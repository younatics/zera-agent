"Cybernetic arms, unicorns, cupcakes and women turning into huge spiders are but a few of Killer Is Dead's quirky delights. But this is no surprise given that it's developed by Goichi Suda, popularly known as Suda51- the outlandish mind behind the acclaimed No More Heroes and Killer7. But to say Killer Is Dead is in the same league would be inaccurate - due to some missteps in the gameplay and graphics departments. Not a sight for sore eyes: There is something impressive about the style, but the colour scheme is way off . You play Mondo, a pencil-thin assassin and womaniser who wakes up to find he has a cybernetic arm (as you do). Mondo and his annoying assistant Mika then join the Bryan Execution Firm - where a lady called Eva sends him on missions to destroy monsters and a muscled man called Bryan smokes cigars. Then there's the gameplay, which plays in a similar way to Devil May Cry. You're encouraged to mix light and heavy attacks, and can use your cybernetic arm to fire different types of ammunition - ranging from bullets to a freeze ray. Sadly, it's incredibly repetitive and extremely easy - and although you can accumulate enough 'blood' to unleash a devastating execution move - the limited repertoire of finishers grates by the end of the game. Mondo's inability to jump, too, is a bizarre decision especially given the multi-layered level design. Visually the game is incredibly inconsistent. The colour pallet really isn't for everyone's tastes - and while environments are varied - ranging from an oversized candy house to the Moon - the colour choice looks deeply unpleasant at times. Fans of Suda51 may find the dialogue amusing, the main vehicle for humour being Mika. But for most, she will soon become incredibly tiresome - an annoyance who's so desperate for attention that it ultimately takes away from what little narrative there is. In-game and texture quality has been sacrificed to keep the framerate smooth - and to its credit,  there's almost no slowdown even during the game's more demanding boss sections. Where Killer Is Dead claws back a points is away from the action. There are inventive mini games where you have to impress women one minute or run over as many enemies with a motorbike as possible the next. There are also moments during the . cinematics that are beautifully directed. A shot where Mondo is running . across the surface of the Moon is particularly memorable. As is an early . scene involving Bryan and a killer you execute. Bland: There are some memorable moments away from the campaign, such as trying to help Mondo woo women, but the bread and butter gameplay isn't as challenging as it should be and soon gets repetitive . Alas, for the most part, Killer Is Dead is forgettable. And although hardcore Suda51 fans may find some solace here, it will be too obscure for many. Killer Is Dead is out on Friday August 30.

"Lions may be the kings of the jungle but this one has come over a little bashful all of a sudden. Covering his eyes with an enormous paw, the lion was either finding the intense African heat in Rwanda too much, or he was feeling camera shy. The retiring lion then settled down to keep . his cub company in the undergrowth as the sun went down, but always kept . an careful eye out for predators or potential dinner. No photos please: This lion covers his face with a giant paw to play hide and seek - or the photographer's attention was proving too much for him . The lion's hide and seek moment was captured . up close by amateur photographer Nelis Wolmarans in Sabyinyo, near the . borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr Wolmarans, who runs a gorilla trekking lodge in Rwanda, said: 'He covered his eyes as if to hide himself. It was a really unique moment.' Seeing a lion, known for their ferociousness, looking vulnerable has captured people's imaginations. 'The reactions to the shy lion picture have been overwhelmingly positive,' he said. Resting with his cub: The lion shares a tender moment in the wilds of Rwanda, Africa . Majestic: Keeping an eye out, the lion's beautiful mane took on a reddish colour in the sunset . Contrary to popular belief, lions spend large parts of their day resting, conserving energy ready to hunt prey. Males like this one can grow up to around six-and-a-half foot in length and weigh between 265 and 420 lbs. This lion was careful to lie down behind his cub, keeping an eye out to protect him from harm. He will also have a responsiblity to protect his whole pride's territory, which can stretch over some 100 square miles. In recent years, Rwanda has had to bring lions and rhinos over from South Africa. Their numbers of lions, as well as other wildlife, had become dangerously low after widespread poaching. The wars of the 1990s had a devastating effect on the wildlife as animals were hunted in ever larger numbers.","Bashful lion plays hide and seek behind his paw in Rwanda .

"This is the shocking moment a former Taiwanese marine kills a burglar after arriving home with his pregnant wife to find the intruder lurking in his bathroom. He Bohai pinned the thief to the floor of the shower cubicle with a military hold after his 'training just took over' to protect his wife and unborn child. He held the burglar in that position until the police arrived. Officers, who took the photograph, found the intruder had fallen unconscious and he was later declared brain dead at hospital. He Bohai was subsequently charged over the death - a decision that has provoked outrage across the country and from his relatives who have praised him for protecting his family. 'My training just took over and I floored him': A former Taiwanese marine pins a burglar to the floor in the shower cubicle after arriving home with his pregnant wife to find the intruder in his bathroom . There has been public outrage after He Bohai was arrested and charged for negligent manslaughter over the death which he claims was an instinctive act of self-defence to protect his wife (top left) He, 29, had been out with his eight-months-pregnant wife Li Sun, 28, when they returned to their home in Beitou District of northern Taiwan's city of Taipei and spotted the thief in the bathroom. He said: 'He came at us and there was no way I was letting him get past me to my wife. My training just took over and I floored him and put him in a military hold. 'Once I had him restrained, I told her to call police and I kept him pinned down. 'I didn't want to kill him but there was no way I was letting him go with my wife and our unborn child to protect.' Police discovered that the man was unconscious by the time they arrived and was declared brain dead at hospital. His family have consented to turn off his life support machine. He and his wife are captured on CCTV shortly before arriving back at their home to find the burglar . After the story was posted online by local media, he was eventually granted a 50,000 Taiwanese dollar (£1,020) bail, but police have said he will still face trial . He was subsequently charged with negligent manslaughter. After the story was posted online by local media, he was eventually granted a 50,000 Taiwanese dollar (£1,020) bail, but police have said he will still face trial. He's father said the whole family supported his son and added that they were proud of him for protecting his family. A police spokesman said: 'A man was killed by another man, it is not up to the police to decide whether he is guilty. He will have to stand trial.' But the former soldier has received massive support across the country after it was revealed the crook had known exactly whose family he was robbing. Video footage shows that he had been to the property several times to check out its potential as a target and then had finally broken in when he saw that the man and his wife were away. But they came back earlier than he expected and the fight took place.","He Bohai pinned intruder to the floor after 'military training just took over'

"Crackdown: Researchers found some supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that it costs less than mineral water . Supermarkets are selling alcohol so cheaply that cans of lager and cider cost less than mineral water. New research shows the price cuts – introduced in time for the World Cup – mean consumers can drink more than their daily recommended alcohol limit for less than £1. It prompted experts to demand a ban on alcohol prices at 'dangerously low levels' because it was fuelling health problems, crime and antisocial behaviour. The findings are also a blow for David . Cameron who two years' ago announced a crackdown on bargain-basket . alcohol prices by saying: 'When beer is cheaper than water, it's just . too easy for people to get drunk on cheap alcohol at home before they . even set foot in the pub.' But . the Prime Minister was forced to water down a new minimum price for . alcohol of 45p a unit in the face of a revolt by most of the Cabinet who . warned it would punish responsible drinkers on low incomes. Instead, the Government outlawed 'very cheap' alcohol – despite admitting it would have little impact on problem drinking. An investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches found three supermarket chains selling lager cheaper than sparkling Perrier water. Tesco . sold multipacks of Fosters, Carlsberg and Carling lager at 69p a pint . and Strongbow cider for 65p a pint. This compared with Perrier mineral . water costing 73p a pint. In Asda, the same beers could be bought for 72p a pint, compared with 76p a pint for Perrier. And at Sainsbury's, 20 cans of Fosters lager was 72p a pint while 15 cans of Strongbow cost £8, equating to 69p a pint, 7p less than a pint of sparkling water. Researchers also found that Tesco and Asda have also been selling two-litre bottles of own-brand cider for £2.25 which means a man could drink his recommended daily alcohol limit for £1 and a woman for 75p. Katherine Brown, director at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: 'The government has completely reneged on its commitment to tackle pocket money-priced alcohol, which is fuelling rates of disease and disorder in the UK.' Public health and crime prevention experts wrote an open letter yesterday SUN calling on the Government to take 'urgent action to curb the damage caused by cheap drink'. The 21 specialists criticised ministers for failing to 'tackle the burden that cheap alcohol places on society'. Asda, along with Tesco and Sainsbury's, were found to be selling alcohol at less than the price of a bottle of Perrier . Recent government figures showed alcohol abuse is costing the country more than £21billion a year through crime, accidents and disease. The experts, including Professor Ian Gilmore, the special advisor on alcohol to the Royal College of Physicians, warned England 'risked being left behind to deal with a growing burden of disease and social disorder' as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland push ahead with plans for minimum unit pricing for alcohol. The Prime Minister had proposed to ban the sale of alcohol at less than 45p a unit in England and Wales. It would have meant a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £1.56, a bottle of wine for less than £4.22 and spirits for £12.60. But the plan was dumped last summer after strong opposition from within the Cabinet and a lobbying campaign by the drinks industry. Ministers insisted it would be disastrous to penalise hardworking families who drank responsibly. Instead, the Home Office announced in February it would ban 'very cheap' booze – effectively the first ever minimum pricing regime. But campaigners dismissed it as 'laughable' when it emerged that supermarkets would still be allowed to sell cans of strong lager for as little as 50p, wine for £2.24 and 750ml spirits for just £10.16. The new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the Treasury, plus VAT. The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said: 'The efforts of retailers working with the government to give clear health information [and] reinforce health messages . . . are having an effect and we are committed to building on these.' Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'There has been no government U-turn on minimum unit pricing. It is still on the radar, but it is sensible to await the legal ruling in Scotland before advancing it further in England. 'Our ban on the sale of alcohol below the cost of duty plus VAT is the first ever government intervention to set a floor for alcohol prices and its significance should not be underestimated. It is after all a minimum price of sorts. It will stop the worst examples of very cheap and harmful drink.'","Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's all sell lager cheaper than Perrier .

"Motorists drawing guns to secure petrol, residents looking through rubbish bags for food and pensioners shivering in sewage-swamped homes. The scenes that smack of Third World misery are the fate of New Yorkers in the wake of superstorm Sandy. Five days after disaster struck America’s Atlantic coast, New York is suffering the sort of social breakdown that followed Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Queues: Hundreds of New Yorkers waiting in line at a Brooklyn bus stop yesterday . Neverending: Thousands of people wait to board city buses into Manhattan in Brooklyn, New York City as limited public transit returns . Shuttled for shuttles: The limited public transport system means all commuters have to resort to buses as no trains run from Brooklyn to Manhattan after tunnels were flooded by the hurricane's storm surge . Anger is building as supplies run short in the densely-populated area. Power is still out for more than 3.8million homes and businesses – causing everything from food stores to petrol distribution centres to close. Families and pensioners have been seen in Manhattan’s East Village and wealthy SoHo sifting through rubbish dumpsters, opening bags of expired food thrown out by supermarkets and shops. Water is also scarce – with the threat of sewage contamination making existing supplies risky. Some residents have taken to filling up bottles and pans from street fire hydrants. In the outer boroughs – particularly . storm-ravaged Staten Island, where 19 have died – and coastal areas of . Brooklyn and Queens, residents say they have been forgotten by officials . who are focusing on Manhattan. ‘We are scavenging for food like animals,’ said Coney Island resident Jeffery Francis. ‘We are in a crisis and no one will help us. Look at us. We are misery. We are Katrina.’ Hunt: People look for salvageable food discarded from a flooded store in Coney Island, New York, as anger mounts over lack of relief supplies . Desperate: With no food supplies and no supermarkets open, residents are forced to pick through bin bags of discarded food . Albert Miller, 58, a fellow resident of the Brooklyn seaside resort where many apartments now smell of sewage and mould, said there was no food anywhere. ‘One person found a sandwich and we split it four ways,’ he said. ‘I’m just happy to be alive. We are praying a lot right now. Praying for help.’ Coney Island is one of the neighbourhoods worst hit by looting. At least 41 people have been arrested across New York for stealing food, alcohol and electronics goods, prompting a dramatic increase in the number of police patrols. Heated: Local residents argue for their place in line while waiting to get fuel at a gas station in Queens . Frayed tempers: Armed police tackle violence at a gas station in Brooklyn, after one customer accused another of cutting in line . Don't bother: A ""no gas"" sign is seen in front of a vehicle that ran out of fuel in front of a gas station in Staten Island . Take a seat: Patient customers, some with their own food and drink, wait their turn . Can you believe it? Cans and even buckets lie waiting to be filled with gas . In Manhattan, muggers have reportedly been snatching Apple iPhones from people who were using them as torches in the unlit streets. ‘There’s just strange people roaming around the buildings in the dark,’ said 75-year-old Irma Batista, who lives in public housing in the East Village. Mile-long queues of cars are forming at petrol stations that have either the power or the petrol to stay open. Tempers have flared and, in Queens, an motorist was arrested for pulling a gun on a driver who had objected to him queue-jumping. Destroyed: Sheila and Dominic Traina hug in front of their Staten Island home which was demolished by Sandy . Salvaging treasures: Members of the Traina family sort through photographs and other personal items that they have managed to find in the rubble that was their home on the south side of Staten Island . A man rinses his hands in flood water while cleaning out a house in a hard-hit neighbor hood in Staten Island yesterday . Sean Bailey, 55, allegedly told his adversary: ‘If you don’t pull back, you’re not getting gas tonight.’ Nearly two thirds of the service stations in New York City and New Jersey, which was also devastated by Sandy, remained shut yesterday. ‘It’s like Mogadishu at the gas stations. If police aren’t there, people are going to get shot, said Dennis Roach, a commercial diver who has been helping with the repairs to New York’s damaged docks. ‘People are literally screaming at each other, pushing and shoving.’ Despite the chaos, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said the city’s marathon will still go ahead tomorrow. The race, which last year drew 47,000 runners and is one of the world’s largest, begins in Staten Island and ends in Central Park. Some runners have promised to head to the start line and spend the day volunteering rather than racing. The mayor has been warned all efforts should go toward relieving the misery of the homeless and hungry.","Living conditions in New York compared to Hurricane Katrina .

"A 44-year-old teacher had sexual relationships with multiple underage students, took them to nude beaches and sex clubs and demanded they have sex with others girls, prosecutors have said. Sean Shaynak, a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School - one of New York City's most selective public schools - was indicted on 36 new counts involving six students on Tuesday. It came after he was charged in August with using Snapchat to send a picture of his genitals to another 16-year-old student at the school, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante. During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. 'Sick': Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly had sex with multiple students at the school where he taught, sent them explicit messages and took them to nude beaches and sex clubs. He has pleaded not guilty . They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported. 'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported. He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said. Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim. During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club. He also had sex with another girl but she put up resistance when the sex went too far - but he forced himself on her anyway, prosecutors said, the Daily News reported. Exclusive: He taught for five years at Brooklyn Technical High School, where Bill de Blasio's son attends school. Shaynak allegedly had relationships with girls ranging in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014 . Shaynak also allegedly sent photos of his genitals to four students, including two minors, and gave the teenagers alcohol and cigarettes. He also gave the girls top grades even though they did no work, the prosecutor said. On Tuesday, Shaynak's lawyer Kimberly Summers pleaded not guilty on his behalf. His bail was set at $1 million. He pleaded not guilty last month to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor and harassment. He was arrested on Tuesday morning on these latest claims. Brooklyn Tech, where Shaynak worked for five years, is based in Fort Greene and is one of the city's most selective public schools. Dante de Blasio attends the school, but students said he was not taught by Shaynak. Shaynak has a nine-year-old daughter. He and his wife are divorced and she lives upstate.","Sean Shaynak was indicted on 36 counts involving six girls on Tuesday .

"A swarm of locusts has crossed the border from Egypt into neighbouring Israel, raising fears that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. A swarm of an estimated 30 million insects had been devastating crops in Egypt putting authorities in Israel on high alert. But a smaller swarm of some one million locusts has now hit Israel. Scroll down for video . Swarm: Locusts cluster on the ground in the Israeli village of Kmehin in the Negev Desert near the Egyptian border . Infestation: Locusts hang on a tree as a swarm arrives in Israel near the Egyptian border . Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . The country's Agriculture Ministry sent out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields on Monday to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline and asked Israelis to report sightings. The insects covered nearly 2,000 acres of desert overnight, officials said. Israel sprayed pesticides from the air and land to try to kill them in the early morning before dew on their wings dried and they could take off again. Miriam Freund, director of plant protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium-sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it advance. 'We hope our actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' Emergency measures: The agriculture Ministry has described the swarm as 'medium-sized' and is currently taking steps to protect crops . Beseiged: An Israeli motorcyclist negotiates the road despite a plague of locusts surrounding him . Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Assessment: Two Israelis stand keep watch of the activity of the swarm close to the border with Egypt . Reports suggest that the insects are mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been reported elsewhere. The locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt. According to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. This year Passover begins on March 25. Pesticide spray: A light plane sprays deterrent on the ground in Israel near the Egyptian border in a bid to clear the swarm before Passover . Climbing trees: The locust swarm is damaging wildlife and authorities fear it could harm the Passover holiday in three weeks . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . Alert: Around 2,000 locusts have been spotted in Israel sparking fears that the country could be plagued by the insects come Passover week later this month . Pest: A locust sits on crops at a farm in the southern Gaza Strip today . Egyptian Agriculture ministers had said that the locusts pass through their country as part of their normal  migration from north east Sudan to Saudi Arabia, emphasising that Egypt was just ‘a transfer station’ for the locusts, which were in larger . numbers this year. As the insects descended on agricultural farms in Giza and in Cairo, causing significant damage, it sparked fears that they could spread to Israel. Those fears have now escalated with the first insects spotted in the country yesterday. On the road: A road in the Negev desert is swamped by locusts as a driver passes through the swarm . A close up shot of the locusts which crossed the border into Israel on Monday . Passover plague: The bugs have fueled apocalyptic fears because of the infestation's proximity to the Bible story of Passover in which a swarm of locusts, the eighth of ten plagues, is imposed on Egyptians by God for enslaving and abusing ancient Hebrews . In a statement from the Food and . Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the infestation was . described as a ‘immature swarm’ which ‘appeared in the afternoon (on . March 2) in the eastern Cairo districts of New Cairo and Mokattam and . dispersed into several smaller swarmlets’. The statement read: ‘The locusts . originated from breeding that has been in progress since November in . southeast Egypt between Berenice and the Sudanese border. Killing crops: As the locusts have descended on agricultural farms in Giza and in Cairo, they have caused significant damage to agriculture . ‘As . vegetation dried out, small groups and swarms of immature adults moved . slowly north along the Red Sea coast, reaching Marsa Alam on 8 February, . Hurghada on the 16th and Zafarana on the 26th.’ As well as Israel, Lebanon and Jordan have been alerted. In Cairo, people had been burning tyres to . create black smoke to deter the locust from settling and there were . reports that swarms had been seen in Zafarana, about 124 miles from . Cairo, on the Red Sea and in the city of Qena, where the insects have . been sighted in at least three villages. According to the Israel National News, . the Egyptian Agriculture Minister Dr Salah Abd Al Mamon said: ‘Egyptian . armed forces and border guards are attempting to fight the swarm with . all means at their disposal. ‘I ask the families living in the locust-plagues areas not to burn tyres. This does not chase away the locusts, but only causes damage and could ignite large scale fires that would cost in lives.’ He said that strong winds were predicted in weather forecasts and he hoped that this would force the insects to migrate toward the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia. Crop duster planes were also going to be used to handle the infestation. Egypt and Israel was infested with . locusts in 2004. Israeli agriculture officials sent crop dusters into the . air to spray against the locusts that swept in from North Africa in the . first such invasion since 1959. The Egyptian Agriculture Ministry said that the locusts pass through the country as part of their normal migration from north east Sudan to Saudi Arabia, reaffirming that Egypt is just 'a transfer station' for the locusts . Farmers in 15 out of the 27 Egyptian governorates suffered significant agricultural damage as the insects devoured crops and flowers. The infestation comes as a study warns that yellow-legged Asian hornets that prey on bees are among the latest non-native species threatening UK wildlife, and even people’s health. A growing number of alien species, from killer shrimps to Spanish slugs, are set to soon reach our shores, a Europe-wide study warns. The Asian hornet, which grows to between 2.5cm and 3cm (1-1.2 inches), preys on native honeybees, wasps and other pollinators, potentially devastating hives and threatening honey and crop production. Battle with the bugs: Residents in Cairo burn tyres to create black smoke to deter the locust settling there as Israel's Agriculture Ministry set up an emergency hotline and urged residents to be vigilant in reporting sightings of the insects . Swarms descending: A swarm of an estimated 30million locust has descended on Egypt (including these insects seen over the Al-Mogattam district of Cairo) as Israel braces for the infestation to head their way . Plague: An illustration of the plague of locusts from a medieval Bible . The locust swarm has crossed into Israel just weeks before the Passover festival, which commemorates the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt. According to the Biblical book of Exodus, a swarm of locusts was inflicted on Egypt as one of ten deadly plagues sent by God to persuade the Pharaoh to release the Hebrews from slavery. The plagues included a plague of frogs, darkness and boils. The swarm of locusts was the eighth plague and began on the first day of the Hebrew month of Shevat. As with previous plagues, the Pharaoh was warned of the impending punishment by Moses. After having suffered enough, Pharaoh's officials begged him to let the Israelites go, but he would still not give in. He proposed a compromise to release the men but keep women, children and livestock. Despite Moses reiterating the warning that every last person had to be released, the Pharaoh refused to give in. The swarm of locusts cast a shadow over Egypt according to the Bible and consumed all the nation's crops. Pharaoh relented and God sent a wind that blew the locusts into the Red Sea. But the Pharaoh changed his mind and two more plagues were sent. The final plague, the death of the firstborn saw God tell Moses to inform all Israelites to put lamb's blood on their doors to spare their firstborn children from death. The Pharaoh was finally convinced to let the Israelites go and Moses led them from Egypt.","A small swarm of 2,000 locusts has been spotted near Jerusalem .

"Good oral hygiene is linked with a reduced risk of gum disease, which has been shown to triple the risk of erectile dysfunction . Men who regularly brush their teeth - thereby reducing their risk of gum disease - are less likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than their less hygienic counterparts. New research has suggested those who suffer from inflamed gums are three times more likely to have trouble getting aroused. The Turkish scientists who led the study compared 80 men aged 30 to 40 with erectile dysfunction with a control group of 82 men without erection problems. This showed that 53 per cent of the men with erectile dysfunction had inflamed gums, compared with 23 per cent in the control group. When the results were adjusted for other factors - such as age, body mass index (BMI), household income and education level - the men with severe periodontal disease were 3.29 times more likely to suffer from erection problems than men with healthy gums. Lead author Doctor Faith Oguz, of Inonu University in Turkey, said: 'Erectile dysfunction is a major public health problem that affects the quality of life of some 150 million men, and their partners, worldwide. 'Physical factors cause nearly two-thirds of cases, mainly because of problems with the blood vessels, with psychological issues like emotional stress and depression accounting for the remainder. 'Chronic periodontitis, or is a group of infectious diseases caused predominantly by bacteria that most commonly occur with inflammation of the gums. 'Many studies have reported that chronic periodontitis may induce vascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, which have been linked with erection problems.' The average age of the men in both groups was just under 36 and there were no significant differences when it came to BMI, household income and education. Their sexual function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function and their gum health using the plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level. The researchers found 53 per cent of the men with erectile dysfunction had inflamed gums, compared with 23 per cent in the control group . Dr Oguz said: 'To our knowledge, erectile dysfunction and chronic periodontitis in humans are caused by similar risk factors, such as ageing, smoking, diabetes and coronary artery disease. 'We therefore excluded men who had systemic disease and who were smokers from this study. 'We particularly selected men aged between 30 and 40 to assess the impact of chronic periodontitis on erectile dysfunction without the results being influenced by the effects of ageing. 'The result of our study support the theory that chronic periodontitis is present more often in patients with erectile dysfunction than those without and should be considered as a factor by clinicians treating men with erection problems.'The study was published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.","Regular brushing reduces the risk of gum disease .

"Manchester United players are being investigated by club bosses over claims they filmed a woman as she performed a sex act on their teammate in a nightclub toilet cubicle, it has been reported. The video taken of the footballer, who has not been named, and the woman, understood to be in her late 20s, is then said to have been shown to other members of the team. Claims over the sordid sex tape are the latest shame for the footballing community - which has been dogged by scandal following the release of rapist Ched Evans from prison last October. The video taken of the footballer, who has not been named, and the woman, understood to be in her 20s, is then said to have been shown to other members of the team. Above, Old Trafford, home of Manchester United . The video was taken by players filming over the top of the toilet cubicle in an exclusive venue in Manchester, a source told the Sun on Sunday. The source said: 'They were in the toilets with the doors closed but other players were filming over the top of the door. It's disgusting behaviour. 'The girl has also been told there was someone filming from underneath.' The woman, who is understood to socialise with the players, is now concerned that the video, thought to have been filmed as a prank, is being passed around the team. She is also worried it may be leaked to a website and damage the reputation of her and the team, the source said. The source added: 'It was a drunken moment and they both got a bit excited'. It comes just a week after rapist footballer Ched Evans made claims he has new evidence he believes will help him overturn his conviction. Claims over the sordid sex tape are the latest shame for the footballing community - which has been dogged by scandal following the release of rapist Ched Evans (pictured with his fiancee) from prison last October . The disgraced striker, 26, maintains he is 'innocent' of attacking his victim in a Rhyl hotel room in 2011 because he believes the sex was consensual. Evans has successfully applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his 2012 conviction re-examined, but sent a new bundle of evidence to them last month. His solicitor has told MailOnline last week that he is confident that the disgraced former Sheffield United striker will be cleared. Evans was released from prison last October after completing half of a five-year jail sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. The Welsh striker denied rape, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.

"Ringleader: Mohammed Zulficar, 33, was jailed for 24 years for his leading role in a plot to distribute crack, cocaine and heroin from a Sheffield flat . A gang of five men were jailed today for their parts in a plot to cut and distribute heroin, cocaine and crack worth a stunning £125million in Yorkshire. Ringleader Mohammed Zulficar, 33, a previously convicted heroin dealer, was sentenced to 24 years after a court heard he had begun the operation while still in prison. His associates Adnan Lal, 27, Mohammed Ishaq, 39, Mohammed Faizan, 26, and Haidar Ali, 25, were jailed for 18 years, 16 years, 12 years and 12 years respectively. Such was the fear they inspired, key witnesses would only testify in the trial after emigrating away from the UK. Sheffield Crown Court heard that the men set up their operation in a rented flat in a leafy suburb of that city, where they cut heroin and cocaine and produced crack cocaine on an industrial scale. When officers raided the property, they found 'leftover' kilos of cocaine and heroin with an estimated street value of about £300,000, as well as cutting agents and equipment to support a drugs preparation factory. Investigations revealed the men had begun working in April 2010 and, over five months, would have produced class A drugs with a street value of a staggering £125million. As he handed down the punitive sentences, with police officers flanking the courtroom for security, Judge Peter Kelson QC called the plot a 'professional operation' that produced drugs on a 'massive scale'. 'This was class A drugs supply on a massive scale and bigger than most cases I have seen come through South Yorkshire,' the judge said. Jailed: The flat was rented by Mohammed Faizan, 26, left, who later told police it had been his 'chill pad' . Adnan Lal, 27, right, was arrested after he turned up at the property as police were searching it . Judge Kelson told the court that ringleader Zulficar started running the operation while serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence for dealing heroin. Zulficar had intentionally chosen people he knew and trusted - but most importantly, did not have criminal records - to be foot soldiers and workers in the operation. The flat was rented by Faizan, who later told police it had been his 'chill pad' - despite there being no evidence of entertainment or essentials in the property. Neighbours told police that within weeks of him moving in they began hearing ‘strange, industrial-type’ noises, and regularly saw several Asian men coming and going. When police raided the property in September 2010, Zulficar was there, and shortly afterwards Lal arrived. Further investigations led police to two more members of the group - Ishaq and Ali. 'Drugs supply on a massive scale':  Further investigations led to Mohammed Ishaq, 39, left, and Haidar Ali, 25, right, who were jailed for 16 years and 12 years respectively at Sheffield Crown Court today . A ‘long and complex’ two-year police investigation followed, and the five men were arrested in April 2012. All were charged with conspiracy to produce and supply Class A drugs. The court even heard that the next door neighbours - who acted as key witnesses in the trial - only felt safe to give evidence once they had emigrated. DC Andrew Shaw, the officer who led the investigation, said: 'This was a sophisticated operation which we were able to stop, thanks to the information from an observant and concerned local resident. 'This is a prime example of the community and the police working together in difficult times. Drugs are a blight on decent communities that can have disastrous effects on lives. 'I would always encourage members of the public to tell us what’s happening in their communities and we will take action wherever possible.'","Five men operated drugs factory in a Sheffield suburb for five months .

In the game: Cover star Gareth Bale gets a shot off against Real Madrid's rivals Barcelona . Overall . presentation remains strong.

No . matter, as for those who can stand waiting a month or two for the . next-gen version of the game, the next-gen Ignite Engine allows for even . more realistic animation and AI. The . most significant tweak to gameplay is the Precision Movement mechanic – . that is easier to use than ever before. Given improved ball physics, . combining close control with dribbling at speed makes you feel much more . in control of attacking plays. AI, too, is with you every step of the . way.

"Should Van Gaal keep the Class of '92 at United? Should Van Gaal keep the Class of '92 at United? Now share your opinion . Wayne Rooney was at the centre of an injury mystery on Thursday after he left Manchester United’s training session early and was immediately sent for scans. Sources close to the player claim that Rooney has been suffering from a stomach complaint but Sportsmail understands it could be more serious, and that explains why the club’s medical staff are so anxious to investigate further. United will assess the 28-year-old’s condition on Friday before deciding if he can face Sunderland at home this weekend. Trouble: Manchester United striker is going for a scan after limping out of training on Thursday . The New Era: Rooney scored twice in the 4-0 win against Norwich at the weekend - Ryan Giggs' first game . Popping for a trim: Rooney was photographed outside a barbershop on Wednesday afternoon . Home comforts: The England striker was spotted in Liverpool, but could be out of the game against Sunderland . However, with little left to play for in their remaining three games of the season under interim boss Ryan Giggs, they are unlikely to risk Rooney if there is any doubt about his fitness. The England striker will also be reluctant to take any chances with the World Cup looming next month after going into the last two tournaments under an injury cloud. In 2006, Rooney arrived late in Germany after rushing to recover from the broken metatarsal he suffered in a Premier League defeat at Chelsea in April of that year. However, he struggled for match fitness and had a disappointing tournament, culminating in his sending-off in the quarter-final defeat to Portugal. The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was equally difficult for Rooney after he damaged the ligaments in his right ankle in Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich in late March having scored his 34th goal of the season at the Allianz Arena. He made it back to play in England’s three group games and the defeat to Germany that sent Fabio Capello’s side home early, but did not find the net again for club or country that season. There were fears that lightning might have struck twice after Rooney suffered a chipped bone in his foot when United met Bayern in another Champions League quarter-final first leg a month ago, but he was able to play in the return game in Germany with the help of a painkilling injection and it is not believed to have troubled him since. Now Roy Hodgson will be hoping that the latest scare is nothing more than a precaution with United anxious not to take any unnecessary risks.","Wayne Rooney left Man United's training session early on Thursday and was immediately sent for scans .

"Ryse has divided opinion. In one corner, gamers were astounded by its undeniable beauty. In the other, the short, button-mashing playable demo at this year's E3 left many thinking Ryse was a case of all style but no substance. You play Marius Titus, a young Roman soldier whose family is murdered by barbarian bandits. Fuelled by revenge, Titus enlists in the Roman army, travelling to Britannia and rising through the ranks to become leader of one of the deadliest military forces in history. Photorealistic? Thanks to CryEngine 3, the powerhouse that fuelled Crysis 3, facial detail across the board is truly next-gen . Powered by the CryEngine 3, gameplay revolves around third-person hacking and slashing. Hammering different buttons unleashes unique combos, while certain moves trigger Quick Time events for brutal finishing attacks. It's a tried and tested formula but the level of detail in the brutality is something current-gen consoles have never been able to capture. Using advanced Vertex animation, you'll see the anger in your foes eyes as they charge at you. Their determination as they swing a sword frantically at your head. And their fear when they stare at your sword hurtling towards their mid-section. What's perhaps even more impressive is that this attention to detail isn't lost on a larger scale. Every soldier on the screen is painstakingly animated - not just floating vaguely in the background. Add to the mix Crytek's Virtual Camera hardware that manipulates lighting, the environment and other effects in real-time, and you've got an incredibly life-like interpretation of battles in that period. Perhaps less realistic are Titus's movements during combat. There's a clever multi-directional attack function - allowing you to take on more than one enemy, but Titus 'glides' around like he's on an ice rink. Hit detection, too, needed some work. Rome, sweet Rome: Although the demo focused sly on action, gamers can expect an enthralling story . Ryse is also Kinect and SmartGlass compatible. Through Kinect, you can command your troops in real time via voice recognition technology, while SmartGlass lets you launch the game where you left off. As well as upgrading your character, the in-game DVR lets players review and share the best experiences from their game directly from their tablet, while context-sensitive achievements and guides help you unlock as many secrets as possible. Anyone who played the Last of Us demo will know just how far away that is from the full game. It was so much more than simply killing zombies. Xbox fans will hope the same applies to Ryse.

"There’s no escaping the fact that F1 2013 isn’t a complete engine overhaul – rather, a fine-tuned update. Perhaps the most noticeable tweak, though, is just how more accessible Codemasters have made it compared to its intimidatingly time-consuming rival. On track: there's plenty here for both hardcore fans of the sport and more causal gamers to enjoy . For starters, there’s the Season Challenge mode – offering a compressed season that can be completed in just a few hours. Or the pick-up and play Scenario mode that pits your wits against 20 racing challenges. Whereas its predecessor focused on its Career experience (which also returns in full force), it often involved dedicating a large period of time to play through it – scaring away some more casual gamers. F1 2013 suffers from no such issue, given the amount of short, fast-paced thrills on offer. And with superb graphics, commentary from Sky Sports' David Croft and Anthony Davidson and handling that’s affected by both the finest set-up tweaks and changes in weather, there is plenty here for hardcore fans to enjoy, too. Hard to master: handling is the toughest thing about F1 2013 - and will take some time to get right . A note about the handling, though. Although last year's edition went some way to allow for driver error, it will still take a lot of practise to ensure you don't finish races with a 30 second penalty. The mind-numbing Young Driver's Test goes some way to teach you the basics, and the rewind feature makes a return - but the latter still feels slightly out of place in a game that prides itself on delivering unparalleled authenticity. Away from contemporary F1, and there is the F1 Classics mode - where you race some of the world's best-known drivers of yesteryear around iconic circuits. The absence of KERS and DRS means driver skill and flair becomes more important than ever - and the cars feel noticeably more raw than today's tamed beasts. Coupled with commentary from Murray Walker, and an optional retro TV filter and it makes for an incredibly authentic, high-speed journey back to the golden age of motorsport. Authentic: every little detail of the cars have been painstakingly captured . Sadly, there are only a limited number of tracks that come with the standard edition of the game. For more classic cars, drivers and tracks you'll have to buy the Classics Edition or download it. Aesthetic changes may be minimal - as expected in a yearly update - but overall presentation, much like the latest FIFA incarnate, has improved - most noticeably in the soundtrack. Multiplayer is catered for via split screen, system link or online while Co-op Championship lets you take on an entire season with a friend. Brake point: the Young Driver's Test goes some way to help but there's no substitute for racing experience . With next-gen consoles around the corner, it’s only a matter of time before F1 games have the engine rebuild so many fans are waiting for. But for now, F1 2013 is more than enough… .

"Overnight, it has become a tourist sensation. And since it’s attached to the most popular ticketed visitor attraction in Britain, the crowds are just going to keep on getting bigger — as, indeed, is this stupendous piece of art. For Paul Cummins, the acclaimed ceramic artist, has barely completed 15 per cent of his poppy invasion of the Tower of London. Ahead of yesterday’s royal opening of the project, he had installed 120,000 hand-made flowers. These are stunning enough as it is, filling one side of the Tower’s mighty moat with cascading ripples of red. Scroll down for video . Stupendous: The tribute at the Tower of London, with each poppy representing a British or Colonial serviceman who died in World War I . Royal visit: The Duchess of Cambridge places a ceramic poppy, watched by her husband Prince William, and Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London . Overwhelmed: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and General Lord Dannatt pause to take in the sheer scale of the display . Work of wonder: Every poppy head was hand made, baked and glazed before the 2ft long stems were welded to them . Come November 11, Armistice Day, there will be no less than 888,246 of them. That is one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers, sailors and airmen who perished in the Great War. By then, all four sides of William the Conqueror’s great fortress will be surrounded by a sea of scarlet (raising millions for charity in the process). By then, too, the capital will have grown rather attached to a powerful little event which began yesterday and will take place every nightfall between now and Armistice Day. As dusk falls, the names of 180 war dead — each one nominated by families and members of the public — will be read out. A different speaker will be invited each night, standing amid the poppies on the same grassy mound where new City of London recruits were sworn in during the war. Video courtesy of Historic Royal Palaces . Poppy appeal: Artist Paul Cummins planned the project for 888,246 ceramic flowers to be planted at the Tower of London and all will be sold to raise millions for charity . Precision: Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns and are paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals . Hand crafted: This is one of the 35 artists who hand made the beautiful poppies now being planted at the Tower . Process: The leaves of the poppy were cut from clay using a stamp and later the red glaze was added and baked on in a kiln . Last night it was the actor Tim Pigott-Smith. With echoes of the nightly bugle call . at the Menin Gate in Flanders — a profoundly moving ritual which draws . ever-larger crowds — the scheme has already been inundated with online . nominations. Once informed that an ancestor will be on the list on a given evening, entire families are expected to attend. ‘Our biggest challenge is the sheer scale of the thing,’ says the Tower’s head of operations and Deputy Governor, John Brown. A former Colonel in the Royal Logistic . Corps, he is used to big projects (he handled the military logistics . for the last royal wedding). This idea represents a fusion of two notable British talents: creative flair and military planning. Each week between now and November, . 55,000 of these poppies must be manufactured before being assembled and planted by an army of . volunteers. Cummins was supported by trainee ceramicists from Johnson Tiles in Tunstall using clay provided by Potclays, also on Stoke-on-Trent. Video courtesy of Historic Royal Palaces . Powerful: The Tower was turned blood red and the shadows of men walking to war were shown in a moving ceremony . Grand opening: Tim Pigott-Smith at the unveiling of the  Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red artwork by Paul Cummins where images were beamed onto the Tower of London yesterday evening . Solo: A lone trumpeter plays under a spotlight at dusk surrounded by the ceramic poppies in a moving ceremony on the Thames yesterday . Col Brown has been astonished by the numbers queuing to help. Some 8,000 volunteers have signed up, . including a group of Americans living in Richmond-upon-Thames and a lady . who flew from Edinburgh to take part. Since the project is in the Tower’s . public precincts and free of charge — with free on-site wi-fi to explain . it all — the crowds have already caught on. Yesterday, I found plenty of City . suits among the T-shirt-and-shorts brigade lining the walkways . overlooking the site as it was opened by the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge and Prince Harry, accompanied by General Lord Dannatt, former . head of the Army and now Constable of the Tower of London. At the Tower’s north-west corner, a . great shower of poppies pours forth from a window in Legge’s Mount, a . bastion named after the founder of the Royal Fusiliers. It’s actually a Yeoman Warder’s kitchen window (a distinguished old soldier, he is, by all accounts, thrilled to be involved). Royal approval: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince unveiled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red in London, telling the artist they thought it was incredible . Production line: After being cut out circular . petals are placed on top of eachother before they are crimped together . by hand at Mr Cummins' Derby workshop . Things . of beauty: The ceramic flowers will be at the Tower of London for . several more months before being sent to the homes of those who have . bought them for £25 . Process: The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position. The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing . Installations: . The parts designed to swoop through windows, over walls and along the . ground were created in Plymouth before being brought to London . At the south-west corner, a great wave . of poppies is surging over the causeway through which three million . tourists enter the Tower each year. The broad layout of the poppies has all been planned by theatrical designer Tom Piper of the Royal Shakespeare Company. ‘As a military man, I obviously have . the temptation to make it all look very neat and tidy but that would . look like a cemetery,’ says Col Brown. ‘The whole idea is to let it flow. This is a dynamic thing which will grow and grow and then, suddenly, go away.’ For this is not a garden of . remembrance. Rather, it is a piece of art to encourage reflection rather . than solemnity — and to raise funds for a broad range of Forces’ charities. Members of the public can buy one of . these poppies — each the size of a grapefruit, hand-sculpted and fixed . to a 2ft metal stalk — for £25. After November 11, each one will be removed from the moat, washed and sent to its owner with a certificate. Months . of work: The poppies are still being planted across the Tower and the . full display will not be completed until Armistice Day this year . Work of art: Each poppy takes three days of work to complete and the 888,000 needed are not yet finished . Design: As well as using ceramic poppies, its creators used the Tower of London and its grounds to form part of the artwork . Determined to contribute something to the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War, Paul Cummins only put his idea to the Tower’s custodians, Historic Royal Palaces, last October. The trustees then created a community investment company to handle poppy sales. Production costs, which include two firings of every clay poppy petal, are not cheap (and could touch £8 million). But 10 per cent of every poppy sold . goes straight to charities including Help for Heroes, the Royal British . Legion and Coming Home. And once all the costs are covered, . the entire surplus will be distributed. With a potential income of £22.2 . million, it could be a very substantial sum. This is a remarkable and highly . original addition to Britain’s commemorative landscape. It is also a . temporary one. Catch it while you can. Charities you will support: Confederation of Service Charities, Combat Stress, Coming Home, the Royal British Legion, SSAFA (Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association) and Help for Heroes.","Ceramic poppies representing every soldier from Britain and Empire killed will be planted by November 11 .

"The fast-moving river of air that controls weather over Northern Europe and North America is undergoing a dramatic shift that could lead to harsher winters. Scientists believe the jet stream which girdles Earth is increasingly taken a longer, meandering path causing weather patterns to become ‘stuck’. This could result in longer and harsher winters over North America and northern Europe, according to researchers in Chicago. The Northern Hemisphere's jet stream is a fast-moving belt of westerly winds that traverses the lower layers of the atmosphere. Experts believe it is taking a meandering path causing weather patterns to get 'stuck' The jet stream is a ribbon of high altitude, high-speed wind in northern latitudes that blows from west to east. It is formed when the cold Arctic air clashes with warmer air from further south. The greater the difference in temperature, the faster the jet stream moves. According to Jennifer Francis, a climate expert at Rutgers University, the Arctic air has warmed in recent years as a result of melting polar ice caps. This means there is now less of a difference in temperatures when it hits air from lower latitudes. This image shows a storm passing over Britain on the jet stream last week. The jet stream is formed when the cold Arctic air clashes with warmer air from further south. The greater the difference in temperature, the faster the jet stream moves . One of the Met Office’s senior experts claims there is no link between global warming and the storms that have battered U.S. and the UK. Mat Collins, a professor in climate systems at Exeter University, said the storms have been driven by the jet stream  which has been ‘stuck’ further south than usual. Professor Collins said: ‘There is no evidence that global warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this winter. If this is due to climate change, it is outside our knowledge.’ Professor Collins is also a senior adviser for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). His statement appears to contradict Met Office chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo. Last weekend, she said ‘all  the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to  play’ in the storms. Professor Collins made clear that he believes it is likely global warming could lead to higher rainfall totals, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. But he said this has nothing to do with the storm conveyor belt. ‘The jet stream is a very fast moving river of air over our head,’ she said on Saturday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ‘But over the past two decades the jet stream has weakened. This is something we can measure,’ she said. As a result, instead of circling the Earth in the far north, the jet stream has begun to meander, like a river heading off course. This has brought chilly Arctic weather further south than normal and warmer temperatures north. Perhaps most disturbingly, it remains in place for longer periods of time. The U.S. is currently enduring an especially bitter winter, with the midwestern and southern states experiencing unusually low temperatures. In contrast, far northern regions like Alaska are going through an unusually warm winter this year. This suggests ‘that weather patterns are changing,’ Professor Francis said. ‘We can expect more of the same and we can expect it to happen more frequently.’ Temperatures in the Arctic have been rising ‘two to three times faster than the rest of the planet,’ said James Overland, a weather expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This photograph shows waves crashing into Southsea in Hampshire on Friday night. Scientists believe changes to the jet stream could create permanent harsher winters . Professor Francis added that it is premature to blame humans for these changes. ‘Our data to look at this effect is very short and so it is hard to get very clear signal,’ she said. ‘But as we have more data I do think we will start to see the influence of climate change.’ The meandering jet steam phenomenon, sometimes called ‘Santa's Revenge’, remains a controversial idea. ‘There is evidence for and against it,’ said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snowland Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. But he said rising Arctic temperatures are directly linked to melting ice caps. ‘The sea ice cover acts as a lid which separates the ocean from a colder atmosphere,’ Mr Serreze told the conference. But if the lid is removed, then warmth contained in the water rises into the atmosphere. This warming trend and the shifting jet stream will have a dire impact on agriculture, especially in the farm-rich middle-latitudes in the U.S.. ‘We are going to see changes in patterns of precipitation, of temperatures that might be linked to what is going on in the far north,’ said Mr Serreze. The main impact on agriculture and livestock will not come from small temperature changes, but rather from temperature extremes and the weather patterns that hold them in place for longer periods of time.","The jet stream controls weather over Northern Europe and North America .

"How would you survive the apocalypse? Stick to conventional weapons? Conserve supplies? Or use light and noise to distract zombies so you can sneak by undetected? In Dead Rising 3, how you stay alive is entirely up to you. But this would not be a true Dead Rising game without the franchise’s delightful zeal for the absurd. Crash and burn: How you escape the city is left entirely up to you... and you can be as crazy as you want . You can don a full set of knight armor and build a laser sword, put on a luchador mask and pile drive zombies, or strip down to a banana hammock while wielding a fireman’s axe. Hours can be spent building insane weapons out of random parts, such as a teddy bear with machine guns strapped to its arms, or joy ride in race cars while plowing through crowds of zombies. Set ten years after the events of Fortune City in Dead Rising 2, you play a mechanic named Nick Ramos trying to escape the fictional city of Los Perdidos, California before a military strike reduces everything to dust. But what it lacks in an original plot, it makes up in other areas. Take the SmartGlass integration, that allows you to set navigation waypoints guiding you and your co-op partner around the city, locate weapon caches, and call in deadly military airstrikes. Or, when Nick discovers a transmitter, an in-game character will call and text your real-life mobile device with advice and hints.

"A grandmother was knifed to death for £104 of her pension money so her killer could spend it on a night out with friends, a court heard yesterday. Doreen Walker, 75, was throttled, beaten, slashed and stabbed more than 40 times in a frenzied attack in her home. The court was told that Liam Naylor, 23, lavished the money on his friends – including the victim’s estranged granddaughter – as Mrs Walker lay dead in her living room. Liam Naylor (left), 23, is accused of murdering Doreen Walker, 75, (right) after stabbing her in her home . Naylor, who was on benefits of £82 a week, treated the group to drinks in a bar, a McDonald’s takeaway and a taxi home, the court heard. Prosecutor Simon Waley said Mrs Walker had collected her pension on the morning of the murder, and had told the cashier she had fallen out with granddaughter Keeley Sweeney, 17. Later that day, the court heard, Naylor texted another woman, his ex-girlfriend, to say he was ‘trying to find some money for town tonight’. Sheffield Crown Court heard he was captured on CCTV entering Mrs Walker’s home at 9.30pm, and emerged just under two hours later. Mr Waley said Mrs Walker, who had three children and five grandchildren, had more than 40 ‘sharp force injuries’ to her head, face, neck, arms and chest, one of which had penetrated her heart. It is also alleged that Naylor smashed Mrs Walker’s nose and twisted her right arm until it broke, then rifled through her jewellery box upstairs before returning to attack her again at the house in Barnsley. Naylor was captured on CCTV entering the woman's home about 9.30pm and emerged two hours later . Police arrested Naylor after Mrs Walker's body was found in her home the following morning by her son-in-law . Naylor had also cut his own hand during the attack, the court heard, and police later found his blood on the knife and a back door handle. The jury heard Naylor lived with Miss Sweeney and another woman, Brooklyn Smith. Miss Sweeney had lived on-and-off with Mrs Walker for two years, and ‘close friend’ Naylor regularly accompanied her on visits or even sleepovers at her grandmother’s, the jury heard. The court was told that when Naylor arrived home after the attack, Miss Sweeney, Miss Smith and his friend Matthew Potter were waiting to go out with him. Mr Potter noticed Naylor had ‘quite a lot of blood’ on his jeans and he was ‘agitated and shaking’, Mr Waley said. Naylor denies murdering the pensioner. The trial at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) continues . When Mr Potter asked Naylor where the blood had come from, he claimed he had ended up in a fight after a man armed with a knife attacked him. On the way into Barnsley town centre, Naylor and Miss Sweeney set fire to his blood-stained clothes, the court heard. Naylor paid for the night out and all four returned home at 1.40am. Mrs Walker’s body was discovered the next day by her son-in-law Llewellyn Jones. Last month Naylor admitted going to Mrs Walker’s home on the night of the attack, saying he intended to steal and had been encouraged to do so by Miss Sweeney. He claimed Mrs Walker had suspicions about his intentions and came at him with a knife, a turn of events branded ‘ludicrous and utterly incredible’ by the prosecutor. Naylor, of Barnsley, denies murder. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Doreen Walker was throttled, beaten and stabbed more than 40 times .

"Hundreds of Libyans invited to the UK for military training are being sent home amid claims of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft. The cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills to help their war-torn country. Instead they have been allowed to run amok outside their Cambridgeshire barracks, terrifying their neighbours. British troops have been drafted in to restore order. On their way home: 300 Libyan troops training at  Bassingbourn Barracks in Cambridgeshire (pictured) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks . Worse still, Libya has failed to pay the bill for the programme. Since the training course – which is backed by David Cameron – began in June: . Ali Zidan, Libya’s former prime minister, paid £2.5million to the UK government but has claimed further payments were being blocked by Libya’s Islamist-led congress. In April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Zidan’s successor, Abdullah al-Thinni, urging him to make the payments. Upset: Local MP Andrew Lansley has said that the MoD has no other option but to ban any more visits . The Prime Minister pledged the UK’s continuing support but added: ‘I understand that you have been working personally to take forward the General Purpose Force Programme and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the UK in May. ‘I hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment, given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security.’ The call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week. Units of the 2 Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, were sent in to Bassingbourn Barracks, near Royston, after their leave was cancelled. Last night, the Ministry of Defence announced the 24-week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home. The future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals. Andrew Lansley, a former Tory health secretary who had initially supported the scheme, said: ‘As this stands, no further groups of trainees could be brought here from Libya.’ He said the MoD must be held accountable for ‘a serious failure’. Mr Lansley said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘were not accepting the discipline and weren’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force’. ‘They were looking to take whatever advantage they could,’ he added. ‘It has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the MoD to try and shore it up and give protection. It is all very disappointing. We wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in Libya. I am unhappy.’ The demand for answers came after Cambridge magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘like a pack’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night. Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to Cambridge where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness. The city’s magistrates were told how they touched them sexually and attempted to put their hands up their skirts. Abdalsalam admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of threatening behaviour towards a police office and one count of theft. El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft. A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, who was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft, refused to enter pleas at the hearing. They will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date. Cases: Five Libyan men have appeared in court in the past week over alleged sex attacks in Cambridge . In another incident, Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abogutila, 22, have been charged with the rape of a man in a Cambridge park. An estimated £2.5million was spent refurbishing Bassingbourn to host the series of courses conducted by members of 3 Scots, the Black Watch. Peter Robinson, who chairs the parish council, said: ‘I thought Muslims didn’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop. That’s their favourite trip – going to the Spar and then stealing bicycles.’ Downing Street confirmed that the Libyan soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the UK before they are kicked out. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Asylum rules apply to everyone. It will be the existing asylum rules that apply.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","300 Libyan soldiers based in thee UK are to be sent home a month early .

"The former Chief of the Australian Army, professor Peter Leahy, has warned that Australia needs to prepare itself for a century-long war, both overseas and at home, against radical Islamic militants. Currently the director of the National Security Institute at the University of Canberra, professor Leahy told Daily Mail Australia that as a liberal, secular society, Australia is perceived as 'the far enemy' by radical Islamic groups and individuals, and would no doubt continue to be targeted. 'We are already affected in that there are places that would be wise for us not to travel to and there have been terrorist bombings in places that we do travel to, as we can see from 9/11 and both of the Bali bombings,' Mr Leahy said. Scroll down for video . Former Chief of the Australian Army, professor Peter Leahy, has warned that Australia needs to prepare itself for a century-long war, both overseas and at home, against radical Islamic militants . 'We've even had bomb plots here in Australia and thanks to police and intelligence agencies, have been able to stop those threats. 'But terrorists only have to be lucky once.' Mr Leahy told The Weekend Australian that the war against radical Islam was likely to last for nearly 100 years. 'Australia is involved in the early stages of a war which is likely to last for the rest of the century,' he said. 'We must be ready to protect ourselves and, where necessary, act pre-emptively to neutralise the evident threat. Get ready for a long war.' He also noted the significant increase in brainwashing content online from radicals looking to recruit Australians to their cause and the effect this information has on national security. 'One example is a radical online magazine called Inspire, which encourages people to make attacks,' Mr Leahy said. 'One recent issue had a photo of the Sydney Opera House on the front cover.' He continued: 'Plots have been thwarted at the Holsworthy army base for instance, and other iconic locations. 'I don't see big armies coming here, but I mean these people who have been radicalised, they’re getting ideas off the internet and these ideas are pouring into our lounge rooms. He said Australia needs to defend itself against individuals who are being brainwashed by radical information online, travel overseas to fight and then 'return home radicalized and decentralized and looking to continue the fight' 'There are certain elements of jihad groups who see the West as a target, and there are people living in Australia who have these ideas and some have gone overseas to fight, who will return home radicalised and decentralised and looking to continue the fight.' His warnings come only a day after ASIO chief David Irvine addressed the media to explain the necessity of the mandatory data retention plans that were recently approved by the Cabinet. 'The terrorist threat is suddenly starting to impact on Australian citizens and on the security of Australian citizens to a greater degree than it has in the past,' Mr Irvine told media. On Wednesday, Mr Abbott also revealed the government was increasing the authority of national counter-terror agencies as well as granting them $630 million in funding to assist in the fight against home-grown terrorism. The warnings come after ASIO chief David Irvine argued the necessity of  mandatory data retention and Mr Abbott revealed the $630 million in funding being granted to national counter-terror agencies . Mr Leahy voiced his support for the new policies, saying the restriction of civil liberties was an unfortunate necessity for national security. He also suggested that Australia had to 'protect itself' by 'making it difficult for certain individuals to come to Australia.' 'I think the most import thing is to identify that the threat is not the individual terror group but the radical ideology that they're following,' Mr Leahy said. 'We need to counter that. That's a job for moderate Islamist nations and leaders in Muslim communities to say ""these radical ideas are wrong and we should be following the rules of the nation we live in"". Mr Leahy said the conflicts derive from a century old 'battle of ideas' of how we should live in society, with radical Islamic societies believing that there should be no difference between politics and religion . 'We also have to support the Muslim community in Australia and the de-radicalisation of these ideas.' He suggested that Australia should follow in the footstep of the US and become involved internationally in the internal struggles, highlighting a key point made by Mr Obama in a speech before launching an air-raid on Iraq. 'As we look out from Australia, we can see chaos and unprecedented savagery in some of these lands, particularly in the ISIS groups in Iraq and Syria,' Mr Leahy said. 'How long can we sit back and watch this before we decide out of morality that we have to do something about this?'","Peter Leahy claims Australia is one of many Western countries perceived as 'the far enemy' by radical Islamic militants .

"A 'heavily intoxicated' Bristol Palin screamed 'who the f**k are you?' at the male host of the South Anchorage party her family gate-crashed last month before punching him at least six times in the face, according to the police report released today. Witnesses to the booze-soaked brawl involving nearly every member of Sarah Palin's family told police that Bristol, 23, was 'out of control' and accused her of striking Korey Klingenmeyer repeatedly before he pushed her to the ground in defense, sparking the 20-person fight. According to police who responded to the chaotic scene, Bristol claimed that Klingenmeyer was calling her a 'c**t and s**t' and that after he pushed her over someone began dragging her 'around on the grass by her feet'. However, Klingenmeyer told police that when they arrived he was furious 'the Palins had showed up and were causing the problems' and added for good measure, 'a fight broke out and the Palins ended up losing.' Scroll Down for Video . Family fun: Todd Palin, 50, with son Trig, six, Sarah, 50, Bristol, 23, with her son Tripp, six, Willow, 20 and Track, 26, with his daughter Kyla Grace, three . The police report paints a confusing picture of the huge fight, with each version of events from those involved differing wildly, no doubt impaired by alcohol. Indeed, it is not clear from any of the witnesses who started the fight and the report essentially boils down into a he-said, she-said situation. However, while blame may not be clear, the police report which dates from the night of father Todd Palin's 50th birthday celebration on September 6, lists Bristol Palin as a suspect, her brother Track, 26, as a victim and Sarah Palin and her husband as witnesses. It also lists Willow Palin, 20, as a 'person interviewed.' The Palins had been celebrating Todd's birthday at a do in their home town of Wasilla and had decided to go to their friend Klingenmeyer's house afterwards as he was also having a party. Klingenmeyer, who has decided not to press charges in connection with the alcohol-inspired melee, claims that a fight started out front of his house and that Bristol came out the back where he was and began punching him repeatedly after crossed words. When he stopped her punching him again, pushing her to the floor - her brother and father ran over and began fighting, sparking a brawl involving at least four men. Bristol Palin claims that the fight began when an 'older woman' allegedly pushed her little sister Willow and that Klingenmeyer became involved, calling her a 'sl**', pushing her to the ground and that the brawl erupted from there. Willow Palin told police that during the huge fight, many people were shouting 'f*** the Palins'. Klingenmeyer, who police described as only 'moderately intoxicated' said that he initially wanted to file charges against Palin. He said that he was told a fight had broken out in the front of his house in the cul de sac and that he had told everyone at the party in his house not to get involved. He claims he stayed at the back of his property and waited there but Bristol Palin and her sister Willow came round. Klingenmeyer then says that Bristol told him she was going to 'knock that b***h out' at which point he claims he says he told her he wouldn't stand for that language and advised her to go home. Infuriated by this she asked him 'Who the f**k are you?', to which he replied he was the owner of the house and that he wanted no fighting. The police report states that Bristol then told him that he was lying, this was not his house and that she was going to 'kick his ass'. Klingenmeyer then told police that Sarah Palin's eldest daughter punched him in the face, to which he replied, 'hit me again if that makes you feel better.' At which point Bristol Palin did. Allegations: Host Korey Klingenmeyer (above) was allegedly punched in the face up to eight times by Bristol when he asked her to leave the party . Husband Todd Palin - who was celebrating his fiftieth that night although it was not his party- became involved . The host alleges that Palin punched him in total up to eight times  in the face and that 'she was hitting pretty hard.' Klingenmeyer then told police that on the sixth punch thrown he put out his hand to stop Palin and pushed her back, at which point she fell over. She got up, he claimed and tried to throw another punch and he pushed her away using her fist again. 'At this time three or four guys come up the driveway and one was yelling that they were going to beat his ass for beating his sister.' For her part, Bristol Palin told police that while they were at the birthday party, an older lady, believed to be the mother of Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, pushed Sarah Palin's youngest daughter. Bristol responded strongly to this and claims that Klingenmeyer approached her while she was tackling the older woman and pushed her to the ground, calling her 's**t' over and over. She then claims that she was dragged around on the grass by her feet after being pushed over and that someone stole her shoes and sunglasses. One witness told police that after Todd weighed in to combat Klingemeyer he was jumped on by four people and that Track ran in to help his father. Todd, who arrived with his family to Klingenmeyer's home just after 10pm, emerged from the scrum with a torn shirt and a bloody lip according to the police report. Indeed, when police arrived at the Anchorage home around midnight they saw Track walking towards his mother's limo, shirtless and one officer noted that Track's friends seemed, 'intent on keeping him away from me.'. The police report describes Track as appearing 'heavily intoxicated' and that he had blood on his hands and around his mouth. He also seemed to have been hit under his left eye and was 'belligerent' when officers first approached him. He only agreed to speak to officers when his mother made him exit her limo and give officers his version of events. Track was 'angry and intoxicated' and told police that 'some guys were talking rudely to his sisters, making them cry.' The report states that as they tried to leave the party, a friend of his was sucker punched and knocked to the ground. 'Track said he then confronted one of the guys and said he would fight him, so Track took off his shirt to fight,' wrote one officer. However, at this point, Track claims he was attacked from behind by four 'skinny white males'. Todd Palin told police that when this happened, 'everything escalated and it was a situation they couldn't walk away from.' Another witness, Matthew McKenna, told the police that 'about four unknown guys then jumped on Todd,' and that Track 'jumped in and was fighting with the people that jumped his dad.' And as if to compound the confusion from the police report, another witness, Brian Horschel told police that during the brawl, Track tried to 'start a fight with his dad'. McKenna said that he felt 'the problem was that Bristol and Willow were drunk as were their boyfriends.' And he said that after Bristol punched Klingenmeyer, 'a bunch of wives tackled her ass'. The police report makes it clear that Sarah Palin was not involved in the physical fighting and was waiting inside the family's white limousine during the altercation, helping to calm everything down afterwards. She did not give a statement to the police on the fight. The former vice-presidential candidate has not commented publicly on the episode, but RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family last month, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. The source said oldest son Track, 26, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him' after his sister was knocked to the ground by Klingenmeyer. That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th that night, although it was not his party- became involved. Sister sister: Willow (left) and Bristol Palin (right) were involved in the brawl. Willow was described by police as 'heavily agitated' after the fight and Bristol as 'heavily intoxicated' Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, ""You know who we are, don’t you?"" But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!' Her son Track served with the U.S. Army service in the Iraq War. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.' But the source said that Bristol is left-handed. One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend. The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. Scene of the crime: The home of Klingenmeyer in Anchorage, Alaska . 'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence. 'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. 'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.' Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office.","Brawl took place in September in South Anchorage, Alaska according to police report .

"First, a health warning: anyone eating breakfast should skip to the sports section. In January of this year a group of doctors in Amsterdam published a study using 'friendly bacteria' in the most extreme way possible. They were treating a group of patients with an infection caused by a bacterium called Clostridium difficile (C.diff) - which grows when your normal bowel bacteria are wiped out by antibiotics. It can cause severe diarrhoea and even death. Ironically the treatment of C.diff infections is usually another strong course of antibiotics, but instead the Dutch group used the ultimate probiotic: a faecal transplantation. The power of porridge: Dr Christoffer van Tulleken ate oats every day for six weeks to assess the impact on his gut bacteria . That's right: they took donor faeces from healthy volunteers (screened for every imaginable disease) and infused it via a tube into the patients' small intestines. The treatment was so effective that the trial was stopped early. It was a small trial, and not without flaws, but it should prompt research in an area of medicine where we are only just beginning to understand our ignorance: the bacteria living inside us. You are more bacteria than you are human: for every one of your cells, you have at least ten bacteria and most of them live in your gut. For every one of your human genes, you have 200 bacterial genes. These bacteria living inside you are called your microbiome and they're not parasites; without them you would die. We have outsourced some of our most vital functions to the bugs living in us and their influence extends beyond mere digestion; they help us extract up to 30  per cent of our calories from food, especially during early life, so they're essential for brain development. They protect us from harmful bacteria, help metabolise drugs, control inflammation and absorb essential nutrients. The bacteria in fat people even seem better able to absorb calories than those found in thin people. Every month more and more functions are found, but the one most of us have heard of is their role as having the largest immune function in the body. It's now thought maternal bacteria can cross the placenta, so even before birth a mother's microbiome directly influences her baby's. Anyone who's watched a birth knows it's not a clean process and babies often start to swallow bacteria from their mothers even as they are being born. When in the gut, those bacteria start to educate the immune system. One disadvantage of having a Caesarean may be that it prevents this exposure to these vital bugs. Modern changes in how mothers, babies and children are exposed to bacteria may be one reason for a rise in asthma, allergies and other conditions. The effect of unnecessary antibiotics on the development of this delicate system is not fully understood, but is likely to be detrimental. Ludicrous: The idea that there could be one simple drink with one simple bug in it that could make us all feel better is farcical . I'm an infectious diseases doctor, so I'm normally interested in destroying 'bad' bacteria, but for the BBC2 programme Trust Me I'm A Doctor, I found out more about the 'friendly' ones that you have probably heard about through the vague, comforting science of 'probiotic' or 'live' yoghurt adverts. A daily dose of these friendly bacteria is claimed to have a wide range of health benefits, but you may find it hard to buy anything called 'probiotic' any more because the European Union has decreed something can only be called a probiotic if it has a proven health benefit - and the criteria are very strict. There is evidence that taking probiotics with particular species of bacteria in them will help in specific situations (such as infectious gastroenteritis, diarrhoea associated with taking antibiotics, or irritable bowel syndrome). Even for an expert, knowing what to take can be very hard. Dr James Kinross is a surgeon at Imperial College London and is doing some of the most exciting research in this area. I met him for the programme and he summed it up by saying: 'If you're well it doesn't seem like they'll make you any better.' But he uses probiotics when there's a problem. Some research shows that, in a large enough dose, bacteria can make it through the harsh conditions of your stomach acid to the large intestine where they can live more easily, so it's plausible they could have a benefit. But, once there, it must compete with thousands of other species in a  complex ecosystem. James compares the microbiome  (the bacteria living in you) to a vast rainforest. He says taking a probiotic to make it 'generally healthier' is like tinkering with the red squirrel population in Surrey and expecting it to have a beneficial effect on the Peruvian jungle - it's possible we know more about the Peruvian rainforest than we do about our own insides. We each have thousands of different species in our bowels, and everyone has their own unique ecosystem. The idea there would be one simple drink with one simple bug in it that could make us all feel better is surely a bit ludicrous. What we do know is the fat and sugar found in some probiotic preparations can have negative health effects. Ironically, this may be because of the effect fat and sugar have on gut bacteria. Luckily, you don't need to worry about finding precisely the right dosage and species of bacteria that's right for you. There's a much simpler, cheaper treatment: porridge. 'The fat and sugar found in some probiotic preparations can have negative health effects.' We've long known high-fibre foods, including oats and green leafy vegetables, have many beneficial effects on health. But, even as a doctor, my understanding of why fibre is good for you was incomplete. I had a vague feeling that roughage worked by cleaning you out, sort of like a brush, and thus got rid of toxins. While this isn't completely untrue it's probably more to do with good bacteria in your gut being able to thrive on the indigestible sugars in fibre. The sugars act as 'prebiotics' - a prebiotic is any substance in food which causes a health benefit by affecting gut bacteria (another term the EU are strict about using, as it implies a proven health benefit). But I wanted to put this to the test, so I went for two weeks with no oats and then six weeks eating more oats than even the man with the caber on the oat packet seems to (a treat for me as I usually have two huge cold lumps of salty porridge per day). I then sent stool samples to Karen Scott at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen (the experience gave me new sympathy with patients I ask to send in a stool sample: not easy or dignified to collect . . . again, apologies if you're reading this over breakfast). Karen is interested in the effect of diet on the health of gut bacteria and, appropriately for her lab in Scotland, the main food she studies is oats. Karen did a genetic analysis of bacteria in my stool sample each week: as the diet went on the species changed. Some died out, others massively expanded their numbers. The importance of fibre: Fresh green veg and oats have many beneficial effects on health, especially, as Dr van Tulleken's experiment showed, because they feed gut bacteria . I felt great, but in larger studies Karen found these changes improve the ecology of the system immensely. To extend the rainforest analogy: if swigging a yoghurt drink is throwing a few seeds into the forest, significantly altering your diet is like changing the soil and the weather: get it right and the good stuff will flourish. Once fed, bacteria can perform all their functions and release beneficial compounds into your blood stream. These have wide-ranging effects from the lining of your gut to your heart and bloodstream. For most of us, it's the prebiotics in the food we eat which has the major effect on the health of your gut and the bacteria in it. The reason food may be good or bad for you is because it changes the populations of bacteria and the chemicals they produce. So while James Kinross and other groups continue to probe the frontiers of your inner universe with the most advanced molecular techniques known to man, I leave you with a conclusion that would have your grandmother saying I told you so: eat more porridge oats. Christoffer van Tulleken is an infectious diseases doctor at University College London Hospitals, and an MRC research fellow at University College London.

"Cosmetic surgery should not be paid for by the taxpayer, Jeremy Hunt said today in a clampdown on NHS spending. The Health Secretary said he could understand public anger at high profile cases of breast enlargements, dental work and slimming treatments being offered by the health service. Mr Hunt insisted that all decisions must be taken on ‘clinical need’ and public money must not be used to pay for surgery just to improve someone's looks. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the NHS against using public money to pay for cosmetic operations . Public anger has mounted at cosmetic treatments being paid for by the NHS, at a time when it is being told to make £20billion in efficiency savings. There are even websites like ‘boobjobsontheservice.co.uk’ which advises people on how ‘whether it really is possible to get boob jobs on the NHS’. Challenged about the controversy by MailOnline, Mr Hunt told a press gallery lunch in Parliament: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS. 'The decisions are taken on the basis of clinical need, but I have made it very clear that I am against purely cosmetic work being done. 'We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS' ‘There will be times when there is a mental health need, which the local doctor has said is very serious. ‘But I do completely understand people’s reservations about some of the things that happen.’ The crackdown would not apply to women offered reconstructive surgery following breast cancer treatment. But the rules are being tightened to ensure only the most severe cases are permitted to justify treatment on psychological grounds. One of the most high profile cases was that of Josie Cunningham, who sparked outrage when it emerged she had received breast enlargement on the NHS, and after becoming unhappy with the results, a tax-payer funded reduction, too. She had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers’ money, after saying her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. Josie Cunningham caused outrage when she got a £5,000 breast enlargement on the NHS, but later said she wanted to have them reduced because the implants left her feeling self-concious . Her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local GP. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. However, Miss Cunningham has since appeared in the media claiming she was planning to have an abortion so she could appear on Big Brother. Meanwhile, Sam Barton, 22, got the NHS to pay for a nose job, and has claimed it was easy to get the £5,000 procedure paid for by NHS Birmingham CrossCity Clinical Commissioning Group. ‘Getting the NHS to pay was the easiest thing I have ever done,’ he said last month. ‘If you say it is ruining your life and you are a good actor it is easy. I can be very manipulative.’ Sam Barton, 22, from Sutton Coldfield, boasted about getting a £5,000 nose job on the NHS . Mr Barton had the operation, left, to try and copy the lives of people such as Joey Essex, right, who appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! He said: 'I feel that if I mirror celebrities, like Joey, I will look and feel good' Stephanie Chamberlain’s four-year-old son Adam was denied SDR surgery to treat brain damage discovered when he was two-and-a-half. The family had been told he could have the operation, but was later informed the NHS was no longer funding it. She said ‘We’re convinced — as doctors have told us — that this is the best thing for him. Where do the NHS’s priorities lie when they choose to fund a breast enlargement operation over enabling a four-year-old boy with cerebral palsy to walk?’ Mother Debbie Foster last month hit out at cosmetic treatments on the NHS, after her son was denied treatment to relieve the agony of Leigh’s Syndrome. The mother of two, who lost her son Robert to the disease at the age of just four on Christmas Eve in 2000, was appalled when NHS bosses refused to pay for treatment for just weeks before Jake, 13, was due to have the operation. Mrs Foster said: ‘It makes me angry that a topless model is allowed to have a boob job on the NHS for cosmetic reasons or someone can have a tummy tuck, but a poorly child has to suffer.’","Cosmetic procedures should not be carried out using public money .

"Manuel Pellegrini has challenged Manchester City star Sergio Aguero to prove he is one of the best players in the world by winning the Ballon d’Or. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have shared the prestigious award between them for the last six years, but Pellegrini believes that Aguero can break their grip on the trophy if he stays fit. The Argentina striker finished as City’s top scorer with 28 goals last season despite spending a third of the campaign on the sidelines, and has scored four in seven games so far even though he has started three of them on the bench. Sergio Aguero has been urged to 'fight for the Ballon d'Or' by Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini . The Argentine striker (right, next to Pablo Zabaleta) training ahead of the Champions League tie against Roma . Pellegrini said: ‘Aguero is among the best players in the world. Now it is up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon d'Or as best player, because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player. ‘He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position inbetween midfield and attack. ‘We hope we will see Sergio back in the form he demonstrated in the Premier League before his injuries hit him. I believe he will make a difference this season.’ Ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad, Pellegrini also warned his players that they cannot afford to let their defence of the Premier League title suffer as they pursue success in Europe. Pellegrini hopes his star man can challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the top award . ‘It is important to progress in the Champions League, but not by forgetting the domestic league,’ he added. ‘We won’t focus all we have on the Champions League and see what happens in the Premier League. ‘If we can fight for the Premier League title and get further in the Champions League, that would be progress. ‘But if we have to leave behind the Premier League to win the Champions League, then for me that isn’t progress.’","Manchester City host Roma in the Champions League this week .

"It is the racing game set to send shivers down Drive Club's spine. And with Forza Motorsport 5 boasting visuals like these, it’s not hard to see why. There are 29 confirmed cars set to feature in the game, including the Ferrari F12berlinetta and Pagini Huayra. Breathtaking: Many felt underwhelmed when seeing the PS4 racing exclusive Drive Club in action. Forza 5, however, is a marvel in full flight . There are also – for the first time in the game’s history – open-wheel cars including the Dallara Dw12 Indycar and Formula One cars such as the Ferrari 312T2 and McLaren M23. So far, there are four confirmed tracks – including Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Mount Panorama Circuit and Spa-Francorchamps. The addition of the latter stage is likely to please Forza fans most. Nestled in the Ardennes countryside of Belgium, the 4.3-mile Spa track is home to legendary corners like 'La Source' and 'Eau Rouge' and has been one of the most requested tracks from fans since the Forza series’ beginning. To ensure maximum authenticity, the environment has been laser-scanned and meticulously recreated at 1080p and 60fps. In comparison, the PS4 exclusive Drive Club looked remarkably last-gen - with muddy textures and the demo riddled with environmental 'pop up'. Developers Turn 10 Studios have also overhauled the physics engine. Working closely with Calspan – the leading tire testing organization in the world – they have developed a completely new and unique set of tire data, including tests and parameters that have never before been utilized in racing games. 'Developing and improving the driving physics has, in many ways, become the central pursuit for the Forza Motorsport series,' said Forza Motorsport 5 creative director Dan Greenawalt. 'We are always chasing that perfect simulation where we can accurately recreate the infinite variables of driving in the digital world. At the same time, that pursuit is always tempered by the limits of what we know about the science of vehicle dynamics and the properties of high performance materials. Tour-de-force: The Forza games have always pushed the boundaries with regards to realism, and the new physics system will do the same again . ‘We are implementing truly cutting edge scientific understanding of tire physics, suspension geometry, and aerodynamics – we’re not implementing the recommendations of last year’s text books, we’re running the tests that will write the vehicle dynamics text books of the next several years.' For the player, this boils down to new level of immersion and challenge each time they play the game. Forza Motorsport 5 is an Xbox One exclusive released on November 22.

"A plague of superweeds, created as a result of GM farming, has swamped 60million acres of American farmland, it has been revealed. A policy briefing issued by America’s Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the weeds in check. The plants have developed as an unintended result of growing crops that have been genetically modified to withstand spraying with certain powerful weedkillers, such as Monsanto’s Roundup Ready, which is also known as glyphosate. File photo: The reality is that the weeds have mutated to become immune to the chemicals with the result they can take over fields . The idea was that the fields could be repeatedly sprayed with these chemicals on the basis they would kill the weeds but allow food crops such as soya to thrive. However, the reality is that the weeds have mutated to become immune to the chemicals with the result they can take over fields. Biotech companies have suggested the way to deal with the problem is to develop new strains of GM crop and switch to different, even more powerful, chemical weedkillers. The UCS study – ‘The Rise of Superweeds – and What to Do About It’ – suggests returning to more natural crops and weed control to defeat the problem. Author of the report, Doug Gurian-Sherman, a senior scientists with the UCS Food & Environment Program, said: ‘It sounds like a bad sci-fi movie or something out of The Twilight Zone. But ‘superweeds’ are real and they’re infesting America’s croplands. ‘Overuse of Monsanto’s ‘Roundup Ready’ seeds and herbicides in our industrial farming system is largely to blame. File photo: These weeds steal nutrients from the crops, which reduces yields, overall productivity, and farmers' profits . And if we’re not careful, the industry’s proposed ‘solutions’ could make this epidemic much worse.’ The US study said as many as 50per cent of US farmers surveyed report glyphosate-resistant weed infestations. In the south east of the country, more than 90per cent of cotton and soybean farmers are affected. To date, some 24 species of weeds have developed resistance, with the result farmers are using more chemical sprays than before the GM crops were planted. Some resistant weeds can grow eight feet tall and the tough stems damage farm equipment. Removing them by hand is the only way to get rid of them, which is expensive. These weeds steal nutrients from the crops, which reduces yields, overall productivity, and farmers’ profits. Mr Gurian-Sherman said: ‘Monsanto and other agribusiness companies are now touting herbicide-resistant crops engineered to withstand older, more toxic herbicides, such as dicamba and 2,4-D, as the ‘solution.’ ‘These new herbicides will certainly exacerbate the problem, but increase the companies’ bottom lines. ‘It’s a highly risky move. Increased herbicides use on the new engineered crops will speed up weed resistance, leaving no viable herbicide alternatives. This is a dangerous chemical cocktail, that when combined with the current farming system, it’s a recipe for disaster.’ He said dicamba and 2,4-D pose additional risks to people and nearby crops. These herbicides have been linked to increased rates of certain diseases, including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in farmers and farm workers. They are prone to drifting on the wind and dispersing into the air after application, and consequently, the herbicides can settle far from where they were applied. These herbicides are extremely toxic to many of the most common fruit and vegetable crops, as well as to plants that provide food and habitat for pollinators and other beneficial insects.","The weeds have so far covered 60million acres of US farmland .

"The typical British family spends more than a quarter of its disposable income on childcare - almost three times as much as parents in other European countries. Childcare costs swallow up 27 per cent of UK parents' net income on average, according to a Tory MP's report which calls for a major overhaul of the system. In contrast, the average family in the Netherlands pays only 10 per cent of its net income to childminders. Expensive: The typical British family spends more than a quarter of its disposable income on childcare. (Pictured posed by models) South West Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss says that, despite the high costs, recent studies have shown widespread problems with quality, price and availability in the UK. In a report for the CentreForum think tank, she claims that while the number of nursery places has increased since 1996, the number of childminder places has dropped drastically in the same period to 245,000 in 2010. The report argues that this has led to price inflation, while at the same time, becoming a childminder is now fraught with red tape. It calls for childminders to be allowed to take on more children at one time. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Miss Truss said a rule that British childminders can only look after three children at a time, including their own, was partly responsible for high costs. The ratio is one to four in France and one to five in Germany and the Netherlands, she added. Arguing for change: Tory MP Elizabeth Truss has called for childminders to be allowed to take on more children at one time . Miss Truss said increasing the ratio in Britain would not compromise child safety. It would attract higher paid staff to the profession, improve the quality and availability of childcare, or make it more affordable, she added. Miss Truss said: ‘At the moment we have childminders getting an average income of £11,000 a year, so people aren’t going into childminding to a great extent. ‘We have half as many childminders as we had 10 years ago. It takes four to six months to register with (childcare regulator) Ofsted. ‘We need to make it simpler. We need to make it attractive.’ The report also calls for a single funding system and for childminders to be able to register with a local agency, nursery or network which would take responsibility for inspection and training and be regulated by Ofsted. Miss Truss said costs were high because of ‘duplication’ in the way childminders are regulated, with both Ofsted and local authorities carrying out inspections. ‘I think a lot of money gets leaked away in the system,’ she added. In the report the MP wrote: 'The coalition Government has a great opportunity to simplify the provision of childcare and get better value for money for parents. 'Reform could lead to an increase in availability of flexible childcare and an end to spiralling costs.' But Anand Shukla, chief executive of the Daycare Trust, cast doubt over whether Miss Truss's recommendations would make childcare cheaper for parents. He said: ‘Looking at the question of ratios, I think it will do very little in terms of reducing the cost of childcare.’ Caring: The report stated that, while nursery places have increased, the number of childminder places has dropped drastically. (Picture posed by models) Mr Shukla called for more research focused on the ‘trade-off’ between having high quality care and allowing childminders to look after more children. ‘There is definitely a case for simplifying the funding stream,’ he said. ‘It is very complicated for childcare.’ Mr Shukla questioned whether reducing regulation would bring down costs. He said: ‘In the Netherlands, they went down this route a few years ago and they have had to row back on it because they have been so worried by quality. ‘The cost to the exchequer went up by 50 per cent.’ The proposals come three months after Downing Street confirmed it was considering a scheme to allow parents to borrow up to £10,000 to cope with childcare costs. Independent think-tank, the Social Market Foundation (SMF), put forward the plan, which would take the form of a loan similar to those offered to students. A poll by SMF showed that 55 per cent of parents find childcare 'too expensive'. The think-tank has suggested a national childcare contribution scheme where parents who earn more than £12,000 annually could receive a lump sum. The loan would be repaid monthly over an extended period and at a low interest rate through the tax system.","The average British family spends 27 per cent of its net income on childminders .

"To call this XCOM would be a major disservice to one of the finest names in tactical gaming. For bar the well-realised time period, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is nothing but another generic third-person shooter with XCOM elements uncomfortably shoe-horned in. Set in the 1960s, you play Agent William Carter – the leader of a three-man squad sent to investigate various alien attacks. Negative space: Gamplay gets repetitive very quickly - despite 2K's best efforts in enemy variation . To its credit, the uninspired combat holds up well. Using a Mass Effect-style command and abilities wheel spliced with a Gears of War cover-system, battles often involve sending your teammates down the flanks to draw fire, while you attack from the other side. Each of your squaddies have their own abilities – for example the Engineer can deploy a floating turret and the Sniper has a useful Critical shot. But where it falls down is in its implementation of a key XCOM principle – that being; when a character dies, they stay dead. Although your squad mates can die if not revived, main character Carter cannot – his fatality merely causing a respawn of the entire squad at the previous checkpoint. Thus, throughout the game’s 15-hour campaign, you never feel connected to the character in the same way you were your squad in XCOM: Enemy Unknown. There's no sense of urgency because you know a checkpoint is always there to save you. Sure, it’s slightly annoying when a high-level squadmate is downed, but they all have no personality or character – and are replaced by yet another bot from a limitless supply of AI-controlled drones. Weapons, too, have no wow factor. All seem slightly muted, with even the largest alien guns coming across as completely limp. Another element uncomfortably borrowed from Enemy Unknown is player choice, and it's commendable that The Bureau – given its frequent delays in development – has kept this element in. However, choices are too black and white often not presenting a moral dilemma but a clear cut: be nice, be nasty scenario. Wooden voice acting and average lip synching do the dialogue sections no favours, either. You can even run around The Bureau's HQ - but apart from the odd mini-game, it's incredibly dull. Boring: There are some nice touches but for the most part there's little to make The Bureau stand out . But by far the biggest nail in The Bureau’s coffin is the lack of co-operative multiplayer. In sticking so rigidly to the rules of the XCOM universe (that being, once your teammates die, they die), they’ve missed a golden opportunity to lift this game away from average. But even then, thrills would be predictable and offer nothing other titles – for example Gears of War – do better. The Bureau isn’t a bad game. It’s just average. And in this day and age, that can be the kiss of death. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is out now.

"Olympic skier Bode Miller and the mother of his son, Sam, reached a last minute custody agreement in Manhattan on Monday that includes online Skype chats between the gold medal winner and his 14-month-old child. Miller, 36, flew overnight from California to attend the latest round in the acrimonious custody battle with former Marine Sara McKenna, 28, and the truce came just in time to prevent him giving potentially embarrassing testimony to the court. Lawyers for the squabbling parents thrashed-out a temporary agreement which sees custody of Sam shared between Miller in California and McKenna in New York over the next four months. Agreement: Olympic skier Bode Miller (seen here in December) exits family court in New York. Miller and former Marine Sara McKenna have reached a temporary truce in their custody fight over their 14-month-old son . The custody battle between Miller and his ex girlfriend Sara McKenna over their son - who is called Nate by his father and Sam by his mother - has raged for almost a year. My fight with Bode: Olympic skier Bode Miller's ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna reluctantly agreed to a temporary four-month custody truce with the star in Manhattan on Monday . McKenna told reporters outside the court that she reluctantly agreed to the truce until August- rather than pushing for full custody at the advice of her lawyers. Attorney's for the pair worked out a seven-page agreement to enable shared custody until the end of summer, that leaves McKenna the primary caregiver. The two warring parties will meet back in court in Manhattan in September, where a psychologist will evaluate the child's well-being and how the arrangement is working. However, McKenna was critically of the plan, especially the element which guarantees Skype chats for six-time Olympic medal winner Miller. 'He’s interested for 45 seconds, then he’s off,' McKenna said of their young son to the New York Post. 'It’s an inadequate substitute for being there — you can’t hug him or touch him.' Despite the ceasing of hostilities for now, the custody battle has been one of the fiercest bi-coastal battles in recent memory. The two first met through the high-end matchmaking service Kelleher and were a couple for three months. Battle: Bode Miller and Morgan Beck with Miller's son - who he calls Nate at their home in California . Father: Bode Miller with his 14-month-old son - who will be shared between him and the boy's mother, Sara McKenna for the next four months . Separated: In September, McKenna lost custody of Sam to Miller and the boy went to live with his skier dad and step-mom in California. Sam and step-mom pictured above . However, they split shortly after McKenna became pregnant because Miller met professional volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom he married. At the commencement of the custody battle last spring, Miller had not even met his three-month-old son and tried to take full custody from McKenna, claiming that because he lived in California, it was illogical for his son to live in the East Coast. McKenna, who was also a former firefighter, moved to New York City so she could study at Columbia University last year. Family Court Justic Fiordaliza Rodriguez approved the custody deal, saying, 'It does appear to be in the child's best interest inasmuch as it provides for substantial time with each parent.' Earlier this month, McKenna outlined her emotional turmoil as she claimed her son had trouble recognizing her because the Olympian had kept him away from her for so long. Miller and his wife Morgan Beck had custody of 'Nate' for five weeks in March and had originally agreed to allow McKenna to have custody of the boy for the whole month of April. Champion: Bode Miller of The USA is kissed by his wife Morgan Beck in the finish area of the Audi FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup Finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland in March (left) and (right) with Miller's son . Heroic woman: McKenna is a former Marine who was working as a firefighter when she was set up with Miller through a matchmaker . They took him to Sochi for the Winter Olympics meaning that the boy was there when he won a bronze medal. The month before, McKenna wrote in Cosmopolitan magazine how difficult the entire custody battle has become and her side of the dispute. Three months into their relationship, McKenna learned she was pregnant but when she told Miller he was less than enthused. 'I told him I wanted to keep the baby. I said he could be involved if he wanted to and that I would love it if he did. If he didn't want any part of it, I said that I was going to do it on my own,' McKenna wrote in an essay for Cosmopolitan. 'I left in tears.' Knowing that she couldn't continue to balance working as a firefighter and being a single mother, McKenna decided to move to New York to attend prestigious Columbia University on the G.I. Bill. Reunited: McKenna won custody of Sam back in November and the two are currently together in New York . In addition to Columbia being a highly-competitive school, McKenna chose the New York City school because there were breast-feeding rooms on campus and family networks that would help her to raise Sam. A month before she moved, McKenna texted Miller to let him know her plans but she says he never responded. She was seven-months-pregnant when she arrived in New York and took up her studies one month later. Son Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna was born on February 23, 2013 and she filed for temporary custody of the child three days later. But when Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna learned that her ex-boyfriend and filed for custody of the child despite never expressing any interest in being the boy's father. Miller and wife Morgan had also experienced a miscarriage that January. Miller sent the custody papers to her home in San Diego, despite knowing she didn't live there, and that set off a complex multi-state custody battle. Eventually the case was sent back to California and on September 4, a judge gave Miller full-custody of Sam calling McKenna's move to New York 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'. Husband and wife: Miller married Beck (pictured above at Sochi in February) in October 2012 and the two lost a child in a miscarriage the following January . After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job. But she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters'. And she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get Sam back for good. All the while McKenna tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 'Nathaniel'. 'I would look for photos of Sam on Instagram and Twitter and saw that Bode was calling him Nathaniel. That was really heartbreaking. Our son’s name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just confusing. 'There were also tons of photos of Bode’s wife holding Sam like he was her baby. That was very hard to bear,' McKenna added. The next time McKenna saw her son was at a court hearing on November 25 where she won back custody of Sam. 'I was sitting in court when I heard Sam’s sweet little voice down the hall. As soon as I saw him, I reached out and said, 'I missed you!' He put his arms out for me and said, “Mama!” We still had to deal with a court hearing that day, but I didn’t care. I could breathe again. I was whole. The next day was my birthday. I woke up next to Sam, and he started giggling — that was the best present I’ve ever received in my life,' she said. McKenna is back living in New York and hopes to work out stable life for Sam where he can see both of his parents. 'That's all I want for our son,' she wrote. The experience of losing her son has also inspired her studies as she is now pursuing a law degree to help others in her position.","Olympic skier Bode Miller and former Marine Sara McKenna have reached a temporary truce in their custody fight over their 14-month-old son .

"A sheet of blotting paper used on the armistice document that brought about the end of the First World War has emerged for sale for £30,000. The sheet carries the inky signatures of military leaders Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, First Sea Lord, and Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the French leader of the Allied forces, who had been sent to France in November 1918 to thrash out a peace deal with the Germans. After four days of tense negotiations conducted in two railway carriages deep in the heart of the French countryside, a historic truce was reached. The blotting paper (left) was picked up by Captain John Marriott (pictured right) after military leaders had thrashed out a peace deal with the Germans to end the First World War . Top brass from all sides signed the armistice, which was aimed at restoring peace to the world after four years of bitter fighting. Captain John Marriott, Admiral Wemyss' naval assistant during the negotiations, was acutely aware of the significance of the peace deal. After the document had been signed, the quick-thinking captain picked up the scrap of paper which had been used to blot the signatures of the dignitaries and pocketed it. Later, Admiral Wemyss wrote on the paper: 'This blotting paper was a signature of armistice with Germany 5 am 11/11/18/ in the Compiegne Forest. R.E. Wemyss.' Two days before the deal was struck, Capt Marriott wrote a poignant letter to his wife Margaret describing the negotiations. He wrote: 'Here we are out in the middle of a lovely forest on a beautiful day. The Boche is in a similar train about 200' off & we await the reply to our armistice terms which have gone to Germany. 'We had 2 meetings y'day & I have never seen a more miserable lot of men, I feel they know the game is up and are terrified of Bolshevism. 'They say they are very hungry in the Country & badly in need of everything. Blotting paper used on the historic armistice document that brought about the end of the First World War has emerged for sale for £30,000. It was picked up at the armistice signing by Captain John Marriott (fourth from left) 'War is a Godless business and I do so hope we shall finish it all by Monday. We shall be here possibly till then but one never knows anyhow, after this business we are off home again. 'It is a historic meeting this without a doubt & I shall never forget it, please God we pull it off & as far as I can see I think we shall...' A blow-by-blow account of the talks written by Capt Marriott has also come to light, revealing the moment he was tasked to call George V with news of the armistice. He wrote: 'At 5.a.m. orders were issued to cease hostilities at 11 a.m. afloat, ashore and in the air. 'I was told by Admiral Wemyss to ring up BUCKINGHAM PALACE and inform HIS MAJESTY; the line was dreadful and I must have been cut off about 30 times but finally got Charles Cust and informed him. I also told 10 Downing Street. 'We then had a glass of port and went for a walk in the Forest which was wonderfully soothing after our busy night.' Two days before the deal was struck, Capt Marriott wrote a poignant letter (pictured) to his wife Margaret describing the negotiations . Capt Marriott's family has decided to sell the blotting paper along with the letters to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. Experts say they could fetch £30,000 when they go under the hammer in a Bonhams auction. Luke Batterham, an expert from Bonhams, said: 'John Marriott was a naval captain who was present at the signing of the armistice in France in November 1918. 'The negotiations took several days and Capt Marriot was there throughout. 'The war had been raging for four years and Capt Marriot was very much aware of the significance of the armistice. 'After the document had been signed he picked up the blotting paper which had been used and took it with him as a souvenir of the moment. 'It really is a remarkable item. It is a wonderful record of an incredible moment in history. 'During the talks he somehow found the time to write a very poignant letter to his wife Margaret describing everything going on around him. 'He captured in words the huge significance of the armistice. 'These documents come to us directly from Capt Marriott's family and they will be of great interest to anyone interested in military or 21st century history. 'It is incredible the stories that can be held within one piece of paper.' The armistice was signed at 5am on November 11, 1918, after Germany had requested to enter peace talks. It was signed by Marshal Foch and Admiral Wemyss on behalf of the Allies. The German delegates who signed it were politician Matthias Erzberger, army major General Detlof von Winterfeldt, Count Alfred von Oberndorff of the Foreign Ministry and Captain Vanselow of the Imperial Navy. After signing the agreement Admiral Foch declared: 'This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years'. The Second World War started twenty years and 65 days later. The auction will take place in London on October 1. The armistice between the Allies and Germant was known as the Armistice of Compiègne after the place where it was signed in the French countryside. It went into effect at 11am on November 11 1918 marking victory for the Allies. There were 35 terms including the end of hostilities, withdrawal of troops to behind their own borders, the exchange of prisoners and the promise of war reparations. It also included the disposition of German warships and submarines. The armistice - largely written by the French Marshal Ferdinand Foch - ended fighting, but it took a further six months of negotiations to conclude the peace deal, the Treaty of Versailles. The armistice brought an end to the First World War and came into effect at 11am on November 11, 1918 . But Foch considered the Treaty to be 'a capitulation, a treason' believing only the permanent occupation of the Rhineland would grant France sufficient security against a revival of German aggression. He is repored to have said: 'This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years' as the Treaty was being signed. The Second World War started twenty years and 65 days later. Many have argued that the Treaty may have helped sow the seeds for the Second World War because its terms caused such anger within Germany. Years later, Adolf Hitler was voted in to power, promising to rip up the document.","Blotting paper was used on document that brought end to First World War .

"Monitoring: Staff have had their emails hacked by the BBC (Director General Tony Hall pictured) over fears they were leaking information or breaching other rules . The BBC has secretly monitored staff e-mail accounts over the last two years to find 'moles' accused of leaking confidential information. A total of 81 employees have had their accounts monitored since 2012 as investigators probed possible fraud, harassment, bribery and confidentiality breaches. Probes into alleged leaks have more than doubled from four in 2012 to ten in 2013, official figures have revealed. But the broadcaster would not say what information they believed was being leaked out of the organisation. BBC bosses have faced crisis after crisis after the crimes of paedophile Jimmy Savile were revealed in 2012, some of them on BBC premises. This scandal also led to the resignation of former Director General George Entwistle and the furore over his payoff - £450,000 for 54 days in the job. The secret monitoring of staff accounts is overseen by the BBC Investigation Service. In total the BBC has confirmed there were a total of 30 occasions in 2012 and another 51 in 2013 when its internal Investigation Service hacked into to staff e-mail accounts to see if there was any wrong doing. As well as the 14 inquiries about information leaks there have also been 15 cases across the last two years where accounts have been accessed because of fraud allegations. Four accounts were opened up because of claims of theft, four relating to harassment allegations, one in relation to an assault claim and another one in connection with a bribery inquiry. There were also a total of 24 cases where the BBC accessed the staff member's e-mails as part of an internal disciplinary case and another four where the police made a formal request for e-mail traffic as part of a criminal investigation. E-mails were also accessed ten times in relation to the misuse of computers and on three occasions where there were allegations of malicious communications. Wide ranging: The Corporation, based at Broadcasting House (pictured), hacked a total of 81 employees have had their accounts monitored since 2012 over possible fraud, harassment, bribery and confidentiality breaches . Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'There is simply no reason why the BBC should be investigating suspected cases of criminality themselves. 'If the level of suspicion warrants employees emails to be hacked into, then the police should absolutely be involved. 'The fact that the BBC has an entire unit dedicated to investigating employee misconduct is in itself troubling. The BBC must be explicit that any investigations will be carried out transparently and that mission creep, leading to employees being surveilled for trivial matters, will not be allowed to set in.' A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC rarely monitors staff e-mail accounts and only in exceptional circumstances where it is reasonable, necessary and represents a proportionate response. 'Monitoring of email accounts is invariably undertaken in relation to criminal or disciplinary investigations and staff are aware that monitoring can occur.'","Staff were 'hacked' over claims of fraud, bribery, harassment and leaks .

"Dripping with chandeliers and lined with gold, this - of course - was Joan Rivers' home. A dazzling gem of old-school showbusiness, it seems only right that her living room ceilings scaled 30ft-high, and velvet drapes framed the vast windows. The 5,000-square-foot penthouse is held up by gold pillars. And in every corner of the opulent New York apartment sit stacks of index cards with jokes spanning her entire career. Scroll down for video . Opulent: The drawing room in Joan Rivers's Upper East Side condo is a sea of pink and gold velvet, with a piano in the corner, lit by three glittering chandeliers .

In progress: Among her extensive archive there were files of uncompleted jokes ready to be worked on . The comedienne, who died last week at the age of 81, once described the Upper East Side condo as 'where Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had the money'. The limestone mansion was built in 1910 for society figure John R Drexel and his socialite wife. In 1959, it welcomed Ernest Hemingway as a tenant in one of the one-bedroom apartments. He installed a study and hoped to write but found they city too oppressive and soon left. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers have been lain across the marble stairs outside the cast iron front door of the Manhattan apartment following Rivers's death . A pillar of showbusiness: Like Rivers, who died last week at 81, the New York apartment lined with pillars and mirrors is a star of the city, valued at around $35million .

Rivers had tried to sell the property a number of times. She first listed it on the market in 2009, when she planned to move to the West Coast to be closer to her daughter, Melissa Rivers. The latest attempt was in 2012 went it was listed with an asking price of $29.5 million.

"They say marriage is for better or for worse. But for Cori Jo Long, 31, and Brooke Powell, 30, from Fort Worth, Texas, it appears the latter has become true. The couple did everything right before they got married. Same-sex marriage: Same-sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia . They fell in love slowly, based on years of friendship stretching back to high school and planned their nuptials carefully for about a year. The same sex couple traveled from Texas to New Hampshire in 2010 as same-sex marriage spread. Sadly, bad times set in three years later, but uncoupling has proven far more difficult. The two women are now trapped in a state of bitter, desperate wedlock, an emerging problem for those who entered into same-sex marriages. It seems like a hollow victory for those who wanted marriage equality for everyone, but now can't find a way around legal snarls that prevent them getting a divorce. Texas doesn't recognize the marriage of Long and Powell, and a judge there ruled recently he had no jurisdiction to either void the union or formally grant a divorce. It's hard to feel like you don't exist, like you're invisible under the law,' Powell said. Long said: 'It's a limbo. It's waiting and seeing. That's all I can do.' The wait may be a long one as they pursue appeals. Thankfully, the two aren't fighting over kids, an area particularly difficult in matters of same-sex divorce for couples who traveled to a state granting the freedom to marry from a state that doesn't. After the honeymoon: Many same-sex couples are trapped in marriages that they cant get out of due to laws . Same-sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, but laws governing divorce have not kept pace, creating a contradictory patchwork that could take years to resolve. 'It's a mess, the inability to get divorced,' said Beth Littrell, a senior attorney for the civil rights group Lambda Legal's Southern regional office in Atlanta. It's difficult to calculate precisely how many same-sex couples have divorced, but watchdogs like Littrell are keeping a close eye on the way judges and state legislatures are responding to wedlock and other divorce-related problems. 'I get hundreds of calls,' New York divorce attorney David Centeno said. 'They don't realize that they're entering into a marriage that's kind of like jail. 'You can't get out of it unless you move here to New York and you meet the residency requirements. It's heartbreaking. There needs to be some sort of national reform.' Divorce proceedings are generally inconsistent from state to state, but the process has become more streamlined for same-sex couples who travel to a marriage recognition state to tie the knot. If they're seeking an uncontested divorce, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota and Vermont — along with the District of Columbia — have loosened residency requirements. However, they won't address child custody, visitation, support or other issues related to uncoupling. In Iowa and 12 other marriage-granting states, however, residency must be established to divorce, taking anywhere from six months to a year or more. Perhaps the most heartbreaking aspect of wedlock is settling child custody battles, said Littrell and others. Fights over kids are usually decided in heterosexual divorces in the state where kids live, said Cathy Sakimura, family law director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. For same-sex couples in states where marriage or civil unions aren't recognized, child-related divorce disputes are murky. Attorney Elizabeth Schwartz in Miami, a family law specialist and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocate, said there can be portability problems in same-sex child custody battles. This occurs particularly from state to state, especially when moving from one state that recognizes same-sex marriage to one that doesn't. 'It's all very challenging for people,' Sakimura said.","Same-sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia .
But laws governing divorce for same-sex couples have not kept pace .
Some states, like Texas, do not recognize gay marriage .
It means that a divorce cannot be granted in Texas to a same-sex couple .
It has left many couples unable to get a divorce if their marriage fails .
One way around it is to move to New York but you must meet residency requirements to be able to get a divorce .
Uncontested divorces are easier in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota and Vermont and the District of Columbia ."
"Venture capitalist Harvey Boulter, boss of Dubai-based developers behind the app said: 'If you're a law enforcement guy, you might have concerns' Police and anti-terrorist agencies are facing a formidable new enemy – a cheap smartphone app that encrypts texts and phone calls, making them virtually impossible to bug. Seecrypt, which costs £2 a month, allows users to apply a secret code to their messages and calls which gives them military-level security. The system also makes it  impossible for intelligence agencies to analyse which numbers terror suspects and criminals are calling, or when – a technique that is a mainstay of criminal investigation. A senior UK official who has worked . extensively in counter-terrorism and against organised crime said he . feared that Seecrypt would ‘enable the bad guys to get ahead’. Encrypted emails have been used by terrorists for years, he said, and sometimes proved impossible to crack. ‘We’re in a constant race against them and I suppose this is another issue we’re going to have to deal with,’ he said. Porton Group, the Dubai-based . investment fund behind the app, says it ‘will work with law enforcement . agencies to ensure this product does not fall into the wrong hands’. But . because the firm that will actually run the app is registered in the . Cayman Islands, neither UK nor other Western security agencies will have . any legal right to obtain warrants to gain ‘real-time’ access to . unencrypted calls. Former head of Defence Intelligence Staff Sir Joseph French said the app is 'at the top of the security ladder' Seecrypt is extraordinarily easy to use. Subscribers are given a special, secret number prefixed by the code +281, and can then call or text anyone else with a Seecrypt account. The app uses the internet to transmit the call, using either a wi-fi connection or an ordinary mobile phone signal. Calls to far-flung parts of the world are therefore free. Seecrypt functions by generating a one-time cipher composed of two ‘layers’ of 2,048 digits every time subscribers contact each other. Sources say it would take a super-computer at GCHQ – Britain’s communications intelligence agency – about six months to break a code with just one layer of encryption at this level. Seecrypt allows users to make and receive secure voice calls and text messages. Anti-terrorist agencies say this is an obstacle they will have to overcome . Sir Joseph French, a former head of the Defence Intelligence Staff, is one of Seecrypt’s advisers. He said the app met the encryption standard required for official communications classified as ‘Secret’, and is ‘at the top of the security ladder’. Seecrypt is the direct descendant of Cellcrypt, Porton Group’s military-grade app, which has been certified as virtually bug-proof by GCHQ. Cellcrypt is widely deployed by Coalition forces in Afghanistan as well as law enforcement and intelligence organisations around the world. Porton’s chief executive is  Harvey Boulter, the businessman who first exposed the bizarre relationship between former Defence Secretary Liam Fox  and his bogus ‘special adviser’, Adam Werrity. It was when the three men met in Dubai in 2011 to discuss the progress of Cellcrypt that Mr Werrity gave Mr Boulter a business card that falsely suggested he had a formal Ministry of Defence position. In fact, although Mr Werrity had been best man at Dr Fox’s wedding and travelled the world at his side, with his bills paid by a network of political donors, he had neither security clearance nor any official post. The ensuing scandal forced Dr Fox to resign. He is currently suing Mr Boulter for libel over comments he made in a television interview. Mr Boulter said Seecrypt expected to have a million subscribers within its first three months, and already had the capacity to go to 25 million. He maintained it was aimed at ‘anyone who wanted to restore their privacy’, adding that the US had estimated that industrial espionage conducted against private business by China alone was costing the American economy about £750 billion a year. A senior UK counter-terrorist official said that terrorists have been using encrypted emails for years, some which are impossible to crack . Mr Boulter admitted: ‘If you’re a law enforcement guy, you might have concerns. For them, it’s not going to be entirely helpful.’ But he continued: ‘People’s privacy has been invaded more and more during the past decade. This will enable you to get some of it back.’ Also working on Seecrypt’s development is Tony Chapa, the former chief technology officer of the US Secret Service – the body responsible for every aspect of the President’s security. He said: ‘Your mobile phone is the open window on your privacy. Of course Seecrypt could be exploited by villains, but we will do everything we can to stop it being misused.’","App makes phones nearly impossible to bug by encrypting texts and calls .

"A gunman who killed two friends at a Yemeni wedding when he lost control of his AK-47 can be seen trying to fire it one-handed in new footage. The latest footage shows the gunman gyrating to Gangnam Style before firing celebratory shots into the air on a packed dance floor. But he could not control the powerful weapon with one hand and sprayed bullets at fellow revellers.

The graphic video ends abruptly as family and friends rush to the injured on the ground. The horrific footage of the wedding in the southern city of Taiz was posted online to Liveleak yesterday. It opens with people happily dancing to the hit song by South Korean pop star Psy. The gunman, dressed in a white striped shirt, can be seen in the background gyrating to the music. As the song reaches its chorus, the guest can be seen raising the gun into the air with just one hand. However, it is too powerful and the man then shoots people dancing next to him.

"The Oakland Raiders fired coach Dennis Allen on Monday, just four games - and four losses - into his third season. The decision was announced soon after the Raiders returned from London where they lost their 10th straight game dating back to last season, 34-14 to the Miami Dolphins. Allen was the first head coach hired by Oakland after the death of longtime owner Al Davis. His 8-28 win-loss record is the worst for the club since before Davis arrived in 1963. Dennis Allen was sacked as head coach by the Oakland Raiders after four straight defeats in 2014 . The Raiders were thrashed 38-14 by the Miami Dolphins in an NFL International Series game at Wembley . VIDEO Ross Tucker: Which coach is on the hottest seat after Week 4? An announcement on the interim coach will come Tuesday, with offensive line coach Tony Sparano and offensive coordinator Greg Olson the most likely options. The Raiders have had 11 straight seasons of more losses than wins and no playoff berths. Oakland will now have its eighth coach since 2003. Allen and general manager Reggie McKenzie were hired after the team finished 8-8 under coach Hue Jackson in 2011, falling one game short of a playoff bid. They were expected to steady a franchise that ran into disrepair during Davis' final years as owner. Instead, the team has become worse. The two were hamstrung their first two seasons by a lack of premium draft picks and a difficult salary-cap situation due to bad contracts handed out by Davis. Dennis Allen oversees a practice session at Pennyhill Park in Bagshot last week . But after spending their first two years overhauling the roster, owner Mark Davis expected the Raiders to be much more competitive this season after having ample salary cap room in the offseason and a near full complement of draft picks. Instead, the Raiders have looked overmatched at times. They fell behind 27-0 after three quarters of their only home game against Houston and trailed by 31 points after three quarters against the Dolphins. In all, Allen had more losses by at least 20 points (nine) than wins. It was performances like those that Davis said he no longer wanted to see in Allen's third season and ultimately led to his downfall.","Allen sacked early in his third season in charge in Oakland .

"The report suggested that fears of abduction, traffic accidents and bullying are among the factors that explain why parents do not let their children walk to school . Only a quarter of primary school children are allowed to travel to school alone, a study shows. Examining how many pupils walk, cycle or take the bus to school unaccompanied, the report by the Policy Studies Institute revealed a dramatic fall from 86 per cent in 1971. It also showed a startling contrast with Germany, where 75 per cent of children travel alone. The report suggested that fears of abduction, traffic accidents and bullying are among the factors that explain the lack of autonomy for the pupils in England. Mayer Hillman of the PSI urged parents to encourage their children to be more independent in order to help their development. He said: ‘Wrapping our kids in cotton wool may seem like we are keeping them safe, but it makes growing up harder and less fun.’ In 1971, when the research by the Policy Studies Institute (PSI) at Westminster University was first carried out, 86 per cent of UK primary pupils travelled alone between home and school. Now it is just 25 per cent, while in Germany, where children cycle, walk or take the bus to school alone years before British children, the figure is 75 per cent. Research fellow Ben Watson, who co-authored the study, said: ‘Independent mobility has been shown to be good for children’s wellbeing and development, yet our research shows it has dropped significantly in the last four decades. ‘The experience from Germany shows that this drop is not an inevitable result of modern life.’ he added. The PSI conducted studies on child mobility in 1971, 1990 and 2010 in primary and secondary schools in five different areas of England while colleagues in Germany did the same. The researchers found that the lack of independence for youngsters seen in the UK was down to a number of factors including fear of abduction, traffic accidents and bulling by other children. Cath Prisk, director of Play England, said: ‘This study confirms our own research that there are more barriers to playing out and travelling independently for children today than for previous generations. Interestingly, the research shows that children in other countries, such as Germany, are able to enjoy this basic right far more than their English peers. ‘Parents who want to buck this worrying trend should think about giving their kids the gift of independence at home, on the doorstep, in their neighbourhood and further afield.’ The surveys of children and their parents were conducted in 10 schools (five primary and five secondary) in five areas of England: Islington, Nottingham, Stevenage, Winchester and rural Oxfordshire. In Germany, Kvln Innenstadt, Witten, Kvln Chorweiler, Wuppertal-Langerfeld and Bochum were the locations surveyed. The children were asked whether they were allowed to cross main roads alone, uses buses and bicycles without an adult, come home from school alone, travel to other places on their own or with friends, and to go out after dark alone.","In Germany 75 per cent of children travel alone, according to report .

"Authorities say a naked woman was riding in the tractor-trailer that struck a school bus in north Florida, injuring 10 people. Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Dylan Bryan says it is unclear why the woman was not clothed when the truck hit the bus Monday afternoon. The bus was carrying elementary students to their homes. Authorities say none of the students received life-threatening injuries, but the driver of the tractor-trailer and the woman were in critical condition. Frantic scene: Children were screaming and crying after a tractor trailer with a naked woman inside hit a school bus and injured seven elementary school aged children . None of the injuries are believed to be fatal. Bradford County school officials said there were 15 students on the bus when it was hit traveling south on U.S. 301 at 2:30 p.m. Bryan said the semi had a sleeper compartment. He did not know if the nude woman was in the cab or in the sleeper area when the accident occurred. Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith said the woman appeared to have been ejected from the vehicle. 'I just remember grabbing something and throwing it over her,' he told Jacksonville.com. '... There were kids and parents.' Jacksonville.com reports that children were screaming and crying and one girl worried about her friend still inside of the school bus. Prior to the crash, motorists called the Florida Highway Patrol to report that the log truck, which wasn't carrying a load, was driving dangerously. Young children: Students on the bus went to Starke Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida and seven of them were hospitalized after the bizarre crash . Neither police nor witnesses learned why the woman was naked. The two drivers of the truck and the woman were hospitalized. Seven of the 15 students on the bus were taken to the hospital but none suffered fatal injuries. Witnesses told Jacksonville.com that the driver didn't appear to hit his brakes. School bus driver Jennifer Swanson saw the log truck coming towards them so she hit the gas which softened the impact of the crash and prevented any injuries. The log truck pushed the school bus almost the length of a football field. Swanson was commended by highway patrol and the school district for calming the children until help arrived. The school bus did provide seat belts for all passengers but it’s unknown whether or not they were wearing seat belts or not. Mental health counselors will be available at the school for anyone at the school affected by the incident. The Mail Online contacted Florida Highway Patrol but no one was available for comment.","A naked woman was riding in the tractor-trailer that struck a school bus in north Florida, injuring 10 people, seven of whom were children .

"Unstable weather and dangerous conditions caused by an Antarctic cold front hitting warm tropical air 2,500kms off Australia's west coast is expected to severely affect the search for MH370 over the coming weeks and months. An aviation meteorologist and an air and sea consultant have both predicted rough times for the planes and ships in the Indian Ocean, and an 'on and off' mission at best as the area's eight-month-long winter brings brutal swells and high winds to the search area. Aviation safety consultant, Geoffrey Thomas of airline industry business publication airlineratings.com, warned today's weather was merely 'a taste' of conditions which would soon close in over the search area. Scroll down for video . Rough seas ahead: the HMAS Success has now left the target area, with severe weather and huge swells forcing it to abandon the search . Back to base: Experts today warned that winter was about to hit the search area, bringing severe weather that could last up to eight months . 'A large cold front is moving in. There are very heavy seas, pouring rain and low cloud,' he said. 'In the sort of conditions out there today, the sea is a cauldron of foam with white caps and crashing waves. It would be pointless and dangerous to be out there.' Mr Thomas described today's conditions an ominous 'portent of things to come'. 'This is the start of the winter season,' he said. 'And that's when conditions like today's are a daily occurrence in this area of ocean. It's winter for eight months of the year, and during that period it is the worst place in the world. 'The seas are wild and rough, there are huge swells and the winds are extreme. They are called the roaring forties, for very good reason.' Dangerous conditions: Planes have been called back to base, with low clouds and high winds making search conditions unsafe . Uncertain future: It's not yet known when the search will continue, with experts warning of 'off and on' conditions . Mr Thomas told MailOnline that the conditions ensured the search mission would continue for weeks, while the retrieval of wreckage might take months or years. 'Aircraft will continue to spot debris from MH370, although it's very hard to locate. You're tearing along at 200km/h and it's there and gone in a flash. 'That's the challenge - find the debris then recover the debris. And it's going to be exceedingly difficult dispatching a submersible off a ship that is pitching and rolling in 60-foot swells. 'But the biggest challenge of all is finding the plane at the bottom of the ocean, the actual crash site. 'If this is pilot suicide, you couldn't pick a better place [to crash a plane so] you'd never find it.' Newcastle University's consultant meteorologist and a former military aviation adviser, Martin Babakhan, said that wintery conditions in the search area would mean efforts to retrieve the plane would be limited to short, clear-weather windows. 'The transition season has begun, and that means the cold air from the Antarctic is moving up and the warm air moving down creating a deep trough line and very severe weather events,' Mr Babakhan said. Heartache: It's yet more pain for the grieving families of passengers, who've now been told the plane had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean . 'That creates a very low pressure, unstable air and lots of storms. The transition will hamper searching and make it dangerous [for ships and aircraft] to be in the area. 'There will be periods when it is fine to resume the search, such as in the next 24 hours, but the search will be on and off during this Autumn period. It will be very patchy. '[Right now] there is a frontal system moving very fast and a severe cold front, and from the north a high pressure system and very strong winds. And so flying from (Perth), you have to calculate the risk for the aircraft.'","The search for MH370 called off due to bad weather .

"Google is facing fresh outrage over its meagre contribution to the UK taxman, after revealing it paid just £20million in corporation tax last year. The California-based internet giant has faced stinging criticism for using a complex corporate structure that allows it to route UK sales through Ireland to slash its tax bill. And the scheme appears to have again paid off. Luck has nothing to do with it: Google has managed to slash its UK tax bill to just £20million . Last night it revealed in accounts filed to Companies House that it paid £20.4million in taxes last year – despite admitting earlier this year that it pulls in £3.3billion of revenues in Britain, largely from advertising. But in accounts filed last night Google UK said it made a profit of £70.8million before tax on sales of £642million. These numbers are artificially low because Google officially registers much of its British sales in Ireland, where the headline rate of corporation tax is 12.5 per cent compared with 21 per cent in the UK. And the internet behemoth is then able to slash its bill even further by siphoning cash out of Ireland by paying royalties to another firm based in the tax haven of Bermuda. 'Deeply disappointed': Ed Miliband's on Google's tax-avoidance policy when it came to light last year . Google’s aggressive tax avoidance policy has sparked criticism from campaign groups and politicians including Ed Miliband. The Labour leader last year declared himself ‘deeply disappointed’ that Google, which employs almost 2,000 people in the UK, is able to get away with paying so little tax. Google has defended itself by pointing to its record of employing people in the UK and investing more than £300million in London property. But France has moved to crack down on the company, slapping it with a tax bill of nearly £800million earlier this year after raiding its Paris offices.","California-based search provider routes UK sales through low-tax Ireland .

"Premier League clubs backed chief executive Richard Scudamore to stay in office after the sexist emails scandal, despite David Cameron suggesting he could have been sacked. An emergency meeting involving all 17 teams —  promoted clubs are not yet members of the top flight  — voted unanimously to support Scudamore. He will face no further action after his email exchanges with TV rights  lawyer Nick West. This came after the Prime Minister was asked if ‘someone in your team could survive that sort of thing?’ ‘No, I don’t think they would,’ said Mr Cameron on Radio 5 Live. ‘People should treat everybody else with respect.’ Watch: Richard Scudamore will be called to account by the FA to deliver his promises . Criticism: Prime Minister David Cameron described sexist emails sent by Richard Scudamore as 'unacceptable' 'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel.

'The Premier League Shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and I fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions. 'I appreciate that I have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who I am and what I believe. So, I will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that I will continue to do my utmost personally, and through all the Premier League’s means to help promote diversity and inclusion, develop the women’s game and support women who want be involved in football at any level.

"Demand: Judge Peter Murphy said the Muslim defendant must remove her burkha in the courtroom because the principle of open justice overrode the 21-year-old woman's religious beliefs . A judge told a Muslim woman she must remove her burkha in court before she can enter a plea after she refused to reveal her face. Judge Peter Murphy said the principle of open justice overrode the 21-year-old woman's religious beliefs, and warned there was a risk a different person could go into the dock pretending to be her. The woman, from Hackney, east London, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, appeared before Blackfriars Crown Court today charged with intimidating a witness. She said she cannot remove the veil in front of men because of her religious beliefs. Judge Murphy told her: ‘It is necessary for this court to be satisfied that they can recognise the defendant. ‘While I obviously respect the right to dress in any way she wishes, certainly while outside the court, the interests of justice are paramount. ‘I can’t, as a circuit judge, accept a plea from a person whose identity I am unable to ascertain.’ He added: ‘It would be easy for someone on a later occasion to appear and claim to be the defendant. ‘The court would have no way to check on that.’ Her barrister, Claire Burtwistle, told the court the woman was not prepared to lower her veil at all while men were in the room. ‘In front of women, it is not an issue’, she said. ‘It is simply men that she will not allow to see her face.’ Hearing: The woman, who appeared before Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, was charged with witness intimidation . Ms Burtwistle suggested herself, a female . police officer or a female prison guard could identify the defendant . and confirm to the court that it is the same person as in the police . arrest photos. Under the veil: The judge said there is a risk that if a Muslim woman was allowed to cover her face with a veil in court a different person could pretend to be her (file photo) Prosecutor Sarah Counsell added that the . police officer in charge of the case was content that he recognised the . defendant while she was in the burkha. But Judge Murphy rejected the suggestions, saying: ‘It seems to me to be quite fundamental that the court is sure who it is the court is dealing with. ‘Furthermore, this court, as long as I am sitting, has the highest respect for any religious tradition a person has. ‘In my courtroom also, this sometimes conflicts with the interests of a paramount need for the administration of justice. In my courtroom, that’s going to come first.’ The judge added: ‘There is the principle of open justice and it can’t be subject to the religion of the defendant whether the principle is observed or not. ‘I am not saying this because of the particular form of dress by this defendant, I apply that to any form of dress that had the same issues.’ Judge Murphy adjourned the case for legal argument over whether the defendant should have to remove her veil. It will be heard again on September 12, when the defendant is expected to enter a not guilty plea and go to trial. The defendant is alleged to have intimidated a witness, in Finsbury Park, north London, in June. The French caused controversy around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public. Politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance. The law - which sparked protests in Pakistan - was brought into effect in 2011 under the leadership of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. British politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha. In 2006, former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sparked outrage when he said he had ask Muslim women to remove their veils when talking to them in his constituency surgery. Three years ago Conservative MP Philip Hollobone tabled a private members' bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in public. However, the bill fell by the parliamentary wayside following claims that bringing in such a law could be in breach of the Equality Act.","Judge Peter Murphy said open justice overrides religious belief in court .

"A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of its iPhones to encourage users to buy a new release. The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new iPhone launch. It then compared those results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and discovered the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung. A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of iPhones to encourage users to buy its new release. The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases . The study, compiled by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco, follows claims that the Cupertino-based company is deliberately sabotaging its old products. Writing for the New York Times, Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, described the results as 'striking'. 'Wouldn't many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one?' Mr Mullainathan wrote. ‘When you sell the device and control the operating system, that's an option'. The study then compared those results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and found the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung . While some MailOnline readers haven't noticed a slow down, others claim that Apple is sabotaging older phones through software updates. 'This is common knowledge,' one reader wrote. 'If you want to keep your iPhone running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out within six months of a new iPhone release,' Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product. She said her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Ms Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Her claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one. And Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before. Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product . A security expert has warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. However, Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes. His investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a ‘backdoor’ in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem. Meanwhile, in 2012 Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly. Ms Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. ‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. Dom Ferkin, managing direction of UK-based iOS experts, Creation Application, told MailOnline that he doesn’t believe Apple are doing this intentionally. ‘On every hardware release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time they are released,’ he said. ‘Each year they release a new iOS. If you’re running an iOS 7 on a 5 chip, for example, it’s comparable to running Windows XP on a Windows 95 machine. ‘It’s just enough to annoy the users, but it’s needed if you want the slew of new features that Apple releases each year.’ Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong. No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower. There are other explanations for why an older model iPhone may slow down, he claims. For instance, the latest version of the Apple operating system, iOS, is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as efficiently on older models. ‘Hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone,’ he added. ‘And you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.’ Apple is yet to respond. But Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong.No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower .","The study was undertaken by student Laura Trucco at Harvard University .

"A state-backed mortgage guarantee scheme worth £130billion will see the market flooded with 500,000 cheap loans. The Government is to subsidise deposits and provide state backing for loans to help homebuyers get on the property ladder or move up. But there were warnings that the scheme risks creating a house price bubble. Scroll down for video . Dangerous? Critics fear that offering government-back mortgages to people who cannot afford a deposit could fuel a new property crisis . The Help to Buy scheme will offer . loans to top up the deposits of those buying newly built properties . worth up to £600,000 who can only put up 5 per cent of the loan . themselves. The Treasury will add an extra 20 per . cent of the house value to enable them to get a mortgage. The first . five years of the loan will be interest free. After that it will attract . a 1.75 per cent payment, which will rise annually by inflation plus 1 . per cent. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding . Borrowers will be able to apply from . April 1 and be able to repay the loan at any point. This part of the . scheme is worth £3.5billion. The second, bigger, part – available . from next January – will guarantee £130billion of mortgages on any . property, not just newbuild, worth up to £600,000. The scheme will be available for mortgages of between 80 per cent and 95 per cent of the home value. So for someone able to muster a 5 per . cent deposit, the Government would put in 15 per cent, to enable the . homebuyer to access an 80 per cent mortgage loan. If a borrower’s property is repossessed, the Government will bear a proportion of the losses, with the lender taking the rest. The Treasury says all major lenders have agreed to take part in the scheme. On top of this, the Chancellor . announced that more Funding for Lending cash may be made available to . the banks, which could also push rates down lower. Changes to the Bank of England’s . remit, meanwhile, could allow it to give guarantees to borrowers that . interest rates would be low for years to come. Last night Chief Secretary to the . Treasury Danny Alexander refused to say what would happen if property . prices collapse, though he admitted there were ‘risks’ with the scheme. ‘What we are doing is supporting . housebuilders to build more homes, support those hundreds of thousands . of people who can afford mortgage repayments to buy a home but not the . deposit,’ he said. Example: The proposed scheme is split into two separate streams, the first (above) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second (below) for everyone else . The scheme, which will run for three years, can only be extended if the Bank of England agrees. Ashley Hollinshead, of accountants . Deloitte, said: ‘This move is interesting as for the first time it . attacks every level of the housing ladder, from first-time buyers to . those moving in to a bigger family home. ‘The guarantee could prove extremely effective as it will provide banks with confidence that is desperately needed.’ David Hollingworth, of brokers London . & Country, said: ‘If you are looking to buy a house then there . really could not have been a bigger carrot waved by the Government.’ Changes: The government offered more backing for housebuilding, after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry . Sea change: Ministers believe cash-strapped second-steppers are holding up the housing market, and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on to the property ladder . In the last housing boom more than . four million mortgages were taken out every year – but this slumped to . little over a million last year. Latest figures from the Council of . Mortgage Lenders show that roughly two in every three loans taken out . are for borrowers who have a deposit of at least 25 per cent of the . value of their home. A typical three-year fixed rate for . someone with a 25 per cent deposit costs 2.59 per cent, giving monthly . repayments on a typical £150,000 loan of £680. But someone with a 5 per cent deposit . would have to pay a rate of 6.19 per cent and repayments of £984, . making this deal £3,684 more expensive over just one year. These steep costs are putting off . first time buyers and, increasingly, those already on the ladder who . want to move to a bigger property. A housing boom gives a huge boost to . the economy. Not only does it increase consumer confidence, but those . moving home add to the tax take by paying stamp duty, and spend on . removals firms, decorators, furniture and DIY materials. Immediately after the Budget, the share prices of developers soared by as much as 7 per cent. But a spokesman for Priced Out, which campaigns for more affordable . housing, said the scheme will ‘push house prices even higher and will . help create a bigger housing crisis in a few years’ time’. David Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: ‘If we don’t tackle . the fact we’re still not building enough homes, we’ll just create . another housing bubble that will continue to push house prices up and . out of reach of the majority.’ Can I buy a house using Help to Buy? If you have a 5% deposit and want to buy a new build home, you’ll be able to access the Help to Buy: equity loan scheme from 1 April 2013. If you want to buy a property which is either new build or an existing property, the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee will be available from January 2014. What if I don’t have a deposit – can I still get a mortgage? To access a Help to Buy product, buyers will need a minimum 5% deposit. Am I guaranteed to get a mortgage? Are there any criteria I need to meet? For both schemes, borrowers will need to meet appropriate tests to ensure they can pay back the mortgage, as well passing their chosen lender’s credit and affordability checks. How much can I borrow? Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and affordability checks, you’ll be able to use either Help to Buy scheme to purchase a property with a value up to £600,000. Can existing homeowners access the scheme? Yes. Both schemes are available to home movers as well as first-time-buyers, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria. Can I get an interest only mortgage using Help to Buy? Help to Buy is only available on capital repayment mortgages. Can I buy a property using Help to Buy and rent it out? Help to Buy will only be available on properties which are occupied by the individual or individuals taking out the mortgage. How do I go about accessing these schemes? Help to Buy: equity loan will be available from 1 April 2013. Buyers will be able to access this through participating housebuilders and HomeBuy agents. Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee will be available from January 2014. The Government will provide further details about the scheme later in the year. Will the Government be guaranteeing my mortgage payments for me? No. The Government will provide guarantees to lenders on a proportion of the mortgage. If a borrower’s property is repossessed, the Government will cover a proportion of the losses suffered by lenders.","Families with 5% deposit will get 20% extra from government .

"A bronze 'buckle' believed to be 1,400 years old had been unearthed in Alaska for the first time - and archeologists are mystified about how it got there. The artifact was found in sediment as they dug on a site where a 1,000-year-old Inupiat home was built. The two inch by one inch object - which seems to have been molded - appears to have been part of a harness. Mystery find: University of Coloardo researchers excavate the 1,000-year-old Inupiat Eskimo home at Cape Espenberg where the 'buckle' was discovered . How it got to Alaska is a mystery - although it is thought it may have been brought by Eskimos from East Asia around 1,400 years ago and passed down through the generations. 'The object appears to be older than the house we were excavating by at least a few hundred years,' research assistant John Hoffecker said. The 'buckle', found at the house near Cape Espenberg on Alaska's Seward Peninsula, has a rectangular bar connected to a broken circular ring. Buckle? This prehistoric bronze artifact was found at the site . Archaeologist Owen Mason, a University of Colorado Boulder research affiliate, said the discovery was made as six houses were excavated. The bronze artifact was found near the entryway to the house by University of California student Jeremy Foin, as he used a sifting screen. A copper needle was found at another Cape Espenberg house. Early Alaskans were known to hammer copper into tools but there is no known metal casting in Alaska, Mr Mason said. 'It would be incredibly significant if there were metallurgy in Alaska, but I just don't see that being here,' Mason said. The house site is within the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and the metal is likely to have been brought from Korea, China, Manchuria or southern Siberia. The researchers are looking for an East Asia expert to confer with on the bronze piece. Mason said it's not likely the bronze piece was washed ashore after being dropped by a Russian explorer or a whaler. 'That's totally unlikely, in fact nearly impossible, considering where it is,' he said. The excavated home was an inauspicious mound that was part of a marsh in a sand dune away from the current coast. Purdue University Assistant Professor H. Kory Cooper, prehistoric metallurgical expert, will study the bronze piece. Researchers recovered several thousand artifacts at Cape Espenberg, including harpoons used to kill seals, fishing spears and fishing lures.","The buckle may have been brought by Eskimons from East Asia around 1,500 years ago ."
"Apple has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its iWatch project, it has been claimed. It is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep, letting wearers track and analyse their every movement. Although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch, experts believe it could be released this year. Scroll down for video . The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Further . reports in September claimed Apple was struggling to make a number of . iWatch components, meaning the release date would be pushed back. 9to5Mac reported that Roy J.E.M. Raymann -- whose background includes working on wearables, sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined Apple from Philips Research. the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called HealthBook that will be built into the next version of its iOS software, allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect. The firm's iPhone 5S already has a movement tracking chip, called the M5, which is expected to be used in the iWatch. Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases. Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge. Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy. Casio, . for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of . watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to . recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch. This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise. Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8. All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011. The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.' These current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 Apple patent. The patent described a 'wearable device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap, patent image pictured. Its battery life could be extended, using a 'solar panel array', or 'a kinetic power source . Other watchmakers, including Casio, already use solar technology in their products. For example, the Casio G-Shock, pictured, can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch . 'An accessory device designed to be worn . on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power . generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the . application continued. Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 . detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of . an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. The . curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded . last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery . into future products. Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life. Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8 . Some analysts claimed the device was . rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating . Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. Whereas . Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much . about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version. Since . the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of . artists have created concept images of what it may look like. Many resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy . Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device. Hamilton . took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and . functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something . Apple would actually produce.' The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen. Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch . Samsung beat Apple to the smartwatch market when it released its Android-powered Galaxy Gear, pictured, in September.

"How will the universe end - with a bang or with a whimper? According to this video it is very much the latter, but only after all life on Earth has long since disappeared. Host Joe Hanson (@jtotheizzoe) takes us on a journey from near future to far future, and ultimately shows us how the universe might come to an end. Scroll down for video . In a video called 'The Far Future of the Universe' host Joe Hanson discusses how Earth and ultimately the universe might end. He says that within 500,000 years we can expect a climate-altering large asteroid to hit our planet, while in a billion years all life will be gone . In the video called 'The Far Future of the Universe' he starts with the postulation that most people on Earth alive today won’t be around in 100 years. In a closed universe, gravity will halt the expansion and the universe contracts into a single point, known as the Big Crunch. In an open universe, as described in the video, the universe will continue to expand forever until all the stars go out, known as Heat Death. This concept is discussed brilliantly in Isaac Asimov’s short story ‘The Last Question.’ Finally, in a flat universe, the cosmos continues to expand  forever but at a decreasing rate, ultimately reaching the same fate as an open universe. In 100,000 years the position of Earth in the Milky Way will have changed to such a degree that the constellations will look completely different in the night sky. Any time in the next 500,000 years, meanwhile, we can expect Earth to be hit by an asteroid large enough to significantly alter our climate. In 600 million years photosynthesis becomes impossible as too much carbon dioxide gets trapped in Earth's crust. A billion years from today all multicellular life, including us, will be eradicated as the sun boils our oceans and destroys our greenery according to Hanson. ‘We wouldn’t want to be around for what comes next anyway,’ he jokes. In 600 million years the sun will have caused so much carbon dioxide . to be trapped in Earth's crust that photosynthesis will cease says Hanson, leading to all . multicellular life being eradicated. By the billion-year mark, all . oceans and life will have disappeared from the surface of Earth, leaving . it looking somewhat like Mars . In four billion years our Milky Way will collide with the Andromeda galaxy but, owing to the huge spaces between stars, it is unlikely many collisions will occur. In fact, it's possible that only six out of a total of a trillion stars will hit each other . At the four billion year mark, our Milky Way galaxy collides with the Andromeda galaxy but, although they will interact, most of the galaxies are empty space. This means that only about six out of a trillion stars might actually collide. In 7.9 billion years, when our sun runs out of gas, it starts to expand and consumers the inner planets Mercury and Venus before deflating into a white dwarf 1.6 billion years later. About 150 billion years later, changes on the scale of the universe start to take place. As the universe expands, we would lose sight of all galaxies from Earth if we were still around as they are too distant for their late to reach us. At the trillion-year mark, stars stop forming, and 110 trillion years all of the stars will have exhausted their energy and flickered out. ‘This is where the sky goes dark,’ says Hanson. In 7.9 . billion years, when our sun runs out of gas, it starts to expand and . consumers the inner planets Mercury and Venus before deflating into a . white dwarf 1.6 billion years later . In 110 trillion years all stars will have died out while in a quadrillion years our planet, now a lifeless hunk of rock, will fall into what is left of the sun (now a black dwarf) as its orbit decays . Ultimately the universe will continue to expand until everything in it is dead. All matter will be so spread out than, in essence, nothing will remain and the cosmos will be completely empty, says Hanson . One quadrillion years from now, what remains of planet Earth is pulled into the black dwarf that is now the sun as its orbit decays. Further ahead from this point, however, seems to be a bleak future for the universe. ‘Anything that remains will be stretched so far apart that it really doesn’t, and isn’t, matter at all,’ says Hanson in the video. ‘After that the universe is basically empty.’ This is, of course, just one theory for the end of the universe. Others include the universe ending in a ‘Big Crunch’ that in turn leads to another Big Bang. Whatever the case, however, our Earth will be long gone before the universe has even begun to edge towards its conclusion.","Video called 'The Far Future of the Universe' looks ahead trillions of years .

"Raheem Sterling is ready to play for England Under 21s in next summer's European Championship. And the Liverpool wonderkid could be joined by Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who's confirmed he is open to being included in Gareth Southgate's squad for the tournament in the Czech Republic. Sterling's decision to inform senior manager Roy Hodgson that he was suffering of leg weariness ahead of last Sunday's clash in Estonia has divided opinion this week - with some even questioning the youngster's commitment to England. Raheem Sterling (above) came off the bench for England against Estonia last week after saying he was tired . Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) want to play for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21s next year . Sterling faced criticism for telling Roy Hodgson (left) he was fatigued before England's match against Estonia . But Sportsmail understands Sterling, provided an agreement between Liverpool and the FA is reached, will show he is fully committed to England by sacrificing his summer break should Southgate select the Liverpool star. Sterling feels the prospect of tournament football can aid his football development. Southgate's men booked their place in the tournament, which kicks off on June 17, with a play-off win over Croatia earlier this week. Sportsmail has led calls for Southgate to pick the strongest possible squad available to him, meaning a number of players who have established themselves in England's senior set-up taking a step down to Under 21 level for the tournament. The likes of Chamberlain, Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones all qualify for the Under 21s - as do Ross Barkley, Calum Chambers, John Stones and Luke Shaw, who all have full international caps. Sterling replaces Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson in the 64th minute for England against Estonia . Sterling responded to criticism via Instagram (above) with the message: 'Be yourself don't please anyone' Sterling has been in superb form for Liverpool this season, scoring three times already . Chamberlain has become the first to publicly reveal he will play for the Under 21s this summer, if asked. Speaking ahead of his appearance on The Clare Balding Show on BT Sport 1 on Thursday night, the Arsenal star said: 'Would I play for the Under 21s this summer if asked? Yes, you’d never turn your nose up at something like that. 'But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament. 'So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide if he wants. There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide. 'I don’t know the dates. When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth might not even want me. 'It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.' Sportsmail have led the calls for Southgate (above) to have every player available for next summer . Luke Shaw (right) dropped into the England Under 21s for their qualifying play-off wins over Croatia . Gareth Southgate could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the Under 21 European Championships next year: . Raheem Sterling, Liverpool . Jack Wilshere, Arsenal . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal . Calum Chambers, Arsenal . Luke Shaw, Manchester United . Phil Jones, Manchester United . John Stones, Everton . Ross Barkley, Everton . The clamour for England's eligible senior players to feature in the next year's tournament was reinforced by Nigel Pearson and Stuart Pearce - who have both worked for the Under 21s - on Thursday. Nottingham Forest manager Pearce, a former Under 21 boss, said: 'If you want a successful international side, you’re going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments, which I’ve said time and time again. 'I'm not going to change my tune now. The bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they’re age appropriate and available in my opinion and that doesn’t change.' Leicester boss Pearson, who worked as Pearce's assistant in the Under 21 set-up in 2007, added: 'I don't think there is a debate. We have it completely the wrong way round. The question that needs to be asked is whether the Football Association invokes the rule it could do. 'Every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant. That stems from the fact the FA don't have the clout other federations have. Clubs basically run football in this country. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (above) has insisted Southgate should be able to pick any eligible player . 'They can call them up, every other country does. I'm stating what the facts are. I've worked for the FA and it's very frustrating when you can't get your best players.' The prospect of established senior international's playing for the Under 21s next summer will not please everyone, though. Managers will be eager for their young stars, especially those who were part of the World Cup squad earlier this year, to have maximum time off ahead of next season. It is likely any decision that will see full internationals take a step back to Under 21s will only come after lengthy discussions with clubs. Jack Wilshere (above) and Calum Chambers are also eligible from Arsenal to play in the tournament . But Arsene Wenger (above) has said publicly he is not happy with the idea of them playing next summer . And Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who could see three of his senior players named in Southgate's squad, says he would prefer for Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere and Chambers to miss the tournament. 'You know my thinking on this, once a guy has moved up to the full national team, you put him down (again to the Under 21s) he is never good,' insisted Wenger. 'Apart from on the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it is better a guy has a good rest during the summer. 'But most of the time, when they move down, they are not completely at their quality.' VIDEO Sterling rest row rumbles on .","Raheem Sterling proves commitment to England by asking to be included .

"More than £16,000 has been spent by British diplomats this year on cigars, it has been reported. Claims that £16,137 spent on cigars in 2014 is said to be part of £407,797 spent by the Foreign Office on entertaining. The figures are thought to have come to light as part of a review by the Labour party, which is closely monitoring Government spending. It has emerged that more than £16,000 has been spent by diplomats on cigars in 2014 (file picture) According to the Sun, diplomats have also spent nearly £3,000 on flowers this year, and £257,000 on restaurant bills from embassies worldwide. In addition they also report that more than £45,000 has been spent on alcohol and more than £18,000 on fast food. It also emerged that over £1,000 was spent at O'Reilly's bar in Fiji and £1,400 went on a dinner at the East India Club in central London. Other cash is said to have gone to music stores, bakeries, confectionery stores and art galleries. Last year, it was reported that British embassies and consulates around the world blew £8.8million on hospitality, allowing ambassadors to enjoy fine wines, good food and lavish parties at taxpayers' expense. It has emerged that the Foreign Office spent £1,400 on a dinner at the East India Club in central London, pictured . A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said they were looking into where the money was spent. He added: 'This was spending in an all-purpose diplomatic department store. We are looking into specific spending lines, but we are confident that none or very little of this spending was on cigars. 'The store description does not refer to the goods actually bought – it’s simply how the store describes itself to the card billing company. 'All our spending is rigorously scrutinised to ensure it is appropriate and provides value for money for the taxpayer, with GPC cards offering better value-for-money than other forms of payment. Overall spend on goods and services is going down.'","Figures show diplomats have spent £16,137 on cigars so far this year .

Dawson told her friend Nadia 'Dat guy frm d mosque dat insulted niqab' and another message said 'I'm gonu beat dat man up' referring to Mr Yusuf, the court heard. Mr Yusuf had taken three Portuguese tourists to view the inside of the mosque. Two members of the party were women who had not covered their heads and Dawson took offence, it was said. Six days later Dawson went to Mr Yusuf's office and demanded to know why he had allowed non-Muslims into the mosque. She was wearing a niqab and the court heard that she became offended when Mr Yusuf asked why she was hiding when he was speaking to her. She then ran off. She was so upset with Mr Yusuf that and returned to the mosque on 23 June with her brother Matthias Dawson, 32, the court heard. Decision: The Muslim woman has been told she will have to lift her veil if she wants to give evidence . CCTV footage played at the trial shows the two defendants entering the mosque together at around 8.45pm and Dawson entering My Yusuf's office alone. Allegations: Dawson allegedly threatened Daudi Yusuf, the caretaker of the Finsbury Park Mosque (pictured), because he let tourists inside . Moments later, Matthias Dawson followed her in to the office and the pair leave at around 8:49pm heading in different directions. This week Miss Dawson became the first defendant to wear the covering at court after a judge ruled ‘freedom of religious expression’ should be recognised. District Judge Peter Murphy ruled: ‘The courts must respect and protect religious rights as far as that can possibly be done. ‘But in my view, it is necessary to the working of the crown court in a democratic society for the court, not the defendant to control the conduct of judicial proceedings.’ Dawson argued that forcing her to remove the veil to give evidence violated her right to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights. But Judge Murphy rejected the application, saying that jurors being unable to see her was contrary to the principle of open justice which overrides religious belief. He invited the defendant to remove the garment, but after a brief adjournment Dawson returned to court still wearing her niqab. Judge Murphy told jurors: ‘I am aware . some people have certain feelings about it [the niqab], but if you have . any feelings you must put them aside completely...  She is perfectly . entitled in this country to dress as she wishes.’ Dawson, . of Hackney, east London, and her brother Matthias Dawson, of Sydenham, . south-east London, deny a single charge of witness intimidation. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Rebekah Dawson, 22, is on trial charged with threatening a caretaker .

"He is the smiling chief executioner who dares to bare his face in grotesque videos of himself executing prisoners. Referred to as the 'Desert Lion' by his supporters, Shakir Wahiyib  is the public face of the army threatening to destroy Iraq and is the chief executioner of the ISIS terror group. Unlike many other commanders in the Islamist militant organisation, he appears on camera without covering his face. Now it is claimed he revels in being a Jihadist poster boy - and has even attracted female admirers from across the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Shakir Wahiyib, centre, is unusual in the ISIS army that he will appear on camera without covering his face . Little is known about Wahiyib, however, his tribal surname – Fahdawi – suggests he is from the Anbar-based Albu Fahd tribe, known to US forces as one of the ‘sinister six’ that first allied with al-Qaeda after Saddam Hussein's fall. Wahiyib, who is thought to be in his late-20s, first gained notoriety through a chilling video which surfaced on jihadist websites last summer, showing him and his gang executing three Syrian lorry drivers who had been driving through ISIS territory in Anbar. But in other pictures he is seen accepting flowers from a child, gently holding a bird of prey, and staring contemplatively into the middle distance while brandishing a rocket-propelled grenade. Wahiyib's men have made significant gains in northern Iraq and are now marching on the capital Baghdad. According to the Telegraph, Armoured convoys containing U.S.-trained soldiers – who mysteriously melted away in earlier confrontations – stormed towards the town of Balad, some 50 miles outside of the capital Baghdad. The soldiers told of a gruelling fight with  ‘crazy, ruthless’ militants who were determined to hold their recent gains even at the cost of their lives. Over the past week ISIS made dramatic gains in the Sunni heartland north of Baghdad after overrunning Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul on Tuesday. Wahiyib can often be seen posing with machine guns or rocket-propelled grenades when appearing on his videos which are spread over the internet . Soldiers and policemen melted away in the face of the lightning advance, and thousands have fled to the self-ruled Kurdish region in northern Iraq - prompting condemnation and threats of harsh punishment from senior politicians. The collapse this week started at the top with the senior-most commanders abandoning their positions early on Tuesday morning as black-clad Isis fighters swept into the country's second city of Mosul. After they seized Falluja and other areas of Anbar late last year, Iraqi medical sources say some 6,000 soldiers died there. Iraq-based foreign diplomats say 12,000 deserted their posts. Wahiyib can often be seen posing with machine guns or rocket-propelled grenades when appearing on his videos which are spread over the internet . The ISIS chief executioner, who was born in 1971 in Baghdad, is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician . Mosul's defenders held up well for three days until late Monday evening, but over the next few hours the force imploded, with the senior commander for all of Nineveh province, Mahdi Garawi, fleeing. The commander of Iraq's ground forces, General Ali Ghaidan, and the vice chief of army staff, Lieutenant General Abboud Qanbar, also abandoned their posts, according to an Iraqi official and a Western security expert. A former U.S. official in Iraq said poor treatment of rank-and-file soldiers by their superiors contributed to mass desertions. Wahiyib's group, Isis, is the centre of power is Raqqa, a city in northern Syria, which is being run under the regime's oppressive and violent code. 'These guys, these units are demoralized,' the former official said. 'They are underpaid and ripped off constantly by their commanding officers, who steal their allowances and use their commands as a way to build a personal nest egg.' Apart from a few standout units, such as special forces who have borne the brunt of the fighting, 'it's a hollow army,' the former official said. Colonel Yassin Dwaij, a senior police in Iraq's western Anbar province, where officials put a $50,000 bounty on his head, described him as 'dangerous and cunning.’ In February, the leader of al-Qaeda issued a statement dissociating itself from Isis, which it accused of 'forbidden bloodshed' directed at fellow fighters. ISIS has so far attacked Mosul, Baiji, Tikrit, Samarra and are now heading to Baghdad . Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's chief, cut ties after Isis attempted to bolster its strength by merging with other rebels in Syria. He said: 'We weren't informed about its creation, nor counselled. Nor are we satisfied with it: rather we ordered it to stop... Nor is al–Qaeda responsible for its actions and behaviour.' The organisation is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a U.S. bounty of $10million on his head, second only to al-Zawahiri. The ISIS leader, who was born in 1971 in Baghdad, is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician. ISIS rebels execute a civilian and film the event before broadcasting it on the internet . Colonel Yassin Dwaij, a senior police in Iraq's western Anbar province, where officials put a $50,000 bounty on his head, describes him as 'dangerous and cunning' Baghdadi, who has a degree in Islamic studies, apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in Iraq soon after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. He was taken as a prisoner of the Americans in Camp Bucca between 2005 and 2007 - it was here that one of the only two photos know to be in existence was taken of him. He is known as 'The Ghost' to members of the pro-Assad Lebanese Shi-ite militia Hizballah. The secretive Baghdadi talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies, according to militants who worked with him in Iraq. He addresses his ISIS followers through audio recordings posted to the internet, rather than in public places. ISIS crucified this man they accused of being a supporter of the Syrian regime . Military sources have reported his death on numerous occasions in the past years, but the fighter always seems to reappear. This has led to speculation that al-Baghdadi is in fact a name used jointly by several commanders. Some estimates claim Isis group has in excess of 10,000 fighting men in its ranks. Many of its fighters are thought to be radicalised Western Muslims who have poured in from Europe and North American to join the fighting in Syria and elsewhere. The group, which controls large areas of land in Syria, is thought to be pouring resources and money from those areas into its burgeoning Iraqi campaign, which has seen it tear through the northern regions on the country. Its military progress, largely unhindered by Iraq's own security forces, have given it control over several highly valuable oil fields, which leaders will hope to exploit to strengthen their hand. The situation has alarmed officials in Turkey, who called an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors after 80 of its citizens were taken hostage by Isis. 'Turkey briefed the other allies on the situation in (the Iraqi city of) Mosul and the hostage-taking of Turkish citizens, including the consul general,' a NATO official said. He said the meeting was held for informational purposes and not under Article 4 of NATO's founding treaty, which permits a member of the 28-nation alliance to ask for consultations with other allies when it feels its security is threatened. Turks seized included 48 from the consulate in Mosul - including the consul-general and three children. Separately, 28 truck drivers who were delivering diesel to a power plant were captured on Monday. Meanwhile, Baghdad residents were stockpiling food, fuel and weaponry in anticipation of an attack on the capital in the coming days. Moments after this image was captured ISIS terrorists beheaded this man . Despite his high profile, little is known about the background of Wahiyib, who is referred to as the 'Desert Lion' by his supporters . Prime Minister Maliki has previously encouraged ordinary Iraqis to take up arms against the advancing soldiers of Isis, especially in light of claims that members of the police and military are intentionally defecting. Senior sources in the Iraqi government have said that they have a plan to take back Mosul, but were unclear on the details. Isis is pushing to expand its territory, which currently straddles the border between Syria and Iraq, and includes land extremely close to the Turkish border. The group's centre of power is Raqqa, a city in northern Syria, which is being run under the regime's oppressive and violent code. This video features an ISIS terrorist aiming a Kalashnikov AK-47 at a car on a video uploaded to YouTube . Raqqa was heavily contested throughout the Syrian conflict, and was held by several rebel groups until Isis threw out all other contenders in 2013. Recently Isis leaders imposed punitive rules on the city's Christian population, demanding that they pay a levy of gold for 'protection' else face being killed on the streets for their faith. Horrifying images have also emerged from the cities of crucifixions being used to punish men who attacked Isis fighters. Seven men were sentenced to death after a grenade was thrown at a soldier near a roundabout in Raqqa. The men, who were riding motorbikes, were then hunted down by Isis forces, according to a statement from the group. Two of the men were sentenced to die by crucifixion. One of the two was wrapped in a banner, which said: 'This man fought against Muslims and threw  a grenade in this place.'","Shakir Wahiyib appears on camera executing prisoners without disguise .

"A ship carrying the bodies of Chinese gold miners from New Zealand that sank more than 100 years ago has been found. S.S. Ventnor was discovered near Whangarei, off the northern coast of New Zealand, in 2012 and renewed hopes that the 499 bodies of Chinese miners on-board would be returned home to their families. The ship was on its way back to China so the bodies could be buried back home in line with tradition, the New Zealand Herald reported. Unfortunately, it hit a reef just two days into its journey from Wellington in 1902. Scroll down for video . A school of fish swim past the ship's wreckage, which has been submerged for more than 100 years . Part of the ship's hull is visible in this photograph in 150m deep waters off the coast of New Zealand . Diver Sandy Varin examines the wreckage of the S.S. Ventnor during its discovery . The Chinese miners had been in New Zealand to see if they could get rich during the country's gold rush during the 1860s, which happened in areas such as Otago and the West Coast on the South Island. The find has also raised controversy among New Zealand's Chinese community who have accused the documentary crew who searched for the wreckage of disrespecting the remains of the dead. In photographs, schools of fish are seen swimming around the mast of the ship. To verify it was the S.S. Ventnor, documentary maker John Albert and his team recovered some artefacts from the wreckage. It was found about 20 kilometres west of Hokianga Harbour, in the North Island, in waters 150 metres deep. But the New Zealand Chinese Association say the community is 'outraged' the ship did not remained untouched, the New Zealand Herald reported. The association's Kirsten Wong said there was 'genuine dismay' in the early settler community because of the lack of respect for the 499 people's remains.

But a relative of one of the miners told 3News he was 'excited' to finally have answers. Choie Sew Hoy was 64 years old when he died a year before the ship made its final voyage. Choie's great-great-grandson said he was looking forward to fulfilling his father's dream of honouring his relative. 'It's important for the Chinese custom that your family tend to your ancestors' graves to ensure a good after life for them, but also the ancestors will look after the living descendants,' he said.","S.S.

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud could be disciplined by the Football Association after headbutting Queen Park Rangers' Nedum Onuoha during the Premier League clash at the Emirates Stadium. Giroud was shown a red card by Martin Atkinson after he appeared to move his head in the direction of his opponent during the 53rd minute. Straight dismissals in the Premier League usually carry an automatic three-match ban, however the incident could be investigated further by the FA. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud was sent off after clashing with QPR's Nedum Onuoha . The Frenchman makes his way off the pitch after being shown a red card by Martin Atkinson . Premier League official Atkinson shows Giroud a red card, while Mathieu Flamini reacts to the dismissal . Giroud will definitely miss his side's next three games against West Ham, Southampton and Hull. He has already missed a large chunk of the season due to an injury he picked up against Everton on August 23. The Arsenal striker's dismissal did not prove to be costly as the home side went on to win 2-1. Arsene Wenger said after the match that his fellow countryman's red card was 'deserved'. He said: ‘It was deserved. He did not control himself. It changed the dynamic of the game, we were in complete control up until that point. ‘I will be having a word with him. Olivier is a guy who stands up and takes responsibility when he has done wrong.’ Giroud moves his head in the direction of Onuoha which leads to his sending off . Tomas Rosicky, who made his first Premier League appearance since October 25, said: 'I think he knows what he has done. When I was substituted I went to the dressing room for a while and he knows he made a big mistake. He has to learn from it.' Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright, speaking on BT Sport, added: ‘I think Giroud will be very, very relieved. I don’t think QPR did enough until the end of the game to get a result. ‘I have looked at it from every angle and I cannot understand why  Giroud was so angry to hit out like that. ‘Arsene knows it has come at a time when Arsenal were quite comfortable and on top. So it was crucial for them to get a second goal.’ The Arsenal striker confronts Onuoha before deciding to headbutt the QPR defender .

The state of the creatures’ happiness and hunger levels were indicated by meters, which had to be monitored frequently. The early versions didn't have a pause option and owners had to press a button every 30 minutes to feed them, otherwise they would starve to death. Update: The new version launches in the UK in December 2014 and will feature short-range communication ability . This led to pupils the world over being distracted in class as they frantically tried to keep their Tamagotchi’s alive. It was a big enough problem for teachers in some schools that the toys were banned. The new version launches in the UK on Boxing Day this year and is available for pre-order from The Entertainer and Amazon.co.uk priced £24.99. It will feature a short-range communication function that will enable owners to ‘bump’ other Tamagotchi devices so their creatures can play together, send text messages, exchange gifts and even go on a date. Apparently, the more they 'bump' the more points and rewards will be earned, with the totals reflected in a 'best friend meter'. It also includes new characters, five games - and crucially for teachers - a pause function and on-off sound function. Addictive: The original Tamagotchi games were banned in some schools after children became distracted by their pets' need to be fed every 30 minutes . Bandai said: ‘Part fashion, part friendship, part community and all fun, the new Tamagotchi Friends combines the nurturing features and simple play pattern of the beloved handheld virtual pet, with exciting new entertainment that we believe will really resonate with Tamagotchi fans. ‘And now, with the new bump feature, similar to what’s found in today’s smartphones, these lovable, whimsical friends can connect with each other for massively increased levels of interaction.’ The Tamagotchi are actually aliens from the planet Tamagotchi. It’s said that they crash-landed on Earth and were placed in egg-shapped cases by The Professor and his assistant, Mikachu. The rest is hand-held history.","The new version - out in December - comes with an interactive 'bump' feature so the digital pets can play with each other .

"Ohio State's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out the name of a missing football player while a police poster seeking information on his disappearance appeared on the scoreboard. Kosta Karageorge was the last of 24 Ohio State players who were expected to play their final game at Ohio Stadium against rival Michigan. His family says he was last seen Wednesday, after suffering a concussion and texting his mother an apology for 'being an embarassment'. Friends, family and police fear the worst for the 22-year-old. The seventh-ranked Buckeyes went on to defeat archrival Michigan 42-28. Scroll down for video .

Missing: The mother of the missing Ohio State football player told police he texted her about his prior concussions the morning he disappeared . The seventh-ranked Buckeyes went on to defeat archrival Michigan 42-28. After the game, an emotional coach Urban Meyer addressed the missing player. 'Our prayers and thoughts are with him and his family and to have him return home safe,' Meyer said. 'He's got a great personality, one of the favorite people I've ever met — just an interesting guy and a big heart,' said starting defensive tackle Michael Bennett. 'We're hoping he comes back soon.' The stadium announcer said the entire university community was concerned about Karageorge and hoping for his safe return. Earlier in the day, around 200 volunteers swarmed the streets in search of the Ohio State football player. Karageorge's former wrestling coach Jeremiah Webber led a crowd of volunteers with flyers and maps of his last-known steps. 'I'm very scared for him,' he told The Columbus Dispatch. 'I'm worried. I'm trying to remain optimistic. We love him, and we want him home.'

A missing-person report filed with Columbus police Wednesday evening says defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his mother he was sorry if he was an embarrassment but concussions had his head messed up . Webber urged anyone that may have seen him to contact police. 'If you think you saw a 6'5', 250lb man, there aren't many out there. Chances are, it's him,' he said. His appeal came as a group of former Ohio State players tweeted their offer of a $1,000 cash reward for information that leads to Karageorge, who also goes by his middle name Alex. The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices. His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused. She said at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message that cited the concussions and said: 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment.' The team's physician insists the squad would not have let Karageorge play after injury or illness if he weren't ready. The player from Columbus was last seen at his apartment at around 2 a.m. Wednesday. Community effort: Former Ohio State players have offered a $1,000 cash reward to find the 6'5' player .

He has a history of concussions, including one a month ago, and might have become disoriented, she said. 'We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on,' she told the newspaper. She said after each concussion, he has followed trainers' instructions and received proper care, but 'his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed.' The team's physician, Dr Jim Borchers, said Friday that he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes. But, Boarches said, 'We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.'

"The extremist preacher accused of radicalising three young Welsh jihadis was exposed last night as a benefits-claiming hypocrite. Abu Waleed, 35, runs an online empire spouting anti-British bile and dreams of turning the country into an Islamist Nazi-style state. In one chilling video he revels in a fantasy in which non-Muslims are forced to shave their heads and wear a red belt around their necks – a chilling echo of Germany under Hitler. Scroll down for video . Abu Waleed, 35, runs an online empire spouting anti-British bile and dreams of turning the country into an Islamist Nazi-style state . Event: Abu Waleed, who lives in west London, dishes out burgers at a barbecue in Cardiff earlier this month . Waleed’s real name is Shahid Janjua and he lives in a council house in Hounslow, West London. A source close to his family confirmed he is jobless and lives on benefits he claims for himself, his wife and his three disabled children. The hate-mongering firebrand has even encouraged followers to cheat taxpayers out of income support and incapacity benefit. Bearded Waleed is a leading member of Need4Khilafah which was banned last week for inciting terrorism. He attended a barbecue in Cardiff earlier this month under the banner of the ISIS terror group, which is an Al Qaeda splinter group. Former students Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana, both 20, were seen promoting a group closely linked to Waleed outside a mosque in the city seven months ago. Former student Reyaad Khan was seen promoting a group closely linked to Waleed outside a mosque in the city seven months ago . They appeared in a glossy ISIS recruitment video this month which has thrown the spotlight on the corrosive effect of shadowy hate preachers like Waleed. In a newly-discovered series of films, Waleed outlines his vision of a Nazi-style, Islamic state in Britain. He dreams of the flag of Islam flying over Big Ben, calls for the Queen to wear a burka and brands the Duchess of Cambridge ‘a whore’. Waleed also calls for the ringing of church bells to be banned and says Christians should become second-class citizens who must submit to a chilling militant ideology. The videos were recovered by the Middle East Media Research Institute, an American anti-extremism monitoring group. In the most recent film, made in January, Waleed said: ‘The kaffir [non-believer], when he walks down the street, he has to wear a red belt around his neck, and he has to have his forehead shaved, and he has to wear two shoes that are different from one another.’ Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, also appeared in a glossy ISIS recruitment video this month which has thrown the spotlight on the corrosive effect of shadowy hate preachers like Waleed . In an earlier video, of a lecture delivered in April 2011, Waleed is even more inflammatory. He rants: ‘The nightmare on Downing Street, my dear brothers, is when the door of 10 Downing Street is kicked down by one muwahid [Muslim], and the  caliph [Islamic ruler] he walks in, and establishes the sharia.’ Waleed added that under a British sharia state, non-Muslims will pay a tax called jiziya for protection. He said that the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge will have to wear veils. Waleed’s home was searched by police in January and he remains under scrutiny. He is in Anjem Choudary’s inner circle and attended Finsbury Park mosque when it was in the grip of Abu Hamza and his henchmen. Waleed has also said that he was a student of the convicted hate preacher Abdullah El-Faisal. His mother, Nasreen, 57, has claimed he was ‘brainwashed’ by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed. In another video, Waleed mocked the Government for handing out benefits and encouraged his followers to cheat the system. He said: ‘We have a lot of money today from the income support and the incapacity benefit. Obviously when you have the incapacity benefit, you want to make sure you walk with a limp when you leave the house just in case there’s someone taking pictures.’ Top QC Lord Carlile, the Government’s former counter terrorism watchdog, said Waleed’s comments border on an incitement to religious hatred. The Lib Dem peer said: ‘The words he used are inflammatory, discriminatory, offensive and ludicrous. ‘The suggestion that a Christian should have his hair shaved and wear a red belt around  his neck reminds me of the  very worst views and actions of Adolf Hitler.’","Abu Waleed's real name is Shahid Janjua - a jobless benefits claimant .

"An extreme marathon runner may be forced to close her animal sanctuary after an airline charged her thousands of pounds to rebook her flight when she got trapped in Antarctica while fund-raising. Fiona Oakes, 44, had taken part in a 25-mile race in -20C blizzards - and set a world record - before she discovered her flight could not take off because of bad weather. She says that despite having paid Air France £5,700 for return flights to Chile, they charged her nearly £6,400 to rebook after she and her mother missed their connecting flight. Fiona Oakes, 44, who raises funds for her animal sanctuary by running marathons, says she may have to close it after Air France charged her to rebook her flights when she was snowed in at Antarctica . Despite losing her kneecap to cancer when she was younger, Ms Oakes is a record-beating athlete . Ms Oakes and her partner Martin Morgan, 49, run their Essex animal sanctuary entirely from donations . The amount she had to pay was double the sponsor money she had raised for her Essex sanctuary which is home to 400 horses, dogs and cats. Now Ms Oakes says the future of her Tower Hill sanctuary hangs in the balance as she no longer has any money to compete in any more fund-raising marathons and will not be able to feed the animals. Ms Oakes, who has run eight extreme marathons on seven continents in the past year, said: 'I’ve barely enough money to see out next month. 'I only raised around £3,000 from sponsorship and the new flights cost double that.  It’s outrageous. If I can’t find any more money soon I will have to close the doors which will devastate me as it’s all I have worked for. 'I can’t believe they would be so cruel and heartless. I only run the marathons for the animals.  It was one of the harshest things I’ve done and now it looks like it was all for nothing. 'Air France has no heart. They are literally taking food out of the mouths of desperate animals.' Ms Oakes says it costs her and her partner, Martin Morgan, 49, £10,000 a month to run the sanctuary, where they have 22 dogs, 53 horses, 82 pigs, 50 cats, 40 sheep, goats, three cows and assorted chicken, geese and ducks. Ms Oakes, who runs marathons to pay the sanctuary's bills, has even completed the Marathon des Sable, right . Ms Oakes, who lost her right kneecap to a cancerous tumour when she was a teenager and who was nominated for the Daily Mail Inspirational Women of the Year prize in 2012, turned to sponsored running to bring in money for her sanctuary. She won the Great North Run for her age category in 2010, has completed the notorious Marathon Des Sables desert race, and now has the world record for being the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent after completing the North Pole marathon, Atlantic city, Siberian, Atacama desert, Adelaide, Arctic and Antarctic marathons. In November she completed her fifth marathon in eleven weeks, becoming the fastest female to finish the Antarctic Ice Marathon in record time. But treacherous weather moved in, cutting the competitors off from the outside world, and they spent the next week stuck in tents on the ice. She said: 'It was really cold and scary as we never knew when we were getting off the ice.  No-one could rescue us as the weather was so bad.' The Tower Hill sanctuary is home to 22 dogs, 53 horses, 82 pigs, 50 cats, 40 sheep, three cows, goats and fowl . Her travel company contacted Air France to explain Ms Oakes' predicament, and she expected to be given discounted tickets because of the unusual and unavoidable situation. But to her astonishment they said they would sell her tickets for a replacement flight, for £6,400, to cover the difference in fares plus a penalty for changing her flight details. Ms Oakes had to hand over all her sponsorship cash and more to get home as she needed to return to the UK to care for her animals. She said: 'I have to travel business class to lie my knee out after running because I have no kneecap and a knee joint replacement. The pain is too much otherwise. 'I couldn’t believe they wanted everything I had made: all my sponsors' monies and more. It was daylight robbery. 'They had no compassion for what I had been through.' Since then the airline has offered her £1,200, but are refusing to refund the full amount. A spokesman for Air France said: 'We became aware of the situation after she contacted us in December. We then offered to waive extra charges applied to the booking as well as donation of £1,000 towards her charity. 'We are deeply sympathetic to the problems encountered by Mrs Oakes, but we did accept two bookings in business class in good faith. 'We responded in similar good faith after we heard about her particular case with a donation to her charity, but it is normal practice for the cost of any delays to be covered by a good insurance travel policy. 'We hope Mrs Oakes will accept our donation and continue to wish her well.'

"Almost a third of all children born in England and Wales now has at least one foreign-born parent,  figures reveal. In 2011, 224,943 babies had either one or both parents born outside the UK – 31 per cent of the total. This is a substantial rise on the figure in 2000, when just 21.2 per cent of babies had at least one non-British-born father or mother. International nation: Over 30 per cent of all children born in 2011 had at least one parent born outside of the UK . The statistics, obtained by Tory MP Nicholas Soames, show that some 131,288 children had two foreign-born parents – 18.1 per cent of the total number of births in 2011. A further 12.9 per cent – a total of 93,655 – had one parent who was born outside the UK. At the end of the year, immigration restrictions will be lifted on Romanians and Bulgarians – prompting concerns that the numbers will rise yet further. Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said the figures were ‘astonishing’. He added: ‘This is the clear result of Labour’s mass immigration policy which is changing the nature of our  society at a speed which is unacceptable to the public who of course were never consulted.’ The figures – obtained after a parliamentary question – show that 64.9 per cent of babies born in London in 2011 had either  one or two parents born outside the UK. Mixed capital: In London, 64.9 per cent of babies born in 2011 had either one or two parents born abroad . There were 27,403 births where one parent was foreign-born (20.6 per cent of the total), and 58,905 where both were born abroad (44.3 per cent). The next highest percentages were seen in the West Midlands, where 28.7 per cent had at least one foreign parent; the South East, 27.7 per cent; and the East of England, which covers counties to the north and east of the capital, 26.9 per cent. At the other end of the scale,  the figure in the North East was 13.1 per cent, and 14 per cent in Wales. In Scotland, it was 18.3 per cent. Shocking: The figures were obtained by Tory MP Nicholas Soames . David Green, from the centre-right think-tank Civitas, said: ‘The irresponsible actions of the last government have played havoc with public services, leading to serious harm especially in the NHS, and serious harm in the schools system. ‘Maternity units are in crisis, there are huge pressures on school places, and housing is under even more pressure that it otherwise would have been.’ A spokesman for the Office for National Statistics said that in 2000, the proportion of babies in England and Wales born to at least one foreign-born parent was 21.2 per cent. It is the first time the figures have been released on both  parents. The ONS usually only releases information on what proportion of mothers are foreign-born. Last October, it was revealed that in 2011, there were 808,000 births, comprised of 612,000 births to UK-born women  and 196,000 births to non-UK born women. This meant that 24 per cent of births in 2011 were to non-UK born women – an increase of two percentage points since 2007. The top five non-UK born mothers’ countries by number of births were Poland, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Not all births are necessarily to parents who live in Britain permanently, as some could be people who travel to the UK to take advantage of its free NHS. Last month, a leading surgeon, Professor Meirion Thomas, said the UK was becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as  people travel here simply to  give birth. Years of high immigration levels have put intolerable pressure on maternity units because the number of births has been  far higher than officials had  predicted. There is currently a shortage of more than 3,000 midwives in the NHS.","Nearly a third of children born in Britain today has a foreign-born parent .

"The schoolgirl whose skull was fractured in the Alps massacre also suffered a serious eye injury and may never be able to give a full account of what happened, it emerged yesterday. Hopes that French detectives could make an early breakthrough in the case have been dashed by the revelation that seven-year-old Zainab Al-Hilli is still too poorly to be questioned about her horrific ordeal. It comes as investigators yesterday admitted it could be at least a decade before the mystery of the Alpine murders is finally solved. Scroll down for latest video . Defeatist: French investigators said they are nowhere near finding the killers or establishing a motive for the Alpine shooting massacre which saw four people killed . Doctors treating the little girl at a . heavily-guarded hospital in Grenoble said she suffered brain injuries in . the attack in which she was pistol-whipped and shot in the shoulder. There are also fears for her sight. A police source said there was no indication as to the extent of the damage to her vision, but one eye was seriously damaged. Speaking a week after the atrocity, . the French prosecutor leading the murder inquiry yesterday admitted it . could be ‘two, three or ten years’ before the case is solved. The extent of Zainab’s injuries were . revealed as it emerged that the former RAF officer who stumbled on the . carnage while cycling in the Alps last Wednesday has returned to his . home in England. The terrified man, who is in his 50s, . is expected to return to France in the coming days to take part in a . reconstruction of his journey. In order not to jeopardise his safety, . the Mail has decided not to identify the man, a potential key witness . who was believed to be at a safe address protected by British police . last night. Zainab’s father, British engineer Saad . Al-Hilli, 50, mother Ikbal, 47, and maternal grandmother Suhaila . Al-Allaf, 74, were shot dead alongside Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old . French cyclist. Each was shot twice in the head. The girl was found by the ex-RAF man . staggering around her family’s BMW estate car which was sprayed with . bullets close to the village of Chevaline near Lake Annecy. Her sister Zeena escaped unhurt by hiding under her mother’s body in the car. Appalling violence: Doctors at the CHU hospital in Grenoble said Zainab may have permanently lost her sight after being pistol-whipped and shot in the shoulder . A police source said Zainab – who . lived with her family in Claygate, Surrey – suffered ‘multiple facial . injuries that caused two subdural hematomas and a fractured orbital . bone’. A subdural hematoma is a traumatic brain injury which can be life-threatening, while the orbital bone surrounds the eyes. French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said: . ‘She will, of course, be listened to very specifically, but her doctors . have got to be able to help her try  to get back to the best possible . health, and eventually hope she will express herself.’ He said she is a key witness – ‘the . only person alive who actually could have seen something’ – but warned . that she is very young and has been ‘very damaged’. Mr Mailluad also admitted that French . police are nowhere near finding the killers, let alone establishing a . motive for the attack. Asked when the mystery might be . solved, Mr Maillaud said: ‘We might have the answers in  two, three or . ten years – it’s a painstaking procedure.’ Referring to US crime fighting drama . CSI (Crime Scene Investigation), Mr Maillaud said ‘It’s not like the . American TV series where they solve everything in 45 minutes.’ Mr Maillaud, who will travel to the UK . today as part of the investigation, said 40 French officers were . working on the case which has led to a flurry of theories relating to . possible motives. But today he admitted that the ‘language barrier’ and diplomatic problems were also slowing the enquiry down. Suggesting inconsistencies in the . testament of the mystery British witness, Mr Maillaud said:  ‘We’ll need . to listen to the British cyclist again - to check his timings. He’ll . have to get back on his bike and re-do the journey.’ Horrifying details of the attack on Zainab emerged as police also revealed that those killed were ‘no ordinary tourists’. Briefings by detectives suggested that . at least one of the victims could have had links to those working in . international espionage or the criminal underworld . Investigation: Detectives are now searching the family's home in Claygate, Surrey (pictured on Monday) and have suggested that at least one of the victims had links to the criminal underworld . The revelations are not only further . evidence of the cruelty shown by the criminal responsible, but suggest . that Zainab will have very little to offer detectives when she . eventually gives an official witness statement. ‘She was beaten around the face with . great force, and then shot in the shoulder – the trauma was immense,’ said the source. ‘She’s already indicated that she remembers very little . about any of it.’ Brutal murders: The girl's father Saad al-Hilli, who was shot alongside his wife and mother-in-law, was a British aerospace engineer . Investigators are focusing on three specific areas – Mr Al-Hilli’s work, his family and his native Iraq. The ‘Iraq connection’ has been the . subject of intense speculation and Mr Maillaud said a ‘specialised’ team . was examining Mr Al-Hilli’s links to the country. He also said there could be a ‘great number of clues’ in Britain. As the only witnesses to the bloodbath, the girls would be an obvious target for those responsible for carrying it out. Discussing the attack in general . terms, another detective said: ‘Police quickly demonstrated that the . victims did not correspond to the profiles of ""normal tourists"" and they . were not assassinated in normal conditions.’ Referring to the gun used, the source . introduced the possibility of state security groups being involved, . saying: 'A 7.65mm is definitely an old-fashioned calibre but it can . still be used by some special forces.' Zainab's statement will take place . inside her hospital room on camera, according to a source at the CNEF . police centre at Gif-sur-Yvette, near Paris, where the officers . preparing to speak to her have been trained. ‘There will be no direct questions,' added the source. 'Everything will be left open-ended and general. This . means trying to stimulate the memory of a little girl whose life has . been shattered. ‘Pictures will be shown of the family . BMW at the murder scene. This is one of the only ways that Zainab can be . taken back to last Wednesday and the horrific events which unfolded.’ The French officers will be . accompanied by a translator and social workers, although there is . currently no indication that an Al-Hilli family member will be with . Zainab. Security remains extremely tight . around the Grenoble University Hospital, where Zainab is guarded by . around 12 police at all times. Vital evidence: Zainab will be questioned in her hospital room over what happened at the beauty spot in Chevaline, part of the French Alps . The victims' family said they were . 'heartbroken' by the 'shocking crime', adding they were 'touched by the . expressions of sympathy from people all over the world'. Meanwhile Ahmed Al-Saffar, the brother in law of Mrs Al-Allaf, described his family's heartache at the massacre. 'The victim's family and I are . heartbroken by this shocking crime and we have been touched by the . expressions of sympathy from people all over the world. 'The victim's family are of . Iraqi-Arabic origin. We are very grateful for the support provided by . the British, French and Iraqi authorities during this difficult time.

She said: 'A sufficiently credible . plan to solve the eurozone crisis will necessitate changes to treaties, . laws, and not least the German constitution. 'There will be wobbles and . uncertainty at every vote and stage of political implementation.' According the BBC's Robert Peston, the deal could involve a write-down of half of Greece's massive government debt. But Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos dismissed reports that he has discussed a scenario of an orderly default by Athens with International Monetary Fund Chief Christine Lagarde and European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet. 'We have reached a point where there are reports about what has been said in a closed door meeting with the participation of only Mrs Lagarde, Mr Trichet and myself,' he said in a statement. 'What is absolutely sure is that there hasn't been and couldn't have been any discussion about the so-called scenario of an orderly default.' However the International Monetary . Fund last night issued an extraordinary warning that it might not have . enough cash to stem the crisis engulfing the Eurozone, prompting fears . that Britain could be forced to find billions more to bail out . debt-stricken economies. Chancellor George Osborne has refused to put British funds on the line for a new EU rescue scheme but he would be unable to resist a call from the IMF to do more. Time for action: Chancellor George Osborne (left)  will be under pressure to help fund the new scheme, but his predecessor Alistair Darling (right)  says decisive action is needed . The dramatic development came as . France was forced to deny speculation that it is on the brink of having . to bail out its banking system. Emergency plans are being drawn up for a . £2.6trillion deal aimed at saving the euro by allowing Greece to default . on its massive debts. The funds would be used to create a . ‘firewall’ around the most indebted Eurozone countries, allow for an . ‘orderly’ Greek default on its towering debts, and bail out those . European banks most at risk. Traders saw a further fall in the price of gold today as the traditional safe haven in times of economic turmoil continued its surprise descent. The precious metal is down by more than 300 U.S. dollars per ounce in the last three weeks, from a record peak of 1921 U.S. dollars an ounce on September 6 to less than 1600 U.S. dollars today. Experts are at odds as to why gold and silver prices have fallen, with some citing a drop in global price pressures and others saying the commodity has been overbought. CME Group, the world's largest futures market, has also increased the minimum investment value to cover itself amid market uncertainty. The recent dive in economic confidence should inspire a flight to gold - as the metal tends to outperform other commodities in times of crisis and also acts as a hedge against inflation. Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said two of the pillars that supported investors' confidence in gold have been 'knocked away' - namely fears of a surge in inflation and a collapse in the U.S. dollar. He said: 'The 300 US dollar fall in the price of gold has caught most commentators by surprise - including us. 'Demand for gold as an inflation hedge has fallen as the global economy has slowed and other commodity prices have tumbled.' Former . Chancellor Alistair Darling warned yesterday that the world is facing a . bigger economic crisis than it did three years ago. ‘The Greek crisis has been allowed  to run on and on and on,’ Mr Darling said. ‘Only this weekend it appears the governments have realised it is only a matter of time before Greece defaults. ‘It is imperative the Eurozone . countries take action now and not let it drag on for the next few weeks . because the risk is it will bring down other countries with it.’ He added: ‘The situation today is more . serious than it was three years ago. There are lessons to be learnt and . they are not being learnt by those responsible at the moment.’ In . a bid to head off a wave of selling when stock markets re-open today, . France’s central bank insisted the country’s besieged lenders were . strong enough to withstand a Greek debt default. Bank of France governor . Christian Noyer described as ‘preposterous’ claims that French lenders . are facing a run on their deposits because of concerns over their . £36billion  exposure to Greece. And he rejected reports that the French government was planning to use taxpayers’ cash to shore up the beleaguered banks. Mr . Osborne has warned that Europe’s political elite have just six weeks to . tame the debt storm engulfing the  17-nation single currency – or risk . pitching the global economy back  into recession. Following . its meeting in Washington, the IMF warned that it could run out of cash . if contagion spreads beyond the crippled periphery of the Eurozone. Its . £248billion bailout fund may not be big enough if the global economy . plunges into the mire because of the debt crisis, according to IMF chief . Christine Lagarde. The . watchdog’s current emergency fund ‘looks comfortable today but pales in . comparison with the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries . and crisis bystanders’, Mrs Lagarde warned. Global . leaders are in a race against time to shore up  the Eurozone and . prevent a Greek default from triggering a full-blown financial meltdown. ‘We need a big bazooka,’ said one senior official at the IMF. World Bank chairman Bob Zoellick said: . ‘[There is] the looming danger that failure to take decisive action in . Europe and the United States may shake the entire global economy, . throwing developing countries off track – and they are today’s engine of . global growth.

"The White House repeatedly declined on Tuesday to offer legal justification for President Barack Obama's forthcoming executive order calling off deportations for certain classes of illegal immigrants. Repeating a statement from the president over the weekend, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that the executive branch would offer an explanation for its actions after Obama had made his announcement . Obama himself had suggested multiple times that he could not go around Congress to freeze deportations because the president is not a 'king'' or an 'emperor' - remarks his spokesman was reminded of today by ABC News' Jon Karl. The Obama administration official wouldn't say if Obama stood by that statement yet indicated in his response that since the president said that, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security had reviewed the law and come to the conclusion that there are unilateral actions the president can take. Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that the executive branch would offer an explanation for its unilateral immigration actions after President Barack Obama had made a formal announcement . He would not reveal the results of that review to reporters, fearing that it would tip them off to the contents of the president's upcoming declaration. According to reports, Obama's executive order, which could come as early as Friday, will cover roughly 5 million illegal immigrants who were either brought to the U.S. as children or have young children living in the U.S. The anticipated measures are seemingly outside the legal boundaries that President Obama, who is a constitutional lawyer by trade, set for himself in remarks on multiple occasions in the past. During a February 2013 Google Hangout an immigration activist asked him what authority he had to keep families from being 'broken apart' until Congress passed immigration reforms. Obama told him: 'This is something that I have struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is, is that I’m the president of the United States, I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.' In 2010 he explained at a Univision town hall, 'I am president, I am not king,' and therefore he could not personally issue a stay of deportation for 8 million immigrants who would be eligible to stay in the U.S. if comprehensive immigration reforms were enacted by Congress. 'I can’t do these things just by myself,' he said to the chagrin of immigration activists. In September of last year, Obama told then-Univision host Jose Diaz-Balart that he couldn't expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to the parents of illegal immigrants because that would fall into a gray area legally. 'If we start broadening that, then essentially I’ll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,' Obama said. 'So that’s not an option.' But that's exactly what the president is gearing up to do now, sources familiar with a 10-point plan Obama is considering told Fox News last week. He may also enlarge DACA to include illegal immigrants of any age who were under 16 when they were brought to the U.S. Currently the executive order requires them to have lived in the U.S. since June 2007 and be under be under the age of 31. The aggrandized rule would allegedly bump the cut-off date up to January 2010. President Obama is pictured here during a meeting with his national security and public health teams today at the White House. Seated to Obama's far left is Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, one of Obama's top immigration advisers. The White House said today that a review conducted by Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder found that Obama has the authority to make some changes to the immigration system . Earnest today refused to comment on the rumors and suggested that the president may not have even received DHS' recommendations for action yet. The president was so busy during his trip to Asia last week, Earnest said, that he didn't really have time to think about immigration reform. Grilled by Karl about what had changed since Obama asserted that the didn't have the authority to shield additional groups of illegal immigrants from mandatory removal proceedings, Earnest said that not only had the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security assured the president of his authority, the political climate had shifted. At the time Obama made those claims, comprehensive immigration reform was still being debated by Congress, Earnest explained. The Senate passed that legislation in 2013 but the House did not, he noted, and now there's little to no chance that Republicans in the lower chamber will take up immigration legislation in the near future, creating an opening for Obama to issue his own measures. Confronted with the argument that Republican leadership in the House was refusing to allow a vote on the president's preferred immigration reform legislation long before Obama's comments last fall, Earnest again pointed to the recent of the law by administration officials whose departments handle immigration. The dodge came after the president himself refused over the weekend to share the legal rationale for his actions. Obama was asked about the perceived flip-flop during a press conference in Brisbane, Australia on Sunday. The president claimed at that time that his 'position hasn’t changed' since his 2010 remarks. 'When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress,' he stated, referencing the Univision town hall. 'And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws.' Obama said the White House had been working with the Office of Legal Counsel to determine what he could in fact do and has been advised that it is within his administration's authority to take such actions such as 'reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can’t do everything.' 'And it’s on that basis that I’ll be making a decision about any executive actions that I might take,' Obama stated, before claiming as he has many times before that this entire debate would cease if Congress would 'pass a bill I can sign on this issue.' That law would should include a solution that 'solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels. 'Everybody knows they’re there, we’re not going to deport all of them,' he pointed out. 'We’d like to see them being able, out in the open, to pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law. 'Give me a bill that addresses those issues -- I’ll be the first one to sign it and, metaphorically, I’ll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take and we’ll toss them in the wastebasket, because we will now have a law that addresses these issues.' In reviewing Obama's previous remarks, the Washington Post 's fact-checking division ruled that the president had in fact changed his position on executive authority to act on immigration over the years, despite claiming that he hadn't. The misleading statement earned him a mild slap on the wrist and one of the publication's upside down Pinocchios.","Obama's spokesman  told reporters today the executive branch would offer an explanation after Obama's formal announcement .

"When President Barack Obama and his family took a six-day African vacation in 2013, the United States Secret Service spent more than $2.1 million to protect them, according to documents from inside the Department of Homeland Security. The costs included $953,788 for the security details' hotel accommodations, with the rest chalked up to actual security costs – and 'entertainment.' The total of $2,189,727 – separate from the whopping $8,104,224 in flight expenses – also included $11,525 spent on preparations for a safari side-trip in Tanzania that the White House later canceled. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Header diplomacy: Obama tried a power-generating soccer ball alongside Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete (L) during his visit to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania . Not cheap: Part of the eight-figure trip included a visit to a limestone quarry where prisoners would work at Robben Island outside Cape Town, South Africa -- the place where Nelson Mandela spent two decades as a prisoner . Tip of the spear: The presidential motorcade, shown in Pretoria, South Africa, is a tiny part of the Obamas' multimillion-dollar security overseas . The safari was scotched, in part, because the White House feared putting the first family on display, flanked by security forces brandishing high-powered rifles – protecting them from rampaging cheetahs instead of human threats. Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group famed for its FOIA requests and the grumble-inducing lawsuits they inspire in the federal government's executive branch, released the documents Thursday. DHS provided the documents more than 10 months after they were first requested on July 3, 2013. 'Everyone should be able to afford a $10 million trip once in a while, and at some point just throw $11,000 out the window because – oops, we changed our minds,' a Judicial Watch spokesperson told MailOnline exclusively. 'The problem is that the Obamas are not spending their own money. It is the taxpayers' money. And there is no end in sight to this brazen spending.' The Washington Post reported last year that in Africa, 100 Secret Service agents were on hand 'as ""post-standers"" – to man security checkpoints and borders around the president – in each of the first three cities he visits.' 'Sixty-five are needed to meet up with Obama in Dar es Salaam,' the Post added, working from a classified planning document. 'In addition, 80 to 100 additional agents will be flown in to work rotating shifts, with round-the-clock coverage, for Obama's and his family's security details.' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement that 'the Obamas clearly either do not understand the value of a dollar.' However, he added, they 'understand it all too well when someone else is picking up the tab.' 'Keep in mind,' Fitton said, 'that this outrageously lavish excursion came at the very same time that the president was shutting down White House tours and blaming it on the [2013 budget] sequester.' 'As one congressional critic noted at the time, the White House could have 1,350 weeks of tours for the cost of the Obama family’s trip to Africa.'

'We don't determine the cost of the president's security, just as President Bush didn't and President Clinton didn't,' Rhodes insisted. The Secret Service is going to do what they think is necessary to protect the president. That's going to come with its own costs.

"Food served in prisons is regulated more tightly than hospital meals, it was revealed today. And campaigners criticised the Government after research revealed a third of hospitals that claim they are fulfilling voluntary requirements are not actually meeting the criteria. The Campaign for Better Hospital Food renewed calls for ministers to introduce minimum standards for the quality of food served to patients, describing the current situation as an ‘affront’ to patients and their families. Failings: Campaigners said research revealed a third of hospitals which claim they are fulfilling voluntary requirements are not actually meeting the criteria (file picture) The call comes after the organisation found that one in three hospitals that claim they are hitting Government Buying Standards are not meeting one of the criteria. These standards are mandatory for food served in government departments and prisons but are voluntary for hospitals. Of 30 hospital trusts in England that said they were compliant with the standards, 12 did not meet the benchmark criteria for the amount of Fairtrade tea and coffee served to patients. The standards state that half of tea and coffee served should meet Fairtrade standards. Of the 30 trusts, including five mental health trusts that said they were compliant with Government Buying Standards, 12 did not meet the criteria, 13 did and five did not provide any information, the campaign found. Missing targets: Of 30 hospital trusts in England which said they were compliant with the standards, 12 did not meet the benchmark criteria for the amount of Fairtrade tea and coffee served to patients (file picture) A spokesman said that ministers have rejected calls to make the standards mandatory for patient meals, claiming that half of hospitals are already voluntarily adopting them. New inspection programme: Health Minister Dan Poulter said patients are 'best placed to decide what is good and what is not' ‘We've had enough of the Government using poor excuses and fiddled figures to justify why it won't introduce mandatory quality standards for patient meals,’ said Alex Jackson, co-ordinator of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food. ‘Their refusal to do this is appalling and inexplicable, and is an affront to thousands of hospital patients and to their families. ‘Ministers must be living on another planet if they think it's acceptable to set standards to improve meals served to prisoners but not to sick patients’. Dan Poulter, the Health Minister, said: ‘There are many fantastic examples of really good food across the NHS thanks to forward thinking and innovative staff. ‘But, we recognise that there is too much variation across the country - that is why we have brought in a new inspection programme - led by patients - to help raise standards. ‘We have also asked Dianne Jeffrey, chair of Age UK, to head up our food standards panel to look at how to improve standards of hospital food right across the NHS.’ Dr Poulter added: ‘We support the principle of food standards but do not think that legislation is the right way to proceed. ‘We believe that the best decisions on hospital food are those taken locally by chefs and catering managers. ‘Patients are the ones who consume hospital food and they are best placed to decide what is good and what is not.’","Third of hospitals claim to meet voluntary requirements but do not .

"President Obama accused Mitt Romney of 'writing off big chunks of the country' and rebuked his rival's claims that nearly half of all Americans believe they are 'victims' entitled to sponge off the government. One the Late Show with David Letterman, Obama added that anyone seeking the presidency ought to be for 'everyone, not just for some' and talked about the hard work of single mothers and auto workers. Obama quickly jumped on the opportunity to condemn his Republican rival's remarks on national TV as he visited New York for a glittering fundraiser hosted by A-list stars Beyoncé and Jay-Z. The President was responding to a secretly taped video of the Republican presidential nominee which showed Romney describing '47 per cent of the people' as Obama supporters who depend on government and believe they are victims.

'My expectation is that if you want to be president, you have to work for everyone, not just for some,' the president said on the talk show, which aired tonight. He added: 'What I think people want to be sure of . is you are not writing off big chunks of the country because the way our . democracy works.' It was Obama's first response to the Romney video, which roiled the Republican's campaign and put him on the defensive over his views about nearly half the nation. Friends in high places: Beyoncé and Jay-Z, pictured earlier this month, hosted an exclusive fundraiser for Obama . After his television appearance, Obama spoke at a fundraising reception hosted by the music power couple at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan. Tickets for the event cost $40,000 each, and the Obama campaign estimated that there were about 100 people in attendance. The President stood on a small riser addressing an audience of men in business suits and women in evening wear, including Beyoncé's DJ sister Solange, sitting on upholstered benches in the dimly-lit club. Beyoncé, named the world's most beautiful woman by People magazine this year, introduced the president and then sat with her husband, a hip-hop musician who has sold tens of millions of records, in the front row, looking up at Obama as he spoke. Obama joked about the success of his hostess, comparing her charisma to that of his wife Michelle. 'Jay knows what my life is like,' he said. 'We both have daughters and our wives are more popular than we are.' New York state is considered a safe win for Obama in the November 6 election, but the President reminded his listeners he is likely to face a barrage of negative ads in what remains a tight election. 'We've got people writing ten million-dollar checks just to see if they can beat me,' he said. 'The other side is full of passion and they are working very hard to beat us.' Obama spoke earlier to a reception . with approximately 200 people at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria hotel. Tickets for the event started at $12,500 per family.

Meanwhile Romney struggled to steady . his reeling White House campaign after a secretly recorded video showed . him dismissing Obama's supporters - almost half the country's voters - . as victims who are too dependent on government. In the footage, taken during a May . fundraiser and posted online on Monday, Romney said it is not his job . 'to worry about those people'. He was referring to what he called Obama's locked-in supporters who believe they are 'entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.'

'There are not a lot of people out . there who think they’re victims,' he said. 'There are not a lot of . people who think they’re entitled to something.' The president also said he did not know what Romney was even referring to with his '47 per cent reference.' He said that when he won office four years ago, 47 per cent was the amount of voters who went for his opponent, Republican Senator John McCain. '(Those people) didn’t vote for me . and what I said on election night was: ''Even though you didn’t vote for . me, I hear your voices, and I’m going to work as hard as I can to be . your president,''' Obama said. Obama, who, according to current . polling, has a slight edge over Romney, said the American people work . hard and just want politicians of both parties to work together to solve . problems. American dream: Obama, pictured left, said he never meets anyone who doesn't believe in the American dream . Controversy: Romney said his plan is to create jobs -- not government dependency -- for the '47 per cent' 'One thing I've learned as president,' Obama said, 'is that you represent the entire country.' In the Letterman interview, he said people understand that the presidential candidates will make mistakes on the campaign trail. Letterman reminded the president of his own slip up during the 2008 campaign, when audio from one of his own private fundraisers caught him saying that some residents of depressed rural areas get bitter and 'cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them'. But Obama noted that he immediately apologized for the statement, unlike Romney who has defended his comments, labeling the remarks 'inelegant' but reflective of his views.","President said his Republican rival was wrong and that half of Americans were not 'victims'

Anders Behring Breivik, 32, has the blond hair, blue eyes and strong features stereotypically associated with the group. However, according to Janne Kristiansen, the head of Norway's intelligence agency the PST, there is no way that Breivik's look was natural. 'You . do not have that Aryan look naturally in Norway,' she said. Aryan: Anders Behring Breivik had plastic surgery to get closer to the Nazi physical ideal . 'Hitler would have had him on posters. He has the perfect, . classic Aryan face. 'He must have had a facelift,' she added in an interview with The Sunday Times. This information fits with the . reminiscences of an old schoolfriend, who has recalled that Breivik . boasted of having had plastic surgery a decade ago, a time when he had . befriended 'a group of people obsessed with their bodies'. 'I remember we were at a party, and he . told me he had had his nose and chin operated on by a plastic surgeon in . America,' the friend told the Sunday Telegraph. The revelation comes at a time when the full extent of Breivik's British connections is coming clear as it emerges that he sourced some of his bomb-making equipment from the UK. An investigation into how Breivik acquired material to make the car bomb which killed eight people in Oslo has revealed that he used online auctioneer eBay to buy ingredients from all around the world, including Britain. Bizarre: Breivik says this red jumper is the only item of clothing he will wear when he goes out in public . Using the name 'andersbrei', Breivik bought a pound of sulphur from a supplier in north London, while the 'hazmat' suit he wore to mix chemicals was purchased from a Briton now living in the U.S. Andrew Christou, who sold Breivik the sulphur, said that when he realised his unwitting involvement in the attack, 'my shock and horror was multiplied 10-fold'. Breivik, who is believed to have considered targeting other high-profile sites in Norway such as a royal palace and the headquarters of the Labour party, has made bizarre demands about his time in prison and in court. He has requested not to be given halal meat and, having been refused permission to wear a military uniform, he says he will only wear a red Lacoste jumper during his public appearances. Norwegian investigators are currently going through the 1,500-page 'manifesto' which he posted online before attacking Oslo and the island of Utoya. Officials believe it may be deliberately cryptic in order to perpetuate Breivik's mysterious image. 'He wants it to be like a Da Vinci Code novel,' said one source. 'He has created a mystery and as long as that mystery is there his message will remain in the public domain.' Murder: This picture shows the bodies of those killed by Breivik on Utoya . Memorial: This week saw a 'Rose March' in Oslo to commemorate Breivik's victims . Breivik's links with the far-right . English Defence League have also become clearer, as it emerged that he . was a member of the Norwegian Defence League, an offshoot of the British . group. Lena Andreassen, a former leader of . the NDL, confirmed that Breivik had been a member of the group, which is . led by British football hooligans, but said: 'I kicked him out because . he had extremist views.' Meanwhile, a senior EDL member has come under attack for starting a debate on which 'liberal twits' deserved to be executed. Alan Lake, who claims to be the EDL's 'events director', ran an article on his extremist website predicting that Britain would 'start to fragment into Islamic enclaves', according to the Observer. Lake then encouraged his readers to suggest names of those who should be forced to live in those enclaves, 'and who we will execute if they sneak out.' He nominated David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Rowan Williams, but later removed the post.

"Gays and lesbians who adopt children are ‘recruiting’ them to their cause claims evangelist Franklin Graham in his latest outspoken remarks about homosexuality. Graham caused controversy last week when he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting children from gay 'propaganda' in a column in the March edition of Decision magazine. In an interview published on YouTube on Tuesday Graham said - rather inaccurately – that gays and lesbians can’t have children. Scroll down for video . Evangelist Franklin Graham has spoken out again against homosexuals and said that those that adopt children are trying to 'recruit' them to join their lifestyle . ‘Of course, gays and lesbians cannot have children,’ he told the Charlotte Observer. When it was pointed out that homosexual couples can adopt children, Graham responded: ‘They can recruit. You can adopt a child into a marriage, but you can also recruit children into your cause. 'I believe in protecting children from exploitation – all exploitations.’ Graham, who is the son of famous evangelical Christian evangelist Billy Graham, claimed he was only saying what his father would say if he were a younger man and in better health. ‘You talk about controversy – my father stood with Martin Luther King in the early 1960s,’ Graham said. Man of God: Franklin Graham thinks Putin is doing a far better job protecting people from the homosexual influence then that lax and 'shameful' views of Obama . ‘My father never worried about polls. I don’t care about them, either. And with the issues we are facing today – if my father were a younger man, he would be addressing and speaking out in the exact same way I’m speaking out on them.’ Billy Graham is bedridden at his Montreat home after taking ill following his 95th birthday party last November. 'He’s very, very weak,' said Graham. Franklin Graham has been accused by his critics of steering the Charlotte-based Billy Graham Evangelistic Association away from his father's later-in-life emphasis on a loving God towards a conservative political agenda. In his column in Decision magazine, Graham praises Putin as better than President Obama whose embrace of gay rights he said was 'shameful.' 'In my opinion, Putin is right on these issues,' Graham wrote. 'Obviously, he may be wrong about many things, but he has taken a stand to protect his nation's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda. 'Our president,' he continued, 'and his attorney general have turned their backs on God and His standards, and many in the Congress are following the administration's lead. This is shameful.' Generations: The elder evangelist Billy Graham (pictured here with son Franklin) once called communism a tool of Satan but softened in his later years . Putin was widely criticized by gay rights activists for persecuting homosexuals in his country in the days leading up to the Winter Olympics. Obama even included openly gay athletes in the U.S. delegation to Sochi in response. While Graham hedged his bets by noting that 'I am not endorsing President Putin,' he still praised his treatment of homosexuals as a deviant, outright dangerous group. 'Isn't it sad, though, that America's own morality has fallen so far that on this issues -- protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda -- Russia's standard is higher than our own?' Graham also took sides in the ongoing civil war in Syria, backing the macho Russian leader's interests as an ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 'Syria,  for all . its problems, at least has a constitution that guarantees equal . protection of citizens,' Graham wrote. 'Around the world, we have seen . that this is essential where Christians are a minority and are not . protected. …Christians in Syria know that if the radicals overthrow . Assad, there will be widespread persecution and wholesale slaughter of . Christians.' Hard heart: Putin has been criticized for denying homosexuals basic human rights . Graham's father, evangelist Billy Graham, once called communism a 'religion that is inspired, directed, and motivated by the Devil himself who has declared war against Almighty God.' However he softened his fire-and-brimstone critique in his later years. 'If I had it to do over again, I would avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics,' he wrote in his 1997 autobiography, 'Just As I am.' Franklin Graham's comments have even angered some religious leaders who note that some gay Russians have been beaten, stabbed, and even killed. 'It's really disturbing when a religious leader seems to endorse laws that lead to this kind of behavior,' Marianne Duddy-Burke, head of the gay Catholic group DignityUSA, to the Huffington Post. Franklin Graham hopes that his family's time in Russia long ago may have influenced a young Putin while the future president was an agent for the KGB in 1982. 'In fact, he was in charge . of monitoring foreigners in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) when my . father preached there in 1984,' Franklin Graham. 'If he was . eavesdropping on our meeting, which I hope he was, he heard the Gospel!' Video: 'Gays and lesbians can't have children,' says Franklin Graham .","'Gays and lesbians can't have children,' said Graham in his latest outburst .
He believes that allowed homosexuals to adopt is exploiting the children because they are 'recruited' to the lifestyle .

"The pregnant stepmother of a five-year-old boy who was found starved and covered in bruises after allegedly being locked under the stairs has lost custody of her six biological children. Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, appeared in a Houston court on Tuesday to try to bring her kids home but a judge handed them over to Child Protective Services and ordered her to have no contact with them. It came after she claimed to be unaware of the boy's horrific condition - which was captured in a series of disturbing images - because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently. WARNING: DISTURBING IMAGES BELOW . In court: Tammie Bleimeyer, pictured in court this week, has lost custody of her six biological children weeks after her stepson was found starved, bruised and living under the stairs . But Bleimeyer and her husband Bradley Bleimeyer, 24 - the boy's father - were charged with felony child endangerment after one of her teenage sons called cops on March 29 and said the young boy, Jordan Bleimeyer, had not been fed properly. Earlier this month, she claimed that she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer. Her . ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, . but took Jordan to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed . for divorce last month from her husband of two years. Tammie Bleimeyer previously told KHOU: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.' Abuse: Jordan Bleimeyer, left, was found extremely malnourished, leading to the arrest of his stepmom, right . Cruel: The 5-year-old boy claimed that he was given just a piece of bread and a cup of water a day . On the mend: A smiling Jordan is pictured in hospital after receiving gifts from strangers . However she doesn't necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition. The 33-year-old added: 'I don't know what caused him to . look like that. I don't know if it's a health issue or something else . like that. I don't want to be like everyone else and assume . the worse.' Arrest: The boy's father Bradley Bleimeyer has also been charged with child endangerment . Police . discovered a locked closet with . a mattress at the Bleimeyer home after being called following a . disturbance last month between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old . stepson. The little boy, who weighs just 29lb, told his mom and grandmother that he was padlocked in a closet under the stairs at the Texas home. He was given just a piece of bread and a cup of water or milk each day and fed drugs when visitors came to the house to keep him quiet. The child was taken to Texas Children's Hospital for treatment. His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder. His biological mother, Windy Hall, is now seeking custody of the boy, who is currently being cared for by members of her family. She was reunited with him after he was saved from the home. She told KHOU: 'It was the most . amazing thing. It was like giving birth again, it was amazing, he knew . who I was. I tried not to cry, I have to be strong for him.' She . said that her son has eaten spaghetti and a grilled cheese. But she . said that he constantly looks around him when he's eating like someone . is going to take the food away.

"A Palestinian lured an Israeli soldier . to a village in the West Bank and killed him with the intention of . trading the body for his jailed brother, Israel's intelligence agency claims. The Palestinian man was arrested and confessed to the killing, the Shin Bet intelligence agency have said. The soldier was reported missing yesterday and Israeli forces began looking for him. Loss: Israeli soldiers carry the body of a fellow soldier killed in the north of the occupied West Bank, near the town of Qalqilyam after Palestinian Nidal Ammar reportedly confessed to the killing and led them to the body . The search led the troops to Nidal Amar, a 42-year-old Palestinian from Beit Amin a village near the city of Qalqiliya in the northern West Bank. Amar told the Shin Bet that he had killed the soldier, who he knew because they had worked together at a restaurant in the coastal city of Bat Yam in central Israel, the agency said. According to Shin Bet, the Palestinian recounted how he had picked up the soldier in a taxi on Friday after convincing him to accept a ride. They claim that after talking the soldier into joining him, Amar took the Israeli to an open field, killed him and hid his body in a well. Israeli forces raided Amar's home early on Saturday based on intelligence information, and interrogated him and his brother. They claim Amar confessed to intending to trade the soldier's body for another brother, who has been in an Israeli jail since 2003 for his role in several terror attacks. Amar then led Israeli forces to where the body was hidden this afternoon and was arrested. It is sadly not the first case of Palestinians abducting Israeli soldiers, sometimes killing them afterward and the military has a long standing campaign warning soldiers not to accept rides from strangers. Conflict zone: Pictured on patrol Israeli troops on duty in the West Bank city of Hebron where deaths on both sides are a regular occurrence . It's still unknown how Amar convinced the soldier to join him on the ride Friday. The killing could deal a new blow to . U.S.-led Mideast peace efforts, which resumed in July after a nearly . five-year break in Israel-Palestinian talks. The . deaths of several Palestinians in Israeli arrest raids in the West Bank . intended to detain militants involved in attacks have further soured . the atmosphere between the two sides. In 2001 a Palestinian woman lured an Israeli teenage boy over the Internet to the West Bank where he was murdered by waiting Palestinian militants. The woman, Amna Muna, was released along with over a thousand other Palestinian prisoners in exchange for a single Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas-allied militants in 2011. The West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967.","Nidal Ammar, 42, has reportedly been arrested and confessed to the murder .

"Marine archaeologists say they have uncovered a wreck from one of Kublai Khan's 13th century Mongol invasion fleets just yards off the coast of Japan. Scientists are hoping to be able to recreate a complete Yuan Dynasty vessel after the discovery of a 36ft-long section of keel just below the seabed off Nagasaki. Japanese legend claims that two 'divine winds', known as The Kamikaze, destroyed both of Kublai Khan's vast invasion fleets with the loss of thousands of troops. Watery grave: Marine archaeologists have found a 36ft-long section of keel from Kublai Khan's Mongol invasion fleet which sank off the coast of Japan in a typhoon in the 13th century . Historic: Kublai Khan launched to attempts to invade Japan from Korea, but both fleets were ravaged by typhoons known as 'The Kamikaze' - or 'divine wind' Using ultrasound equipment, scientists found the well-preserved wreck 3ft below the seabed and it is the first from the period to have an intact hull. Yoshifumi Ikea, a professor of archaeology at Okinawa's University of the Ryukyus, said the keel section could help remodel the 60ft warship. He said: 'This discovery was of major importance for our research. 'We are planning to expand search efforts and find further information that can help us restore the whole ship. 'I believe we will be able to understand more about shipbuilding skills at the time as well as the actual situation of exchanges in East Asia.' Artefacts: Cannonballs and stone anchors are among thousands of items found around the shipwreck off the coast near Nagasaki . Doomed: Thousands of Mongol, Korean and Chinese troops drowned or were slaughtered by Japanese samurai after the failed invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281 . Empire: Scientists used ultrasound to find the shipwreck three feet below the sea bed, where it has remained remarkably well preserved . More than 4,000 artefacts, including ceramic shards, ballast bricks, cannonballs and stone anchors have been found around the wreck, CNN reported. The hull will not be immediately salvaged, but the site will be covered with netting to prevent damage. The Kamikaze - two powerful typhoons that struck seven years apart - halted the Mongol expansion in the Far East. Historians say both attempts by the Yuan Dynasty to invade Japan ended in disaster. Thwarted: Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271 after removing opposition in the south of China and the Mongol empire, in blue, spread from Europe to the China coast at its height . Invasion force: Both fleets contained tens of thousands of well-armed troops who had initial success against Japanese samurai, but the typhoons devastated them . Armada: 900 ships sailed to Japan in the first invasion, and two forces of 4,400 ships took part in the second failed invasion . The first, in 1274, saw a fleet of reportedly 900 ships land at Hakata Bay and troops made initial inroads into Japan with their superior weaponry. But as a storm arrived, the Yuan force was forced to retreat back to their ships after the Battle of Bun'ei and it worsened into a typhoon which destroyed much of the fleet overnight, forcing the rest to limp back to Korea. In 1281, two separate forces of 900 and 3,500 ships carrying nearly 150,000 troops attempted another invasion. Initially, the Korean, Chinese and Mongol troops captured the islands of Iki and Tsushima, but they were thwarted by improved seawall defences on the the Japanese mainland. Vision: Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, united China under his rule and also led invasions into Vietnam before his death at the impressive age of 78 . Kublai Khan was the fifth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1294 and the grandson of Genghis Kahn. His forces established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271, setting up a capital near what is now Beijing, and he became Emperor of China. By 1279, he had removed all resistance from the Southern Song Dynasty and became the first non-Chinese Emperor to conquer all of China. After the heavy defeats and the deaths of his wife and son, he became grossly overweight and suffered from gout and diabetes. He died on February 18, 1294, at the age of 78 having handed over control of the Yuan empire to his son. Among his achievements was the introduction of paper currency in the Yuan empire. He also staged invasions in the north of Vietnam. Marco Polo's life story includes mentions of Kublai Khan, after he met him as a teenager travelling with his father. He was also mentioned in the 1797 poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in which he refers to his theoretical idea of building a 'Pleasure Dome'. At the height of its power, the Mongol empire extended from Eastern Europe, through Russia, Persia and on into Asia to include Mongolia, China and down into Vietnam. A second typhoon then hit the Tsushima Straits, destroying around 80 per cent of the fleet and seeing thousands of Kublai Khan's troops drowned or slaughtered by samurai as they managed to make landfall. Kublai Khan is widely believed to have rushed to assemble his enormous fleets in under a year - particularly in the second invasion - forcing shipbuilders to use river boats that were not suitable for the sea. He is even thought to have vowed to carry out a third invasion before his death at the impressive age of 78. Invasion route: Both fleets set off from Korea with thousands of troops on board for the 110-mile journey between Masan and the Japan coast .","Japanese legend claims two 'divine winds', known as The Kamikaze, destroyed Mongol invasion fleets .

"Two police officers chased a severely autistic man in a car 'because it was funny' before one beat him in a racist-fuelled attack, a court heard. Police constables Christopher Pitts and Christopher Thomas were heard laughing as they drove after Faruk Ali, who was walking in the street in Luton. Pc Thomas described Mr Ali as a 'f***ing P***' before he got out of the car, ran after Mr Ali, who has the mental age of a small child, and beat him, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. The officer allegedly rugby tackled Mr Ali before throwing him into some bins and punching him in the face, as he desperately tried to get away. Mr Ali was left with cuts and bruises following the attack. Police officers Christopher Thomas (left) and Christopher Pitts are accused of chasing a severely autistic man because they thought it was funny, with Thomas also alleged to have punched the man in a racist attack . The pair then got back into their car and drove off when they were confronted by concerned family members. Both are accused of trying to cover up the motivation for the chase, claiming they were concerned for 33-year-old Mr Ali. They deny misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice. Pc Thomas is also charged with racially aggravated common assault and common assault, which he denies. David Richards, prosecuting, told the court: 'The case against them, which at first may seem extraordinary, is that they chased a vulnerable man for no proper reason whatsoever, that one of them assaulted him and that he did so in part because of racial hostility. 'Then those two accused deliberately mislead those they knew would hear about their conduct in the form of a complaint.' He said Mr Ali had the mental age of a three or four-year-old and was incapable of living on his own. The court heard Mr Ali had definite routines and would go to a Day Centre on a Monday and Tuesday. 'Every Thursday he helped to put the bins out,' said Mr Richards. Faruk Ali, who has the mental age of a three-year-old was left with cuts and bruises after the attack . 'He would get up early and put out the bins for his family and neighbours. He had done so for several years and the bin men would call him ""Superman""'. The jury was played a video recording from the officers' car taken at around 8.20am on February 20. The recording shows Mr Ali walking along the street at which point, it is alleged Thomas, 33, says 'F***ing P***.' The Vauxhall Vectra is then seen on the video turning round and Mr Ali is seen running down the street. Both officers are apparently heard laughing before stopping at one end of Whitby Road. Pc Thomas then got out as it was a one-way street and Pc Pitts, 39, drove round the other side. 'There was no reason at all for chasing Mr Ali,' said Mr Richards. 'Why they did so can only be discerned from what passed between them...and it seems to be nothing short of because it was funny, because it was entertaining.' One of Mr Ali's neighbours described seeing Pc Thomas 'rugby tackle' him before throwing him into some wheelie bins and punching him in the face. As Mr Ali tried to get into his house, Pc Thomas bundled him into the door and onto the ground inside and punched him again, said Mr Richards. Mr Ali cried for help, drawing his brother and sister to the scene along with other neighbours. With Pc Pitts now also at the house, the officers claimed they were concerned for Mr Ali as he was not wearing proper shoes and also said they thought he could be a burglar or have a knife. 'It had gone wrong for them and they were trying to justify their actions,' said Mr Richards. 'There was no grounds whatsoever to suspect Faruk of being a burglar or of carrying a knife.' Mr Ali's brother told the court how he appeared 'terrified' after the alleged attack. Dhobir Ali said Pc Thomas was acting 'aggressively and shouting' in the aftermath of the incident. He said he was surprised when the officer told him he thought his brother was a robber when he asked him what he was doing. Thomas (left) and Pitts are pictured arriving at an earlier hearing at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court . He told the court his brother had cuts on his face and chin following the incident. 'He was terrified,' Dhobir told the jury of eight women and four men. 'He looked very scared.' Mr Ali's brother said he asked the officer for his name but he refused to give it to him. As the two officers returned to their car there were heated exchanges between them and neighbours, with one accusing them of being racist. A neighbour said the confrontation continued in inside the hallway of the family home with Mr Ali shouting: 'Uma Uma' - Bengali for mum. On the floor in the hallway Thomas is alleged to have struck Mr Ali again. He ran to the back of the house, followed by the officer but was stopped by his sister who got in between them. PC Pitts left the car and also went to the house. When asked what they were doing they said Mr Ali may have been a burglar, or a robber and could have had a knife on him and stabbed someone. When they left ,the officers were followed into the street by family members who asked for their numbers. PC Pitts was recorded as saying: 'You have got to love it haven't you?' When one said he was going to complain, PC Thomas is heard to say: 'Make a complaint? Do what you want. What do you want a medal?' He was called a 'racist fool.' The two officers are on trial at Aylesbury Crown Court for perverting the course of justice and misconduct . After driving away from the scene, Pc Pitts said to his colleague: 'Welcome to Bury Park.' - a comment referring to the area of Luton they were in. Pc Thomas was then heard saying: 'F***ing doesn't interact with people, don't f***ing let him out,' which Mr Richards said was about Mr Ali. It is alleged the pair knew there would be a complaint and spoke to senior officers, saying they   were concerned for Mr Ali's welfare when they saw him in the street and followed when they saw him running away. 'They mislead their supervising officers because they knew very well they should not have chased Mr Ali that morning,' said Mr Richards. Thomas, from Welwyn Garden City, Herts., and Pitts, from Bedford, were part of an ANPR unit. Thomas had been part of the unit for three years and Pitts four at the time of the incident and were both thought of highly by their superiors, the court heard. The trial continues.

Earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to rule out sending troops further into Ukraine, saying he reserves the right to use 'all means' to protect Russian speakers in the country. Speaking for the first time since Russian troops effectively took control of the Crimean peninsula, Putin said if 'anarchy' erupts in eastern Ukraine, Moscow would have no hesitation in responding. The comments came during a press conference in which Putin denied Russian troops had besieged Ukrainians based in Crimea, saying it was simply pro-Russian 'self-defence' forces protecting citizens from the 'ultra nationalists' and 'anti-Semites' he said were patrolling streets in the country. During the news conference, Putin called the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych an 'anti-constitutional coup and armed seizure of power'. He insisted that Yanukovych was still the official president but admitted there appears to be little political future for him in Ukraine, going as far as to say he believes he would have been killed without Russia's 'humanitarian' assistance. Putin added that he felt the West had encouraged the anti-Yanukovych street protests that put the president's life at risk. The press conference came as Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base in Crimea fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back. About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance.

Ukraine's new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet EU leaders on Thursday ahead of an emergency summit the same day on the crisis in his country, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said. EU leaders 'will discuss situation in Ukraine with PM Yatsenyuk in Brussels Thursday prior to extraordinary summit,' Van Rompuy said on Twitter this morning. Earlier in the day, two Russian warships on their way to Crimea passed through Istanbul's Bosphorus straits. The Saratov and Yamal warships, which are usually based in the Mediterranean, were seen sailing unaccompanied through the Marmara Sea before entering the straits at around 7.30am local time. At the same time as the Russian warships headed towards the Crimea, a Ukrainian ship called 'Hetman Sahaidachny entered the straits at Canakkale in Turkey.

Valentyn Nalivaichenko said the mobile phones of lawmakers had been hit by the cyber attacks. The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move to protect millions of Russians living in the region, with Moscow's UN envoy adding that ousted president Viktor Yanukovych had asked the country to send troops across the border.

"A British nuclear power reactor was shut down for five months over fears of a Fukushima-style meltdown. One of two reactors at Dungeness power station on the Kent coast was closed by energy giant EDF last year after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event. The flood defences were reviewed in an official government report in response to the Fukushima disaster and they were found to ‘not be as robust as previously thought’. Worries: One of two reactors at Dungeness power station on the Kent coast was closed by energy giant EDF after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event . In 2011, an earthquake struck Japan, killing 20,000 people and resulting in a tsunami to crash over the Fukushima nuclear plant’s sea wall. EDF told the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) in December 2012 that it ‘no longer has confidence’ in its sea defences being able to defend against rare weather events such as the Japanese tsunami. One of the reactors at the power station, which generates enough power for about 750,000 homes, was shut down on May 22 in order to build a new barrier wall. It was reopened again in October. The new permanent wall around the site is expected to be finished by the end of the month. The defences were upgraded from protecting against a one-in-1,000 year weather event to one that occurs every 10,000 years. Damage: In 2011, an earthquake struck Japan, killing 20,000 people and resulting in a tsunami to crash over the Fukushima nuclear plant's sea wall . Billowing: Smoke is seen coming from the area of the No. 3 reactor of the Fukushima plant in March 2011 . An EDF spokesman said last night: ‘EDF Energy chose to take the reactor offline to further improve flooding defence at Dungeness B. The Dungeness A nuclear station started generating power in 1965, before it was joined by Dungeness B two decades later. Dungeness B is formed of two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985. They were set up more than a decade behind schedule and at four times the cost estimated to get them running. Dungeness B remains operational after the 2006 closure of Dungeness A, which was the world's oldest operating nuclear power station at the time. The site is protected from storm surges and coastal erosion by shingle extracted locally. A Dungeness C was considered in 2009 on a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations - but the Government later ruled it out, citing environmental reasons. 'Prior to this the site was deemed safe to operate and protected from events which would occur one in every 1,000 years by the nuclear safety regulator, the ONR. ‘We conservatively took the decision to take both reactors offline in order to undertake additional protection to cover extremely rare events; ones which might happen only one in 10,000 years. ‘Part of this work included building a flood defence wall around the site which is due to be completed this month. 'We are continuously updating and improving the plant to ensure it is operating safely. The recent weather has had no impact on operations at Dungeness B.’ Martin Pearson, station director at Dungeness B, said: ‘The recent adverse weather has had no impact on existing infrastructure and the power station has operated normally in the recent high tides and stormy weather.’ An ONR spokesman said: ‘We consider NGL to be making satisfactory progress in improving the Dungeness B flood defences, taking into account the challenges associated with the work and the need to ensure high confidence in the completed defences.’ Kyshtym (Soviet Union): September 1957 .

The explosion kills two people and 28 more die from acute radiation sickness directly after the blast. It is also thought that the disaster caused thousands of cancer deaths. Fukushima Daiichi (Japan): March 2011 . A magnitude-9.0 earthquake at sea causes a tsunami to damage four of six reactors at the nuclear power plant site. Fires are set off after cooling systems fail, but there is only a minimal risk to health. And here are three nuclear near-misses: . Kirtland Air Force Base (New Mexico): May 1957 . A cow was killed and residents of Albuquerque terrified when a B-36 aircraft transporting a nuclear bomb from Texas to New Mexico fell through the bomb bay doors from 1,700 feet and detonated, blasting a crater 12ft deep and 25ft across. Luckily the nuclear capsule had separated from the bomb and did not explode. Savannah River (Georgia): February 1958 . A B-47 carrying a nuclear bomb collided mid-air with an F-86 jet during a training flight. The device was jettisoned and fell into the river and has never been located.

"Boston's mourners were handed a stunning development Thursday with news that a secret intelligence assessment, issued just five days before the Boston Marathon bombings, specifically warned that the finish line area was an 'area of increased vulnerability' for terrorist bombers. The report, now eerie in its accuracy, raised alarms over fears that terrorists could execute 'small scale bombings' aimed at killing both marathon runners and spectators near the race's end point. Two officials read portions of the 18-page report to a reporter in the Los Angeles Times' Boston bureau, according to the paper. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told members of the House Homeland Security Committee that the FBI never shared information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev with his agency . Former U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman (L) said local law enforcement is the 'first line of defense' against terror plots, and criticized the feds for holding back information . The 'Joint Special Event Assessment' was issued on April 10, and concluded that there was 'no credible, specific information indicating an imminent threat' to anyone running or attending the race. That assessment, according to the LA Times, included a caution that 'The FBI has not identified any specific lone offender or extremist group who pose a threat to the Boston marathon.' But the organization that prepared it, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, is linked by its funding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - not to the Department of Justice, which is the FBI's parent organization. Questions remain about how much credible intelligence DHS had on the principal bombing suspect, the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, before he and his brother detonated two shrapnel-laden pressure-cooker bombs, killing three and injuring hundreds. Boston Marathon runners were devastated after two bombs exploded near the finish line on April 15. A report cited by the Los Angeles Times indicates that Boston terror-trackers considered the marathon's finish line a high-risk target . Flowers and teddy bears dominated an impromptu memorial site in Boston's Copley Square, near the site of the April 15 bombings. Tamerlan Tsarnaev (R) and his brother Dzokhar are the accused bombings. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police just days after the bombings . Russia's government gave the United States specific intelligence about Tsarnaev and his terrorist sympathies in 2011. And a high-ranking Saudi official has told MailOnline that his government warned the U.S. about Tsarnaev in 2012 after denying him an entry visa in December 2011, although DHS and the Saudi embassy in Washington have issued denials about that report. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told a congressional panel on Thursday morning that his department was never told about the Tsarnaev brothers. 'We would have liked to have known,' Davis testified in a House Homeland Security Committee hearing, but 'we were not aware of the two brothers. We were not aware of their activities.' Boston police, he said, weren't aware they existed until three days after the bombings. 'We didn't look at the brothers until after the shootout' that claimed Tamerlan's life, he said. Ten days after the Boston bombings, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced that the Tsarnaev brothers planned to bomb Times Square. Federal agencies did not share that information with New York City officials until long after the information could have made a difference . Anguish: First responders helped a screaming man into an ambulance - one of more than 200 who were injured in the bombings. Three others died, including an 8-year-old boy . 'We would certainly have looked at the information' if federal law enforcement had provided it, Davis testified. But the three officers he had assigned to Boston's Joint Terrorism Task Force said later that they were never in the loop. 'They tell me they received no word about that individual prior to the bombing,' Davis told the committee. In the hearing, New York Republican Rep. Peter King slammed federal law enforcement for failing to share information with authorities in Boston and New York, where the FBI was aware the Tsarnaev brothers intended to detonate more bombs in Times Square. 'The failure to share information is absolutely indefensible,' said King. Lieberman applauded the Boston police chief, but slammed the federal government for failing to share information with city and state authorities . Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, a former chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, testified that DHS and the FBI should share a broader variety of information with state and local law enforcement agencies, calling them 'your first line of defense.' Not sharing all the federal government's information with Boston police, he said, was 'a serious and aggravating omission.' He called that lapse 'one of the most significant and painful takeaway lessons' from the federal government's response to the bombings.","Finish line was 'area of increased vulnerability,' report read .

Mr Devereux moved to the Caribbean island, a favourite with British holidaymakers, in May this year. A police spokesman on the island, which is also a well known financial tax haven, said last night: 'The officer had been shore diving with a colleague when he got into difficulty and lost consciousness. 'His colleague brought him to the surface. Staff from Sunset House immediately assisted, brought him to shore and performed CPR. 'When the ambulance crew arrived they continued CPR while conveying the officer to the Cayman Islands Hospital in George Town. 'However, despite efforts of the dive staff and the paramedics he was pronounced dead on arrival. 'A family liaison officer has been appointed by the RCIPS and efforts are being made to contact his next of kin.' ‘He was a very dedicated officer and was involved in a lot of investigations,' said RCIPS Superintendent Kurt Walton.

"The elder Boston marathon Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been buried in a secret midnight service at an undisclosed location after a mystery benefactor came forward - ending weeks of controversy. According to federal officials the body was taken from the Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlor and entombed under cover of darkness outside of the city of Worcester, Massachusetts, where his remains have laid since last Friday. The burial location was approved by Ruslan Tsarni, the terror suspects outspoken uncle, who has been attempting to find a cemetery that would accept his nephew for burial. Scroll down for video . Tamerlan Tsarnaev has finally been buried at an undisclosed location outside of the city of Worcester, Massachusetts . 'As a result of our public appeal for help a courageous and compassionate individual came forward to provide the assistance needed to properly bury the deceased,' said Worcester police in a statement this morning. 'His body is no longer in the city of Worcester and is now entombed.' The body was finally buried one day after Worcester Police Chief Gary Gemme pleaded for help in burying Tsarnaev - who was killed in a firefight with police on April 19th in Watertown, just outside of Boston. 'There is a need to do the right thing,' said Gemme said. 'We are not barbarians. We bury the dead.' The statement did not say where his body now rests . Peter Stefan, the director of the funeral home had previously expressed his strong desire to find a proper burial site for Tsarnaev despite protests outside the funeral home and the refusal of Cambridge to take his body for burial.

Before today's announcement, a retired Vermont school teacher, Paul Keane had yesterday offered up his family's plot in Hamden, Connecticut. He intended the offer to be a tribute to his mother, who taught him to, 'love thine enemy.' Keane told reporters that he didn't withdraw the offer, even after he received hate-mail - but no one from Worcester contacted him. And the firm responsible for digging graves at the Mount Carmel Cemetery told the MailOnline that they have dug no fresh graves this week. And on Monday, the founder of the organization that built Colorado's largest mosque is offered to bury suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a Denver-area Muslim cemetery. Sheikh Abu-Omar Almubarac said he would pay for a traditional Muslim burial - no headstone, monument or casket - at a plot at a Muslim cemetery in Denver or Bennett. Almubarac refused to say which one out of concern for 'undue publicity.' He said he would bury Tsarnaev as long as his family can get the body to Denver. It is not known whether the family of Tsarnaev took him up on that offer.

Tsarnaev’s widow continues to face questions from federal authorities . and has hired a criminal lawyer with experience defending terrorism . cases. Katherine Russell added New York lawyer Joshua Dratel to her legal team, her attorney Amato DeLuca said Wednesday.

Providence-based DeLuca and Miriam Weizenbaum have been representing Russell, who is from Rhode Island. They specialize in civil cases such as personal injury law. An FBI spokeswoman wouldn’t comment when asked Wednesday whether Russell is cooperating. DeLuca has said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband and his brother in the deadly April 15 bombing. Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia and living in Massachusetts, are accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring about 260. Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb, was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Their mother has said the charges against them are lies. In Washington, the first in a series of hearings was planned Thursday to review government’s initial response to the bombing, what information authorities received about the brothers before the bombings and whether they handled it correctly. Sheikh Abu Omar Almubarac, a prominent member of the Denver-area Muslim community offered to bury Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a Denver-area cemetery on Tuesday . The hearing on Capitol Hill comes less than three weeks after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s arrest. The FBI and CIA separately received vague warnings from Russia’s government in 2011 that Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother were religious militants. Russell, Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s wife, had wanted his body turned over to his side of the family, which claimed it. Nineteen days after his death, cemeteries still refused to take his remains and government officials deflected questions about where he could be buried. On Wednesday, police in Worcester, west of Boston, pleaded for a resolution, saying they were spending tens of thousands of dollars to protect the funeral home where his body is being kept amid protests. 'We are not barbarians,' Police Chief Gary Gemme said. 'We bury the dead.' It is unknown if Katherine Russell, widow of Boston Marathon bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, (left), was at the burial - but Ruslan Tsarni (right) approved the site . An expert in U.S. burial law said the resistance to Tsarnaev’s burial is unprecedented in a country that has always found a way to put to rest its notorious killers, from Lee Harvey Oswald to Adam Lanza, who gunned down 20 children and six educators at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school last year. Peter Stefan, whose funeral home accepted Tsarnaev’s body last week, said Tuesday that none of the 120 offers of graves from the U.S. and Canada has worked out because officials in those cities and towns don’t want the body.","Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been buried in an undisclosed location outside the city of Worcester, Massachusetts .

Nasa's Cassini probe has been in orbit around Saturn since October 1997 and has previously managed to capture only a handful of blurred images of Earth as it travels around the ringed planet. Yet due to a rare solar eclipse scheduled to take place next month, the probe's cameras will be able to take a clear image of our planet without the sunlight causing damage to its sensitive equipment. Nasa's Cassini probe has been orbiting Saturn for almost nine years. It has previously taken photos of Earth, pictured in the top left-hand corner, but Nasa hopes a solar eclipse scheduled for July will mean the probe can take the clearest shot of the planet to date . The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched in October 1997. It was supposed to last four years but is still fully-functioning and orbiting the ringed planet. When Cassini was launched it orbited several planets, including Venus, Earth and Jupiter before getting a speed boost from the gravity of each planet that propelled it towards Saturn. It went by Venus in April 1998 and June 1999, Earth in August 1999 and Jupiter in December 2000. It regularly passes by the moons of Saturn collecting new data and sending these discoveries back on Earth. Cassini weighs nearly 12,600 pounds and has radioisotope thermoelectric generators (nuclear power) on board. It will also be the first time Nasa is telling . people exactly when the photo will be taken in the hope they will . want to be a part of the event. Cassini imaging team leader Carolyn Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado said: 'My sincere wish is that people the world over stop what they're doing at the time the Earth picture is taken to revel in the sheer wonder of simply being alive on a pale blue dot of a planet. 'And to appreciate the ever-widening perspective of ourselves and our world that we have gained from our interplanetary explorations.' Nasa has said the photo will be taken between 21.27pm and 21.42pm GMT (5:27pm and 5:42 p.m. EDT) on 19 July. However, anyone who takes part shouldn't get their hopes up about being seen from space. Earth is 898 million miles away from Saturn and will appear as a tiny bright dot next to Saturn and its rings. North America and part of the Atlantic Ocean will be pointing towards Saturn at the time the picture is taken. An artist's impression of what Cassini looks like as it orbits Saturn. When Cassini was launched in 1997 it orbited several planets, including Venus, Earth and Jupiter before getting a speed boost from the gravity of each planet that propelled it towards Saturn . This image, snapped in 1990, was the first ever photograph showing of our solar system. It was taken by Nasa's Voyager 1 ship and Earth can be seen as the small dot, highlighted by the arrow . Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California said: 'While Earth will be only about a pixel in size from Cassini’s vantage point 898 million miles away, the Cassini team is looking forward to giving the world a chance to see what their home looks like from Saturn.' With this advance notice, we hope you'll join us in waving at Saturn from Earth, so we can commemorate this special opportunity.' The Cassini team have chosen the 19 July because it will be able to take advantage of a rare total eclipse of the sun from Saturn. Another artist's impression shows Earth's proximity to Saturn. Earth is around 898 million miles away from the ringed planet and will appear as a single pixel in the image Nasa plans to take in July . The spacecraft's sensitive cameras can then turn toward Earth without suffering any damage from the sun's rays. 'Ever since we caught sight of the Earth among the rings of Saturn . in September 2006 in a mosaic that has become one of Cassini's most . beloved images, I have wanted to do it all over again, only better,' said Porco. 'And this time I wanted to turn the entire event into an . opportunity for everyone around the globe, at the same time, to savor . the uniqueness of our beautiful blue-ocean planet and the preciousness . of the life on it. 'It will be a day for all the world to celebrate.'","Nasa's Cassini probe has been orbiting Saturn for almost nine years .

"The former girlfriend of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev said he slapped her and beat her head against a car because she was wearing shorts. Nadine Ascencao, 25, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she and Tsarnaev split up after he became so abusive she called police. The couple dated for three years and she said he became increasingly religious during that time. Scroll down for video . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in a police mugshot, was arrested after attacking then-girlfriend Nadine Ascencao, right. She called police after he beat her head against a car for wearing shorts . Nadine Ascencao said she was shocked that Tsarnaev's younger brother got involved in the attack . Tsarnaev, 26, and brother Dzhokhar, 19, set off the bomb at the marathon on April 15 that killed three by-standers and injured more than 170 people. Tamerlan was killed in a stand-off with police four days later and his young brother is in police custody after being injured in the same shoot-out. Ms Ascencao told Inside Edition that Tsarnaev, a former amateur boxer, attacked her after she wore a tank top and shorts to a pool party. She said he screamed at her 'what are you wearing' and then became violent. She said: 'He literally grabbed my jaw and he was telling me ""you are not going to wear this, do you understand what I'm saying"" and he kept pushing my head until I hit the car and it hurt and that made me really upset and he just slapped me across the face. But that right there just made me so furious'. Watch the exclusive interview with Inside Edition here . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, died in a police shootout four days after setting off the bomb at the Boston Marathon and brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is in police custody . The interview with Deborah Norville was the first time Ascencao has spoken on camera . Ascencao, who dated Tamerlan for three years, says she now regrets not pressing charges . Ms Ascencao said she told she was going to dial 911 and he told her to 'go ahead'. She said in the interview with Inside Edition: 'The police officer goes up to him and . she said, ""did you hit her?"" 'He goes, ""I just gave her a little slap."" She goes ""excuse me what did you just do to her?"" ‘[He said] I just gave her a little slap. 'She said, ""turn around sir"" and just handcuffed him.' He was arrested on domestic assault and battery charges and the mugshots later emerged after he was identified as the suspect in the bomb attack. Tamerlan Tsarnaev went on to marry  Katherine Russell, pictured, who converted to Islam . Three people were killed and more than 170 people injured in the attack on the Boston Marathon . However, despite the violent outburst Ms Ascencao did not press charges, which she says she now regrets. Ms Ascencao said: 'At that time I was young and really didn't think it through'. In previous interviews, Ms Ascencao said her boyfriend, who she met at high school, became increasingly religious and was angered if she wore Western clothes. He later went on to marry Katherine Russell, who converted to Islam.","Nadine Ascencao said Tamerlan Tsarnaev raged at what she was wearing .

"Mobile phone owners could soon be able to give their batteries a boost with their own urine. British scientists at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory have developed a way of using urine as a power source to generate electricity and claim to have created the world's first microbial fuel cells (MFC) powered mobile phone. While many people might turn their noses up at the energy source, the researchers said that it is the 'ultimate waste product' and does not rely on the erratic nature of the wind or the sun. Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos is pictured at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory holding a phone powered by a microbial fuel cell stack. He believes the new technology could one day power homes in developing countries . The scientists shared their breakthrough in the Royal Society of Chemistry Journal of Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos, an expert at harnessing power from unusual sources using microbial fuel cells at the University of West England, Bristol, which was also involved in the research, said the urine-powered phone is a 'world first'. 'No-one has harnessed power from urine so it’s an exciting discovery. 'Using the ultimate waste product as a source of power to produce electricity is about as eco as it gets. 'One product that we can be sure of an unending supply is our own urine. 'By harnessing this power as urine passes through a cascade of MFCs, we have managed to charge a Samsung mobile phone. He believes that the reliability of the fuel source is a big selling point. A number of fuel cells are pictured. They use urine as a source of power to produce electricity. By harnessing this power, researchers have managed to charge a Samsung mobile phone . 'The beauty of this fuel source is that . we are not relying on the erratic nature of the wind or the sun; we are . actually re-using waste to create energy. 'So far the microbial fuel power stack that we have developed generates enough power to enable SMS messaging, web browsing and to make a brief phone call.' However, he said that making a long call on a mobile phone is far more power hungry. 'Making a call on a mobile phone takes up the most energy but we will get to the place where we can charge a battery for longer periods. 'The concept has been tested and it works - it’s now for us to develop and refine the process so that we can develop MFCs to fully charge a battery.' Microbial fuel cells are energy converters that turn organic matter directly into electricity by utilising the metabolism of live micro-organisms. Dr Ieropoulos said: 'Essentially, the electricity is a by-product of the microbes’ natural life cycle, so the more they eat things like urine, the more energy they generate and for longer periods of time.' A single microbial fuel cell is pictured. The MFCs are energy converters that turn organic matter directly into electricity by utilising the metabolism of live micro-organisms . The electricity output of MFCs is relatively small and the researchers are currently only been able to store and accumulate low levels of energy into capacitors for short charge and discharge cycles. However they claim that this is the first time that scientists have been able to directly charge the battery of a device such as a mobile phone and it should be seen as a significant breakthrough. They believe that their research, which was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Gates Foundation and the Technology Strategy Board, has the potential to be installed in bathrooms. The scientists think that the technology could be  installed into domestic bathrooms in the future to harness the urine and produce sufficient electricity to power showers and lighting...or at least electric shavers. Dr Ieropoulos said: 'We are currently bidding for funding to work alongside partners in the US and South Africa to develop a smart toilet. Watch this space.'","Bristol Robotics Laboratory and UWE scientists claim to have created a mobile powered by microbial fuel cells that use urine to generate electricity .

"When 17-year-old Kurt Coleman walks past his own reflection he stops in awe to look at the teenager staring back at him. But it's a trait his Mother has grown to love about her selfie obsessed son, who spends more time behind the camera and in front of a mirror than you care to imagine. Speaking about the teenager, Maureen Coleman has delved into the private life of a very public teenager who in an interview with New Idea told the magazine about the bullying which forced him to drop out of school. Scroll down for videos . 'Gorgeous boy' Maureen Coleman regularly poses up for selfies with her proud son Kurt, who claims to have posted more than 100,000 selfies online . 'it hasn't been easy for Kurt' Maureen Coleman says her son has been taunted online because of his overtly confident ways . But apart from a few online taunts, which his mother said he has learnt to rise above, it it has been a largely fruitful rise to stardom for the online wonder kid who is now under the wing of a full time publicist. It is claims such as the one where he declared himself god's gift to earth and that he is Australia's answer to Paris Hilton which has raised his teenage profile. Given his popularity online, he said he was once asked if his online profile was an invented character or if he really does love himself. Kurt replied: 'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong.' He said his confidence was not hiding any insecurities ... 'I do love myself.' Now and then: A photo taken of a photo of Kurt in school uniform back in 2007 . 'He's forever looking in the mirror:' Kurt Coleman's mother said the 17 year old is always talking about how good he looks . He said it: Kurt Coleman has declared that he is a bigger than life itself . And his Gold Coast mother, who has two other children, loves him just as much. The hairdresser who features in some of the 100,000 photos he claims to have posted online, said she supports her boy's obscure and overtly confident outlook on life, adding the 17-year-old is a 'gorgeous boy with a beautiful heart.' 'Kurt loves who he is, he always says how good he looks and I think it's great at least he doesn't sit there and say how bad he looks,' she told MailOnline. Naturally, comments such as the claim he is Australia's answer to Paris Hilton has elicited some strong reaction online, but Maureen supports her son's positive attitude and outgoing lifestyle. 'I don't really read it (nasty comments), Mrs Coleman said. 'I know there is some hate out there but that's their opinion. Kurt says the hate motivates him to keep doing what he does because he loves proving people wrong.' She said it's 'disgusting' to see some of the things written about him. One commenter recently reacted to a photo posted to Facebook by calling him a 'fag'. 'It hasn't been easy for Kurt, he was bullied at school and dropped out.' 'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong,' the 17-year-old doesn't hold back. Kurt's mother said he spends hours in front of the camera fine-tuning and admiring his obsessive look . She said although he has his detractors, there's plenty of positive things being said about the 17-year-old. 'I do hairdressing and when some customers find out that I'm Kurt Coleman's mum, they freak out,' she said. 'One time I was cutting one of my friend's daughters hair and she wrote on Facebook 'Kurt Coleman's mum breathed on me!' it was so funny.' While she still finds it hard to comprehend just how popular he has become, Mrs Coleman said she has always encouraged her boy to 'dream big.' 'I'm not surprised he has become successful, I've always told him to dream big.' She said she thought Kurt might one day find himself in the spotlight, but didn't expect it to come via social media - a tool which he has taken too with keen interest. 'I didn't ever think it would be from social media but I knew he would end up on TV because he has always been in front of the camera,' she said.' Even when he was really young he would make me buy him cameras for Christmas and birthdays and take photos and videos of himself all day. I'm very proud of him and everything his done.' Among his most incredible public claims, Kurt once said the only reason he remains single is because 'he loves himself too much' and noone else is 'good enough for me.' 'My Idol:' American socialite Paris Hilton is the 17-year-old's most loved female celebrity . Selfie fan: The Gold Coast sensation says he takes selfies '24/7' because he likes what he sees . 'The lunar eclipse is almost as perfect as me.' Kurt Coleman has photo shopped a variety of different photos and posted them to social media . But while this kind of self-delusional attitude has rustled the feathers of  many active people on social media, the one woman closer to him than any other said there's never a dull moment when he's around. She said on one occasion she came home to find him re-arranging his room to have the end of his bed facing the mirror. His reason? so that when he woke up the first person he saw was himself. And some more trivia about the 17-year-old you probably don't already know, courtesy of his mum, is that he he's 'addicted to eating chocolate.' Did we mention he also loves spray tans? She said: 'Kurt's always testing out different spray tans that he gets sent from companies which makes for some interesting looking sheets and towels. Sometimes when he comes home his spray tan is so dark and we just laugh about it for hours.' Spray tan obsessed: Kurt said he has had more than 300 spray tans, which his mother can attest too . A quick scan of Kurt Coleman on Facebook and you'll find there's more than 20 different pages dedicated to the baby-faced Gold Coast blondie who has called himself the 'perfect' human . To put all these likes and interests into perspective, Kurt has amassed some 170,000 followers on Facebook and nearly 85,000 on Instagram. A quick scan of Kurt Coleman on Facebook and you'll find no fewer than 20 different pages dedicated to the baby-faced Gold Coast blondie. On his own personal page, there's the latest picture of him 'posing' alongside Paris Hilton which he has modeled his like on. 'She's my inspiration, she's just like me, that's why I love her,' he said. His jaw-dropping popularity has also spawned a mini-industry, with businesses set up in Australia flogging Kurt Coleman-related merchandise. The Kurt Coleman Supply Company says on its website it exists to promote 'the poster-boy to thousands of youth around the world for being who you are and not caring what anyone else thinks.'","Maureen Coleman has called Kurt's online taunts and bullies 'disgusting'

"Could you give up the internet for Lent -  or even for good? Following various reports about companies stealing information and complaints about oversharing on social media, a web hosting firm has created a nine-step guide on how to disappear from the web completely. It includes deactivating accounts, removing links from search results and how to remove yourself from various lists - and for people who'd rather just stay hidden than disappear, the guide also gives tips on how to use the internet anonymously. The infographic, pictured, from London-based WhoIsHostingThis, details the nine steps needed to remove yourself from the web. It includes deactivating accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ . 1. Close your Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn accounts. 2. Search for yourself online and close any accounts you'd forgotten about. 3. Falsify information on accounts that can't be closed or deleted. 4. Unsubscribe from mailing lists. 5. Delete search engine results. 6. Contact websites directly and ask them to remove details about yourself. 7. Ask data clearing houses - companies that collect and sell data to other firms -  to remove your records. 8. Ask to be unlisted in phone books and online directories. 9. Delete your email accounts. 'Social media has made everyone’s life an open book - one that’s open a bit too far in some cases. ‘For [people] concerned about their personal information potentially costing them jobs and relationships, the decision to ‘pull the plug’ is an increasingly attractive one,' said London-based WhoIsHostingThis (WIHT). ‘While it might seem impossible to keep your private life private, the truth is you can disappear online with a little effort and dedication.' There are a number of sites that can help users delete their information, such as DeleteMe and JustDelete.me. However, for people who want to do the job manually, WhoIsHostingThis' infographic details the nine steps needed to disappear from online completely. The first step involves deactivating primary accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. WIHT’s infographic gives step-by-step instructions for each account. In the second stage, WIHT recommends users search for themselves, pictured. This will reveal which sites a user has signed up for in the past, but no longer uses such as a MySpace. Search engines can help people track down their old web activity . The third step in WIHT's nine-step plan involves uploading false information into the accounts that can't be deleted, including fake names and locations, pictured. This has the double benefit of removing traces of the user, but also letting the user continue to use the web under an alter ego . In the second stage, WIHT recommends users search for themselves online. This reveals which sites a user has signed up for in the past, but no longer uses, such as a MySpace. The third step in WIHT’s nine-step plan involves uploading false information into the accounts that can’t be deleted, including fake names and locations. Step four involves unsubscribing from mailing lists using emails in an inbox and junk folder as a starting point. Step four involves unsubscribing from mailing lists that send emails to an inbox, or junk folder, pictured . The final two steps involve contacting phone companies and online directories, and asking to be made unlisted before deleting every email address, pictured . If, while searching from their name on Google, users find various links that include information about them, they can ask the search engine to remove them. Google has a URL removal tool, for example. However, Google is not obliged to remove links - especially if the website is owned or hosted by another company. In this instance, WIHT recommends contacting the website directly and asking them to remove any references. There are also services, known as data clearing houses, that collect information from sites to sell to advertisers, for example. WIHT admits this is one of the most difficult places to remove data from but suggests being persistent with phone calls and letters. The WIHT infographic also details tips on how to keep on top of online data, and how to browse anonymously using DuckDuckGo . The final two steps involve contacting phone companies and online directories, and asking to be made unlisted before deleting every email address. ‘In order to maintain your new-found anonymity, you must master reputation management, learn to use dummy accounts, and take advantage of anonymous searching - on sites such as Duck Duck Go,’ explained WIHT. 'Disappearing from the internet isn’t for everyone. But if you’re serious about your privacy, your security, and your reputation, taking the time to make yourself invisible online is worth the time and trouble.’","Hosting firm created a graphic explaining how to disappear from the web .

"Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group . Syria has said it is ready to cooperate with the international community to tackle Islamic State militants as it continues its civil war with various rebel groups. Foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group. But he insisted any military action inside the country must be co-ordinated with Damascus, or else an attack would be considered as aggression. Al-Moallen added that airstrikes alone will not be enough to eliminate extremists groups such as the Islamic State and the Nusra Front. He called for 'drying up' their resources including cutting off funding and arming by regional state actors and private donations as well as controlling the borders and exchange of intelligence information. America's top general last night said he will only recommend military action against Islamic State militants in Syria directly if they become a threat to the U.S. homeland. General Martin Dempsey said that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also said he believed key allies in the region, such as Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, will join the U.S. in its battle against the group. Al-Moallem's remarks at a news conference in Damascus  marked the first public comments by a senior official of President Bashar Assad's government on the threat posed by the Islamic State group, which has captured large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory. 'Syria is ready to cooperate and coordinate on the regional and international level in the war on terror,' al-Moallem said. 'But any effort to combat terrorism should be coordinated with the Syrian government.' Al-Moallem's remarks at a news conference in Damascus marked the first public comments by a senior Assad official on the threat posed by the Islamic State group . He went on to say: 'Any strike which is not coordinated with the government will be considered as aggression.' President Barack Obama has resisted ordering U.S. military action in Syria for three years, even after a deadly chemical weapons attack a year ago near Damascus he blamed on President Assad's government. But now, Obama faces pressure from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State group inside Syria. Obama remains wary, however, of getting dragged into the bloody and complex Syrian civil war that the United Nations says has killed more than 190,000 people. Western authorities now fear the Islamic State 'caliphate' could be used as a launchpad for global terror attacks - fears that were increased following the beheading of American journalist James Foley last week. An Islamic State video last week depicting the beheading of Mr Foley prompted revulsion in the West and calls for tougher action against the jihadists, including taking the fight to them in Syria as well as Iraq. Some experts have suggested that attacking Islamic State in Syria should involve coming to some sort of arrangement with the government of President Assad, seen in the West as a pariah since an uprising against him began three years ago. A man inspects damage at the entrance of the National Hospital of al-Tabaqa, caused by what activists said was an airstrike by forces of Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad on the hospital, beside al-Tabqa military base, west of Raqqa . Last week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted that Britain will not 'align' itself with President Assad to defeat IS fighters. Mr Hammond said Britain may have a 'common enemy' with the Syrian regime but added: 'That doesn't make us friends. It doesn't make us able to trust them, it doesn't enable us to work with them.' His remarks came after Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria. The peer said Britain would eventually have to work with President Assad to defeat the insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria. During today's press conference, al-Moallem  said the Syrian government had repeatedly warned of the threat of terrorism and the need to cut off resources and funding but 'no one listened to us.' Syria's government has long described the rebels fighting to topple Assad as 'terrorists' in a foreign conspiracy. U.S. officials revealed last week that U.S. forces had tried to rescue Mr Foley in a failed operation in Raqqa in July. General Martin Dempsey said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe . 'Had there been prior coordination that operation would not have failed,' al-Moallem said. The minister also denounced 'in the strongest terms possible' Mr Foley's killing last week by Islamic State militants, while asking: 'Has the West ever condemned the massacres by the Islamic State and Nusra against our armed forces or citizens?' Al-Moallem's news conference came a day after jihadis captured a major military air base in northeastern Syria, eliminating the last government-held outpost in a province otherwise dominated by the Islamic State group. After several failed attempts, Islamic State fighters stormed the Tabqa air base Sunday, killing dozens of troops inside. Al-Moallem conceded defeat in Tabqa, saying that soldiers were withdrawn to nearby areas, along with their weaponry and warplanes inside the base. The Islamic State group has established a self-declared caliphate in areas straddling Iraq and Syria's shared borders. The United States began airstrikes against the group in northern Iraq earlier this month which have helped the Kurdish peshmerga to reclaim some lost territory. Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, has said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria . The United Nations meanwhile today condemned 'appalling, widespread' crimes by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including mass executions of prisoners that could amount to war crimes. U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay condemned 'grave, horrific human rights violations' being committed by Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim group which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria to the alarm of the Baghdad government and its allies in the West. Up to 670 prisoners from Badush prison in the city of Mosul were killed by Islamic State on June 10, Pillay said in a statement quoting survivors and witnesses to the 'massacre' as telling U.N. human rights investigators. 'Such cold-blooded, systematic and intentional killings of civilians, after singling them out for their religious affiliation, may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Pillay said. Islamic State (ISIL) loaded 1,000 to 1,500 prisoners from the jail on to trucks and took them for screening, Pillay said. Sunni inmates were then separated and removed. 'ISIL gunmen then yelled insults at the remaining prisoners, lined them up in four rows, ordered them to kneel and opened fire,' she said.","Syrian foreign minister says government is ready to cooperate to fight ISIS .

"The MoJ refused to release the convicts' identities despite police appeals helping to track down recent absconded killer Michael Wheatley, aka the Skull Cracker . On-the-run killers and other criminals should not be publicly identified because it is ‘unfair’ on them, Government officials say. To the fury of MPs and victims, the Ministry of Justice is withholding the identity of 18 convicts who have absconded from open jail to protect their privacy. Officials say they have not even bothered to consider whether releasing the information is in the ‘public interest’ – despite the fact it could help to trace the fugitives. They claim that, under Freedom of Information laws, there is a blanket ban on releasing the criminals’ identities because it is their own ‘personal data’. Last night, senior Government sources said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling was furious with the decision, which was taken without his knowledge. He is now intending to over-rule his own department and publish a list of all on-the-run criminals within days. MPs said the decision – revealed in response to an FOI request by the Mail – was ‘idiotic’ and put the public at added risk. It came as yet another two convicts absconded from open jail, taking the total to six in just four days. Ex-Tory justice minister Nick Herbert said: ‘It is simply not acceptable to say naming a criminal who has escaped from prison is a breach of their rights. Unless there is an operation reason, they should be identified. It runs completely contrary to common sense.’ In individual cases, police have successfully appealed for the public’s help in tracking down the on-the-run inmates. But the MoJ said that it was not prepared to release a comprehensive list, despite MPs pointing out that it could help to apprehend serious criminals. Hell’s Angel David Richards killed a 16-year-old boy with a monkey wrench in 1984. He absconded nine years ago but has never been publicly identified. The Mail understands he is among the 18 names on the list. Also on the list is a killer named Derek Passmore, who absconded last June. Farcically, his identity was withheld from the Mail’s FOI request despite the fact that he featured on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme earlier this year. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The Ministry of Justice’s stance is idiotic. I’m almost embarrassed for them coming up with such tripe. ‘Surely the public, for their own safety, is entitled to know which prisoners are on the run.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is said to be furious with the response, and it is believed he will over-rule his own department and publish a full list within days . The row over on-the-run prisoners exploded earlier this month when notorious armed robber Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley absconded from an open prison in Kent while on temporary release. Since then six more convicts – including two new cases revealed yesterday – have walked out of prison. They include a violent robber dubbed the Scarborough Slasher, who was arrested yesterday after fleeing Hatfield Prison in Doncaster on Monday. But police issued an appeal to help trace Anthony Peloe, 43, jailed for possessing firearms, and John Arnold, 30, a convicted robber, who have walked out of minimum security HMP Thorn Cross in Warrington, Cheshire. In a letter to the Mail, a spokesman for the National Offender Management Service’s Security Group justified the decision not to name the current batch of absconders. It said: ‘I can confirm that the department holds information that you have asked for, but in this case we will not be providing it to you as it is exempt from disclosure. ‘We will not be able to provide the names of absconders as we are not obliged... to provide information that is the personal information of another person if releasing would contravene any of the provisions in the Data Protection Act 1998.’ Mr Grayling has responded to the recent spate of on-the-runs by unveiling stricter rules on who can qualify for so-called Release on Temporary Licence. He said that ‘with immediate effect’ prisoners will not be transferred to open conditions or allowed on temporary release if they have previously absconded. Last night, an MoJ insider said: ‘Operationally the police have the responsibility for locating and apprehending absconders and MoJ releasing the names could undermine their efforts. ‘The police may be following intelligence leads and be close to apprehension only for the individual to see their name in the media and then disappear. ‘MoJ would likely be accused of undermining police efforts and face allegations that we had put the public at risk.’","MoJ confirms it has details of 18 criminals but refuses to name them .

"Out: Annie Schmutz Seifullah, 35, was escorted from Robert Wagner Secondary School of Arts and Technology, in Long Island City, Queens, Thursday, where she was principal of the 7th-12th grade . A New York City high school principal has been accused of sleeping with a guard, an assistant principal and a parent on campus while classes were in session, and leaving incriminating photos of the trysts on department computers. Annie Schmutz Seifullah, 35, was escorted from Robert Wagner Secondary School of Arts and Technology, in Long Island City, Queens, Thursday, where she was principal of the 7th-12th grade. Detectives investigating the allegations seized computers and other electronics from her office and home, which, according to the New york Post, contained pictures of her wearing only lingerie and engaging in various sex acts including a threesome. 'We are appalled by these disturbing allegations and acted swiftly to remove the principal while the matter is under investigation,' a Department of Education spokesman told the Post. 'This type of alleged behavior is completely unacceptable for any DOE employee.' The newspaper reports that Seifullah's antics were revealed after a romance with a student's father came to a bitter end and the scorned lover turned over three department laptops he obtained while living with the principal. The unidentified dad also gave investigators a video and audio tape in which Seifullah allegedly confesses to engaging in oral sex with an NYPD school-safety agent in the school security office. She also admits to getting frisky with an assistant principal in a book-storage room during school hours, while he was visiting from another school. 'I don't know what I was thinking. I don't know why I thought it was OK,' she tells the angry father in the tape, after he accuses her of cheating. 'You gave him [expletive] while my child was in the building,' he yells in the recording, according to the Post. Tape: The unidentified dad also gave investigators a video and audio tape in which Seifullah, pictured in her underwear, allegedly confesses to engaging in oral sex with an NYPD school-safety agent in the school security office . Scorned: Seifullah's alleged antics were revealed after a romance with a student's father came to a bitter end and the scorned lover turned over three department laptops he obtained while living with the principal . Campus: Seifullah allegedly carried out sex acts with various men on school property, pictured . The dad also claims Seifullah admitted she had multiple rendezvous with an 'old lover' in a 'hidden location' inside the school. The father said he came forward because the mother-of-one 'played me for a fool.' 'Ms. Seifullah clearly used her power and position as principal to . . . seek several sexual partners at her school,' he charged. The principal, whose annual salary is $136,959, lent her lover money, according to records, handing over $10,000, plus $500 and $300 money orders. She also testified in Queens Family Court as a character witness in his custody battle with his wife. She spoke as both his child's principal and as the dad's 'girlfriend' while on the stand. Dating colleagues or parents of students is not against school policy however performing sexual acts inside a school or placing sexual images on school equipment could bring about misconduct charges. Sefullah uploaded a picture of herself with the father, naming him and declaring with a heart icon, on her now-defunct Facebook account last July with the caption: 'A single dad walked in the office of my school and swept me off my feet.'The pair split in March. Seifullah filed for divorce, presumably from her four-year-old son's father, last summer. The divorce is still pending.","Annie Schmutz Seifullah, 35, was escorted from Robert Wagner Secondary School of Arts and Technology, in Long Island City, Queens, Thursday, where she was principal of the 7th-12th grade .

"The convicted killer of three Ohio students at a high school cafeteria who escaped from a Lima prison Thursday has been taken back into custody. Nineteen-year-old T.J. Lane escaped along with two other inmates and one of the inmates was immediately captured, Lima police Sgt. Andy Green said. A search was then underway in woods and a residential area near the prison, he said. Lane was discovered after 1am with the help of police aircraft hiding out in or near an area farm building. Lane's accomplice remained at large. Scroll down for video . Caught: T.J. Lane smirks as he listens to the judge during his sentencing in Chardon, Ohio. Ohio police said Thursday, Sept. 11, 2014,  that Lane, 19, the convicted killer of three students at a high school cafeteria, escaped from prisonand was caught hours later near a farm building . Still on the run: Authorities identified the other inmate as Clifford E. Opperud, 45, and said he was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping . Authorities did not believe the two men are armed, however. They had no further information on how the inmates escaped from prison. Green said the police were notified about 8 p.m. Thursday evening. Lane pleaded guilty last year to shooting three students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He said he didn't know why he did. He was given three life sentences. Authorities identified the other inmate as Clifford E. Opperud, 45, and said he was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping. Before Lane's case went to adult court in 2012, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. At his sentencing, Lane was defiant, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of the victims spoke. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, who were killed in the Feb. 27, 2012, rampage. Three others were injured. Reached Thursday at her home in Chardon, Dina Parmertor, mother of Daniel Parmertor, said of Lane's escape: 'I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it.' Chardon Police told CNN they offered to provide extra patrols to the families of Lane's victims and to people in the area who opt for it. Chardon community of about 5,000 which is 190 miles away from Lima, Lane's known whereabouts before his early morning capture. Ohio public safety and correction officials said they began an 'extensive search,' along with the local authorities and the Ohio State Highway Patrol after the inmates escaped at 7:40 p.m. Thursday from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution. Escaped: TJ Lane was serving his life sentence here at the Allen County Correctional Institution mixed security prison in Lima, Ohio. Details on how he and his fellow inmates escaped Thursday were not immediately available . Dangerous: The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation immediately released a flyer to aid in the search for Lane, who was captured hours later . In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in past months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness: . August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall . October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time . August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded . July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo . They did not immediately reveal how the inmates escaped. However, recent state report on the prison revealed it's over capacity and has recently suffered from increased violence. An April visit from a state committee found that the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution housed 1,635 prisoners--217 over its capacity, reports the Plains Dealer. That's about 15 percent over capacity. The recent report's concern over the 20-year-old facility appeared to focus on the higher security areas, where Lane was housed. 'Security management remains a concern, both in terms of how the higher security inmates are handled, as well as discipline for misconduct,' reads the report. According to the report, there was a 60 percent increase in inmate assaults on staff between 2012 and 2013. 'All available troopers from the Ohio State Highway Patrol have been joined by Allen County Sheriff's deputies and local area law enforcement in establishing a perimeter and searching the area,' Ohio Department of Public Safety Director John Born said. 'A Patrol helicopter with advanced infrared detection equipment has been deployed and is engaged in the search as well. Born encouraged the public to call 911 of any suspicious persons or possible sightings. APB: Police in northwest Ohio went quickly to  work searching for the escaped inmates after catching a third. The group escaped via unnamed means just after 7:30pm Thursday. After Lane's capture, Opperud remained at large . Lane fired 10 shots at students in a cafeteria at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He was there waiting for a bus to another school. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed. Lane, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was prosecuted as an adult. Minutes before his guilty plea, the judge accepted a report finding Lane mentally competent to stand trial. Investigators say he admitted shooting at students but said he didn't know why he did it. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school on Feb. 27, 2012, and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Lane attended an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools. He was at Chardon waiting for a bus. Murdered in the Chardon, Ohio high school cafeteria in a school shooting that was lost amid media fascination over the Newtown massacre were Daniel Parmertor (left), 16, Demetrius Hewlin (right), 16, and 17-year-old Russell King Jr. (center) Attorney Ian Friedman, who defended Lane in the Chardon High case expressed shock when the Cleveland Plain Dealer informed him of his former client's escape. 'It's wild,' Friedman said. 'I'm sure there will be a lot of questions asked about how the correctional facility could allow this to happen.' Friedman also warned that while dangerous in many ways, Lane also wields the weapon of intellect. 'I can't speak to what his mindset is,' Friedman said. 'But I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that he's a very smart young man.' The frightening words of TJ Lane's attorney: Ian Friedman tweeted his take on his old client's escape Thursday night and it left many with a sense of unease . Proud murderer: T.J.

Wearing a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it, a teenager cursed and gestured obscenely as he was given three life sentences Tuesday for shooting to death three students in an Ohio high school cafeteria. T.J. Lane, 18, had pleaded guilty  to shooting at students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. Investigators have said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it. Before the case went to adult court, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. Lane was defiant during the sentencing, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of victims spoke. After he came in, he calmly unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal the T-shirt reading 'killer,' which the prosecutor noted was similar to one he wore during the shooting. At one point, he swiveled around in his chair toward the gallery where his own family members and those of the slain teenagers were sitting and spoke suddenly, surprising even his lawyer. 'The hand that pulls the trigger that killed your sons now masturbates to the memory,' he said, then cursed at and raised his middle finger toward the victims' relatives. A student who was wounded in the rampage dismissed the outburst. 'He said it like a scared little boy and couldn't talk slow enough that anyone could understand him,' said Nate Mueller, who was nicked in the ear in the shooting. The forgotten school shooting: An Ohio State highway patrol helicopter prepares to leave the grounds of Chardon High School in February 2012 after Lane opened fire with a handgun in the cafeteria of an Ohio high school east of Cleveland on Monday, fatally wounding three students . Dina Parmertor, mother of victim Daniel, called Lane 'a pathetic excuse for a human being' and wished upon him 'an extremely, slow torturous death.' She said she has nightmares and her family has been physically sick over the crimes. 'From now on, he will only be a killer,' she said, as Lane's smile widened. 'I want him to feel my anger toward him.' Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed. Lane was at Chardon waiting for a bus to the alternative school he attended, for students who haven't done well in traditional settings. Lane had pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault. Life imprisonment without parole was the maximum sentence Lane faced. He wasn't eligible for the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the shootings. Relatives of the slain students indicated earlier they wanted Lane to get the maximum sentence.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the introduction of the 'under-occupancy penalty' is not designed to punish pensioners . A 'bedroom tax' being introduced by the Government could force pensioners to move into smaller houses. The measures, which are part of the new universal credit scheme, will mean that those with a spare bedroom will be penalised. Around 600,000 are expected to be affected by the reforms, which are expected to result in a cut of approximately £14 a week. The plans are aimed at those renting council housing or housing association properties and not those in private properties. The changes are an attempt to encourage those who have spare bedrooms to downsize. Pensioners currently living in council properties will not be affected by the changes, which will come into effect in April. But those entering the benefit system will face deductions in benefits due to the 'under-occupancy penalty'. The Government has made concessions in the plans, excluding existing elderly claimants where somebody of working age also lives in the property. But it is understood the exemption will cease to exist for new claimants in mixed-age homes after October, despite mixed homes previously being exempt after the plans are introduced in April. DWP guidance, seen by the Sunday People, says: 'New housing benefit claimants who are mixed aged couples and claiming pension credit will not be exempt when they transfer on to Universal Credit.' Cuts: Around 600,000 are expected to be affected by the reforms, which are expected to result in a cut of approximately £14 a week . Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said that the Prime Minister needed to 'get a grip fast' and warned that the scheme could 'descend into chaos' Shadow work and pensions secretary . Liam Byrne criticised the plans, saying: 'Ministers promised to protect . pensioners from the bedroom tax, but thousands are set to lose out.' He added: 'David Cameron had better get a grip fast, before this scheme descends into total chaos.' Iain Duncan Smith, however, said that pensioners would not suffer because of the plans and said that the application of the rules had yet to be finalised. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'The reality is that they are looking at universal credit further down the road. 'It is not our intention that pensioners in any way will suffer.' He added: 'This is not about punishing people. This is about trying to reallocate the housing. It is about getting the balance right.'","Around 600,000 people expected to be hit by reforms .

"The missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 dropped to as low as 12,000ft in what could have been a cabin emergency before it disappeared from the radar, it has emerged. As the exhaustive search continues in the Indian Ocean for the missing Boeing 777-200, an official revealed the doomed passenger jet made a sharp turn over the South China Sea which ‘seemed to be intentional’. The plane's last confirmed position, picked up by Malaysian military radar, was at 2.15am Malaysia time (1815 GMT March 7) about 200 nautical miles north-west of Malaysia's Penang island, roughly an hour after it diverted from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Australian Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, right, talks with John Rice, left, senior search and rescue officer and mission coordinator for the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines aircraft . Radar specialists are pictured aboard a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion aircraft searching for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 over the southern Indian Ocean . A Chinese Antarctic exploration team member aboard Chinese icebreaker Xuelong (Snow Dragon) searches for debris of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 over the southern Indian Ocean . Ten aircraft including two from Japan and two from China have bolstered the ongoing search effort in the Indian Ocean, where possible debris from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 was spotted . Radar tracking shows the aircraft changed altitude after making the ‘intentional’ sharp left turn as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation said. The anonymous official, who is not authorised to speak to the media, told CNN that flying at 12,000 feet in the heavily trafficked air corridor would’ve kept the missing jet out of sight of other aircraft. Mary Schiavo, an aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, told the international broadcaster the new information was ‘highly significant’. She said: ‘It explains so many pieces that didn't fit together before. ‘Now, if we have a scenario where something happened, the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet, this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic on-board event, such as a rapid decompression, a fire, an explosion. ‘That's what you would have to do, descend, get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane.’ It raises questions over what might have happened in the plane’s cockpit to cause such a drop in altitude. However, it is not yet clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet, which officials will now be desperate to uncover. Mike Barton, rescue coordination chief, left, looks over the maps of the Indian Ocean with Alan Lloyd, manager of search and rescue operations at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination centre in Canberra . A relative of Chinese passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines, MH370, expresses her frustration at the lack of information, to journalists in Beijing . Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss says the search operation is 'clutching' at new information after it was revealed new French satellite images were taken 850km from the current target zone . The new information comes after France said it was investigating a possible sighting of debris in the south Indian Ocean. Officials are hoping the new data will help them solve the disappearance of the plane, which went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, and has quickly become one of the world's great aviation mysteries. France's Foreign Ministry said yesterday that a satellite image taken 850 kilometres from the current search site in the Indian Ocean indicated floating debris in the water. Satellite images previously issued by Australia and China have proved futile in the search so far with Chinese officials withdrawing their data last week after admitting to ‘mistakenly’ releasing it. And search planes have so far failed to locate two objects that Australia said it had identified in the Indian Ocean, about 1,500 miles south east of Perth. However, the new information from France has promoted authorities to widen the search area in the hunt for the doomed airliner. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination centre said the search area was expanded from 59,000 to 68,500 square kilometres (22,800-26,400 square miles) to include the new separate area uncovered by the French data. A photo released by Chinese broadcaster CCTV shows a satellite image of a large floating object in the Indian Ocean that could be related to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Commanding Officer of HMAS Success, Captain Allison Norris of the Royal Australia Navy (RAN), scans the ocean from the ship's bridge during the search for the missing Malaysia Airline flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean . It comes amid concerns of rain hampering the search, which has been buoyed by the addition of two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 planes, increasing the number of aircraft involved from eight to 10. There are also concerns about Tropical Cyclone Gillian bearing down on the Australian northwest coast which Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said ‘could stir up less favourable weather’. The search could deteriorate rapidly this morning, with rain forecast in in the search area, about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth. Officials will be worried about bad weather hindering the search, especially after Minister Truss described Sunday as a ‘fruitless day’ which delivered ‘nothing of note’. He said: 'It is a very difficult task. 'The weather yesterday wasn't too bad, although there was early morning fog. 'Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and of course the forecasts ahead are not all that good. 'So it's going to be a challenge but we'll stick at it.' He also described the search operation as 'clutching' at information, as flight and sea crews prepared to embark on their fifth day of sweeps in the target zone some 2,500km off the coast of Perth. Acting Prime Minister of Australia Warren Truss speaks to the media at the RAAF Pearce Base, where he said the search for MH370 would continue 'while there's still hope' and until officials were certain it was 'futile' Mr Truss walks with RAAF Wing Commander James Parton and RAAF Group Captain Craig Heap: Mr Truss dismissed a suggestion the Australian Government had waited too long to act after revealing the satellite photos . A Royal Australia Air Force AP3C Orion leaves RAAF Pearce Air Base in search of MH370. The flight went missing more than two weeks ago carrying 239 passengers and crew on route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . 'The French sighting is a piece of new material because that is in a completely different location. That is about 850 kilometres north of our current search area,' Mr Truss told ABC Radio. 'That's not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft may have entered the sea. But having said all that we've got to check out all the options. 'We're just, I guess, clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along to try and find a place where we might be able to concentrate the efforts.' Today's search, bolstered by 10 aircraft, including three civil planes, two Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft from China and two P3 Orions from Japan, has been split into two areas within the same proximity of the southern Indian Ocean covering 22,800sq miles. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the aircraft will also search for possible objects in an area about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next. Police are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.","Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 dropped in altitude after 'intentional left turn'

Once when I was one month pregnant and than when I was six months pregnant. We did not have money to go more often. 'She was born through a Caesarian operation and the doctor told us we had to take her out of Agartala to get her treated. But we did not have any money at all.' But the devastated mother revealed some family members had been less than supportive. Fatima added: 'When she is better, I hope my in-laws accept her. And she can have the love she deserves from her grandparents.' Roona's father Abdul, 19, added: 'Even though our neighbours come and play with her, my parents have refused to acknowledge her existence, since she was born.' Abdul, who earns the equivalent of just £1.82 a day as a labourer thanked those who had helped Roona. He said: 'I cannot find work every day. Its hard enough to earn for food, so her treatment would have been impossible had it not been for the press and hospital people who have helped us.'","Roona Begum suffers from a severe case of Hydrocephalus .

"For most people, playing racing video games is as close as they will get to being a racing driver. But for Jann Mardenborough, this wasn't enough. The 19-year-old from Cardiff was one of thousands of wannabe racers who took part in a unique competition on the Gran Turismo 5 video game that can transform gamers into professional race drivers. Welcome to the GT Academy. Let the fastest time win. Dream come true: Jann is still shocked at just how much has happened over the past 12 months . 'I entered GT Academy as the prize at stake was incredible,' said Jann. 'It was always a dream to become a racing driver, but I never thought it would be possible as motorsport can be so expensive. 'I knew thousands of people would be entering, so I did not think at the start I would win. I knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up, so I thought it was worth giving it my best shot.' Then began Jann's gruelling regime, every day trying to shave off milliseconds from his time in the hope of making the National Final. Having dropped out of university to reassess his career options, he had time on his side but as he soon found out, this made things no easier. 'I basically locked myself in my room for two weeks,' he said. 'I would have breakfast, and then I would focus everything on the time trial. After a quick break for lunch, I would be straight back on it to around four o’clock. 'It was tough, but I really wanted to make the National Final. There were times when my parents were on at me for spending so much time playing the game and some of my friends were travelling around Australia during a gap year, but I knew what I want to do. Become a professional racing driver!' Little by little, Jann would see his lap times improve, only for another equally keen gamer to better him. Religiously checking the leader boards, Jann carried on undeterred until finally, nearly 1000 time trials later, his persistence paid off. Doing it for real: Jann says the skills learned through playing the game served him well on the track . 'I was thrilled, as just to qualify for the online time trials I must have done nearly 1,000 laps!' he said. 'When I did my best lap I was exiting the final corner with one hand on the steering wheel and the other fist-pumping the air because I knew that was the lap where I couldn’t go any faster, that was my limit. 'Then I watched the timing screens for the rest of the night and woke up in the morning to find out that I’d qualified and it was amazing. I was jumping for joy and telling my family, who were as excited as me. It was a fantastic moment.' From then on, Jann's life changed. He went on to win the National Final and earn a place on the GT Academy Race Camp. Gone was the Playstation controller and safety of his bedroom. These were real cars with real, potentially fatal, consequences. Thankfully, Jann was able to transfer some of his gaming skills on to the track. 'I first drove the Nissan GT4 at GT Academy Race Camp, on slick tyres,' he said. 'The noise was just incredible, the gearbox was amazing and the brakes were so stiff – it was a car! 'I was definitely able to take some skills from the game into real life. I’d never had a car sideways before and I was suddenly doing it in real life, just from doing it on the game!' Before long, Jann was racing in Le Mans 24 hours - a legendary endurance race that would push his skills to the limit. And even though he didn't make the podium, the entire experience was a moment Jann would treasure for a lifetime. On course for success: The teenager has been tipped for great things in the racing world . 'To be able to race at Le Mans last month racing against drivers I watched on TV was an incredible feeling!' he said. 'The Mulsanne Straight, the Porsche Curves…it was all as good as everyone said it would be.  Racing at Le Mans was everything I expected and more. When you are on the track, on your own, with new tyres and low-ish fuel, it’s incredible.' As the latest crop of GT Academy drivers from the Gran Turismo 6 demo converge for the final at Silverstone on August 13 - only one thing will be on their minds: 'I wonder where I'll be this time next year...'

"The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, pictured, magnified the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims, according to the report . Children as young as ten have been responsible for anti-Muslim abuse, a study has claimed. It suggests that the Muslim community is facing abuse on a daily basis, with many of the attacks carried out by younger people. And the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby 'clearly magnified' the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims, the study's author has claimed. The report found that there were 734 self-reported cases of anti-Islamic abuse between May 2013 and February this year - equivalent to more than two a day on average. Researchers at the Centre for Fascist, Anti-Fascist and Post-Fascist Studies at Teesside University, in Middlesbrough, used data collected over a ten month period by the Tell Mama (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) project. Separate figures produced by Tell Mama were questioned a year ago when directors of the government-funded project said they had received more than 200 reports of Islamophobia in just over a week after the brutal murder. It emerged that more than half of the incidents reported on the hotline related to offensive messages on Twitter, Facebook or online blogs, and only a tiny minority were physical attacks. Nearly 600 of the incidents examined in the separate university study were online abuse and threats. The rest were 'offline' attacks such as violence, spreading of anti-Muslim literature, threats and assaults. Around 60 per cent of these 'offline' attacks are believed to have been carried out by individuals estimated to be aged between ten and 30. The study also suggests that around two fifths of the cases recorded by Tell MAMA had a link to far-right groups. It found that more than half of the victims reporting incidents to the project were women, while less than one in six of all of those who reported incidents also told the police. Study author Dr Matthew Feldman, co-director of the Centre for Fascist, Anti-Fascist and Post-Fascist Studies said: 'Muslims remain among the most likely minority group in Britain to be targeted for a hate crime. ‘""Trigger"" events like the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby clearly magnify the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims simply for who they are and what they believe.” Nearly 600 cases of anti-Islamic abuse between May 2013 and February this year took place online, the report said (file picture) The report noted a spike in reported incidents in the wake of Fusilier Rigby’s murder in Woolwich, south east London on May 22 last year. The soldier’s death sparked shock across the country after he was run over with a car and then hacked to death by British Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. In the week after the murder, there were 127 reported incidents, according to Tell Mama’s figures, while a total of 354 cases of anti-Muslim activity were reported in May and June last year. A number of attacks received widespread coverage at the time alongside warnings from Tell Mama Project director Fiyaz Mughal of a ‘cycle of violence’ against Muslims which had led to ‘a sense of endemic fear’. But while they included a petrol bomb attack on a mosque in Grimsby and another incident in Essex where a man entered a mosque armed with a knife, only 17 cases involved individuals being physically targeted, it was claimed in a Sunday newspaper at the time. Six people had things thrown at them and most of the other 11 incidents related to attempts to rip off women’s headscarves or other items of Islamic dress. More than half related to offensive or abusive messages on social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter.","There were 734 self-reported cases of anti-Islamic abuse in nine months .

"The startup's system includes an app, alongside a series of physical alarms that sound emergency tones as soon as possible, before the shaking reaches that particular location . In the past 30 days, more than 1,400 earthquakes have struck globally - and at least 160 of them have rocked the US across Oklahoma and the west coast. The US government is working with a number of experts to develop an early warning system to give residents a heads up about such natural disasters as quickly as possible. And one firm, called Early Warning Labs, is developing a service called QuakeAlert that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app. The California-based startup's system includes an app, alongside a series of in-home or office alarms that sound an emergency tone as soon as possible, before the shaking reaches that particular location. The system also plays a countdown to warn the homeowner, or office worker, when the shaking will reach them, and reveals how intense it will be - ranging from light to severe. Additionally, the app includes tips on what to do if the user is indoors, outdoors, or in a moving vehicle. The app works as a standalone product, meaning that if an earthquake hits while a user is out of the house or office, they are still sent a warning. It does this using the phone’s in-built sensors. The firm developed the technology in partnership with mapping provider ESRI, as well as the US Government. Its mission is to ‘improve, expand, and lower the costs of the existing earthquake early warning systems.’ The work is part of a larger project set up by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to develop an earthquake early warning system (EEW) for the country - dubbed USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. Early Warning Labs is developing a system called QuakeAlert that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app and sensors built into physical alarms. It is hoped it will reduce the amount of damage caused by natural disasters in the US. The aftermath of the 1994 Northridge earthquake is pictured . A demonstration earthquake early warning system called ShakeAlert began sending test notifications to selected users in January 2012. But, EWL said the system needs to be further tested, and additional funding is needed to complete the final research and development of the system. The point of an earthquake early warning system is to ‘rapidly detect the initiation of an earthquake, estimate the level of ground shaking intensity to be expected, and issue a warning before significant ground shaking starts’ explained EWL. A network of seismic sensors detect the first energy to radiate from an earthquake, known as the P-wave energy, as well as the location and the magnitude of the earthquake. Then, the system estimates how far and wide the ground shaking will spread. The system provides a second warning before the so-called S-wave arrives, which brings the strong shaking that typically causes most of the damage. Warnings are sent to local and state public emergency response officials, critical infrastructure, private businesses, and the public. EEW systems have already been successfully implemented in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, and other nations with varying degrees of sophistication and coverage.

The developers added that this also gives officials time to disable gas lines and manage transport links, for example.

"Soft drink company SodaStream is closing the factory in the West Bank that drew Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson into the dispute about Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territory. The company said the decision to move the factory to a location inside Israel was for 'purely commercial' reasons and was not connected to pressure from pro-Palestinian activists who had boycotted the company because of its location. A pro-Palestinian boycott movement has targeted businesses that operate in the West Bank, saying they benefit from Israel's occupation of the territory, which was captured in 1967 and is claimed by the Palestinians. Scarlett Johansson endorsed soft drink maker SodaStream and cut her ties with UK charity Oxfam after it criticised the Israeli company for using a factory in the occupied West Bank . Actress Scarlett Johansson got caught up in the controversy over the plant's location earlier this year after she agreed to serve as SodaStream's global brand ambassador. The decision upset Oxfam International, a humanitarian aid organization for which Johansson had served as a global ambassador for eight years. The US star severed her ties with the UK charity because of the dispute, citing 'fundamental differences of opinion.' The Hollywood star was SodaStream's global brand ambassador and defended the company's decision to use the factory in the West Bank, which employed local Palestinians . Johansson's deal with SodaStream was announced in January at a function with the company's CEO Daniel Birnbaum (pictured left) SodaStream said it was closing the West Bank factory and moving operations to a site inside Israel. The company said the decision was made for 'purely commercial' reasons, though activists claim their boycott movement forced theshift . In March, Johansson denied her decision to join SodaStream was mistaken. ""No, I stand behind that decision,"" she told The Observer. ""I was aware of that particular factory before I signed. And it still doesn't seem like a problem – at least not until someone comes up with a solution to the closing of that factory and leaving all those people destitute."" The Palestinian boycott campaign welcomed Wednesday's announcement by SodaStream International Ltd, saying its boycott caused retailers to drop SodaStream, known for its machines that allow users to make their own fizzy drinks. SodaStream representative Nirit Hurwitz said the new location received a $20 million grant from the Israeli government. The new location ""will become our flagship manufacturing site and is expected to deliver operational excellence and result in savings of 2 percent across our entire cost base."" she said. The move is expected to be complete by the end of next year. SodaStream has defended the factory in the past, saying it employs hundreds of Palestinians and gives them equal benefits as Israeli workers. Most of them are from nearby West Bank towns. The company said it would try to keep all of its workers at the new plant, though they will face lengthy commutes and need permits to work inside Israel. For Palestinian workers from the nearby city of Ramallah, the new facility will be over 100 kilometers away. From Hebron, another nearby city in the southern West Bank, the commute will be about 50 kilometers. ""We are offering all employees the opportunity to join us in Lehavim, and specifically, we are working with the Israeli government to secure work permits for our Palestinian employees,"" SodaStream Chief Executive Daniel Birnbaum said. Rafeef Ziadah, a spokesman for the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions National Committee, said its campaign against SodaStream forced the company's hand in the West Bank decision. Johansson appeared in high-profile ads for SodaStream during the Super Bowl . 'SodaStream’s announcement today shows that the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is increasingly capable of holding corporate criminals to account for their participation in Israeli apartheid and colonialism,' Siadah said in a post on the group's Facebook page. 'BDS campaign pressure has forced retailers across Europe and North America to drop SodaStream, and the company’s share price has tumbled in recent months as our movement has caused increasing reputational damage to the SodaStream brand.' He said, however, that SodaStream was implicated in the displacement of Palestinians even if the factory closure goes ahead, alleging it paid them less than Israeli workers and forced them to work in sub-standard conditions.","SodaStream said decision to move is 'purely commercial'

"Botched circumcision procedures in remote parts of South Africa are killing young men to such an extent that it has been labelled 'genocide' by a local health official. The initiation, from youth to adulthood, is carried out as a cultural tradition across the country. But this year alone, 39 young men have died from unsafe operations in the Eastern Cape, and over the last seven years, there have been 462 reported deaths. Young men are dying at such an extent following botched initiation circumcisions that the problem has been labelled a 'genocide'. Pictured, a young South African boy, in his initiation robes and paints, in Xhosa . The problem has reached such crisis levels that the Eastern Cape's health authority is looking into setting up facilities manned by surgeons and other medical staff to safely carry out the procedure. Sizwe Kupelo, spokesman for the EC Health Department, told Dispatch Online: 'The custom has nothing to do with an actual surgical procedure, it will remain a custom but it's the cutting of the boys that is important. How this is done needs to be closely looked at as some boys are getting infected and ending up in hospital. 'This is very close to genocide,' he said. This view was mirrored by senior traditional leader Ndumiso Hlongwa who was quoted in Sowetan Live as saying the death rate could be called 'genocide as our people are slashed to death in these mountains'. The main cause of hospital admission is septicaemia. In the last seven years, 5,000 young men have been admitted to hospitals in South Africa suffering complications after their circumcision procedure. It is also the main cause of death. For those who survive, they must live with the embarrassment and humiliation of being permanently deformed. There is also a strong belief still, in parts of South Africa, that those who succumb to problems during initiation are not real men, according to survivor Thando Mgqolozana, who has shrugged aside mockery to write about his experiences. Eastern Cape's health authority is looking into setting up circumcision facilities to safely carry out the procedures, particularly where the death toll is highest. Pictured, a painted Xhosa awaits his initiation . Now, in a bid to prevent and epidemic of septicaemia among young men, the authorities are getting involved. At the start of the initiation season, the Eastern Cape Health Department allocated 20m rands (£1.32million) to curb initiation deaths. Some of it was used to assist the monitoring and evaluation of the process, but there was little impact on the death toll, according to Dispatch Online. The head of the Eastern Cape's health department, Sicelo Gqobana, now wants to look into placing permanent facilities to specialise in carrying out the procedure, especially where the death toll is the highest. He points out the dire health economics of the current situation, with every patient admitted to hospital costing the authority 1,000 rands (£65.90). South Africa's Eastern Cape province has recorded 39 deaths so far this year from botched circumcision procedures. The main cause of death is septicaemia . The number of men dying every year is also increasing, so the need to implement a plan to prevent this 'genocide' is urgent. Kansas Shezi, parent of deceased 14-year-old initiate Siniko Shezi, told Dispatch Online: 'Anything that can help us will be great. We are losing children.'","In the Eastern Cape, 39 young men have died this year alone from complications following the procedure .

"A 22-year-old Arizona man turned himself in to police this week and admitted to beating his girlfriend, a 19-year-old college student, to death with a dumbbell in their apartment days earlier. The victim has been identified as Arizona State University junior and Minnesota native Rebecca 'Becky' Kasper, whose decomposing body was discovered in the bathtub in the off-campus apartment she shared with Luis Soltero. Court documents made public Wednesday state that Soltero, who is not believed to be a student, left a note next to the apparent murder weapon allegedly admitting to the brutal slaying. Tragic end: Luis Soltero, 22 (left), walked into a police station and said that he had murdered his girlfriend, 19-year-old Becky Kasper (right), whose body was later found in his apartment . Troubled relationship: Neighbors said the couple, pictured here in December, could often be heard screaming and fighting . According to a statement released by ASU, Kasper was a junior majoring in marketing. 'ASU extends its sincere condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time,' the statement read. 'Counseling services for those who knew Kasper are being made available to the university community.' In a Wednesday night press conference, the 19-year-old's father, Dan Kasper, said his daughter 'loved being a Sun Devil,' referring to ASU's athletic teams, and was on the Dean's List. Becky Kasper, who had two sisters, was . a native of Saint Cloud, Minnesota. She graduated from Northfield . Senior High School in 2011. 'This is like lightning out of the clear blue sky, we had no idea that this was coming,' said the victim's father, Dan Kasper, according to CBS5 AZ. Appearing dressed in a black ASU Sun Devils T-shirt, Mr Kasper said his daughter, described as a tough and focused young woman, loved Arizona, where the family had briefly lived when she was a child. ASU was the only school the 19-year-old had applied to, even though Kasper said he was always unease about his daughter moving so far away from home. Becky Kasper loved shopping and cats. She was pursuing a degree in marketing from the W.P. Carey School of Business, and was planning to graduate a year early. The family were trying to get Miss Kasper to move back to Arizona, and her father said the last phone conversation they had before she was killed was about internship opportunities he had found for her. But the 19-year-old informed her dad that she loved Arizona, and that her future was there. Bereaved father: Dan Kasper said his daughter was a tough girl and loved Arizona and ASU . No warning signs: Mr Kasper said he met Soltero over Christmas, and he seemed laid back and nice . 'She's our daughter, and I just think her story is worth telling,' the emotional Mr Kasper told reporters, adding that Becky was likely going to do something great. The bereaved father also said that he met Soltero before when Becky brought him home to Minnesota to spend Christmas with her family. 'He was quiet, laid back and easy going, seemed like a good kid,' he said. The couple met last fall while working for Southwest Books, a door-to-door sales program. According to Becky Kasper's dad, she told him that their relationship came to an end a few weeks ago, but that Soltero did not seem upset by it and took the breakup in stride. At around 10.30am Tuesday morning, the 22-year-old Soltero walked into a Tempe Police Department substation, handed an officer his ID card and Kasper's Minnesota driver's license and stated: 'My girlfriend is there and she is dead, and I am not going to tell you anything more without an attorney,' according to the court papers cited by Phoenix News Times. Soltero was then hospitalized with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning after telling police he felt dizzy because he had spent 12 hours in his car with the engine running inside a storage space. Meanwhile, police officers went to Soltero and Kasper's home at 919 East Lemon Street in Tempe near the ASU campus, where the 22-year-old man said they would found his girlfriend’s body. Responding officers forced open the door to the unit and found Kasper dead in the bathtub. According to court documents, the 19-year-old's body was covered with blankets and a yoga mat, with coffee grounds and baking soda sprinkled on top. The young woman’s head was covered . with a plastic bag, and her face was described as 'unrecognizable' from . horrific blunt-force trauma. Gruesome scene: Kasper's body was found inside Soltero's unit at 919 East Lemon Street in a blood-spattered bathroom . 'It's a gruesome scene,' Tempe Police Sgt Mike Pooley told the station KTAR. Court . documents indicate that Becky Kasper's wrists were handcuffed and her . ankles were restrained, and there was blood splatter in the tub, on the . walls and floor. The rest of the woman's body was beginning to decay. A blood-covered dumbbell, believed to be the murder weapon, was found on the bathroom floor. Next to the dumbbell, police discovered an unsigned note wedged into the bathroom doors which read in part: 'I did not treat her right. She deserved better but never accepted it. So I had to make the choice for her.' The author of the rambling missive goes on to say: 'She died on 420 not because of drugs, but because a sociopath talked and treated her nice...I don't know where to go from here. Do I kill again, end it with myself or become invisible.' Police say the note was penned in handwriting consistent with Soltero's, according to the documents. Neighbors told police that Soltero and Kasper had a stormy relationship and often could be heard screaming at one another.

"Disgraced running back Adrian Peterson has been credited with the Minnesota Vikings' impressive win at the weekend - despite not even being on the field . Disgraced running back Adrian Peterson has been credited with the Minnesota Vikings' impressive win at the weekend - despite not even being on the field. The NFL player, who is currently waiting action on child abuse charges  in Texas, sent a text message to coach Mike Zimmer before Sunday's game. According to his former teammates, it was Peterson's motivational words  that fired them up to secure an incredible 41-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons. According to 1500ESPN, Starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater described the message as 'very deep'. 'One thing that I took away from that message was: 'play each down like it's your last because you never know when it's going to be your last opportunity,' he said. 'Today I think the guys got that message pretty well. We went out, we fought today and it was just a great overall team effort.' Vikings running back Matt Asiata did not specify exactly what Peterson wrote, but he did describe the text message as a 'motivational speech'. 'We felt him in spirit,' Asiata said. 'He gave us a text, a motivational speech in a text, and we came out punching.' The motivation certainly appeared to have worked on Asiata, who scored three touchdowns. The Vikings finished with a season-high 241 rushing yards off Asiata's 78. Peterson   has been away from the team since September 17, when the Vikings reversed their initial decision to reinstate him following a 60-hour ban. The Vikings could play the rest of 2014 without him. On September 12, Peterson was indicted in Montgomery County, Texas, for felony injury to a child. During interviews with Child Protective Services and Texas law enforcement, Peterson admitted to giving his son two spankings, one with a belt and the other with a switch, as 'physical discipline,' according to the complaint. Since details of the allegations have emerged, Peterson has been dropped from the Vikings' active roster while the criminal case against him is pending in Texas, where he has an October 8 arraignment. Minnesota Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater looks to pass over Atlanta Falcons free safety Dwight Lowery during the first half of the NFL football game at the TCF Bank Stadium . Teddy Bridgewater   dives into the end zone for a touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons during Sunday's game . The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, taking him off the roster and bowing to pressure from outraged fans and sponsors. The fallout from the abuse allegations have led to major sponsors dropping the NFL star from lucrative endorsement deals. Linebacker Gerald Hodges said the text message sent to Zimmer who read it out to the team ahead of the game at the TCF Bank Stadium in Minnesota. '[Peterson] just sent it to coach,' Hodges said. 'Him and coach were texting back and [Peterson] said he wanted to share some things. 'He just said he'd love to be out here, would be dying to be out here with us. But everything's out of his control. He just said go out there and play your hearts out like it's your last time playing.'

"For two years, Sam the cat was nurtured and adored by owner Aydan Ulugun. She had got him when he was just six weeks old and as well as knowing his every purr, she had come to think of him as her child. So imagine Miss Ulugun’s distress when she had to resort to defending herself against him – with a vacuum cleaner. Still healing: Aydan Ulugun shows the wounds on her leg after her 'psychotic cat' clawed at her skin . It was all the decorator had to hand . when Sam launched a vicious attack on her, transforming into a . ‘psychopath cat’ in a split second and leaving his doting owner in . hospital on a drip. The . 35-year-old had merely walked into her spare bedroom, where Sam spends a . lot of time, when he leapt at her, sinking his teeth into her leg and . clawing at her skin ‘like a feline ninja’. Luckily Miss Ulugun’s mother, who . lives with her in Walthamstow, east London, was in their three-bedroom . home and rushed upstairs to fight off the cat. The . pair barricaded themselves in the room while Sam prowled the landing, . and only plucked up courage to emerge half an hour later – armed with a . vacuum cleaner. Miss Ulugun then spent seven hours in . A&E where she was  X-rayed and given antibiotics through a drip, as . well as a tetanus injection. Attack mode: Sam the cat's assault caught on camera. The 'psychotic' moggie has now been neutered in the hope it will calm him down . The wound on her leg is refusing to heal more than a week after the attack and she is waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant to find out if Sam has inflicted any long-term damage. A shocked Miss Ulugun said Sam had always been as ‘good as gold’ before the attack. ‘I’ve had him since he was six weeks old. I absolutely adore him and give him loads of affection. 'I treated him like he was my kid. But when I walked into the spare room he was looking very odd,’ she said. ‘His hair puffed up and his tail seemed far larger than normal. His facial expression changed and became menacing and he started making strange, aggressive noises, when he is normally quiet. ‘He pounced on me as my back was turned. I was terrified that my little cat who was so lovely had turned into a monster.’ Vicious: Sam the cat is pictured during a calm moment after being fought off with a vacuum cleaner (file picture) Miss Ulugun has since taken Sam to the vet to be neutered, which she hopes will help calm him down. She said: ‘The vet thought it must have been a dog that attacked me. She said it was the worst injury caused by a cat she had ever seen.’ She added: ‘The vet thought  the problem might be territorial or behavioural.’ Miss Ulugun has suffered flashbacks since the attack and has  now decided to give Sam up to Battersea Dogs and Cats home. ‘It’s going to be for his best interests and mine,’ she said.","'Psychotic cat' Sam left his doting owner in hospital on a drip .

"Cracked under pressure: Florence Thomson, arriving at Lincoln Crown Court . A grandmother was tasered by police after stabbing her husband 17 times when  she snapped under the pressure of caring for him, a court heard yesterday. Florence Thomson, 78, had just moved home with her husband Keith, 79, who has Alzheimer’s disease, when she ‘flipped’ and repeatedly plunged a carving knife into his chest, causing him horrific injuries. She looked ‘totally deranged’ when her daughter called in by chance after the attack, prosecutors said, and ‘had a wild look in her eyes and was covered in blood’. Police were called, and when Mrs Thomson, who had also begun to  cut herself, refused to put the knife down, they tasered her twice. Mr Thomson, who used to work for electronics firm Ferranti, survived despite his injuries and is being looked after at a care home. He is said to be keen to see his wife. Mrs Thomson, who arrived at court using a Zimmer frame, yesterday escaped a jail sentence for the attack after a judge heard that years of  caring for her husband had taken their toll on her mental health. Lincoln Crown Court heard how Mrs Thomson cracked after the couple moved to a newly built bungalow in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, from another property in the market town. They had been married for almost 40 years but Mr Thomson’s memory had deteriorated severely since 2003. Mrs Thomson was said to have complained in the weeks leading up to the attack that she had ‘lost him’ years before and couldn’t ‘put up with him’ for much longer. After the attack last November, her husband was taken to intensive care in nearby King’s Lynn with ten stab wounds to his chest as well as injuries to his shoulder, hands and right thigh. Mrs Thomson, who suffered minor injuries from the barbs of the taser, told police: ‘I love him to bits. I lost it. I just flipped my lid. You always hurt the one you love and I hurt my husband. It was because of the stress. The pressure of moving house got to me. Please, please, I’m sorry for what I’ve done. I’m not an evil person.’ Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, told the court how on the day of the attack Mrs Thomson’s daughter from a previous marriage, Sheena Pentney, called in to check that  everything was OK. She found her mother in a ‘deranged’ state and  her stepfather lying on the bedroom floor, covered in blood. When police arrived, Mrs Thomson ‘appeared at the doorway still holding the knife’ and moved towards them, Mr Aspden said. She ignored requests to drop it, causing officers to taser her twice before arresting her on suspicion of attempted murder. Psychiatrists who examined Mrs Thomson agreed she was ill at the time she carried out the attack. She pleaded guilty to wounding her husband with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Judge Michael Heath sentenced Mrs Thomson, who had spent five months on remand, to a two-year community order with supervision by probation officers and imposed  an indefinite restraining order which means she can visit her husband only under supervision. 'Unusual and sad case': Lincoln Crown court Judge Michael Heath (pictured) sentenced Florence Thomson to a two-year community order with supervision by probation officers . He said the case was ‘highly unusual and extremely sad’, adding: 'They had been happily married for 40 years and were devoted to each other. ‘In 2003 Mr Thomson began to experience signs of memory loss. He eventually contracted dementia and it got progressively worse. She was his sole carer. ‘Caring for anyone with dementia should not be underestimated. She found herself under a great strain and contracted a depressive illness. 'Plainly at the time of this incident the balance of her mind was disturbed against a background of great domestic upheaval. ‘There are very exceptional cases when justice should be tempered with mercy. This is one of them. 'In almost every case of wounding with intent any defendant who either pleads or is found guilty can expect to receive a sentence measuring in years. 'For reasons I hope are obvious, I am satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the guidelines in this case.’ Mrs Thomson chose to make no comment after the hearing but her lawyer said she was ‘anxious to see her husband’ and that he ‘would like to see her as well’. A neighbour of the retired couple, Jim White, 42, said yesterday: ‘To taser her twice does seem a little bit over  the top. It does make you wonder what the police would have done 20 years ago or so without these weapons.’ But Detective Inspector Dave Rimmer, of Lincolnshire Police, said: ‘The use of the taser was necessary to prevent Mrs Thomson injuring herself further, to prevent her injuring the attending officers but most critically to allow for immediate medical attention to be rendered to her husband. ‘Had the officers not acted so quickly, it is possible the injuries to Mr Thomson may have proved fatal.’","Police taser elderly Florence Thomson twice when she refused to drop the knife after stabbing her husband 17 times .

"A fleet of Russian warships is stationed north of Australia ahead of the G20 summit which kicks off in Brisbane this coming weekend. The Department of Defence has confirmed it is monitoring the four Russian naval ships in international waters in the Coral Sea. The move appears to be a show of force from Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the APEC leader's summit on Tuesday in Beijing. The pair discussed the MH17 tragedy and Abbott demanded an apology and compensation for the victims of the doomed flight from Putin, citing a similar case where the US took these actions after accidentally shooting down an aircraft. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) spoke with Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) during their meeting at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing on Tuesday . A fleet of Russian warships are reportedly on their way into Australian waters . One aide got a front-row seat to the tension between Putin and Abbott in Beijing . The Department of Defence chief Mark Binskin has downplayed the strength of the Russian naval fleet. Asked why Russia was sending four ships to the international summit instead of the usual one or two, he indicated they weren't all warships. Russia had publicised its intent to deploy a task force to the South Pacific a while ago, and an ocean-going tug and an oiler are part of that group. 'So it's just one part of their operations. They're in international waters. They're allowed to do that. And we'll continue to surveil them,' he said. The news comes after the highly anticipated exchange between Mr Abbott and Mr Putin at this week's APEC summit. There were reportedly 'no harsh words' between the two leaders . The force could be in Australian waters outside of Brisbane by the weekend when the G20 summit will be held . The four Russian ships are near Bougainville in the Coral Sea . Among them is the Russian destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov (pictured) While 'no harsh words' were exchanged during the 15-minute meeting, Russia rejected Mr Abbott's demand the Kremlin apologise for the downing of the passenger jet MH17 over Ukraine. The attack resulted in the deaths of 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, and is believed to have been carried out by separatists using Russia equipment. Asked if the ships were a show of force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'You'll have to ask the Russians.'

CEO of Intelligent Risks Neil Fergus said on the Today Show that while it is a show of strength there is ‘not necessarily anything wrong because the fleet will stay out in international waters and doesn’t need permission’. ‘Putin has organised fleets in recent years when he goes to these summits,’ Mr Fergus added, as he explained Putin’s father was in the navy so there are strong family ties. Australian ships HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Stuart have been sent to monitor the fleet. A P3 Orion Surveillance Aircraft has also been deployed to the area to monitor the ships along with an Anzac class frigate, Seven News reported.

Mr Putin and Mr Abbott will have further discussions in Brisbane . When Australian ships reach the Russian fleet Mr Fergus said there will be some ‘polite engagement and navy discourse’. But he stressed ‘there should be no alarm about diplomacy happening on the high seas’. It's not the first time Russian naval vessels have been present while an international summit is on. Russian warships were around for an APEC meeting in Singapore in 2009 as well as former Russian president Dimitri Medvedev's visit to San Francisco in 2010.

Putin is said to have ordered the fleet, and it has been instructed to 'show the flag' on Saturday morning, The Daily Telegraph reported. A senior government source told The Daily Telegraph the intentions of the Russian leader were obvious. 'There is no doubt this is posturing, to show the power of the Russia fleet,' the source said.

"A giant 45 foot cannon so powerful it could launch satellites into space has been revealed by a Canadian inventor. Richard Graf hopes his design, which has a specially developed bore than continually increases the speed of the satellite. Graf believes it could even lead to giant cannons 150 feet long to launch bigger objects. Scroll down for video . An early prototype of the Space Cannon that could one day launch small satellites into orbit . The Starfire space cannon breaks the propellant charge down into a number of smaller increments. These increments are ignited sequentially as the vehicle travels down the 8 inch bore. This gives you much lower pressures and much lower G loadings. the longer the barrel the more efficient the system becomes, claims its inventor. 'Have you ever wanted to fly something into space but you thought that it was too expensive or too complicated to do it yourself ?' he says on the Kickstarter page for the project. 'I used to think that way too, and then I invented the Starfire space cannon.' Graf decided to redesign the traditional cannon for his space cannon. The Starfire gun is an 8” bore by 45 foot long multi-chambered artillery piece that has been custom designed to fire payloads into space. 'The problem with a conventional gun as a space launcher is that it has one big propellant charge and when that charge is fired it produces a very high pressure spike, often 50,000 to 60,000 PSI which drops off rapidly as the projectile travels down the bore,' said Graf. 'These high pressures place high G loadings on a payload, often tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of G’s. 'Launching at high G’s may be OK for simple payloads such as fuel or construction materials but it is not much good for launching payloads that are useful for the average person.' Inventor Richard Graff with the cannon. He believes it could be scaled up to be 150 feet long . Graf's invention breaks the propellant charge down into a number of smaller increments. These increments are ignited sequentially as the vehicle travels down the bore,  resulting in much lower pressures and much lower G loadings. 'One interesting aspect of this technology is that the longer the barrel the more efficient the system becomes,' Graff said. 'The Starfire gun has been limited to 45’ only because of the need to keep it road mobile, but with this technology a barrel twice or even three times as long would be practical.'","45 foot Starfire space cannon could launch small 'cubesats' into orbit .

"Healthy pint: Beer is rich in calcium so could benefit your bones, and full or minerals and vitamins . Amid warnings that we should avoid soft drinks and fruit juice due to their high sugar content, some experts have suggested we drink only milk or water. But another, rather unlikely low-sugar beverage is increasingly being hailed for its health benefits: beer. Research suggests it can help protect against Alzheimer’s disease, aid weight loss and even balance hormones – and now it’s attracting more and more health-conscious men and women. A raft of female celebrities are also embracing the brew. Actress Mila Kunis says her favourite drink is Blue Moon beer, while supermodel Elle Macpherson revealed recently that she washes her hair with it. Even saintly Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow has said she ‘can’t get enough of Guinness’. So what are the benefits of beer, and can it really be good for you? A VITAMIN-PACKED PINT . ‘If you analysed beer you would  be amazed at how many super-nutrients there are in it,’ says Dr Stephan Domenig, medical director of The Original F.X. Mayr Health Centre in Austria. ‘Beer contains  all of the essential – and many of the non-essential – amino acids.’ As well as these protein-building blocks and minerals including phosphorus, iodine, magnesium and potassium, beer is rich in calcium  so could benefit your bones. A study by Tufts University in the United States in 2009 found that moderate beer consumption can protect bone mineral density. For years Guinness was even prescribed to pregnant women due to its high Vitamin B content. ‘It’s  now recommended that pregnant women avoid alcohol but other  people could benefit,’ says nutritionist Vicki Edgson. Choose unpasteurised beer for the greatest health benefits. Pasteurising, or heating to prolong its shelf-life, reduces some nutritional value as the ‘living’ content is removed, says Georgina Young, head brewer at Fuller’s. And cloudy beer is best as filtering removes the yeast and therefore a lot of B vitamins. BANISH THE BELLY . While . high in vitamins, beer is actually low in sugar, high levels of which . have been linked to diabetes and obesity. While a can of Coke contains . seven teaspoons and an orange juice six, half a pint of beer contains . just over one. ‘Compared . with soft drinks, it  will give less of a blood sugar  spike,’ says . nutritionist Dr Kathryn O’Sullivan, who last year carried  out a . scientific review of beer. ‘Beer is about 93 per cent water so it’s . quite hydrating.’ Hop on: Hops have 'aphrodisiac-like qualities' and phytoestrogen found in the plant may help with low libido . In fact, . moderate beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes. A 2010 study . of more than 38,000 men in the US found that when men who rarely drank . beer increased their consumption to one or two glasses a day, after four . years their risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 25 per cent. And despite . the threat of a so-called ‘beer belly’, a study of nearly 2,000 regular . beer drinkers by the University of London concluded it’s unlikely that . moderate intake is associated with large weight gain. ‘Drinking beer increases the production of bile, which helps us to digest fatty food,’ says Dr Domenig. Beer is a rich source of fibre – two glasses provide between ten and  30 per cent of our recommended requirement. Fibre is known to help keep us full and ward off hunger. STAVE OFF DISEASE . Although beer drinking is usually associated with brain fog, research suggests it might help prevent Alzheimer’s. The disease, which affects almost 500,000 people in the UK, has been linked to high levels  of aluminium, but the silicon in beer may offset the damage. A 2008 study published in the journal Food And Chemical Toxicology found the silicon was able to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive tract and slow the accumulation of the metal in the body and brain tissue. But beware of overdoing it:  a University College London study warned that men drinking more than two pints a day could suffer memory loss. Beer could also help heart health. A 2013 study at Harokopio University in Athens found it boosted the flexibility of the arteries. Scientists measured the cardiovascular health of non-smoking men under 35 two hours after drinking 400ml of beer and compared that with drinking vodka or alcohol-free beer. While all three drinks had some beneficial effect on the stiffness of arteries, beer had the greatest benefit. Beer can raise good cholesterol too. ‘The main component that helps protect the heart is alcohol, which raises “good” HDL-cholesterol and has other benefits,’ says Dr R. Curtis Ellison, professor of medicine and public health at the Boston University School of Medicine. However, that’s not a licence to binge. ‘Large amounts of alcohol may cause disease of the heart muscle,’ warns Dr Ellison. Not so bad: Moderate beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes and researchers have found that it is unlikely that moderate drinking is associated with large weight gain . BE BEER-TIFUL . While red wine is known for containing the anti-ageing plant compound resveratrol, beer drinkers also get skin-boosting benefits. Made from barley, beer is rich in ferulic acid, a potent antioxidant shown to protect skin from sun damage. This is also found in tomatoes, sweetcorn and rice bran, but research from Guy’s Hospital in London in 2000 suggests beer contains a more absorbable form. Men given low-alcohol beer absorbed all the ferulic acid present against just 25 per cent absorbed from tomatoes. Studies indicate that darker beers pack a stronger antioxidant punch. Though it’s not just drinking  beer that health fans love. Catherine Zeta-Jones uses it as conditioner, saying: ‘I smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterwards but it’s very good for the hair.’ ‘The hops in beer contain silica which adds lustre, increases volume and fortifies the hair from within,’ says Janey Lee Grace, author of Look Great Naturally... Without Ditching The Lipstick. To condition the hair using beer, she recommends first boiling the liquid to remove alcohol, which can strip hair of natural oils, then mixing it with extra virgin coconut oil. BOOST YOUR LIBIDO . It may not be ‘beer goggles’ getting people in the mood – the hops in beer are said to have aphrodisiac-like qualities. ‘Hops are a wonderful relaxant,’ says Dr Marion Gluck,  an expert in hormonal imbalances. ‘And you don’t need much to get  the benefits,’ she adds. Research shows that the phytoestrogen from hops – oestrogen-like compounds found in plant foods – may help reduce hot flushes, low libido and other symptoms associated with menopause. Beer may help balance hormones in cases of polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and perimenopause, according to Vicki Edgson. ‘The phytoestrogens help to regulate either hormone deficiencies  or excess oestrogen,’ she says, advising that ‘half a pint once or twice a week would be ample to have an effect’. Edgson emphasises it does not work for everyone, though. ‘It should be tried in moderation initially to see whether symptoms are relieved.’","Beer is being hailed for its health benefits and vitamin levels .

"Asbo: Anisha Mitchell, 41, is not allowed to go into the playground after repeatedly abusing other parents . A mother-of-three has been given an Asbo banning her from dropping off and collecting her children from school after more than 100 anti-social outbursts. Anisha Mitchell, 41, is not allowed to go into the playground after repeatedly abusing other parents. She has been banned from going near St Mary's Infant and Junior Schools or Cleeve Secondary School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, for the next five years. In total, 31 people had reported her to police and the council, Cheltenham Magistrates' Court was told. The mother has also been ordered not to cause distress to her neighbours under the Asbo. Mrs Mitchell and her husband Benjamin had . previously had an Asbo imposed in West Sussex at the request of Crawley . Borough Council. The new Asbo, granted on Monday this . week, prevents her from entering the schools' grounds between 6am and . 6.15pm from Monday to Fridays, unless in the case of a 'genuine . emergency'. One neighbour said Mrs Mitchell had been a problem since moving into the area. 'She has fallen out with several residents and there have been some quite nasty incidents,' she said. 'She . is a bully and she seems to pick on the more vulnerable people. Any . attempts to be neighbourly towards her have been completely thrown back . in our faces. Whatever happens we want to have peace on the street . again.' But Mrs Mitchell insisted she was the victim and that she was being picked on. She said problems first started when she trimmed the hedge separating her house and the next door neighbours. Banned: Anisha Mitchell, 41, is forbidden from going near St Marys Church of England Infant School in Cheltenham under the Asbo . 'There are only about five or six people who have problems with me,' she said. 'I am the victim here. In this court of law, the more people who say the same thing, the more leverage they have. 'It has caused a lot of problems for my husband and for my children. They are trying to intimidate me and force me to move out.' Trevor . Gladding, community protection team leader at Cheltenham Borough . Council, said: 'We decided to take civil action as the anti-social . behaviour which has been going on for four years, was not acceptable and . had to stop.'

"A 1,200-year-old Egyptian manuscript tells the story of the crucifixion with incredible plot twists - including the revelation that Jesus could change shape. The ancient illuminated text's claim explains why Judas used a kiss to betray Jesus, since the Christian Messiah had the ability to transform his appearance. It also claims Jesus in fact spent his last supper with the man who ordered his execution, Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, who is said to have offered to sacrifice his own son in Jesus' place. Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper': A newly deciphered manuscript claims Jesus could change shape at will and in fact had his last supper with Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect who sentenced him to death . And it defies the official Easter timeline by putting the day of Jesus' arrest on Tuesday evening, rather than the canonically agreed Thursday. The translation from the original Coptic has been revealed for the first time in a new book by Roelof van den Broek, emeritus professor of the History of Christianity at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. In the commonly-accepted Bible story it is claimed that the apostle Judas agrees to betray Jesus in exchange for cash, then kissed him to reveal his identity. A recently uncovered fragment of ancient papyrus makes the explosive suggestion that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were man and wife, researchers say. The 8cm by 4cm fragment supports an undercurrent in Christian thought that undermines centuries of Church dogma by suggesting the Christian Messiah was not celibate. The centre of the fragment contains the bombshell phrase where Jesus, speaking to his disciples, says 'my wife', which researchers believe refers to Magdalene. In the text, Jesus appears to be defending her against some criticism, saying 'she will be my disciple'. Two lines later he then tells the disciples: 'I dwell with her.' If genuine, the document casts doubt on a centuries old official representation of Magdalene as a repentant whore and overturns the Christian ideal of sexual abstinence. However, since the papyrus emerged last November, scholars have queued up to cast doubt on its authenticity. The newly-deciphered text explains that, far from a sign of affection or guilt, the kiss was Judas' way of forestalling any shapeshifting confusion. 'The Jews said to Judas: How shall we arrest him [Jesus], for he does not have a single shape but his appearance changes. Sometimes he is ruddy, sometimes he is white, sometimes he is red, sometimes he is wheat coloured, sometimes he is pallid like ascetics, sometimes he is a youth, sometimes an old man...' it reads. For a man who could walk on water, raise the dead, feed 5,000 people with just a single loaf of bread and a fish, and turn water into wine, such abilities are perhaps unsurprising. But shapeshifting is not the only superpower the ancient manuscript attributes to Jesus - it also says that he could even turn himself invisible. It claims that on the night before his crucifixion, Jesus ate dinner with Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect who decided his sentence - who, it is said, remarkably offered his son to be crucified in place of the Messiah. Jesus declined the offer, explaining that if he could escape from his fate if he wanted to. 'Pilate, then, looked at Jesus and, behold, he became incorporeal: He did not see him for a long time,' the text says. Later that night, according to the manuscript, Pilate and his wife dreamed of an eagle representing Jesus being killed. The incredible text, which is thought . to be some 1,200 years old, is written in the name of St Cyril of . Jerusalem, although, Professor van den Broek says, it was probably . written by someone else. Back then it was looked after by monks at the Monastery of St Michael in the desert of north-west Egypt, south of Cairo. The . text was rediscovered in 1910 and, the following year, it was bought . along with other manuscripts by the wealthy Wall Street financier JP . Morgan. Morgan's collections were later given to the public and they are now kept in the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City. A scene from the film 'The Passion of the Christ': The new manuscript offers a very different account of the days and events leading up to the death of Jesus from the conventional one given by the Bible . Professor van den Broek told LiveScience that the Bible was already canonised in Egypt by the time the text was written, but that such apocryphal stories nevertheless remained popular among believers. He said he was not convinced that the monk who wrote down the story necessarily believed all the details in it, 'but some details, for instance the meal [Pontius Pilate had] with Jesus, he may have believed to have really happened.' 'The people of that time, even if they were well-educated, did not have a critical historical attitude,' he added. 'Miracles were quite possible, and why should an old story not be true?' Professor van den Broek's book, Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem on the Life and the Passion of Christ, is out now, published by Brill.","Claim explains why Judas used a kiss to betray Jesus, since he could have transformed to foil any attempt at description .
Manuscript also claims that Pontius Pilate offered his own son for crucifixion in place of the Messiah - but Jesus declined ."

"Swiss citizens have voted to impose some of the world's strictest controls on executive pay. Early returns in a referendum revealed 68 . per cent backed plans for shareholders to veto executive pay and for a . ban on big rewards for new and departing managers. The clear majority came as a surprise given fierce opposition and intense campaigning by business lobby group Economiesuisse, which warned the proposals will damage the country's competitiveness and scare away international talent. Support for the move was sparked by anger over the big bonuses blamed for fuelling risky investments that nearly felled Swiss bank UBS, as well as outrage over a proposed $78 million payment to outgoing Novartis chairman Daniel Vasella. Claude Longchamp, of pollsters Gfs.Bern, . said the public outcry last month that forced Novartis to cancel . Vasella's 'golden goodbye' helped drive the campaign. The Swiss vote for stricter rules on execuitve pay was sparked by outrage over a proposed $78 million payment to outgoing chairman of drugs company Novartis Daniel Vasella (pictured) 'It emotionalised and it mobilised,' he said. Thomas Minder, the businessman-turned-politician behind the campaign, says his proposals are aimed at ending a culture of short-termism and rewards for managers of badly-run companies rather than just capping salaries. Despite threats from some executives, Switzerland is unlikely to see an exodus of big companies who have previously been drawn to the country by low taxes, stable politics and business-friendly laws. And companies will seek ways around the new rules to reward executives, just as banks in Europe are looking to soften the impact of a cap on bonuses for top staff agreed by European politicians on Thursday. The Swiss vote comes as the European Union . tries to push through a proposal which will mean bankers bonuses will be capped at a year's pay and a perk of two years' salary could only be paid if a majority of shareholders agreed to it. Downing Street said Prime Minister David Cameron had . ‘real concerns’ about the plans and warned it must not be allowed to . stifle Britain's role as a global banking centre. Chancellor George Osborne (left) is expected to argue against the European Union's plans to cap bankers' bonuses at a year's pay. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) said he had 'real concerns' about the plans . The deal must be signed off by EU . governments before coming into force next year but Chancellor George . Osborne is expected to argue against it at a meeting of European finance . ministers next year. Boris Johnson joined the chorus of British opposition, branding the plans 'deluded' and 'self-defeating'. The London Mayor warned it would . simply play into the hands of the City of London's overseas. Mr Osborne is expected to try to block the plans, claiming it would prevent City firms hiring the best staff, prompting an exodus of top talent to New York. The deal must still be signed-off by EU governments before coming into force in 2014 but the UK is struggling to convince other countries it is a bad idea. If Britain loses its showdown with Brussels, it would mean the most draconian clampdown on fat cats' perks since the financial crisis of 2008. Swiss companies accounted . for five of the top 10 best-paid chairmen in Europe in 2011, but only . the heads of Novartis and Roche made it into the continent's top 10 for . chief executives. While anger at multi-million dollar . payouts for executives has spread around the globe since the financial . crisis, the Swiss system of direct democracy means populist proposals . have a greater chance of implementation. Swiss citizens get to vote on a range of topics in up to four national referendums each year. A few other countries, including the . United States and Germany, have introduced advisory 'say on pay' votes . in response to anger over inequality and corporate excess. Britain is also planning to give shareholders a binding vote on pay and 'exit payments' at least every three years. The near collapse of flagship bank UBS in 2008 stoked anger among Swiss who blamed its heavy losses on rewarding bankers to make risky bets . Thomas Minder's initiative in Switzerland forces binding votes on compensation every year as well as on board composition and would also ban bonus payments to managers if their companies are taken over. The plan also includes possible jail sentences and fines for breaching the new rules. While Switzerland has fared relatively well through the financial crisis, the near collapse of flagship bank UBS in 2008 stoked anger among Swiss who blamed its heavy losses on rewarding bankers to make risky bets. Last year, more than one third of UBS shareholders rejected the bank's plans for executive pay - including a 4 million franc signing-on fee for new German chairman Axel Weber - after a sub-par 2011 profit and a $2 billion rogue trading scandal. The centre-left Social Democrats are already pushing for another referendum on even tougher curbs on executive pay - they want to limit the annual compensation of top managers to just 12 times that of their lowest-paid worker.","People in Switzerland have voted for strict controls on executive pay .

"A 27-year-old woman, who had her leg amputated just four years ago after a motorbike accident, has become a star in India with her remarkable dance moves on one leg. Subhreet Kaur Ghumman, from Ludhiana, India, came runner up on India’s version of Britain’s Got Talent this year but not before she won over the nation with her impressive talents. Her show stopping moves could rival any able-bodied dancer and now the former nurse is touring the world with her talents. Subhreet Kaur Ghumanhas has become famous as India's one-legged dancer after she shot to fame after she appeared on India's Got Talent show . Subhreet wowed the judges and won over the nation when she took to the stage on India's Got Talent . Subhreet (in jeans) who is now famous as one legged dancer is seen here dancing at a competition at her nursing school before the accident in which she lost one of her legs . She said: ‘I always loved dancing but my parents wanted me to study so I worked hard to become a nurse. The accident changed my life; it not only took my leg but it gave me the determination to fulfill my dreams. Now I’m dancing for a living and I love it.’ Subhreet used to only dance in her bedroom when she was growing up; too nervous to perform in front of an audience. ‘I was so shy I couldn’t talk to anyone, I used to talk only when needed. I was a good student and I used to keep my head in my books,’ Subhreet remembers. ‘Dancing was a love of mine but it was never something I thought I’d ever do professionally.’ But in October, 2009, Subhreet’s world was turned upside down. She caught a lift on the back of her friend’s moped after college and just a few miles from home the bike skidded at speed on a sharp corner and both Subhreet and her friend were thrown off. ‘I fractured my knee badly but I wasn’t dying, my life wasn’t in danger thankfully,’ she said. But at the local government hospital Subhreet was left lying in a bed for almost two weeks. Subhreet's mother (right) Charanjeet Kaur Ghuman, 56, and her younger sister (left) Surmeet Kaur Ghuman, 25, supported her throughout her ordeal, which saw her undergo seven operations . Subhreet, here working out in a gym in Chandigarh, had to learn how to walk on one leg and was turned down from numerous dance schools because of her disability . ‘The negligence in a basic government hospital is terrible. My mum begged doctors to treat me, but they just put my leg in a brace and left me. They didn’t even attempt to treat my fracture.’ As Subhreet already had a congenital condition called Arterioenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, doctors were apprehensive about surgery to insert plates to fix her fracture. Eventually Subhreet had the operation on November 5th, 15 days after the accident. But during surgery, a doctor cut a vital vein and Subhreet began to bleed uncontrollably. The surgical team managed to stop the bleeding but cut short the operation. ‘When I woke up and saw my mother’s face I knew the surgery hadn’t gone well,’ Subhreet added. ‘I was devastated. The surgeon’s incompetence meant I now had to wait for the veins in my leg to heal before they could even attempt to fix my fracture for the second time.’ She was sent home to recover but as weeks passed Subhreet’s condition went from bad to worse. ‘I lost all feeling in my leg and slowly my toes, foot and my leg started to turn black. I was bed ridden for more than two months . Infection spread throughout her leg and in the end Subhreet found herself begging her mother to just cut off her leg. Subhreet's determination and spirit meant she eventually Rockstar Academy, in Chandigarh accepted her . Subhreet (centre in pink dress) poses for a photograph with her choreographer (on her right) Sameer Makkar, 28, along with the other students at her dancing school in Chandigarh, India . She said: ‘I turned to my mother and asked her do you think my leg will ever be the same again? She knew the answer. I was sobbing, I was devastated but I knew that I had to cut it off, it was the only option left and the only chance I had of trying to get my life back.’ Her mother Charanjeet Kaur, 56, travelled from one hospital to the next near their home in Jhundan village in Punjab, northern India, begging doctors for their help. Over a time period of 12 months, as Subhreet permanently lay in bed, her mother was looking for a doctor to help her. Finally, Dr Harinder Bedi from the Christian Medical College, in Ludhiana, agreed to do the operation on September 16, 2010, almost a year after the bike accident. Subhreet said: 'It was a huge decision for me but I knew there was no other way. If I wanted to survive I had to cut off my leg. I came to the conclusion it was better to amputate my leg than stay as it was.' ‘When I woke after the operation tears filled my eyes out of pure happiness. That feeling of not having a lifeless leg was amazing.’ The surgery cost Charanjeet 7 Lakh (£7,000) and she had to take out a loan to cover the costs. In total Subhreet needed seven operations before she could learn to walk again. Subhreet (centre) has always loved dancing and was determined to achieve her dreams despite her disability . And this year, feeling positive about the future, Subhreet started reading a lot about disabled achievers. They gave her ideas and hope, inspiration to achieve her own dreams. And she decided to apply for India's Got Talent. She said: 'My friends started ignoring me, people showed sympathy but it was pity. I didn’t want pity. I decided not to fall into darkness but show the world that I was a strong person and continue my passion for dance. My mother was shocked but happily agreed to support me.' Subhreet tried to enroll at dance studios around her home but she was rejected because of her disability. Until eventually Rockstar Academy, in Chandigarh accepted her. Her show stopping moves could rival any able-bodied dancer and now the former nurse is touring the world with her talents . Charanjeet said, 'My daughter was always a fantastic dancer but I had forced her into studies. After the operation, when she told me that she wanted to dance on TV, I was apprehensive but I supported her dreams.' And in February, Subhreet's audition on India’s Got Talent amazed the judges and crowds. She was chosen for the final, but was piped to the show’s first prize by Ragini Makkhar and Naadyog dance group and missed out on a £68,000 cash prize but she is not unhappy, the show has changed her life. Subhreet is now a celebrity in her hometown. She is continuously asked for her autograph and her dance studio is full of well wishers and supporters. She said: ‘My life has changed completely. I have seen the darkest days but now everything seems beautiful. People recognise me when I go out, they ask me for photographs and autographs. It is an amazing feeling.'","Subhreet lost her leg after a road accident in 2009 .

"Someday in the near future, amputees will be able to print an artificial limb with the latest updates in a matter of hours. That's the goal of Italian technology designer, Federico Ciccarese, who has created a unique artificial hand, dubbed 'YouBionic'. The hand uses electrical signals generated from the brain to move mechanical fingers, in the same way that muscles move when neurons are fire off signals. Scroll down for video . Someday in the near future, amputees will be able to print an artificial limb with the latest updates in a matter of hours.That's the goal of Italian technology designer, Federico Ciccarese, who has created a unique artificial hand, dubbed 'YouBionic' (pictured) YouBionic is 3D-printed from nylon dust, meaning designs for the device can be downloaded online and created by anyone who owns a 3D printer. 'We can manufacture the hand and all of its moving components in a single piece and with a single print,' the company writes on its website. In the current designs, electrodes are attached to the muscle of the remaining part of an amputee's arm. These can read brain signals and convert them into the movements of the plastic hand, using a type of microcontroller known as Arduino. YouBionic is 3D-printed from nylon dust, meaning designs for the device can be downloaded online and created by anyone who owns a 3D printer .

'There's electricity in all muscles of our body,' Mr Ciccarese told Lina Zeldovich at Digital Trends. 'When the brain sends an impulse to the muscle, the sensor reads it and translates it into a number proportional to the contraction and then sends this message to the microcontroller.' He told Digital Trends that amputees will be able to update the hardware and software of their limbs in the same way we update our smartphones. But Mr Ciccarese said even healthy humans may be able to use a third limb, for instance when an astronaut is repairing the International Space Station. 'I started this device as a prosthetic, but it can have many applications,' Mr Ciccarese says. 'I hope I can do something for humanity like the Iron Man,' he added.

The system - which is limited to the lab at this stage - has worked for two-and-a-half years in Mr Spetic's case and 18 months for a second patient in the trial Keith Vonderhueval. Similar research involving prosthetic hands has reported sensation lasting one month and - in some cases - the ability to feel began to fade over weeks. Because of Vonderheuval's and Spetic's continuing progress researchers are hopeful the method can lead to a lifetime of use and optimistic a system can be developed for use at home within five years.","YouBionic hand, which is still in development, is printed using nylon .

"Comedian David Walliams is set to lend his distinctive voice to a remake of a 1970s cartoon, bringing Charley the cat back to life in a new series of short cartoons. The creature and his owner featured in TV safety campaigns to help warn households of the dangers lurking in and around their homes. Walliams has joined forces with Electrical Safety First to bring Charley's messages to today's audiences. Scroll down for video . Revival: Comedian David Walliams is the new voice of Charley the Cat, star of the 1970s and 1980s public safety cartoon series Charley Says . Star role: Walliams has teamed up with Electrical Safety First campaign to help promote safety in the home after it emerged around 350,000 people suffer electric shocks each year . The new venture is part of a campaign to reduce the number of accidents in the home, after figures revealed around 350,000 people suffer electric shocks each year. The new set of short films address dangerous mishaps, including overloading electrical sockets around the home with too many devices plugged into the circuit. The first clip shows Charley the cat stepping in to save his owner from an electric shock. Walliams' character ends up burning his paw for his troubles, but is given a fish as a treat for his quick-thinking. The 42-year-old, who is married to model Lara Stone, is taking on the role, which once belonged to DJ Kenny Everett, before he passed away in 1995. The DJ and star of the Kenny Everett Video Show meowed the safety messages as Charley the cat in the original Charley Says series, which aired throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In total six films were made, funded by . the Government, and each tackling everyday safety issues, including . falling in the water, dangers to be aware of in the kitchen, matches and . the importance of not talking to strangers.

Alter-egos: Both personalities are known for their drag alter-egos. Wallaims is pictured as Emily Howard in the hit series Little Britain and Everett (right) in one of his drag roles . A spokesman for Electrical Safety First said while the films are fun and enjoyable for people to watch, they each contain a serious message. He said: 'Although the message is communicated in a fun way through the cartoons, it is still a serious one. 'Overloaded sockets are a major cause of electrical fires. 'Electrical Safety First recommends that, instead of relying on adaptors, you use a registered electrician to add more sockets in your home.' High voltage appliances like dishwashers and washing machines can also cause sockets to overheat. When a socket does overheat there is a risk of a fire igniting and spreading throughout your home.

"The boos rang out around the DW Stadium as Wigan’s alarming slide towards League One continued. Worse still for manager Malky Makay, it was his old club Cardiff City pushing him in the wrong direction. Owner Vincent Tan and his board boycotted the fixture in protest over Wigan’s decision to offer Mackay a route back into football last November following his sacking and acrimonious departure from South Wales 11 months earlier. But the Cardiff players certainly turned up against their old boss, and Aron Gunnarsson – one of the key figures in the team that Mackay led to the Premier League in 2013 – scored the only goal to pile more misery on the Scot.

A fourth home defeat in a row leaves Mackay with a woeful record of just two wins from 17 games in all competitions since taking over, and fighting an increasingly desperate battle to save Wigan from disappearing into League One. They remain nine points from safety with 13 games left to play. He also remains under investigation by the FA over allegations – revealed by Sportsmail – that he sent sexist, racist and homophobic text messages during his time as manager of Cardiff, while Wigan chief Dave Whelan was hit with a £50,000 fine and six-week ban for comments he made in Mackay’s defence. Whelan was missing from his usual place in the directors’ box last night despite completing his ban and returning from Barbados earlier this month, and Wigan filled the seats vacated by Tan and his entourage with members of local charities. Two Cardiff directors made the trip to the north-west and sat with the away fans who chanted Mackay’s name in what was his first meeting with his old club. ‘That was something I’m immensely proud of,’ he said. ‘I had a terrific time in Cardiff and loved being with the people at the football club. I tried my very best for the club at every opportunity. Peter Whittingham  is tackled by Fortune and Kim Bo-kyung during the Sky Bet Championship match . Aron Gunnarsson ensured Bluebirds return to haunt former manager Malky Mackay on Tuesday night . ‘To get that response is something that will live with me. It was lovely and I’ m delighted that they chose to that.’ Mackay was less impressed with the match officials for disallowing two efforts from James McClean and Martyn Waghorn when TV replays suggested that both players were narrowly onside. ‘The referees’ association text me yesterday to apologise on behalf of the linesman for the first goal at Bournemouth. I would imagine there will be another one on the way,’ he added. Kim gets past Gunnarsson but Wigan fell short against Cardiff as their battle to beat the drop continues . The defending that led to Gunnarsson’s goal in the 20th minute summed up Wigan’ s current malaise. There appeared to be little danger when Kenwyne Jones headed the ball down to the Iceland international on the edge of the box, but James Perch and Harry Maguire got in each other’s way in their attempts to tackle Gunnarsson who then beat a third opponent before casually rolling a shot past Ali Al Habsi. Cardiff’s first victory in nine games lifted them 10 points clear of the relegation zone, and manager Russell Slade dismissed suggestions that the build-up surrounding Mackay had any effect on the match. ‘Honestly not at all,’ said Slade. ‘We just prepared exactly the same.

"Grieving relatives visited a morgue to see an uncle who supposedly died only to find him 'wriggling' inside a zipped-up body bag. Valdelucio Goncalves, 54, had been declared dead by doctors who reported he had suffered 'respiratory and multiple organ failure', it was reported today. His family was informed and his body taken to the morgue inside the Menandro de Farias General Hospital in Salvador, northeast Brazil. Thumbs up: Valdelucio Goncalves, 54 (pictured) was declared dead by doctors in Salvador, Brazil, who said he had suffered 'respiratory and multiple organ failure' - but two hours later was found wriggling in a body bag . Two hours later Mr Goncalves' brother Walterio was allowed into the morgue to dress his body ready for his funeral later in the day. But as he approached the body bag, it began moving. He told Brazil's G1 website: 'We had already made all the arrangements for my brother's funeral. 'All I needed to do was put some new clothes on him, so he'd be ready for the undertaker to come and collect him. 'Workers at the morgue let me in, and showed me where he was lying, in a zipped-up body bag. 'But as I got closer I could see it wriggling. Then he saw it raising and falling as if he was breathing. 'I went crazy and shouted for the medical team, the nurse, so they could see what was happening. They checked him and confirmed that he was still alive.' Blunder: Staff at the Menandro de Farias General Hospital have opened an investigation into the incident . Mr Goncalves, who is being treated for stomach cancer, was taken to the hospital by his family on Saturday morning when he woke up struggling to breathe. He is thought to have been declared dead just after 11pm and his brother went to see the 'body' in the early hours of the next day. His niece Patricia Cintra said: 'We were worried about him and thought he'd be better off in hospital, that they'd take better care of him that we could at home. 'It was a shock to all of us when they called to tell us he'd passed away. But we started making the funeral arrangements. 'By Sunday morning everything was sorted. We'd paid for his death notice in a newspaper, bought the coffin and booked his funeral. 'His feet had already been tied together and his nose and ears stuffed with cotton wool.' Mr Goncalves was rushed back to the intensive care unit of the same hospital which wrongly declared him dead. He was transferred to another hospital, Santo Antonio in Salvador, at the request of family members yesterday. Mr Goncalves, who cannot speak, wrote a letter claiming he had been brought back from the dead by Blessed Irma Dulce, a Franciscan Sister who is revered as a saint with miraculous powers in Brazil. He wrote: 'I, Valdelucio, saw death at my feet, but my faith was so great that I was cured. 'Before Irma Dulce I said, do a miracle in me, and she heard my prayer. I saw my mother telling me, son, hold onto her and you will be saved.' The health department for the state of Bahia said today they had opened an inquiry into the blunder. Margarida Mirando, director of the Meandro de Faria General Hospital, said in a statement that she 'will meet with the whole team involved in the patient's care to clarify the chain of events which allowed this to happen.'","Valdelucio Goncalves, 54, was declared dead by medics in Salvador, Brazil .

"Being married could be the key to a longer life - by improving your chances of surviving middle age, claim scientists. People who never married were almost three times as likely to die early than those who had been in a stable marriage throughout their adult life US researchers found. The new research suggests for the first time that not having a spouse in midlife increases the risk of dying during those years. Marital bliss? A spouse could help you navigate middle age . Being single after 40, or losing a partner without marrying again, increased the risk of early death during middle age and cut the chances of getting to 60. Even when personality and risky behaviours such as smoking and drinking were accounted for, married people were still 2.3 times more likely to survive. The new study was carried out by Dr Ilene Siegler and colleagues from the department of behavioural sciences at Duke University Medical Center, North Carolina. She said ‘In sum, having a partner during middle age is protective. ‘Being single or losing a partner without replacement are the situations that increase mortality risk during middle age and decrease the probability that one will survive to be elderly. ‘New research on chronic loneliness may provide a partial explanation for our findings’ she added. Dr Siegler said living to a ripe old age is expected, particularly for people who reach the age of 40, which makes it important to understand why some people do not survive to become elderly. Getting and remaining married has long been associated with better survival, especially for men, but the impact on the risk of dying in middle age has not been previously researched, she said. In a new study, researchers analysed data for 4,802 individuals who took part in the University of North Carolina Alumni Heart Study (UNCAHS) - an ongoing study of individuals born in the 1940s. Those taking part were aged around 40 at the start of the study, and were in their late 50s by its conclusion. They completed four questionnaires at regular intervals. The researchers recorded stability and change in patterns of marital and non-marital status during midlife, and looked at the effect of personality traits during the late teens, socioeconomic status and health risk behaviours. Altogether 238 deaths were reported during the study, including 32 women. Researchers found those who had never married by midlife were at highest risk of death. Previous research has found marriage can help people to survive heart bypasses and lower the risk of Alzheimer's . They were 2.84 times as likely to die early than those who had been in a stable marriage throughout their adult life. Being single, or losing a partner without replacement, increased the risk of early death during middle age by three quarters and reduced the likelihood of surviving to be elderly. Personality and poor lifestyle factors in middle age such as smoking, drinking and taking no exercise slightly reduced the benefits of marriage. The study is published online in the journal Annals of Behavioral Medicine. Being married has a positive effect on lifestyle, say experts, although it does not fully account for the health benefits. Happily married people are more likely to eat more healthily, have more friends and encourage each other to take care of themselves. Being lonely and without companionship may have a bigger effect on single people in middle age, they suggest. A recent huge study carried out in seven European countries found married people enjoy better mental and physical health, and are up to 15 per cent less likely to die prematurely. Meanwhile U.S researchers have found heart . bypass patients with supportive spouses are more than three times as . likely to still be alive 15 years later than those who have never tied . the knot. Plus a Swedish study shows being married protects you against Alzheimer’s in later life, with people who have a partner in middle age at half the risk of developing dementia as those who live alone. Getting divorced and becoming widowed in mid-life raised the risk three-fold. Other work has shown that married people have a better chance of surviving cancer than those who are separated or divorced and tend to live longer than singletons.","Being single after 40 cuts your chances of reaching 60 .

"Ariel Sharon, the Israeli general and former prime minister who proved such a controversial figure across the Middle East for more than five decades, died yesterday. He was 85. Nicknamed The Bulldozer for his tenacious approach to war and politics, Sharon suffered a serious stroke in 2006 and remained in a coma until his death. Scroll down for videos . Iconic: This picture taken on November 16, 2005 shows former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon addressing a press conference in Jerusalem . 'Departed peacefully': Hospital director professor Shlomo Noy today gave a press conference on the former prime minister's death . Led away: Sharon's body is moved on to an ambulance while a policeman stands guard . Departure: Media gathered ahead of the departure, after the hospital confirmed the former prime minister's death this afternoon . Many Israelis will mourn one of their . nation's founding fathers, who fought in all their wars and held almost . every top political post. But millions more will remember him as the Butcher of Beirut, infamously allowing the slaughter of refugees in Lebanon. Perhaps the only point of agreement is that he was one of the central characters in the turbulent drama of the Middle East. Ariel . Sharon was born in 1928 to middle-class parents who had emigrated from . Russia, and he grew up near Tel Aviv. He joined the underground Jewish . army aged 14. Six years later, he fought in the 1948 war of . independence, where he was wounded, then made his name in the new . Israeli Defence Forces.

David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding prime . minister, admired Sharon and asked him to establish an elite commando . unit. Within months, Unit 101 had earned Israel its first condemnation . by the United Nations after a raid on a Jordanian town that left 69 . people dead. But Sharon recovered from the furore and went on to play . key roles in Israel's subsequent wars. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, he . defied orders to take 5,000 men through Egyptian lines, a daring move . that changed the course of the conflict and cemented his heroic status . among Israelis. 'When he decided to go': Gilad Sharon, Ariel Sharon's son, today confirmed the news of his father's death . Upon entering politics, Sharon was renowned as a hawk, . supporting the creation of Jewish settlements in occupied territories. In . 1982, came the moment that made him such a hate figure across the Arab . world when, as defence minister, he ordered Israeli troops into Lebanon. It ended with them besieging Beirut and standing by as Lebanese militia . massacred thousands in refugee camps. Sharon denied responsibility, but . he was sacked as defence minister and condemned by an inquiry. Unexpectedly, . he bounced back to become leader of the right-wing party Likud, and was . elected premier in 2001 on a promise of peace and security after his . provocative visit to a Jerusalem mosque helped spark a Palestinian . uprising.

"A real-life Atlantis which sunk off the coast of Egypt nearly 1,200 years ago has now been brought back to the surface with the help of 3D. The city of Heracleion, home of the temple where Cleopatra was inaugurated, was one of the most important trade centres in the Mediterranean area before it disappeared into what is now the Bay of Aboukir. Heracleion was discovered in 2001, and after more than a decade of excavation, researchers have now been able to create a map depicting life in the ancient trade hub. Scroll down for video . Real-life Atlantis: The sunken city of Heracleion, brought to life by the research team investigating the site 150ft under the sea where it now lays, including the main temple of Amun-Gerb, centre-right . For centuries, Heracleion was believed to be a legend, much like the fabled city of Atlantis. But 12 years ago, underwater . archaeologist Dr Franck Goddio was searching the Egyptian coastline for . French warships from the 18th century battle of the Nile, . but instead stumbled across the treasures of the lost city. After removing layers of sand and mud, . divers discovered evidence of extraordinary wealth, painting a picture . of what life was like in Heracleion, believed to have been at the centre . of Mediterranean trade more than 1,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found remains of . more than 64 ships, buried in the seabed four miles off the coast of Egypt, the largest number . of ancient ships ever to be found in one place. As well as 700 anchors, the . team have dug up gold coins and weights made from bronze and . stone which would have been used in trade and to calculate taxation rates. Secrets of the sea: Three divers inspect the ancient colossal statue of Hapi, the god of the Nile, at the site of the sunken city of Heracleion . Uncovered: Marine archaeologist Frank Goddio shows a stone slap from Heracleion, left,  next to a statue of the Egyptian goddess Isis, found in the sunken city . Ancient: A sphinx from Heracleion has been brought up from its resting place in the Bay of Aboukir . ‘The site has amazing preservation,’ Dr Damian Robinson, director of the Oxford Centre for Maritime . Archaeology at the University of Oxford, told the Telegraph. ‘We are getting a rich picture of . things like the trade that was going on there and the nature of the . maritime economy in the Egyptian late period. 'There were things were . coming in from Greece and the Phoenicians.‘ . The international research team have . also discovered remnants of the legendary temple of Amun-Gereb where . Cleopatra was invested with the power to rule Egypt. The temple was the centre point of Heracleion from which a Venetian web of canals and channels connected other . parts of the city together. Hidden treasure: One of the 16ft statues found in the underwater ruins of Heraclion off the coast of Egypt, depicting an unknown Pharaoh . Historical: A bust found in the mud along the remains of Heraclion which sunk under the Mediterranean sea over 1,000 years ago . Giant 16ft statues have been . reassembled on the seabed 150ft below the surface before being brought ashore, as . well as hundreds of smaller statues of Egyptian gods. Other finds include stone blocks with . both Greek and Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and dozens of sarcophagi . believed to have contained mummified animals offered as sacrifices to . Amun-Gereb. The research team, led by Dr Goddio . have yet to establish what cause the city to go down, but the main theory . is that the unstable sediments Heracleion was built on collapsed, and in . combination with a rising sea-levels, may have caused the entire area to . drop 12 feet straight into the water. ‘We are just at the beginning of our research,’ Dr Goddio told the Telegraph. ’We will probably have to continue working for the next 200 years.’","City of Heracleion sunk into the Mediterranean sea 1,200 years ago .

"Cardiff City's board will not be in attending the club's Tuesday night trip to Wigan Athletic in protest over the alleged racism shown by their former manager Malky Mackay and Wigan owner Dave Whelan. The planned absence is a show of support for Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan, who remains upset over the Football Association's handling of the race rows involving Mackay and Whelan. While Tan did not order his directors to miss the trip to the DW Stadium, board members wanted to show their support for the owner who was labelled a 'chink' in texts sent by Mackay. Cardiff City's directors will be visiting Wigan Athletic due to Malky Mackay and Dave Whelan's alleged racism . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan sacked Mackay in December 2013 . Sportsmail's Matt Lawton exclusively broke the story on Mackay's obscene text messages during his time as Cardiff manager, including references to 'chinkys' and comments about Jews and black people. After hiring Mackay last November, Whelan added to the problem when he said in an interview that it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'chink' and that 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else' - comments that drew a £50,000 FA fine. He also served a six-week ban from all football-related activity although the FA said it was 'satisfied' that Whelan is 'not a racist'. Mackay maintains that he is not racist despite sending messages referring to Tan as a 'chink' Whelan's comments included saying it was 'nothing' to refer to a Chinese person as a 'chink' Mackay, sacked by Cardiff in December 2013, is still under investigation by the FA for the text messages that he admits sending while at the club although he denies being racist, sexist, homophobic or anti-Semitic. The Welsh club have been dismayed that the situation has yet to be resolved. 'I had no sympathy for him after what he had done. He is the man responsible for us being relegated,' Tan said in September. Wigan declined to comment on the planned boycott. The Latics are sitting second-bottom of the Championship with 13 points separating them from Tuesday night's visitors.

"Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has been banned for six weeks from football-related activities over comments he made regarding Jewish and Chinese people but the 78-year-old will not carry out his threat to quit the club. Whelan accepted an aggravated misconduct charge from the FA and has also been fined £50,000, warned as to his future conduct and ordered to undertake a mandatory education programme. However the club issued a statement saying that according to the full findings of the case - which have yet to be made public by the FA - the commission was satisfied that Whelan 'is not a racist'. Sources close to Whelan said that on that basis, he would not quit football. Dave Whelan (left) has been banned for six weeks and fined £50,000 by the Football Association . Whelan previously said he would resign from his role at Wigan if the FA suggested he was racist . Bolton (Away) - January 3 . Birmingham (Away) - January 10 . Blackburn (Away) - January 17 . Huddersfield (Home) - January 24 . Ipswich (Away) - January 31 . Bournemouth (Home) - February 7 . The Wigan chairman has seven days in which to appeal or accept the sanction, which would be suspended until after the outcome of any appeal or would begin immediately if he decides to accept the punishment. The ban would mean he is unable to attend matches, stadiums, club offices or training grounds during the six weeks. The Wigan chairman made the remarks in a newspaper interview defending his decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager. Mackay is the subject of an investigation into alleged racist and anti-Semitic texts sent while he was in charge of Cardiff. Whelan told The Guardian it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'c***k' and stated: 'Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.' Wigan's statement quoted the Commission's findings as saying Whelan 'did not intend to cause offence'. The statement from the club said: 'Wigan Athletic can confirm the findings of an independent regulatory commission following statements made by Chairman Dave Whelan in the Guardian newspaper on November 20. Wigan chairman Whelan will not be allowed to attend his side's next six matches . The Latics are currently languishing in the Championship relegation zone, having won just four league games . 'In summary, the FA Commission concluded that: 'We are satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan is not a racist. We are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan did not intend to cause any offence by his comments. It is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise publicly, plead guilty and begin to make amends'.' Whelan had previously indicated he would resign if the FA even suggested he was guilty of using racist language saying in November: 'Should they even suggest I'm guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.' Simon Johnson, the chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, applauded the FA's sanctions and says he is content that Whelan is not racist and made his comments with no racist intent. 'I accept the FA's decision, they have considered it fully, have come up with their verdict and yes, we accept it,' he told Sky Sports News. 'This is an extremely important decision in the fight against racism. It follows the precedent set in the Nicolas Anelka case, it says the intention of the person making the comment was irrelevant and that the most important thing is the meaning of the words. Malky Mackay (left) is also being investigated over texts exchanged with former colleague Iain Moody . 'This shows the FA is moving towards a position of strict liability for racist comments and it's that development I think is the most welcome. 'I never called for him to resign, that is a matter for him. What we called for was for him to withdraw his comments and apologise. 'He did do that, and I am satisfied, as the FA found, that Mr Whelan is not racist and had no racist intent, but the important thing in the battle against racism in general is that if someone makes a racist comment or action, the most important thing is the plain meaning of what they have done and the impact on the victims, not the intention of the person making it.' The FA said Whelan had breached FA Rule E3[1] in that comments made to the media were abusive and/or insulting and/or constituted improper conduct and/or brought the game into disrepute, and was an 'aggravated breach' as it included 'a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief'. The FA is still investigating a series of texts sent between Mackay and the former head of recruitment at Cardiff, Iain Moody, which it is alleged were discriminatory in nature. Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews added that he was happy with the outcome. 'Dave Whelan accepted the disciplinary charge after making racist comments and the FA have imposed an appropriate penalty, which I welcome. The Board hopes that the outcome of this sad episode will be a widespread determination by players, managers and fans to kick racism out of football,' he said.","Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has accepted an aggravated misconduct charge over comments made about Jewish and Chinese people .

"'Law is biased': Dr Al-Saffar was told he must pay maintenance to his ex-wife . A Muslim hospital consultant was told yesterday that he must pay his ex-wife maintenance even though under Islamic rules he believes he owes her nothing. A judge told Dr Zaid Al-Saffar that he must follow ‘the rule in this country’ and share his money. The Appeal Court decision means Dr Al-Saffar must pay £60,000 to his former wife, academic Hanan Al-Saffar. The ruling sounded a warning to Muslim couples who believe their marriages are ordered according to sharia law and agree to be bound by Islamic courts. Lord Justice Ward told Dr Al-Saffar: ‘The rule in this country is that you share and the starting point is equal division. ‘You came out of the marriage without having made your wife any substantial capital payment.’ He added: ‘Life is sometimes hard; do not be consumed with bitterness.’ But Dr Al-Saffar said after the case: ‘By playing the system and pretending to be a victim she got everything, which I think is totally unfair. ‘Family law in this country is biased against Muslim people.’ The consultant rheumatologist at Scarborough Hospital in North Yorkshire, who is also the head of the Islamic Society in the resort town, was married for eight years, and the couple had two children. The marriage was formalised following the Islamic tradition of Mahr, under which the groom pays a gift to his bride. Because of this, his wife had signed away her share of the couple’s home in Belvedere Road, in Scarborough. Dr Al-Saffar also assumed he had no obligation to make maintenance payments, and that, following Islamic practice, his former wife’s family would support her. However, after the marriage fell apart in 2008, a county court judge ordered him to pay £60,000 to his wife in a hearing to settle the legal terms of their break-up. Dr Zaid Al-Saffar worked as a consultant rheumatologist at Scarborough Hospital in North Yorkshire . Dr Al-Saffar made payments for only four months but then contested the decision. In . the Appeal Court, he told Lord Justice Ward that he had stopped paying . because he had heard his former wife had inherited £250,000 from her . father and had become ‘very, very well off’. Dr Al-Saffar, who represented himself, told the court: ‘I have nothing but respect for the court’s order, but I only stopped paying because all her family were telling me she’s got millions. She doesn’t need it.’ Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams broke open the controversy over sharia divorce in February 2008 when he appeared to recommend giving Islamic law force in English courts. He said in a lecture that the idea that one law could claim the allegiance of every group in the country was ‘a bit of a danger’. He suggested sharia courts might have authority over divorce and financial matters for Muslims. The archbishop added: ‘This introduces into our thinking about law what some would see as a market element, a competition for loyalty.’ The row led to questions over Dr Williams’s future and to a number of senior liberal lawyers backing the call for official power for Islamic courts. Dr Williams and others pointed to Jewish Beth Din courts, which settle disputes among Orthodox Jews, but only when all parties have agreed to be bound by the decisions of the tribunal. However the idea of giving power to sharia courts attracted severe criticism from lawyers and politicians who thought women could be bullied into accepting unfair settlements. But the judge said the doctor had been determined not to pay because ‘he felt the payments were illegitimate or illegal according to Islamic culture’. Lord Justice Ward said: ‘The husband has kept the whole of the capital in the marital home and the wife has not received any of it. ‘In those circumstances the order for spousal maintenance was a perfectly proper and fair order to make.’ The judge added: ‘The husband has to try to understand that inherited wealth is not available for distribution, especially when it comes in after or shortly before the breakdown of the marriage. 'That would not reduce the husband’s obligation to make a proper contribution to his wife.’ ‘I must dismiss this application,’ Lord Justice Ward said. An unknown number of Muslim couples take their family disputes to sharia tribunals, usually run under the umbrella of local mosques. There are said to be around 85 operating in Britain. They operate voluntarily, but critics say women may be disadvantaged if they agree to accept Islamic rules. At present, if a sharia court settles a marriage dispute, an official law court has to approve the arrangement before the divorce is finalised. The judge must decide whether it is reasonable and ensure neither party is disadvantaged. But agreements are submitted to the family court on a form just two pages long. The couple do not need to attend court. The great majority are approved and critics say this process can amount to no more than rubber-stamping. Four years ago Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams caused controversy when he said that full acceptance of sharia courts ‘seems unavoidable’.","Dr Zaid Al-Saffar told he must follow 'the rule in this country'

"Row: Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt says his company doesn't need to pay much tax in Britain . Google was yesterday accused of leaving British taxpayers out of pocket after avoiding more than £200million of tax. The internet giant, which has a history of minimising its contribution to the nation’s coffers, faces a fresh backlash over its financial affairs. Company accounts show that last year Google raked in £2.6billion in revenues from its UK operations, which are officially based in Ireland. But the group admitted it paid only £6million to the Exchequer during 2011. The sum is £218million short of what it should have coughed up, tax experts said. The shortfall deprives Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs of much-needed money to fund public services, leaving ordinary taxpayers to make up the difference. The company has long been accused of doing cosy deals with the taxman to minimise its bill. Google’s UK arm claimed it made only £395million turnover in 2011. But figures released by its parent company in California, Google Inc, show that the UK division had revenues of $4billion (£2.6billion) during the year. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said the company achieved this by registering its UK arm as a services business, which allows it artificially to deflate its real sales figures. It does this by channelling its UK operations – and revenues earned here – as a 'service' to Ireland, where corporation tax is lower. Mr Murphy said the company structures its affairs so that minimal tax is payable. 'The company generated 11 per cent of its sales in the UK,' said  Mr Murphy. British profits based on the global pre-tax figure would therefore be £845million, he added. Home: Google has its headquarters in London, pictured, but paid a small amount of tax again this year . 'The . anticipated tax rate on this would be 26.5 per cent, which would give . rise to taxes due of £224million. And instead it paid £6million, which . is £218million gone astray needing to be accounted for.’ He said the . group is 'ignoring its own maxim of “do no evil” and is inconsistent . with its own social goals'. It is not the first time the company’s tax contribution has come under scrutiny. In 2010 it paid £5million in tax, despite making sales in the UK of £2.1billion.

"Having less than six hours sleep a night can cause serious health problems . Turn off the iPad in bed if you want to avoid getting fat, warn researchers. Lack of sleep caused by the stimulation of electronic devices ranging from portable computers to gaming devices could be fuelling obesity, it is claimed. Even watching TV before dropping off has been linked to sleep difficulties that can trigger health problems, says a new research review from scientists. They are calling on doctors to 'prescribe' a good night's sleep because it may prevent common metabolic disorders, including growing numbers of cases of type 2 diabetes. Millions of Britons - around one in four adults - have sleeping difficulties and up to one in 10 has an insomnia disorder that can affect their everyday lives through fatigue and mood disturbances. Research shows people who have between six and eight hours sleep a night are likely to live longer and have better health, while those getting less than six hours are more at risk of dying prematurely. Scientists at Surrey University found just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress, immunity and inflammation. Sleep deprivation has long been known to affect brain function, reducing alertness and cognitive ability, and in recent years has been thought to contribute to physical illnesses. Experts believe poor sleep directly disrupts insulin levels, a hormone that regulates energy through the body's fat cells. Using electronic devices, such as laptops, shortly before bed can disrupt healthy sleep patters, a study claims . A new research review in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, says experimental studies are showing a direct causal link between sleep loss and the body's ability to metabolise sugar, control food intake, and maintain energy balance. German and Swiss scientists report that disruption of the body's natural sleeping and waking cycle by shift work may contribute to chronic illness and early death. But lifestyle factors in 'globalised 24hour societies' are interfering with people's sleep quotas, claim the scientists, led by Professor Bernd Shultes, from the eSwiss Medical and Surgical Centre in St Gallen. He said 'voluntary sleep curtailment' is commonly caused by the use of technical devices for gaming, online shopping, social networking or watching television. 'Programmes of sleep education and cognitive behavioural therapies focusing on improved sleep hygiene might represent promising approaches to induce behavioural changes' he said. Even as babies, children who do not get enough sleep eat far more than those who sleep a healthy amount . Such targeted interventions could help curb the present epidemic of the metabolic syndrome and related diseases. 'Ongoing and future studies will show whether interventions to improve sleep duration and quality can prevent or even reverse adverse metabolic traits. 'Meanwhile, on the basis of existing evidence, health care professionals can be safely recommended to motivate their patients to enjoy sufficient sleep at the right time of day' he added. Young children who sleep less eat more, which can lead to obesity and related health problems later in life, reports a new study by University College London (UCL) researchers. The study found that 16 month-old children who slept for less than 10 hours each day consumed on average 105kcal more per day than children who slept for more than 13 hours. This is an increase of around 10 per cent from 982kcal to 1087kcal. A new study, published in the International Journal of Obesity, is the first to directly link sleep to energy intake in children under the age of 3 years. The study, funded by Cancer Research UK, involved 1303 UK families, monitoring sleep when children were 16 months old and diet at 21 months old. 'We know that shorter sleep in early life increases the risk of obesity, so we wanted to understand whether shorter sleeping children consume more calories' said Dr Abi Fisher of the Health Behaviour Research Centre at UCL. 'Previous studies in adults and older children have shown that sleep loss causes people to eat more, but in early life parents make most of the decisions about when and how much their children eat, so young children cannot be assumed to show the same patterns. 'The key message here is that shorter sleeping children may be prone to consume too many calories,"" says Dr Fisher. "" 'Although more research is needed to understand why this might be, it is something parents should be made aware of' said Dr Fisher. It is thought the regulation of appetite hormones may become disrupted by shorter sleeping patterns.","Lack of sleep can cause serious problems with mental and physical health .

"Our cities are constantly growing, changing and evolving to meet the demands of swelling populations. But how they look today is just one final outcome from many thousands of possible plans that would have been submitted and dismissed over the years. This collection of maps of some of our best-known cities in the world shows how they could have looked today if these plans had been followed through. In a 1948 plan, left, for a San Francisco highway, we see how, just like most of America's main cities, there were plans to completely carve up the city by the post-war highway building frenzy. Today, some of the city's central park areas would be completely different had the dotted-red express highway plans gone ahead . Some might argue that planners decades ago were short-sighted in not following these ideas through - particularly, perhaps, in Los Angeles where one proposal to build a fast and direct interconnected subway was halted even after tracks had been laid and tunnels dug. The 1925 Rapid Transit Plan for the city and County of Los Angeles began being put into place, with the digging of trolley tunnels and the laying of some tracks. But all that was halted with the expanded use of the motorcar. Today, however, much of this plan has now been seen through, with the current subway system following many of these original routes. If the subway lines are expanded out as is planned, LA will eventually have a transport system first designed 78 year ago. In fact, transport systems appear to be the main submissions among this collection of urban plans, that have been debated and dismissed at the local authority level. In Lower Manhattan, the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up in 1966, left, to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house, including the development of the World Trade Centre. Right, as it is today . This collection of maps forms part of a . project by Andrew Lynch, which explores 'unrealised', or 'hyper-real' cities through the many plans that have been considered by officials but . never adopted. His Tumblr . project refers to the cities that never were as 'dream cities' and he . likes to imagine what life would be like in each urban metropolis if . different decisions had been made.

However, with the subsequent stock market crash a few months after the mayor's plans were submitted, the ambitious expansion plans were dropped. Right, today's subway system in the area .

In Lower Manhattan, the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house, including the development of the World Trade Centre. Superblocks built on landfill would extend the footprint of the island into the East River, according to WIRED. The plans included new houses and offices, and new underground highways aimed to pull traffic off the streets.

The dictator commissioned Albert Speer, his chief architect, to design a capital named Welthauptstadt Germania which translates to 'World Capital Germania', worthy of such an empire, according to WIRED. Speer planned a vast north-south parade route with an underground highway. At one end would be a massive new train station; at the other a gigantic Volkshalle, or 'People's Hall' would have been the largest indoor space by volume. In the middle of the parade an enormous, 1,000ft tall arch, large enough to stand over Paris's Arc de Triomphe would tower.

"Australia has a new marine animal in its waters, one which scientists have been debating the existence of for years. The Australian Humpback Whale has been determined as its very own species, and this week was given its scientific name - Sousa sahulensis. One of four humpback dolphins, the Australian variety can be identified by its darker skin and its unique dorsal fin, which sits lower on the body. The Australian Humpback Whale has been determined as its very own species, and this week was given its scientific name - Sousa sahulensis . It grows to around nine feet long, or 2.7 metres, - a similar size to the Bottlenose Dolphin - and is shyer than its relatives, according to RYOT. A study by the Wildlife Conservation Society last year concluded that there were four species of humpback dolphins, with one found in Australian waters, two more in the Indonesian-Pacific Ocean and the fourth in the Atalantic region. However the Australian humpback dolphin was only given its name on Thursday, following the release of a study from the Society for Marine Mammology. The Marine Mammology study states: 'A review of multiple lines of evidence from skeletal morphology, external morphology, coloration, molecular genetics, and biogeography, in combination provides strong support for the recognition of four species of Sousa. 'Finally, We describe a new species of Sousa, the Australian humpback dolphin, which occurs in the waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to southern New Guinea. One of four humpback dolphins, the Australian variety can be identified by its darker skin and its unique dorsal fin, which sits lower on the body . 'It is separated from the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin by a wide distributional gap that coincides with Wallace's Line (a faunal line which separates Australian and Asian organisms)'. Prior to this study being released, there was debate over whether there was only one, possibly two species of humpback dolphins. Lead author of the paper Dr Thomas Jefferson of Clymene Enterprises, told IFLScience any confusion over how many varieties of the species there were could now be put to bed. 'We've finally managed to settle many long-standing questions about humpback dolphins - particularly how many species actually exist - using a huge body of data collected over two centuries and analyzed with the latest scientific tools'. The splitting of the species into four varieties could see each type be classes as endangered, with the population of each humpback dolphin species likely to be low.","Australian Humpback Dolphin has been named as its own species .

"White British children will be outnumbered in state school classrooms in England within 23 years, research reveals. Population trends since 2004 have seen ethnic minorities soar by 61 per cent in primary and secondary schools as the number of white Britons dropped by 12 per cent. The findings in a Department for Education report suggest increased immigration and falling birth rates will see classroom demographics shift dramatically by 2037. Scroll down for video . Shift: Population trends in the last decade suggest white British pupils will be a minority by 2037, a report says . White British pupils aged five to 18 are already a minority in many on the UK's major cities. The indigenous population has dropped from 5.4 million pupils to 4.8 million in just ten years - with the most notable changes seen in schools in London and Birmingham. Meanwhile, the number of pupils from ethnic minorities has risen from 1.14 million to 1.83 million in the same period. The biggest ethnic-minority group in English schools is of Asian-origin with just under 670,000 pupils. Black British and white non-British are the next biggest group, with almost 360,000. And there are 320,000 mixed race children in English classrooms. The figures come a month after a study revealed white teenagers are the least likely group to apply to university after being overtaken by black pupils. Rising numbers from all ethnic groups are setting their sights on a degree but white teenagers are less likely to apply than black, Asian or Chinese pupils. The statistics also show that pupils on free school meals due to family poverty are half as likely to seek a place as their more privileged peers. The figures come after studies revealed a rise in immigration and falling birth rates among white Britons . Just one in seven schoolboys on free meals is aiming for university. The analysis from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service examined applications from 18-year-olds at England’s state schools to start university this autumn. It shows that 31 per cent of white teenagers applied – compared with 61 per cent of Chinese, 45 per cent of Asian and 39 per cent of black. The report compares the figures with those from 2006 and finds that demand among black teenagers has overtaken the proportion of white pupils applying. While the application rate of white teenagers rose from 25 to 31 per cent, black pupils increased their applications more rapidly, from 24 per cent to 39 per cent. ‘Application rates for all groups are higher in 2014 than in 2006 with the largest increase being for the black ethnic group,’ the report said. The findings will focus fresh attention on under-achievement among white working-class pupils, who are fast falling to the bottom of the educational heap.

"A hate-filled note attached to the doors of a synagogue has branded Jews as 'child murderers' in the latest of a spate of anti-Semetic attacks in Britain. Samuel Landau, 26, the rabbi at Kingston, Surbiton and District Synagogue in Surrey, arrived this week to find the sick message attached to the entrance. The father-of-one says he now feels threatened and has condemned those who 'tar everybody with the same brush'. Scroll down for video . 'Child Murderers': The hate-filled message was attached to the doors of Kingston, Surbiton and District Synagogue in Surrey . Fear: Rabbi Samuel Landau, 26, who called the police when he found the note at the doors of the synagogue (pictured) said he no longer feels safe . The number of anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish people in Britain soared in July, believed to be because of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. One incident saw vandals target gravestones at a cemetery in Rochdale, Manchester . Statistics show that 304 anti-Semitic . incidents were reported in the UK between January and June - a 36 per . cent rise compared to the same period a year ago. Mr Landau, a trainee criminal psychologist, called the police when he saw the note and  believes he is at risk of similar attacks. 'When the distinction between Palestine and Israel motivates you to behave in such a way - with no thought to debate or discussion - I think that is worrying,' he said. 'I am disappointed the society we live in is not able to process and think things through and tars everybody with the same brush. I feel less safe.' Rabbi Landau,  who presides over Sabbaths through the week, said offensive material had previously been put up outside the synagogue some years before when Israel had been involved inprevious conflicts. He added: 'It is not something out of the blue. I look like a Jew when I walk down the road in Kingston and several people have shouted out of their car at me, so this does not seem out of place.' The Community Security Trust have recorded 130 attacks on British Jews  since the start of the Middle East conflict on July 8, which has so far killed more than 1,400 Palestinians and about 60 Israelis. Mark Gardner, a spokesman for CST, said: ‘There is no excuse for this wave of racist intimidation and violence and we call upon all good people to unequivocally condemn it.’ Tens of thousands of Britons have taken part in protests in London and other cities against the Israeli action. Pro-Palestinian activist groups stress that they oppose Israeli government policy and are not hostile to the Jewish people. Some of the signs at protests have however been distinctly anti-Jewish. Although the overall total of anti-Semitic incidents this year has increased, there were fewer violent assaults recorded - down 32 percent to 22, and the vast number of incidents related to verbal abuse, graffiti and abuse via social media. The number of recorded incidents had been falling in recent years from a high in 2009, which was also sparked by conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza when politicians said that British Jews faced a ‘real and growing danger"". This month's surge in incidents has also provoked concern. The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual head of the world's 80 million Anglicans, voiced unease at the impact of the conflict in Gaza. The number of anti-Semitic incidents has risen since the start of conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . ‘While it is acceptable to question and even disagree with particular policies of the Israeli government, the spike in violence and abuse against Jewish communities here in the UK is simply unacceptable,’ he said in a statement. ‘We must not allow such hostility to disrupt the good relations we cherish among people of all faiths.’ MP John Mann, chairman of a parliamentary group against anti-Semitism, said the latest report was troubling. ‘From the feedback we are receiving, it is likely that the volume of anti-Semitic incidents will increase significantly before the year's end,’ he said. Jewish people in Britain are enduring a backlash of attacks, bomb threats and anti-Semitic insults fuelled by the bloodshed in Gaza. A total of 130 hate crimes were recorded by police and community groups in July, more than double the usual number. In several disturbing cases attackers have invoked the Holocaust and even shouted: ‘Heil Hitler’ at victims. A rabbi was attacked by four Muslim teenagers outside a Jewish boarding school in Gateshead in one of the most serious incidents. In Belfast, bricks were thrown at the city’s only synagogue, smashing windows on two consecutive nights. Jewish people in Britain are enduring a backlash of attacks, bomb threats and anti-Semitic insults fuelled by the bloodshed in Gaza. Pictured: Protesters gather in Westminster to protest against the ongoing conflict . Groups of Asian men chanted 'Heil Hitler’ as they drove through a Jewish area of Manchester, throwing missiles at passers-by. In north London, one pro-Israel organisation received a telephone bomb threat and a Jewish boy riding a bicycle had a stone thrown at his head by a woman in a niqab. Peaceful protests against the violence have also been marred by vile placards including one declaring: ‘Hitler you were right!’ At a Central London march, protesters confronted a Jewish woman with her two young children and told them: ‘Burn in hell.’ There has been also been an explosion of anti-Semitic abuse on social networks, including Facebook and Twitter. One man called for a Jewish neighbourhood in London to be bombed so ‘Jews feel the pain’ of the Palestinians. In a separate incident, a BBC journalist was reprimanded after seeming to suggest western politicians failed to intervene in the Middle East because they had been ‘bought’ by the Jews. The surge in attacks and threats follows a similar trend in 2009, when up to 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the Gaza war.","Message was stuck to Kingston, Surbiton and District Synagogue in Surrey .

Even though the creature, found in a single province in Panama, is perfectly healthy, it looks 'on the point of death', he said. Its population is under the same threat as the tiger, but the toad is not held in the same affections.

"The New York newspaper that . sparked controversy after publishing the names and addresses of nearby gun permit owners is now taking up arms in an apparent response to threats.

The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of . pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just . north of New York City in an interactive map on its website. Targeted: The Journal News published the names and addresses of people in the area with legal gun licenses . The Rockland County Times reported on Tuesday that Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days. The paper hired the increased security from RGA Investigations & Security, a firm based in New City that provides services like protection and security guard certification, according to the Times. The news came just days after the Journal News announced plans to publish an expanded list of  even more permit-holding locals. Along with an article entitled 'The . gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your . neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 . shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, . editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said. Naming names: The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just north of New York City in an interactive map on its website . The next batch of names will be . permit holders in suburban Putnam County, New York, where the county . clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information. Some 44,000 people are licensed to . own pistols in the three counties, the newspaper said. Owners of rifles . and shotguns do not need permits, the newspaper said. The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners. 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' Republican state Senator Greg Ball of . Patterson, New York, said he planned to introduce legislation to keep . permit information private except to prosecutors and police. Calling for change: The paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the Newtown shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and there were protests across the country (pictured) A similar bill that he introduced earlier as an Assemblyman failed in the state Assembly. 'The asinine editors at the Journal . News have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet . letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region,' Ball wrote . on his Senate web site. The newspaper's editor and vice . president of news, CynDee Royle, earlier in the week defended the . decision to list the permit holders. 'We knew publication of the database . would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we . could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of . the Newtown shootings,' she said. Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. Howard Good, a journalism professor . at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City . 'It doesn't move the issue of gun . control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a . contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.'

"A Second World War re-enactment has brought Dad's Army back to life just as hype over the wildly popular TV show's film adaptation begins to build. The annual Pickering Wartime and 1940s Weekend is running this weekend, with some of its participants bearing an uncanny resemblance to two of the beloved characters from the classic British comedy - Lance-Corporal Jack Jones and Commander Chuck Mainwaring. Wartime and history enthusiasts dressed as  British, German and U.S. soldiers sent Pickering Showgrounds, in Yorkshire, back in time to celebrate everything 1940s in a surreal recreation of Britain during the Second World War. The festivities today included an Eastern Front re-enactment, set in Autumn 1942 as the German troops invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, and a Western Front battle re-enactment - complete with sound effects and pyrotechnics - of the 1944 liberation of Europe.

John Howard, 26, from Manchester, dressed as a soldier from the U.S. 101st Airborne, complete with a recreation grenade and pistol . Although the original Dad's Army TV series featured no women in leading roles, in the new film actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has been lined up to play a glamorous journalist. The remake will begin shooting this month in Yorkshire and has been picked up by Universal Pictures, which means that it will be distributed worldwide. Toby Jones – who appeared in The Hunger Games – will play Captain Mainwaring, with Love Actually star Bill Nighy taking on the role of Sergeant Wilson. Starring alongside them will be Michael Gambon as the frail medic Godfrey, Tom Courtenay as Jones and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison – who will play Private Pike. The bumbling teenager was originally played by Ian Lavender, who at 68 is the only one of the original cast still left alive. Frank Williams who played the Reverend Timothy Farthing, the vicar of St Aldhelm's Church, joined the programme in the second series and is going strong at 83. The film will be directed by Oliver Parker, whose previous projects include a remake of St Trinian’s, and produced by Damian Jones, whose credits include The Iron Lady. Along with the cast list, a few details about the film’s plot have been released, revealing that the remake will be set in 1944 near the end of the Second World War, when morale among the Home Guard is low. The journalist played by Catherine Zeta-Jones proceeds to set the Home Guard’s pulses racing when she is sent to Walmington-on-Sea to write about their attempts to root out a spy.

A statement detailing the new film's plot outline explains: ‘Their new mission to patrol the Dover army base is a great chance to revive spirits and reputation, that is until glamorous journalist Rose Winters arrives to write about their exploits, putting the local women on red alert. ‘MI5 then discover a radio signal which was sent direct to Berlin from Walmington-on-Sea. ‘There’s a spy on the loose! The outcome of the war is suddenly at stake, and it falls to our unlikely heroes to stand up and be counted.’ Dad’s Army ran from 1968 to 1977 and attracted 18million viewers at its height, with the original cast making their own film in 1971.

So far fans have been skeptical about the remake, with Adam Ward writing on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can’t remake Dad’s Army. Oh please don’t ruin one of our greatest ever comedy shows.’ Paul Oscroft added: ‘Unbelievably great British cast for the new Dad’s Army film – but still dubious about a remake.’ But producer Mr Jones has promised that the film will remain faithful to the spirit of the original show, which is considered a classic of British comedy. The film will be a comeback for 45-year-old Zeta-Jones, whose career has taken a back seat recently while she sought treatment for bipolar disorder.

"A Madison County Justice Court judge has been indicted and arrested over allegations he struck a . mentally disabled man and used racial slurs while working as a security . guard at an event in Canton. Judge Bill Weisenberger turned himself in to the Madison County Sherif's office, authorities said. Last year, the family of the 20-year-old African-American man, Eric Rivers, filed a police complaint against Weisenberger in . connection with the May 8 incident at a flea market. Madison County Justice Court Judge Bill Weisenberger was indicted today for allegedly assaulting a mentally disabled black man in 2014 . 'The law does not discriminate, and the Grand Jury has given us our marching orders,' Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood told the Jackson Free Press. 'The law does not discriminate. We look forward to presenting the facts of this case in court.' Weisenberger was released on a $10,000 bond and could be put behind bars for five years if convicted. Witnesses told The Clarion-Ledger that Weisenberger, who is white, struck the young man and yelled racial slurs, telling the man to 'Run, n-----, run.' William Truly of a Mississippi NAACP chapter said Weisenberger should stop hearing cases or resign pending an investigation.

Her sister, Tammy Westbrook, also of . Tuscaloosa, told the newspaper she saw Weisenberger “rear back and slap” Rivers twice and use a racial epithet as the Rivers ran. “No citizen should have to face justice before . a judge who holds such a high degree of racial animus and hatred,” Truly said in a news conference Friday.","Local NAACP officials have called for Judge Bill Weisenberger to step down or cease hearing cases until a full investigation is complete .

"These dramatic images show three Muslim siblings attempting to kidnap and rob their sister's lesbian lover after they found out about the relationship. Sarah Harrison, 35, was targeted as she left work in Blackburn, Lancashire. As she was attacked, one of the siblings shouted: 'you've messed with the wrong Muslims.' The women's sister Nazma Ditta, 27, one of six sisters and three brothers, had been due to enter into an arranged marriage. Scroll down for video . This dramatic picture shows CCTV footage of (clockwise from left) Atfah Ditta, Nighat Morris, Ghazala Ditta attacking their victim shop manager Sarah Harrison after they found out about her relationship with their sister . Miss Harrison can be seen struggling with her attackers and attempting to run away. The woman had been secretly seeing their sister Nazma Ditta for several months . But Nazma had begun a secret relationship with Miss Harrison when both women worked at a clothes shop in the town. Miss Harrison was confronted by sisters Atfah Ditta, 32, and Ghazala Ditta, 31, who got out of a parked silver Toyota Corolla car on June 20 last year. They were joined by another sister Nighat Morris, 38, and brother Tahmoor Ditta, 26, who produced a metal tool which he brandished at a work colleague of Miss Harrison. The three women then assaulted Miss Harrison who was dragged around by her hair and kicked as they tried to force her into the car. Miss Harrison, seen struggling with the women, and Miss Ditta met while the two worked at a shop in Blackburn . A sibling reaches for Miss Harrison's hair. One of the gang said 'you've mess with the wrong Muslims. We are going to kill you' during the terrifying attack . One of the women shouts at Miss Harrison to get in to the car. She was repeatedly hit in the face and the arms during the stuggle . The victim was repeatedly punched in the face and to her arms in an effort to remove her handbag and force her into the vehicle. Her bag was taken from her but she managed to prevent herself being dragged into the car by holding on to its sides. She was left standing at the side of the road as the group got back into their vehicle and drove away. In the days leading up to the attack, members of the Ditta family had confronted the victim at her workplace and asked her about the whereabouts of their sister. They also asked her work colleagues about where she parked her car and waited at various locations for her to leave work. Miss Harrison later told police: 'I can't work comfortably now and I think about people throwing acid in my face. Anyone Asian I don't know could be associated with the people who attacked me. I have trouble sleeping. 'I feel uncomfortable sleeping on my back because of where I was kicked. My temple still hurts from where I was punched. I have a permanent reminder of the attack by the scar under my eye. Tosif Ditta (left) and Nayarr Mehmood (right) pictured arriving at Preston Crown Court today . The family are now banned from attempting to contact their sister and Miss Harrison . 'I have to sell my house and move somewhere where Nazma's family won't find us. I have had to find a different job which is not easy because I loved my work.' Today the siblings appeared at Preston Crown Court. Ghazala Ditta, Atfah Ditta and Nighat Morris pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiracy to commit actual bodily harm, attempted kidnap and robbery. They were all jailed for five years and four months. Tahmoor Ditta pleaded guilty to the above charges and also admitted assault and possession of an offensive weapon and was sentenced to six years. Two other sisters, Tosif Ditta, 35, and Nayyar Mehmood, 37 had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit actual bodily harm and were imprisoned for three-and-a-half years. The children's mother, Rani Ditta, 55, had been charged with conspiracy to kidnap but in November the prosecution offered no evidence against her. The court heard Nazma was only girl in her family who was unmarried and several potential suitors had been found for her. Tamoor Ditta (left) was jailed for six years and Tosif Ditta for three and a half years at Preston Crown Court . But she had already begun a relationship with Miss Harrison after meeting at the USC clothing store in Blackburn shopping mall. Nazma was so fearful of being discovered, she spent six months secretly and slowly moving her belongings into Miss Harrison's home 26 miles away in Blackpool so it wouldn't be noticed. Prosecutor Mr Richard Haworth said: 'The family had a traditional arranged marriage planned for her and had already suggested a suitor, her cousin to whom the family believed she was betrothed but whom she had already rejected.' Suspicions about the lovers began after a niece of Miss Ditta spotted messages and photos shared on her relative's mobile phone. Miss Ditta denied an affair but was ordered to stop any sleepovers at the homes of friends. A date was set for her wedding which Nazma agreed to - whilst secretly planning to leave. Mr Haworth added: 'There had already been regular discussions about marrying off Nazma. 'But knowing that the family would react very badly to the news that she was gay and that she was in an ongoing relationship, Nazma had been slowly moving her belongings from the family home over to Miss Harrison's property. Atfah Ditta, (left) one of the women who attacked Miss Harrison, got five years four months as did Ghazala Ditta . 'She further decided to terminate her employment and moved into Miss Harrison's property. 'She left a note to inform her family she had got a new job in Manchester and was moving out. She left her email address as her contact details and changed her phone number.' Nazma's family later went to the shop asking about her whereabouts and repeatedly emailed her until she confessed she was gay. A family meeting was later held at a coffee shop in Blackburn during which Miss Ditta said she would not get married but agreed to return home to say her goodbyes. When she left again she received text messages from her brother Tasawar saying: 'I am dead to you. Delete my number I hope you're happy with sarah.' Her sister Ghazala sent a message saying: 'selfish stupid bitch. Just wait till I get hold of you.' Later members of the family confronted Miss Harrison at her workplace, asking her about the whereabouts of her partner. They also asked her work colleagues about where she parked her car and waited at various locations for her to leave work. Nayyar Mehmood (left) got three and a half years and Nighat Morris got five years four months . Mr Haworth said: 'The attack was virtually all captured on CCTV. The three sisters simultaneously attacked and attempted to physically bundle Miss Harrison into the back of the car. 'She was punched and kicked and had her hair gripped and pulled repeatedly. 'Both Miss Harrison and Shah Ahmed refer to the family saying ""get her in, get her in, you've messed with the wrong Muslims, we're going to kill you"" and ""get her bag, get her bag"". 'The attack on Miss Harrison was a brutal sustained and a pre-planned group action and it nearly succeeded. All claimed they acted out of concern for their sister. Defence lawyer Adam Watkins, defending Tosif, said: 'She did what she did out of a misjudged sense of what was right for her sister. It was a misguided sense of love. Graham Blower for Nayyar said: 'This would have happened to Miss Harrison if she was Mr, Mrs, black, white, pink or orange.' But Judge Graham Knowles QC said: 'This is a case about power and contol. It is about striking terror and attempting to control not just the body but the will. This was a group ambush and you struck with the terror that all of you intended.'","Nazma Ditta, 27, entered into secret relationship with Sarah Harrison, 35 .

Today's search was frustrating because 'there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud,' Flight Lieutenant Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions. Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because 'we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody.

"Environment Agency staff were told to stay away from a flood-hit area because they were abused by members of the public when they tried to help, it has emerged. Staff were abused in the Wraysbury area of Berkshire and were told to retreat by police. They have now been told to report any further abusive incidents to the agency.

Justin Bowden, national officer of 'Briatin's General Union' the GMB said that widespread criticism of the EA by politicians, including Eric Pickles, had prompted the abuse.

'GMB members have been working double and triple shifts around the clock to protect and assist.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, now put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by David Cameron, said Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith should make a public apology for its mistakes. And asked whether Lord Smith, a former Cabinet Minister, should resign, Mr Pickles said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision.’ He accused Lord Smith of playing ‘divide and rule’ by ‘trying to set town against country’, letting the EA become ‘riddled with politically correct’ eco-fanatics opposed to dredging, presiding as the organisation ‘lost its way’ and spending 20 times more money on its bloated bureaucracy than on keeping rivers clear.

"A two-year-old girl was shot to death by Syrian soldiers to prevent her from growing up to be a demonstrator, a United Nations probe said today. The toddler was one of hundreds of children who have been murdered by troops since the government in March started a crackdown on the protest movement that has swept through the Middle-East. As of early November, government forces have killed at least 256 children and committed other 'crimes against humanity', according to  the report by a panel of independent experts. A giant portrait of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is carried in a sea of thousands of pro-government demonstrators in Damascus today. A UN report today claimed government forces have killed at least 256 children and committed other 'crimes against humanity' The study said that men and boys have been sexually tortured at military detention facilities. 'Torture was applied equally to adults and children,' said the panel's report to the UN Human Rights Council. Among its details were that 'numerous testimonies indicated that boys were subjected to sexual torture in places of detention in front of adult men.' The panel said government forces used excessive force to 'shoot indiscriminately at unarmed protesters' while snipers targeted others in the upper body and head. It found Syrian security forces cooperating with militias were given 'shoot to kill' orders to crush demonstrations. Paulo Pinheiro, a Brazilian professor and the panel's chairman, said: 'These crimes include murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence. We have a very solid body of evidence.' The panel's members and staff weren't . allowed into Syria. But the commission said that it had interviewed 223 . victims and witnesses, including defectors from Syria's military and . security forces, since September. Report: Paulo Pinheiro, who is mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to lead an investigation of allegations of human rights abuses in Syria, reveals his team's findings at a press conference in Geneva . Supporters of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad attend a rally at al-Sabaa Bahrat square in Damascus . The UN Human Rights Council appointed Mr Pinheiro, Turkish women's rights expert Yakin Erturk and Karen Abu Zayd, a U.S. citizen and former head of UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees to lead an international investigation of allegations of human rights abuses in Syria. The commission was asked to follow up on a report from the UN human rights office that crimes against humanity may have occurred during Syria's crackdown against anti-government protesters, and to find those responsible. Among the other findings listed in the report: . Show of support: Syrians chant the national anthem during the pro-government rally . Service: The coffins of 17 army members, who the Syrian government said were killed by armed groups, during a funeral in front of the military Abdul-Qadder Shaqfeh hospital in Homs on Saturday . The report came out as it today emerged Russia is sending a flotilla of warships to its naval base in Syria in a show of force which suggests Moscow is willing to defend its interests in the strife-torn country. Arab League sanctions and French calls for the establishment of humanitarian zones in Syria have increased international pressure on Assad to end bloodshed that the UN said has killed 3,500 people during nine months of protests against his rule. Russia, which has a naval maintenance base in Syria and whose weapons trade with Damascus is worth millions of dollars annually, joined China last month to veto a Western-backed UN Security Council resolution condemning Assad’s government. Izvestia newspaper today reported, citing retired Russian Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, that Russia plans to send its flagship aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, along with a patrol ship, an anti-submarine craft and other vessels . Admiral Kravchenko said: 'Having any military force apart from Nato is very beneficial for the region as it prevents the outbreak of armed conflict.' A navy spokesman quoted by the newspaper confirmed that the Russian warships would head to the maintenance base Russia keeps on the Syrian coast near Tartus but said the trip had nothing to do with the uprising against Assad. The paper said the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier would be armed with at least eight Sukhoi-33 fighters, several MiG-29K fighters and two helicopters. It will also have cruise and surface to air missiles, the paper said. Yegor Engelhart, an analyst with Moscow-based defence think-tank CAST, said Moscow did not want its position to be ignored while the Assad government was under pressure. 'At the very least Moscow wants to show that it is willing to defend its interests in Syria,' he said.","UN report: At least 256 children have been killed by government forces .

'They call me Popeye, the Egyptian Popeye,' Ismail, 24, said while working out in the Boston suburb of Milford. But unlike the cartoon character, 'I like chicken, beef, anything but spinach.' It's not easy having the world's biggest arms. Generous amounts of poultry, seafood and shakes provide the protein he needs to fuel daily two-hour workouts in which he lifts as much as 600 pounds. He also takes mineral and vitamin supplements and drinks plenty of water to flush out his system. Then there's clothes shopping. The rest of Ismail's body is average, so it's a challenge finding shirts that fit his arms without making him look like a little kid playing dress-up. Not to mention the controversy that ensued when Guinness decided to recognize him as having the largest upper arm muscles on earth and critics accused him of using steroids or other artificial methods. He lost a night of sleep but then decided the criticism 'is motivation for me — it's not something that's gonna put me down.' Give us a lift: Model Jessica Jerrard gets a lift from Moustafa Ismail, 24, who has the largest biceps in the world . Dedication: Ismail started building his muscles in his Egyptian hometown of Alexandria before moving to the United States in 2007 and settling in Franklin, southwest of Boston . 'They call me Popeye, the Egyptian Popeye,' Ismail, 24, said while working out in the Boston suburb of Milford. But unlike the cartoon character, 'I like chicken, beef, anything but spinach' Mr Ismail says he began bodybuilding to get fit and realised he enjoyed his arms getting bigger as he received more and more compliments . Ismail started building his muscles in his Egyptian hometown of Alexandria before moving to the United States in 2007 and settling in Franklin, southwest of Boston. To pay for his gym membership and dietary requirements, he worked two jobs as a gas station attendant, but gave up one after his wife complained that he was pushing himself too hard. A minimum of three hours of training, at least twice a day . Daily diet includes . Then Guinness called last Fall, offering him an all-expenses-paid trip to London for a signature appearance with the world's shortest woman and others. He went, but then the controversy started. Strangers claimed online that he used steroids or had implants in his arms. Others speculated that he might have injected his muscles with a synthetic oil substance, synthol, used by bodybuilders to fluff muscle tissues. 'It is hurtful,' Ismail said, noting that he has no scars that would have resulted from surgery and that supporting a wife in the U.S. and family members in Egypt doesn't leave him with spare cash to buy pricey synthetic oils. He even went to Tokyo to appear in a Fuji TV documentary program in which independent doctors collected blood samples and X-rayed his muscles. They found nothing abnormal, he said. Still, Guinness hastily removed references to Ismail from its website. Spokeswoman Sara Wilcox said in October that Guinness was conducting research with medical specialists and reviewing Ismail's category. She did not respond to emailed questions later seeking details about when Guinness would conclude the review and what it entails. Some fellow amateur bodybuilders at his gym, however, support Ismail and say they believe his arms are natural. 'When I first saw him I thought ""Oh my God, he's a freak"" — the big Popeye arms, he's incredible, but he works out hard, so good luck to him,' said Janice Vincuilla. Ismail has lifted as much as 600 pounds but said he doesn't typically focus on how much weight he is hoisting. 'It's not about me lifting heavy weights,' he said. 'It's about me making the right techniques, even with the light weights, but getting good results out of that.' Namesake: But unlike the original Popeye (right) 'Big Mo' says he hates spinach, preferring his high protein, high carbohydrate diet. He can now lift an incredible 600lbs . He has a daily exercise regime of 5am . until 8am during which he concentrates on cardio, strength-training and . body sculpting, using heavy and light isolated weights. 'Working out makes my mood better. You’re just focusing. 'And I like that in this type of sport you can see your improvement in your shape,' he says. 'I know they are growing, my chest, my shoulders, my arms. I love weights.'","'Big Mo' eats 7lbs of protein every day and drinks three gallons of water .

"The UK's freak weather has whipped-up its greatest shock yet - after a walker claimed to have spotted a penguin on a British beach.

She managed to get her phone out just in time to take a picture of the mysterious bird waddling along the sands. Scroll down for video . P-p-pick up a penguin at Polkerris beach: Chantelle Smith snapped this image of what she believes is a penguin . Chantelle, of St Blazey in Cornwall, said she believes the creature was a penguin - normally found in Antarctica. She said: 'I was with a friend walking over to the harbour and I saw it run past. 'At first I thought it was just a rabbit but when I turned on the torch of my phone to have a look I could see it was a penguin - an actual penguin.

"Going to prison: Kirsty Debanks outside Oxford Crown Court where she admitted fabricating a rape charge . A woman has been jailed for eight months after falsely accusing her ex boyfriend of raping her. Kirsty Debanks, 20, lied that Chris Newitt had attacked her the day after she suffered a miscarriage. However, she finally admitted that she had made it all up when CCTV showed Mr Newitt was in Oxford city centre with his brother at the time. Sentencing her, Judge Ian Pringles told Miss Debanks 'Those who suffer genuine rape are undermined by people . like you. You undermine the whole system of justice.' He added: 'I would be failing in my duty today if I was not to pass an immediate prison sentence.' The city's crown court heard that police were called by paramedics to help control Debanks who was claiming to be having a miscarriage. Prosecutor Jonathan Stone said the next day Debanks told police that Mr Newitt had raped her when she got home from hospital. Mr Stone told the court: 'She said he had pushed her friend Tracy out of the address. 'He had pushed her (Debanks) down on the sofa. He said: 'You're going to f*** me whether you like it or not'."" Mr Newitt was arrested and questioned in . police custody for almost six hours and subjected to forensic testing. Officers visited her to begin the formal investigation but she told them she did not want to make a complaint only 'wanted the defendant to pay for what he did'. She also refused a medical appointment and would not sign the officer's notebook to confirm her account. False claim: Kirsty Debanks showed 'no remorse' the prosecution said in court . However, later on she called police to say that she did want to make the complaint. In interview she described the alleged attack to them, saying Mr Newitt's face was 'pure evil'. Miss Debanks' mother then called police and said something did not ring true in her daughter's account. Mr Newitt protested that he could not have carried out the attack as he was in Oxford city centre with his brother at the time. When officers viewed CCTV footage it confirmed his account. Debanks then called police herself and confessed that she had lied. In . her statement she explained that in fact she had gone to the pub with . her friend Tracy to drink double vodkas and beers, then gone back to her . home to continue drinking and smoke crack cocaine. Punishment: The judge at Oxford Crown Court said that Miss Debanks undermined 'the whole system of justice' Tracy . then suggested making the false claim, she said. Debanks only told the . truth when her mother warned her the case would go to trial. 'She appeared to show no remorse. In fact she smirked as she gave her account,' Mr Stone told Oxford Crown Court. Lucy . Ffrench, defending, said Debanks had suffered a difficult time, . including the loss of her father to cancer and of her uncle in a freak . accident, as well as other personal issues. 'She has been looking in the wrong places for the attention she craves,' said Ms Ffrench.","Kirsty Debanks lied that her ex-boyfriend had raped her after a miscarriage .

"Benefit claimants are being asked only . to make ‘some of the same choices working families have to make every . day’, George Osborne insisted yesterday. Accusing his critics of talking . ‘ill-informed rubbish’, the Chancellor said most voters understood the . need to change a welfare system that Labour allowed to spiral so far out . of control it cost one pound in every six paid in tax by workers. He said the Government’s reforms, . including a cap to ensure no one on benefits can get more than the . average working family, were restoring ‘common sense and control’. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne defended changes to the benefits system which he said were designed to back people who work hard and want to get on . Mr Osborne sought to present a more populist image, addressing workers at the Morrisons supermarket distribution centre in Sittingbourne, Kent . He conceded the shake-up would mean . welfare claimants having to make choices such as living in a ‘less . expensive house, to live in a house without a spare bedroom unless they . can afford it, to get by on the average family income’. But he insisted: ‘These are the . realities of life for working people. They should be the reality for . everyone else too. I’m proud of what we’re doing.’ Speaking at a supermarket distribution . centre in Kent, the Chancellor warned those opposing the Government’s . reforms they were ‘out of touch’ with ordinary families whose taxes paid . for the benefits system. In 2010, when Labour left power, payments to working age families cost a staggering £90billion, the Chancellor said. Mr Osborne suggested his approach to welfare cuts was inspired by the Morrison slogan . Mug's game: The Chancellor drank tea with staff at the site, as he argued that capping benefits was fair for those who worked and paid taxes . ‘That means about one in every six . pounds of tax working people like you pay was going on working age . benefits. To put that into perspective – that’s more than we spend on . our schools,’ he added. ‘For too long, we’ve had a system . where people who did the right thing – who get up in the morning and . work hard – felt penalised for it, while people who did the wrong thing . got rewarded for it.’ George Osborne's hopes of avoiding an unprecedented triple dip recession are on a knife-edge. The British Chamber of Commerce yesterday predicted that the economy grew from January to March, averting the devastating second consecutive quarter of decline would have officially returned the UK to recession. Export deliveries and orders from the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of UK economic output - rose close to the all-time highs seen in 1994 during the first three months of 2013, the BCC said. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: 'We should not be satisfied with a long and tortuous road to recovery. These results provide a glimpse of the as-yet-distant sunlit uplands of recovery - businesses up and down the country are working hard to drive the economy, create jobs and export, but they cannot accelerate this process alone.' However, fears of a triple dip recession were fuelled by new figures which suggested Britain's manufacturing sector contracted in the first quarter following another month of sliding output. The sector's 'winter of discontent' continued into March as overall activity slumped for the second month in a row, with a worse-than-expected headline reading of 48.3 - below the 50 level which separates growth from contraction, the latest Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) revealed. The Chancellor was scathing about the . ‘vested interests’ who complained with ‘depressingly predictable . outrage’ about every change. ‘In recent days we have heard a lot of, . frankly, ill-informed rubbish about these welfare reforms,’ he said in . response to criticism from Labour, charities and some church leaders. ‘Some have said it’s the end of the . welfare state. That is shrill, headline-seeking nonsense. I will tell . you what is true. Taxpayers don’t think the welfare state works properly . any more.’ Mr Osborne said the Government had to . act to reform a system that was ‘fundamentally broken’, leaving people . better off on the dole than if they went out to work. ‘Defending benefits that trap people in poverty and penalise work is defending the indefensible,’ he said. A raft of changes comes into force . this month, including a £500-a-week cap on household benefits and an . average £14-a-week cut in housing benefit for council tenants who insist . on a spare room. The first trials will be held of a . universal credit, which replaces the main out-of-work benefits and is . designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or work more hours. For Labour, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . insisted: ‘The benefits bill is rising under this Government because . our economy is flatlining, inflation is rising and unemployment is high. ‘The best way to get the benefits bill down is to get our economy growing strongly and get people back to work.’ Anne Marie Carrie, head of the . children’s charity Barnardo’s, appealed to ministers to ditch a 1 per . cent cap on benefit increases, which is well below the rate of . inflation. Disability living allowance is being replaced by a personal independence payment. Mr Osborne said that for too long people who work were penalised to fund handouts for the jobless . Before delivering his speech on benefit changes, Mr Osborne unveiled a plague to officially open new City watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), as the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King, second left, and Andrew Bailey, left, the Chief Executive of the PRA, look on .","Osborne says his reforms are backing 'people who want to get on in life'

"Boris Johnson tonight accepted a challenge from Pippa Middleton to a table tennis showdown to prove who is from the most competitive family. The socialite and author threw down the gauntlet to the London Mayor, boasting of her prowess as an under-13 competitor in national competitions. The contest will pit the Middletons and Johnsons, both with claims to being close to the Royals, against each other in a game of what Boris likes to call 'whiff-whaff'. Scroll down for video . Head to head: Boris Johnson and Pippa playing a game of table tennis, as imagined by Carla Millar for the Spectator, to decide once and for all whose is the most competitive family . Pippa boasted that she once played in national Under-13 table tennis championships, warning the London Mayor: 'Bring it on Boris' Fresh from competing in a cross-country ski marathon on the slopes of St Mortiz, Pippa revealed she hopes her next big sporting challenge will be taking on Boris at table tennis, declaring: ‘Bring it on Boris.’ And her prowess is not to be doubted – Pippa boasts that she once competed at national level, albeit more than 15 years ago. Boris took to Twitter tonight to declare:  'I’m game if she is. Happy for Pippa to join me on a visit and see the benefits of our £22m Sports Legacy Fund in action.' No-one would doubt the ambitions of either family with close links to the British royals. Boris is a descendant of King George II while Pippa was propelled to global fame when she was bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William. It catapulted the middle-class Middletons into the social stratosphere, with parents Carole and Michael rubbing shoulders with the Queen and Prince Charles. Pippa claims that her family is even more competitive than the Johnsons and believes the only way to put it to the test is a game of table tennis. Pippa will be hoping for a better outcome in the table tennis game than in her recent attempt to complete a ski marathon in St Moritz, which had to be aborted because of bad weather and the threat of avalanches . Writing in tomorrow’s Spectator magazine, she says that having returned from her Alpine challenges she hopes to ‘pursue less demanding hobbies in my spare time, such as ping-pong’. Pippa adds: ‘I’m informed that Boris Johnson, former editor of this magazine, wants to be ‘whiff-whaff’ world king even more than he wants to be Prime Minister. ‘I’m also told the Johnsons are almost as competitive as the Middletons. So I’d like to lay down a challenge to the Mayor. ‘My only stipulation is that I can use my favourite Dunlop Blackstorm Nemesis bat, which I used when I played in the Milton Keynes U13 National Championships, don’t you know. Bring it on, Boris.’ The image of the pair playing on a blue table was mocked up for the magazine by artist Carla Millar. After Mr Johnson accepted the challenge, Spectator editor Fraser Nelson said: 'We'll get a ping pong table set up in the Spectator's garden.' And he warned the Mayor: 'She's quite serious. And sporty.' Pippa will be hoping that her latest sporting trial will have a better outcome than her attempt to take part in the 45th Engadin Ski Marathon 2013 race in St Mortiz. In her Spectator diary she reveals how she was weighed down by her rucksack, filled her gloves with snow and put her crampons on wrong. Her 'strikingly handsome' guide Matthieu exclaimed at her incompetence: 'It is a ******* joke, Pippa.' The Duchess of Cambridge's sister has been signed up as a columnist by Waitrose magazine, but readers have complained her first offering - an Asian feast- was difficult to prepare . She and Boris have more in common than ties to the Royal Family. Both are high profile columnists, Boris earning a reported £250,000-a-year from the Daily Telegraph while Pippa was recently signed up as a recipe writer for Waitrose magazine. Her ascent from party planner to professional foodie came after her first book - a guide to party-planning, which did include several recipes - bombed in October last year. Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities For Families and Friends reportedly netted Pippa a £400,000 advance from publisher Michael Joseph. But her agent David Godwin last month confirmed that he and the middle child of the Middleton family were no longer working together. Boris has made no secret of his love of . table tennis, causing a diplomatic row when he claimed at the Beijing . Olympics that the game originated not in China as many thought but on . the dining tables of 19th century England. The London Mayor revealed to a global audience his love of table tennis at the Beijing Olympics, declaring the sort was 'coming home' At an event to mark the official handover of the 2012 to London, he declared: 'Ping pong is coming home. All sports were either invented or codified by the British. Even ping pong was invented on the dining tables of England and it was called wiff waff. 'When the French look at a dining table, they saw an opportunity to eat. When the English look at a dining table, they saw an opportunity for whiff waff.'","Pippa Middleton says she wants her next public test to be against the London Mayor .

"It is four months since Luis Suarez sunk his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini and absented himself from football for his brief sabbatical. On Saturday evening at the Bernabeu Stadium he re-emerged and time away had not withered him nor has psychiatric counselling dimmed his spirit. But good though he is, he cannot yet conjure miracles. He may have added intensity, ferocity and guile to an already-formidable Barcelona attack – but as a collective unit on Saturday night they did not have the tools to stop Cristiano and Co. The world’s most richly-decorated football match, which even in the absence of the injured Gareth Bale, still boasts a comfortable majority of the world’s top ten footballers, produced a spell-binding match of attacking intent which further suggests the balance of power in football’s universe in tilting in favour of Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo at present.

Real Madrid were welcomed to the match by a huge crowd of fans outside the Bernabeu ahead of their win over rivals Barcelona .

Subs (not used): Ter Stegen, Bartra, Alba, Munir . Bookings: Messi, Neymar, Pique, Iniesta . Goals: Neymar (4) Ratings by Pete Jenson . Karim Benzema, scorer of the third goal, left the pitch to a standing ovation having led the way to a comprehensive victory which might have been more embarrassing for Barca. Of course, Ronaldo was a key contributor, as was Isco while Luka Modric and Toni Kroos meanwhile were simply magnificently neatly efficient at the base of midfield. And while Suarez shone whilst his fitness allowed, Messi and Neymar flickered only in moments, Xavi looked a 34-year-old short of game time and Andres Iniesta made a rare, awful error to gift Real their third. Indeed, when even with the game effectively over and the celebrations in full swings the Bernabeu groaned angrily at Marcelo for failing to play in Ronaldo for a fourth goal, Real’s dominance was clear. The game might be won but the crowd wanted more; they wanted humiliation. They contended themselves with a chorus of ‘Viva Espana.’ It was not a night for Catalan pride. They will comfort themselves that they do at least have Suarez. He was excellent, given the time he has been away. ‘I’m happy to be back playing,’ he said afterwards. ‘It’s a big relief and I’m happy that the time has passed. It’s a bittersweet feeling because of the result but this side has come back many a time. ‘It is very difficult to play here but I did the things that I could. Everyone knows how clasicos are played, the first few minutes are hard, but football is like that. They played well on the counter after we went ahead and they killed the game.’ After a tumultuous opening, Real Madrid did indeed kill the game. The ‘King of Kings’ banner celebrating Real Madrid’s ten European Cups had barely been put away, the music had only just died down, when the tiny knot of Barcelona fans were celebrating in the far corner of the Bernabeu inside three minutes. The goal sparked a frenetic response from Real Madrid. ‘I was surprised at the level at which we could play so soon after the Liverpool game,’ said a satisfied Carlo Anecotti. ‘This is a serious team and they sacrifice themselves for each other.’ Indeed, this side is much more than a collection of galaticos; Ancelotti has created a balance that is truly impressive. Even Leo Messi, cowed on the night, seemed unnerved, crashing into Toni Kroos early on and earning a yellow card, the first of four Barca would accumulate in that first half. Ronaldo was at the heart of Real’s early best efforts, crossing on 11 minutes for Benzema, whose header crashed off the bar and whose strike from rebound blazed over. The game was infused with attacking talent, but the finishing didn’t always match. Suarez sent in a delicious cross and Messi, from six yards out, missed. Neymar, similarly, mis-kicked from four yards out. Neymar gave Barcelona the lead after just four minutes with Suarez providing the assist at the Bernabeu .

Neymar celebrates his goal against Real Madrid but Barcelona could not hold on to their lead in the La Liga clash . Ronaldo looks frustrated after Real Madrid go 1-0 down but the former Manchester United player soon got his own goal . Real Madrid had to re-establish their grip on the game and they did so through right back Marcelo driving into the penalty area on 34 minutes. His cross induced Gerard Pique to collapse to the ground and handle the ball. The penalty was inevitable as was the finish from Ronaldo: a crisp, unstoppable striker into the bottom right hand corner, his 16th this season in La Liga and we’re not even out of October. Barcelona hadn’t conceded in the league this season, a record always unlikely to survive this outing and after the break Real were re-invigorated, flying forward on the counter attack on 47 minutes as Benzema released Ronaldo, with Pique sliding in to block for the corner. No matter. Kroos trotted away to take the kick with precision that was signposted for Pepe at the far post. The Portuguese connected, heading the ball firmly into the bottom corner and the Bernabeu was itself again, full of noise and confidence. Ronaldo takes his penalty in the 35th minute to bring Real Madrid level in the El Clasico tie against Barcelona on Saturday . Ronaldo celebrates in typical style at the Bernabeu as the former Manchester United star equalises against Barcelona . Ronaldo goes to his usual celebration after scoring against Barcelona to bring the teams level before half-time on Saturday evening . Barca did not immediately retreat. Sergio Ramos needed a crucial sliding clearance to prevent Messi from connecting with a pull back and Jeremy Mathieu hit a remarkable strike from 35 yards which Casillas dived to save spectacularly. But the flow of the game was with Carlo Ancelotti’s men. Barca were creaking and Iniesta as good as confirmed the fact with an uncharacteristic lazy touch on the hour which allowed Isco to break and feed Ronaldo, who played in James. The Colombian touched the ball on to Benzema, who finished quite splendidly, pulling his shot across goal and past Claudio Bravo. Barca’s suddenly appeared terribly brittle. Mascherano’s fine sliding challenge prevented Ronaldo adding to the scoring on 65 minutes. Dani Alves needed to do the same again, leaving the world player of the year in complaining, crumpled heap. Suarez departed on 68 minutes: he had run his course, done his best but ultimately in vain. He will come again, but Barca’s unbeaten record in Liga is over and their superiority complex severely punctured.

As the Flybe twin-engine craft approached, the airport was being battered by strong winds of around 45mph, with gusts of up to 80mph forecast. This photo shows the terrifying moment the wing of a plane nearly crashed on to a runway as it landed . The passenger plane landed at Manchester Airport at around 2.45pm today in 45mph winds . Despite the fact wind gusts of up to 80mph are forecast in the area, the airport expects flights to run as usual . Airport officials said that no cancellations had been announced and, despite the weather, flights were expected to continue to operate. The photographs show the 40-seat plane approaching the runway at around 2.45pm. At first, the plane was level but, as it came down to the ground, the wind blew it to one side and the left wing nearly touched down on the runway. The pilot was able to land the plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 model, safely without any injuries. The photographs show the 40-seat plane approaching the runway at around 2.45pm . The plane, which had flown from Waterford in Ireland, did land safely and no passengers were injured .

"It’s hot, cramped and breaks down almost daily yet the twisting turns and complex nature of trains travelling around the London Underground every second is undeniably fascinating. To showcase this, a pair of developers have used online code to build an interactive 3D map of the tube network, complete with moving trains. The visualisation was built to demonstrate the capabilities of the ViziCities project, and its creators have now made the code behind the project available for anyone to use. Scroll down for video . A pair of developers from London used open source data to build an interactive 3D map of the tube network, complete with moving trains, pictured. The visualisation was built to showcase the ViziCities project. Its creators have made the code behind the project available for anyone to use . To try and capture the unique sounds of the London Underground, archivist Ian Rawes has created the London Sound Survey - an online collection of field recordings, sound maps, early BBC radio actuality and more. As part of this project, Rawes travelled London's canals and rivers during during 2011 and 2012 recording ambient sounds along the way and has plotted these on his Underground-inspired Waterways map. Although the map follows London’s canals and smaller rivers, noises from other landmarks including the M4 bridge, London Zoo and Victoria Park are also featured. Set up by developers Peter Smart and Robin Hawkes almost a year ago, ViziCities was designed ‘to change the way you look at cities and the data contained within them.' Cities are created using OpenStreetMap data and are powered by JavaScript and WebGL. 'Maps and data visualisations have always captured the imagination of people,' Hawkes told the MailOnline. 'Perhaps . because they are often beautiful to look at, but I imagine more because . they communicate complex situations in an easy to consume fashion. 'Trying . to understand how the entire London Underground network works would be a . headache for anyone, let alone TfL, but seeing it all happen before . your eyes in an interactive 3D experience allows you to step back and . comprehend what’s happening.' The data for projects be taken from any open source information, including Transport for London, but also traffic agencies, social networks and more. For example, Smart and Hawkes also created a map of a town with small blue boxes floating into the air.

The data can be taken from any open source information, including Transport for London, but also traffic agencies, social networks and more. For example, Smart and Hawkes created a map of a town with small blue boxes, designed to be tweets, floating into the air, pictured . The boxes were designed to represent . tweets sent from different co-ordinates within a town. Another of their . projects visualised traffic flowing around a city. The ViziCities code has now been added to Github along with instructions on how to begin building ViziCities projects. However, . the developers stress the software is in a pre-alpha state, meaning . features may change, be added or removed, and there may be bugs. Current features include the ability . to add buildings, waterways including rivers and canals, as well as . parks, grass and forests. Users can also zoom, pan and orbit cities. Smart . and Hawkes will be adding 3D road networks, live data visualisation . from tweets and public transport, local weather and more to later . versions of the software. To get started the developers have created a demo city that users can experiment on. Hawkes . told MailOnline: 'We started the project it's an exciting technical and . design challenge for us - both Peter and I thrive on pushing ourselves . to the limits by exploring something unknown to us. 'There’s something exciting about creating a way to do that for real-world cities rather than fictional ones. 'The idea of visualising a city in 3D with up-to-date data about that city overlaid is an appealing one. 'Imagine if you could see census data about your area, education data, health data, crime data, property information, live transport - you’d be able to learn and understand so much more about the place you live. And this is really just the beginning. The possibilities are endless!' More recently, the developers took part in #FloodHack. Using . data from the Environment Agency, they created a 3D map of the UK and . overlayed it with current and predicted water levels. This helped them work out what areas were likely to flood and allow people to take action by seeing which locations are safer. They won a prize at #FloodHack for this particular 3D visualisation.

'Online maps have shown us the power . and demand for easy ways to visualise the location of business and to . get directions from where you are now to where you want to be in an . hour. People will always have a fascination and need for maps.' Potential applications for ViziCities include visualising air traffic in 3D, analysing and predicting traffic flow using 3D road networks and artificial intelligence, civic planning - using a 3D city to see the impact of planned developments - and interactive 3D floor plans for museums, public buildings and shopping centres.

"This two-year-old boy was meant to be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Doctors claimed little Nolan Rooms would never walk, roll, crawl or even swallow food and he would see life out as a vegetable. But now he is remarkably defying the experts and slowly overcoming the debilitating symptoms of his cerebral palsy with the help of alternative therapies. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Nolan Rooms is slowly overcoming the debilitating symptoms of his cerebral palsy with the help of alternative therapies known as Vojta and therasuits . Nolan, who was born three and a half months premature in March 2012, was diagnosed with a severe form of the disorder soon after birth. He spent two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Townsville with his parents, Nicole and Christian, before he contracted both a blood and chest infection that caused him to lose about 40 percent of his brain cells. 'He lost brain cells mostly on the left hand side, which is responsible for motor skills... they said he will be a vegetable in a wheelchair,' Ms Rooms told Daily Mail Australia. 'They said he wouldn't even be able to hold his head up, swallow food or drink water.' He started the alternative therapies on the Sunshine Coast when he was eight months old and his parents say he has improved immensely . Prior to the Vojta therapy, Nolan couldn't sit up, roll over or even extend his limbs. But the two-year-old was able to reach out for a toy after just one week of treatment . But it took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince Nolan's parents he could defy the doctors. His parents started to counteract the effects of his cerebral palsy with early intervention using alternative therapies. 'In the first year he didn't develop at all. He couldn't roll over and I couldn't put him on his tummy because he went blue,' Ms Rooms said. His parents, Nicole and Christian, then flew the two-year-old to the United States for two months to undergo extensive therapy . 'He couldn't straighten his arms or unclench his fists. He couldn't move or do anything - his limbs started to slowly deform.' Ms Rooms found a therapy called Vojta, which is popular in her native Germany. 'We started when he was eight months old. We came to the Sunshine Coast from Townsville for one week to see the only Vojta therapist in Australia,' she said. 'After one week, Nolan opened his hand for the first time and reached out for a toy. He rolled over three times and we thought that was a miracle.' He spent two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Townsville before he contracted both a blood and chest infection that caused him to lose about 40 percent of his brain cells . He spent three months battling in hospital after doctors told his parents he was unlikely to survive . The family moved to the Sunshine Coast soon after so Nolan could undergo the therapy everyday. After hearing about another therapy available in America known as the 'therasuit', Nolan and his parents  spent two months overseas for treatment. 'When we brought him back from America… he could hold his head upright and the rolling became consistent. He also started commando crawling. It was just another miracle,' Ms Rooms said. 'For us he is becoming more and more mobile, so that means when you look at Nolan you can't immediately see he has cerebral palsy any more. 'Even the eating has changed. Before he could only eat liquid and he struggled putting weight on. Now, today he ate half my toast with avocado.' 'He can now see the world while sitting instead of laying flat on his back.' Nolan has now started eating solid foods after surviving on a liquid diet because he couldn't swallow properly . It took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince Nolan's parents he could defy the doctors . Due to the therapy's success, the Rooms and five other families pitched in to hire a therapist from the US program to come to Australia for 10 weeks. 'The next step for Nolan is crawling on his arms and legs. He just wants to stand up and walk, but we need to teach him to use the right muscles first,' Ms Rooms said. 'I think he will walk eventually, although I'm not sure if it will be with an aide. We know it will still take a long time, but he surprises us every single day. 'He does the therapy every day for three hours. If I went to the gym for that long, I would be narky and sore. But he does it with a smile, so it's just amazing.' His mum Nicole says she's hopeful Nolan will walk in the near future, but they are trying to teach him to use the right muscles first . Nolan undergoes three hours of therapy every day and his parents say the results have been remarkable . The two-year-old's family moved to the Sunshine Coast  so Nolan could undergo the therapy everyday . As for the doctors who said Nolan would not be able to move, Ms Rooms said they're gobsmacked. 'The doctors were very amazed. When we used to go to the doctors, they would just prescribe medication or equipment. But we were always against,' she said. 'Now they keep saying, ""whatever you’re doing keep doing it"".' Fellow Queenslander Blaise Wyatt, 3, has undergone the same therasuit treatment in the US. Diagnosed with cerebral palsy in 2010, Blaise has had similar success to Nolan - he can now roll over and sit up on his own.

"Amid the 4,000 graves of his fallen comrades, D-Day veteran Ken Scott struggles from his wheelchair to his feet. Supported on either side, his tears fall as the Last Post rings out across Bayeux Cemetery. Wearing his original forage cap and a replica Second World War uniform adorned with medals, the 98-year-old former platoon sergeant with the Durham Light Infantry manages to raise his shaking hand to salute the Queen and those who gave their lives for freedom. Scroll down for video . Farewell: Ken Scott, paying what he says is his final visit to his fallen friends, is lifted to his feet for the Last Post . Yesterday, on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, he spoke for the first time of the unimaginable horror and bloodshed that greeted his landing craft on Gold Beach. ‘I always said I’d take it to my grave but people should know,’ he said. ‘I’m coming near to the end of my life now and people should know history and what it was like.’ One of the oldest D-Day veterans, Mr Scott, from Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, had a distinguished campaign as a Desert Rat in North Africa from 1940-1943, including fighting at the battle of El Alamein. Then came the D-Day landings. He was 28 when he boarded a train in Cambridge before being transferred to a landing craft at  Plymouth. ‘It was the dead of night and we had no idea we were going to France,’ he added. ‘We smoked ourselves to death as we were so frightened.’ Poignant: Mr Scott and the graves of the comrades he lost 70 years ago . He then recalled the horrifying moments as his landing craft reached the target beach. ‘When the ramp came down we were scared stiff,’ he said. ‘There were bodies floating in the water, some were injured. ‘They had met the machine guns and you couldn’t help them. They were crying out “give us a hand buddy”. Some of them were calling for their mothers. ‘We just had to keep going – we pushed them to one side, we just couldn’t help them.’ Wiping away tears and with his voice trembling, he continued: ‘It’s been with me ever since. I don’t tell many people but it does upset me. ‘Bodies were just lying there, they were just floating and the water was red. You were looking after yourself, you were so frightened. ‘I remember the smell of the cordite and the noise from the navy shelling – we were trying to defend ourselves. I will never forget that.’ Helping hand: Mr Scott speaks with a helper during the memorial service held at the cemetery . Mr Scott, who has a son John, says this will be his last pilgrimage to Normandy. He said he was determined to stand up during the last post, adding: ‘I wouldn’t have missed that for the world. This is the end. ‘I can go home and just relax –  this is all finished now. I won’t come here again. I can put it all [the war] behind me.’ After the war, Mr Scott ran a dry cleaning shop with his wife Barbara, who died in 2007. He was also instrumental in helping to start the repatriation parades through his hometown of Royal Wootton Bassett. He said: ‘I saw a coffin draped in a Union Jack one day – and thought it was one of us old boys. When I found out it was a soldier from Afghanistan, I thought his repatriation should be marked. ‘So I phoned the MoD and told them to let me know when our boys were brought back – and that’s how it started.’ Respect: Mr Scott, right, was one of hundred of veterans at the emotional Bayeux service . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","Veteran Ken Scott saluted The Queen and those who gave their lives .

Solve this riddle to find a cryptic clue. This quiz was inspired by Alan Turing whose genius significantly shortened World War II . It portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his team at Britain's top-secret code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park, during World War II. Turing’s genius significantly shortened the war and saved thousands of lives, but his contribution was not recognised at the time. In 1952, he was convicted of homosexual offences, and as an alternative to imprisonment accepted chemical castration with doses of the female hormone oestrogen. Among the consequences, he developed female breasts. As well as a code breaker, Alan Turing was a pioneer of artificial intelligence and mathematical biology. During his time at Manchester University, Turing proposed a famous experiment now known as the Turing test . What do you have to do?

Hugs: In emotional scenes, Malala hugged staff that have cared for her over the past three months . In October last year a Taliban hitman burst onto her school bus in Swat, northern Pakistan, and shot her at point-blank range. The bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, . 'grazing' her brain. It was later removed by surgeons in Pakistan . before she was flown to the UK for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

Medics said that Malala will be re-admitted later this month or early February to undergo reconstructive surgery on her skull. She will visit the hospital every week to attend out-patient clinical appointments where doctors will assess her progress. Medical . Director Dr Dave Rosser said: 'Malala is a strong young woman and has . worked hard with the people caring for her to make excellent progress in . her recovery.

Since Malala was shot there have been a number of candlelit vigils in Birmingham and across the world to pray for her recovery. Celebrities including Madonna and Angelina Jolie have joined millions of people across the world to support Malala. There are growing calls for her to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize. Since her arrival in Britain there have been concerns for the teenager’s safety. Just a day after she was admitted, well-wishers had to be turned away from the hospital after they turned up claiming to be family members. And in November the shooting, banned hate preacher Sheikh Omar Bakri sparked global outrage when he threatened to issue a fatwa - a death sentence - against Malala - when he branded her “a traitor to Islam.” Honoured: A Pakistani police officer stands guard outside the college which was named after Malala, in Swat, Pakistan. The Taliban have vowed to target her again. Ziauddin Yousafzai has been appointed education attache for three years, with the option of an extension for a further two years afterwards.

Scientists have found that eating a diet based on that served up traditionally in Denmark could significantly reduce your risk of heart disease. Nordic cuisine is usually made up of fresh berries, fish and game - foods that thrive in colder northern climates. Healthy: A Nordic diet of fresh fish and vegetables could be the key to a healthy heart, say scientists . Obese people in a study who ate a diet packed with fresh berries saw their cholesterol drop by 4 per cent . Professor Matti Uusitupa, from the University of Eastern Finland,told The Daily Telegraph: 'The Mediterranean diet, representing the diet traditionally eaten in southern Europe, has long been related to improved health and prevention of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and type two diabetes. 'Acceptance of the Mediterranean diet has not been easy in other parts of the western world, probably due to difficulties in changing dietary patterns, cultural differences in taste and limited accessibility to various foods. 'A health-enhancing regional Nordic diet has therefore been proposed as an alternative to the Mediterranean diet.' The diet favoured in Copenhagen, pictured, is being lauded as an alternative to the Mediterranean diet . The diet has already been nicknamed the Noma diet - after the Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, ranked as the world's best three years in a row. The study featured 166 obese people from Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland, some of whom ate their regular diet and some who adopted the Nordic diet. Both sample groups ate the same number of calories but those on the Nordic diet ate meals packed with fish, locally sourced vegetables and whole grain products. Poultry or game was consumed rather than red meat. Top food: The diet has already been named the Noma Diet after the world's best restaurant in Copenhagen, pictured . While those who stuck to their . regular diet showed little difference in their levels of 'bad' cholesterol after 24 weeks, those on the Mediterranean diet had seen . LDL-C levels drop four per cent with an increase in 'good' cholesterol. Unlike . the Mediterranean diet, the Nordic version also reduced chemicals that . cause inflammation in the blood that are linked to heart disease.","A study found that the Noma diet could reduce cholesterol by 4 per cent .

"A balloon aviator who had to abort his attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean just 12 hours into his flight has described the dramatic moment he crash landed. Speaking for the first time via his messaging system, Jonathan Trappe told Barcroft Media he thought he would die as his vessel plummeted to the ground. 'Honestly did not know if I would survive that landing!' said the 39-year-old, who landed in pitch darkness. 'Situation stable. Have 60l water 38L. Gatorade 60,000 cal food. Have shelter and exposure gear.' 'Alternate location': A GPS tracker shows the flight path of balloon aviator Jonathan Trappe before he was forced to abort his bid to cross the Atlantic in Newfoundland just 12 hours into the challenge . Jonathan Trappe set off this morning on a 2,500 mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean relying on 370 helium balloons to fly him safely to Europe . Bon voyage: Jonathan Trappe waves from the lifeboat which hangs from the balloons ahead of taking off from Caribou, Maine . Putting on a brave face: Mr Trappe posted a tongue-in-cheek update on Facebook after landing in Newfoundland. Earlier, it had been going so well for the first few hours . The cluster balloonist was attempting . to cross the Atlantic using giant balloons filled with helium, but was . forced to make an early landing in Newfoundland, Canada, due to a . technical issue. There were commiserations around the world - including one from Virgin boss and fellow balloonist, Richard Branson. He . tweeted: 'Commiserations to Jonathan Trappe, who has abandoned his . UP-style cluster balloon crossing. I know how you must feel!' Fans . of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite . tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm EST. Trappe wrote on his Facebook page: 'Hmm, this doesn't look like France.' He . later followed up with: 'Landed safe, at an alternate location. Remote. I put the exposure canopy up on the boat. Will stay here for the . night.' The IT consultant from Raleigh, North . Carolina, US, took off yesterday morning at 6.30am EST attempting to be . the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean via cluster balloon. Crowds gather to wave the IT specialist off in Caribou, Maine, this morning as he begins his attempt to become the first man to successfully cross the Atlantic in this way . The IT specialist took off at 6.20am this morning in front of volunteers and supporters. His team of meteorologists will monitor his progress using a satellite phone . Though admitting weather was the most dangerous aspect of the journey Mr Trappe was not put off by the thick fog he faced this morning as he hovered above Caribou, Maine . Kevin Knapp, speaking from the command . centre overseeing Trappe's flight, said: 'I can confirm that Jonathan . was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 EST. 'Thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home. 'While . disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I . know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement.' Despite . fears Atlantic weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to . achieving his dream crossing, the landing was blamed on a technical . problem relating to the balloons. Trappe and his team . had faced an agonising wait of more than 100 days in Caribou, Maine, for . the right weather conditions to carry him across the Atlantic to . Europe. The latest weather reports suggested winds would take Trappe to western Europe but unpredictable conditions could see him land anywhere between Morocco and Iceland . The IT technical project manager and his team have been waiting almost 100 days for good enough weather conditions to begin the journey which is expected to last between three and five days . Trappe already holds the record for the longest-ever cluster balloon flight after crossing the English Channel in 2012 and the Alps in 2011 when he suspended an office chair from similar helium balloons to those used in this journey . Global weather . systems being monitored by the project meteorologists started lining up . on Monday, but local storms around Maine threatened to destroy the . cluster balloon system and forced Trappe to stay grounded. Trappe . said: 'It was nail biting waiting for a weather window that would allow . me to get up into the air and catch those transatlantic winds we'd been . seeing. I need to get on them and ride them across like a conveyor belt.' His . planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him . towards Europe - potentially landing anywhere between Iceland and . Morocco. Trappe already holds the record for the longest ever cluster balloon flight of 14 hours. He became the only person to have crossed the English Channel by cluster balloon in May 2010, and the Alps in September 2011. Previous . flights had seen him travel in a simple office chair suspended by the . balloons, however, for this attempt he travelled in a small yellow life . boat in case of a sea landing. Volunteers help inflate the 370 balloons which Trappe will gradually deflate to control his descent once above dry land in several days time . Five people have died in the past trying to make the 2,500 mile journey in conventional hot air balloons or single gas balloons as the result of unexpected winds and storms . 12 previous attempts have been made to traverse the Atlantic Ocean using balloons though none has been successful. In 2008 A Brazilian priest died trying to make the journey using helium filled birthday balloons . Trappe is relying on state-of-the-art weather data from the meteorologist who advised Felix Baumgartner on his record-breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year . The 370 balloons have been attached to a lifeboat which will save Mr Trappe's life if he drops into water at any point in the dangerous journey . Volunteers clutch on to seven helium balloons ahead of Trappe's take off this morning after the journey was put on hold for months due to poor weather conditions . Colonel Joe Kittinger, 84, who acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive from space, has aided with preparations for the dangerous journey . Mr Trappe's partner Nidia Ramirez was there to wave him off this morning as he prepares to embark on the 2,500 mile flight which could see him reach altitudes of 25,000ft . Mr Trappe said though he was aware how dangerous the feat is, he wants to live an interesting life and 'go forward in the spirit of adventure' Life imitates art: In the Pixar film, Carl Fredricksen strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the U.S. to South America . Speaking . immediately before take-off yesterday, Trappe said: 'This is far greater . than anything achieved before. I'm looking at 62 hours or longer.' 'If . I touch down on water then the attempt will be over as it will be . impossible to take off again, but the boat will keep me alive. 'It . will be incredibly dangerous as I could be several days away from any . rescue crew and it will mean surviving rough seas for a long time, . alone.' While Trappe is the . first ever to attempt an Atlantic cluster balloon crossing, five people . have died trying to cross the ocean in 12 total attempts using hot-air . balloons or more conventional single gas balloons. Trappe . said: 'I'm just as afraid of dying as anyone. 'But I go forward in the . spirit of adventure, doing something nobody has achieved before, and to . live an interesting life.' Also . advising on the project was aviation hero Colonel Joseph Kittinger, 84, . who acted as Capsule Communicator during Felix Baumgartner's skydive . from space. He was also the first person to make a solo Atlantic crossing by gas balloon, in 1984. 'I . accepted the role of advisor on this project because I want to help a . young man achieve his dream, to reach his goal,' said Kittinger. 'Like me, Trappe wants to be remembered for achieving something that nobody has achieved before him, . 'I'm here because I believe he can do it. 'His planning has been meticulous and if anyone can make this, he can.'","Jonathan Trappe, 39, ditches on Canadian Island around 350 miles from take-off site in Maine on the U.S. mainland .

"Hillary Clinton has downplayed emails that suggest the White House knew an Islamic militant group had claimed credit for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11 just two hours after it took place. The dismissal comes after three internal emails sent by her State Department staff surfaced in which officials specifically mention that Libyan group Ansar al-Sharia had claimed responsibility. The Secretary of State said that the group's claims of responsibility on Facebook and Twitter were not 'evidence' - and that they had also denied carrying out the attacks in the same time. 'Posting something on Facebook is not in and of itself evidence,' Clinton said. 'And I think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be.' Scroll down to hear Secretary Clinton address the messages . Denial: Hillary Clinton, pictured on Tuesday, has dismissed claims the White House knew that an al Qaeda-linked group had claimed responsibility for the U.S. consulate attacks in Libya . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney added: 'I think within a few hours that organization itself claimed that it had not been responsible. Neither should be taken as fact.' The emails were obtained by Reuters from government sources not connected with U.S. spy agencies or the State Department and who requested anonymity. Three Republican senators wrote a letter to the White House on Wednesday saying the emails 'add to the confusion' about what the administration knew of the attacks, Fox reported. 'In television interviews nearly a week after the events in Benghazi, you yourself even refused to describe it as a terrorist attack, instead emphasizing the role played by a hateful video,' Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Kelly Ayotte wrote. 'This concerted misrepresentation of the facts of the case - facts that, it appears, you and your administration possessed almost as soon as the attack began - is why so many of our constituents are demanding a fuller explanation of why your administration responded as it did.' The emails in questions were sent on the afternoon of September 11 by the State Department's Operations Center to multiple government offices, including addresses at the White House, Pentagon, intelligence community and FBI. Deadly: Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi . The first email, timed at 4.05pm . Washington time - or 10.05pm Benghazi time, 20-30 minutes after the . attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission allegedly began - carried the . subject line ‘U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack’ and the . notation ‘SBU,’ meaning ‘Sensitive But Unclassified.’ The text said the State Department's regional security office had reported that the diplomatic mission in Benghazi was ‘under attack. Embassy in Tripoli reports approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well.’ The message continued: ‘Ambassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four ... personnel are in the compound safe haven. The 17th of February militia is providing security support.’ At 4.54pm Washington time, a second . email was fired off, headed ‘Update 1: U.S. Diplomatic Mission in . Benghazi’ said that the Embassy in Tripoli had reported that ‘the firing . at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi had stopped and the compound . had been cleared.’ It said a ‘response team’ was at the site attempting . to locate missing personnel. A . third email, also marked SBU and sent at 6.07pm, carried the subject . line: ‘Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi . Attack.’ First missive: The first email was sent by the diplomatic mission in Benghazi 20-30 minutes after the attack on the complex began . False hope: A second email stated that the attack on the mission had stopped and the compound had been cleared . Attackers named: A third message stated that a group called Ansar al-Sharia ha claimed responsibility on the attack on Facebook and Twitter . The message reported: ‘Embassy Tripoli . reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has . called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.’ Official version: President Obama said during an interview on '60 Minutes' that he didn't believe mob violence alone was responsible for the deadly assault on the embassy . While some information identifying . recipients of this message was redacted from copies of the messages . obtained by Reuters, a government source said that one of the addresses . to which the message was sent was the White House Situation Room, the . president's secure command post. Other addressees included intelligence and military units as well as one used by the FBI command center, the source said. It was not known what other messages were received by agencies in Washington from Libya that day about who might have been behind the attacks. Intelligence experts caution that initial reports from the scene of any attack or disaster are often inaccurate. U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi assault, which President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials ultimately acknowledged was a ‘terrorist’ attack carried out by militants with suspected links to al Qaeda affiliates or sympathizers. Administration spokesmen, including White House spokesman Jay Carney, citing an unclassified assessment prepared by the CIA, maintained for days that the attacks likely were a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim film. While officials did mention the possible involvement of ‘extremists,’ they did not lay blame on any specific militant groups or possible links to al Qaeda or its affiliates until intelligence officials publicly alleged that on September 28. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack on a building . which has now been revealed to be a CIA base . There were indications that extremists . with possible al Qaeda connections were involved, but also evidence . that the attacks could have erupted spontaneously, they said, adding . that government experts wanted to be cautious about pointing fingers . prematurely. U.S. intelligence officials have emphasized since shortly after the attack . that early intelligence reporting about the attack was mixed. Spokesmen for the White House and State Department had no immediate response to requests for comments on the emails. By the morning of September 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, Reuters reported that there were indications that members of both Ansar al-Sharia, a militia based in the Benghazi area, and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African affiliate of al Qaeda's faltering central command, may have been involved in organizing the attacks. Fourteen hours after the attack, . President Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of ‘60 Minutes’ for an . interview and said he did not believe it was simply due to mob violence, . CBS reported. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . ‘You're right that this is not a situation that was -- exactly the same as what happened in Egypt and my suspicion is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target Americans from the start,’ Obama said. One U.S. intelligence official said that during the first classified briefing about Benghazi given to members of Congress, officials 'carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information, relying on the best analysis available at the time.' The official added, however, that the initial analysis of the attack that was presented to legislators was mixed. ‘Briefers said extremists were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous, there may have been a variety of motivating factors, and possible links to groups such as (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar al-Sharia) were being looked at closely,’ the official said.","Three emails were sent from Benghazi to White House, State Department, Pentagon, FBI and other offices .

"A judge in Wyoming sentenced a 75-year-old Missouri woman to life in prison on Monday for killing her husband with a rifle in the mid-1970s and throwing his body down the shaft of an abandoned gold mine, where it remained for nearly 40 years. Defendant Alice Uden wore wire glasses, a court-supplied hearing aid and a blue suit, and sat quietly in her wheelchair before speaking at the hearing. She sobbed gently as she addressed the court about the death of her third husband, Ronald Holtz, then 25. Life in prison: Alice Uden, 75, admitted to murdering her husband 40 years ago and dumping his body in a mine shaft, only for police to unearth it last summer. She will now spend the rest of her life behind bars . 'I've tried to atone for it,' Uden said. 'I wish that I never would have met him so that none of this ever would have happened. He was a very frightening man.' Jurors in Cheyenne didn't buy Uden's argument that she shot Holtz in the head to defend her toddler daughter from him. In May, they found her guilty of second-degree murder. Uden killed Holtz in late 1974 or early 1975 in Cheyenne, where he was living with her and her two-year-old daughter. Uden testified that she shot him with a rifle after he flew into a rage over the girl's crying and was inches away from attacking her in bed. Laramie County District Court Judge Steven Sharpe said he considered possible mitigating factors, including Uden's lack of prior criminal history. 'This was very much a cold, calculated murder,' Sharpe said. 'The jury heard all of the evidence that was before the court and the jury rejected the defense that it was self-defense.' District Attorney Scott Homar argued the killing was a thoughtful, deliberate act that rid Uden of Holtz. 'Her way out was to take Mr. Holtz's life while he was sleeping and then dispose of it in a way that it wouldn't be found for 39 1/2 years,' Homar said. Police arrested Uden and her fourth and current husband, Gerald Uden, 72, both of Chadwick, Missouri, last fall in southwest Missouri, accusing them of killing former spouses in separate attacks. Twist in the case: . Gerard Uden (right) - the fourth husband of Alice Uden (left) - was arrested at . the same time as her last summer on separate charges of killing his own wife and . two children in 1980. He has pleaded guilty . Gerald Uden has pleaded guilty to killing his ex-wife and her two sons in central Wyoming in 1980. Prosecutors have not drawn any link between the two cases. At her trial, Alice Uden testified that she removed Christmas decorations from a large cardboard barrel and put Holtz's body inside. She wrestled the barrel into her trunk, she said, and dumped the barrel in an abandoned gold mine on a ranch between Cheyenne and Laramie. One of Uden's sons, Todd Scott, testified at the trial that his mother told him decades ago that she had shot Holtz while he was asleep. After previous, unsuccessful attempts to find Holtz's remains in the mine filled with the carcasses of cattle and other ranch animals, investigators last summer dug deeper in the vertical shaft and finally excavated Holtz's remains. Evidence of an unhappy marriage: A . returned envelope containing divorce papers initiated by Alice Uden . -against the husband she murdered after only a few months together - were presented to the court . The jury declined to find Uden guilty of premeditated, first-degree murder, which would have carried a mandatory life sentence. The jury also declined to convict her of a less-serious charge of manslaughter. Uden's attorney, Donald Miller, urged the judge to sentence Uden to probation because the now-grown daughter, Erica Prunty, has cancer and has been given six months to live. He also highlighted the psychiatric history of Holtz, who met Uden, a former nurse, while she was working in the psychiatric unit at a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan. 'His behavior was unpredictable. He was irritable, he was hostile, he was explosive. He had no incentive to change,' Miller told the courtroom. Prosecutors in the case against Gerald Uden said the bodies of 32-year-old Virginia Uden, and her two sons, 11-year-old Richard Uden and 10-year-old Reagan Uden, have yet to be found. Convicted: Alice Uden wore a grim expression as . she left the courtroom in a wheelchair following her conviction in May, looking frail in a white shirt . and wire glasses . Gerald Uden told a Fremont County courtroom in November that he shot each of them with a rifle not far from his home, one after the other, and dumped their bodies in an abandoned mine. Months later, he said, he retrieved the bodies and sank them in Fremont Lake in western Wyoming. Investigators briefly searched the deep lake for the bodies and say they plan a more comprehensive search soon. Jurors at Alice Uden's trial were prohibited from hearing about Gerald Uden's case.","Alice Uden, 75, was found guilty of the second-degree murder of her husband in May .

"Matthew Bates, 25, was spared jail today after admitting being caught with bags full of smoke bombs and fireworks during an anti-cuts demonstration last year . An anti-cuts demonstrator caught with two bags full of 'smoke bombs and bangers' at a rally that ended with running battles between police and protestors was spared jail today. Matthew Bates, 25, was found with the fireworks during a TUC march against government austerity measures on March 26 last year. The demonstration sparked a mass sit-in at department store Fortnum and Mason and attacks on the Ritz Hotel and resulted in scores of arrests. Officers discovered the items when .

Bates Judge David Higgins said: 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious . offense, that of having an explosive substance which, as I understand . it, comprised smoke bombs and bangers. 'You had them in your possession during a public demonstration on March 26, 2011, against government spending cuts. 'If of course such implements or . explosives were used in a crowd it could result in great distress and a . danger of injury or even death of the crowd were to stampede, which . would simply then be a matter of chance, and such behaviour is . deplorable and deeply anti-social. 'I've . come to the conclusion that the proper and least sentence which I may . impose is a community order comprising on an unpaid work requirement of . 180 hours to be completed within 12 months.' The court heard Bates was stopped by police after he was seen collecting wood and discarded placards near to the burning effigy. Matthew Bates was arrested during last year's anti-cuts demonstrations in London which sparked a mass sit-in a department store Fortnum and Mason . When he was asked what he was doing he told an officer it was 'none of his business', said the prosecutor. Bates was subsequently taken to one side and searched.

"A woman has finally fulfilled her New Year's resolution by shedding nine stone after being given a personal trainer as a Christmas gift. Every year Denise Winwood, 54, from Nottingham, made it her mission to lose weight this year but never quite managed it. This year, however, she will finally be celebrating after her weight plummeted from more than 20 stone to just 11st. Superslimmer: Denise Winwood, 54, has finally achieved her New Year's resolution of losing weight . Much better: Denise spent years battling with her weight and has now lost an impressive nine stone . The administration officer has battled with her weight since she was a teenager and has spent most of her life fluctuating between a size 20 and 26. Now, thanks to husband Robert who hired her a personal trainer as a Christmas present last year, Denise is a svelte size 12 and couldn't be happier. 'I am a new woman now, both physically and mentally,' she revealed. 'I have amazed myself with what I have been able to achieve with the help of my personal trainer. 'I had tried dieting before, but when you weigh 20 stone you need to lose three before it even looks any different. After losing a few stone I would give up and put the weight back on and more.' The turning point for Denise came after she was turned down for her dream job and decided to do something for herself. She joined the gym in August 2011 and had lost three stone by December 2012, but her weight loss plateaued. Helping hand: Denise was able to fulfill her weight loss dreams after husband Robert got her a personal trainer . Svelte: Once a hefty size 26, Denise is now a size 12 thanks to the work of personal trainer, Dan . Since losing weight, Denise has completed a half marathon and can play with her grandchildren . So when her husband asked what she wanted for Christmas, Denise mentioned for a personal training session. 'When I joined the gym, it was the first time in 25 years,' she remembers. 'I lost three stone and felt incredible. 'But I started to get disheartened when the weight stopped coming off so I asked for a personal trainer. With Dan's help, I lost another five and a half stone. 'I must say it was tough. I worked hard and was disciplined, both in exercise and what I ate. With Dan's encouragement, his belief in me, his guidance and monitoring my nutrition, I was constantly being challenged and constantly moving forward.' She added: 'For the first time in my life I feel good about myself. I feel so fit. I can do things I never imagined I would be able to do, especially running.' Since losing the weight, Denise has run a half marathon in two hours and 37 minutes and is fit enough to play with her three grandchildren at the park. She now hopes her story will inspire others to lose weight in 2014. 'I want people to think that they can do it too,' she explained. 'When I was nine stone overweight, losing a stone never showed. You had to lose three stones before anyone noticed. It's a big challenge. 'Many times I would lose three stones and would put it all back on again. It's a long journey. I thought I'm never going to do this. But I have.'","Denise Winwood, 54, from Nottingham, had given up hope of losing weight .

"A man who calls himself 'Mule' has been riding through towns and cities in the U.S. for nearly 30 years with three real mules carrying his rather more high-tech possessions. The 65-year-old man describes himself - on his Facebook page - with the words: 'We are mules. We are from the outside. We live outside all day, every day.' He has been spotted by people in locations including outside the Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley and walking across the Golden Gate Bridge with his three-animal pack and saddlebags - which admittedly contain three mobiles, two voice recorders, a digital camera and a Samsung tablet computer which he uses to update his website. Master: 'Mule' - he has no other name - has ridden across American with his three-mule team . Mule, whose real name is John Sears, grew up in suburbia, just South of San Francisco, near Los Altos, according to The Atlantic, . A nomad by choice, he apparently bought his first mule 10 years ago in Spokane, Washington, so he could carry more supplies with him into the bush and visit towns less often. Mule says he works menial jobs in the winter months in order to buy what he needs. He travels during the summer, walking by day and sleeping in public spaces or on grass beside the road at night. While no details are known about why . Mule started his wandering, in recent years he has become a campaigner . against urban development in California which, he warns, is gradually being subsumed into a 'megatropolis'. 'The space is continually shrinking,' he told the Press Democrat. 'We have to bring the man-made world into balance.' Team: Two of the Mules that have walked across the cities and countryside of the U.S. Back and forth: Mule has been walking across the American West for the past 29 years . Diary: Mule carries three mobiles, two voice recorders, a camera and a computer to document his travels on Facebook and his website . According to his website, his nomadic lifestyle made him notice 'an ever increasing urban sprawl' and that 'as the urban environment exploded, natural habitats have vanished'. He claims to have made the decision to start speaking out two years ago on the 295 mile walk from Las Vegas to Ely, Nevada. He charges his computer in Starbucks and uses it to document his travels and update his website and Facebook page. He explained: 'I needed a website so that when I got to California, I would have a voice. 'I'm nothing. I'm uneducated, I'm a weak little man, I'm the low man on the totem pole and I've been there my whole life. But a website would be my voice.' Defiant: Mule has frequent run-ins with the police for offences such as sleeping rough . Wanderer: Mule rides between cities such as San Diego, left, to more equine-friendly communities . Ride-thru: The Mules' owner first turned to the animals to help him carry supplies on his nomadic wanderings - here shown outside a burger joint in Corona, California and in the town of Westwood, Massachusetts . Broadwalk: The Mules take a trip down the road in the city of Moonpark, California . Old ways: The Mules take a trip past the San Mateo County History Museum . He also has a lawyer, Sharon Sherman, to help him deal with his frequent run-ins with the police. She has taken on the work free of charge because she is fascinated by the legal questions Mule raises. She said: 'I've been in practice for 35 years, but Mule really made me stop and think about issues that I've never considered before. 'We have a countervailing balance between public space, private space, and what access do we really have to public space. 'Sure, I can walk down a street, but which street? What's the difference in using a road in a car, than with mules? Why do you have more rights in a car, than if you are walking, and walking with animals?' Outsider: Mule has a lawyer who represents him free of charge, and he has been jailed in the past and sent to a mental facility . Traffic: The Mules make the most of a multi-use bikeway in an industrial area . Mule is currently fighting a $485 charge . for sleeping in the entrance to Torrey Pines State Reserve and a court . date was originally set for August 2013, but had to be pushed back until . 2014 because Mule travels with the sun and seasons. In another episode he was arrested at . the side of the 101 highway last month, jailed, and then sent to a . metal facility before eventually being released. He . is also being followed by an American film maker John McDonald who is . making a documentary about him and helping him with his gadgets.

"Arshad Arif was unanimously convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court of a double rape on a drunk teenager . A convicted rapist attacked a schoolgirl after targeting her when she lost her friends on a night out. Arshad Arif, 28, raped the 17-year-old as she tried to get home to her family’s £2.5million mansion after becoming stranded outside a nightclub with no money or phone. The rape was a chilling re-enactment of an attack Arif carried out on a girl of the same age in 2004. He was convicted and jailed for five years in 2006 after admitting the crime. He had been out of prison for just over two years when he carried out the second rape last November. He was remanded in custody after being found guilty of raping the teenager twice and is awaiting sentencing. A jury heard that Arif lured the 17-year-old into a taxi in the early hours of the morning and took her to a park in Slough, which was miles from her home, and raped her twice. The drunken girl eventually escaped, jumped over a wall at the nearby home of an elderly couple and hammered on the door to raise the alarm. The rapist was caught because the girl had asked to use his phone to call home and police were able to trace him through his number. Jury members heard that in 2004, Arif had approached another drunken 17-year-old in the early morning, under the pretence of taking her home, and raped her in a flat. On Thursday they took less than two hours to reach unanimous guilty verdicts on each of the two counts of rape. In a recorded police interview heard . in court, his distraught victim said: ‘I just felt like I’m going to . die. It’s just hard to believe it actually happened, that I would get . away.’ The petite girl said the taller, stronger Arif had pushed her down and made her perform a sex act on him while threatening her. ‘If I didn’t do it, I was going to be raped,’ she said. ‘In the end it was both.’ The attack was almost identical to another one he was convicted for in 2004 . The eight women and four men on the jury at Reading Crown Court had heard how his latest victim had been on a night out celebrating a friend’s birthday with nine girls when she became separated from them on November 25 last year. The girl was stranded in the cold and wet outside Oceana nightclub, in Watford, Hertfordshire, for about an hour, drunk, with no phone or money and wearing just a small black dress and high heels.She used strangers’ phones to try to call her own phone, which was in a bag with her friends, but nobody answered. She also tried to take a taxi home but was dropped back within minutes when the driver realised she had no money. Arif, who was on his own in the town, then joined her and several other people who had sought shelter from the cold in a doorway. CCTV footage shows them walking off together. At 3.15am, the girl’s parents – both successful professionals – were woken by a call from Arif’s mobile phone to their home landline. The girl said: ‘Mum, it’s me. I don’t feel well and I’ve lost the others. Can you come and get me?’Within five minutes the concerned mother was on the road, yet when she got to Oceana her daughter was not there and she raised the alarm with police. Reading Crown Court heard that Arif raped the girl twice as she tried to get home from a nightclub . The tearful woman told the court: ‘I went looking for her in bins, in alleyways. There’s a large pond behind Oceana and I was looking to see if she had drowned in there.’ Meanwhile Arif, who runs a mobile phone and watch business, and the girl were in a taxi heading to his hometown of Slough, Berkshire. As they arrived at a park, the driver noted the girl did not want to leave. She was then pushed and carried through the park to a remote spot and attacked. As Arif led her out afterwards, she seized the chance to escape and ran to the home of pensioners Michael and Barbara Georgiu. Arif ran off to his nearby home. Arif was identified by his mobile phone number and arrested. Detective Sergeant Lucy Deane said: ‘This man is a dangerous predatory offender who needs to be locked up to ensure the safety of young women who find themselves, through no fault of their own, in vulnerable situations. ‘He literally hunted this victim down – identifying her vulnerability and taking the worst kind of advantage imaginable.’","Arshad Arif raped a 17-year-old as she tried to get home from a night club .

"Chelsea are furious with the FA after they failed to punish Burnley’s Ashley Barnes for his terrible tackle on Nemanja Matic. The FA confirmed on Monday that blunder referee Martin Atkinson — who has been omitted from this weekend’s matchlist — claims to have seen that incident and Barnes’s kick at Branislav Ivanovic. Jose Mourinho and the Chelsea board will demand a modification of the rules relating to retrospective punishments after Barnes escaped further action. Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Ashley Barnes . This studs-up tackle from Barnes infuriated Matic and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Matic will learn the outcome of his appeal on Tuesday after being handed a three-match ban for his reaction . Barnes slides into a challenge with Chelsea midfielder Willian during the heated contest . Reports on Monday night claimed that Premier League delegate Steve Greaves, who was at Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge to assess Atkinson, agreed with the referee on the four contentious decisions which most angered Mourinho. Burnley manager Sean Dyche, unhappy that his player’s conduct has been highlighted by Mourinho in such a public way, issued a video statement in defence of Barnes and said the challenge was made to look worse by slow-motion replays. Dyche said: ‘I find it hard to believe that all these people, including the Chelsea manager, using very strong phrases didn’t have any reaction at all at that live moment,’ he said. That will not stop Matic continuing with his appeal against his three-match ban for the shove that followed Barnes’s tackle in an attempt to play in Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham. Sean Dyche defended his striker Ashley Barnes, insisting the Burnley man had got the ball in the challenge . Dyche makes a point during the ten minute analysis of Martin Atkinson's performance last weekend . Jose Mourinho described the tackle as 'criminal' during his appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . Matic has appealed based on ‘excessive punishment’ and Chelsea are expected to present views of former players — including Sky Sports analyst Gary Neville and the BBC’s Alan Shearer — claiming their player was entitled to react. The FA’s three-man independent commission will sit today and a decision on Matic’s punishment is expected this afternoon. Mourinho claims Barnes should have been sent off and criticised his conduct by referring to him as ‘a player, if you can call him that’. It has emerged that Chelsea captain John Terry showed team-mates stud marks down his legs, allegedly from a tackle by Barnes, and is understood to have brought a rogue elbow to his eye socket, again apparently from Barnes, to the attention of Atkinson during the game. The Chelsea manager was not happy with several decisions during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Burnley . Mourinho appears on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday after Chelsea's controversial draw with Burnley . The match official, who booked just three players during one of the feistiest games in the Premier League this season, took no action. He has been left off this weekend’s referees’ match list and will be the fourth official for Manchester United’s home game against Sunderland. Mourinho, who was fined £25,000 by the game’s governing body for claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against his club after their draw with Southampton last year, will not be punished for his latest comments. He was unhappy about the Matic incident, Barnes’s challenge on Ivanovic and two penalty appeals that were turned down. His appearance on Sky’s Goals on Sunday has provoked widespread debate about the rules governing retrospective punishments and the FA went to some lengths to explain them on Monday. An FA spokesman said: ‘Retrospective action was introduced as a deterrent for off-the-ball incidents (eg. kicks, stamps, etc) committed out of sight of officials. In line with this rationale, the FA confirm no further action in relation to Ashley Barnes as the incident was seen by the officials.’","Ashley Barnes will not face retrospective action for dangerous tackle .

"The Premier League is now so wealthy that all 20 clubs from England’s top flight last season are among the richest 40 clubs in the world by income — even relegated Norwich City. There are five English clubs in the top 10 of the football ‘Rich List’, published on Thursday by accountants Deloitte. Manchester United are back up to No 2 behind Real Madrid. Half of the top 40 wealthiest football clubs are from the Premier League, according to a new survey . Champions League winners Real Madrid are the wealthiest club in the world . United’s income of £433million in 2013-14 left them behind the Spanish giants, who brought in £459m, but ahead of third-placed Bayern Munich (£407.7m), Barcelona in fourth (£405.3m) and Paris Saint-Germain in fifth (£396.6m). Real Madrid have now been the richest club by earnings for 10 years in a row. Manchester City (£346.5m), Chelsea (£324.4m), Arsenal (£300m) and Liverpool (£255.8m) are next in the top 10. Newcastle and Everton squeeze into the top 20, with West Ham and Aston Villa just below them. Southampton are the 25th richest club in the world (on £106.1m), with Sunderland, Swansea and Stoke inside the top 30. The rest of last season’s Premier League teams earned more than the £80m necessary for a top-40 place. This was largely down to lucrative new 2013-16 TV deals which began to pour into club coffers last season. Austin Houlihan, senior manager at Deloitte, said: ‘This is testament to the huge appeal of the Premier League globally and the equality of distribution the clubs enjoy relative to their European counterparts.’ 1.

"A professor at the University of Texas has sparked outrage by claiming  black students are failing academically because they have been raised in single parent homes usually by females. Law professor Lino Graglia was talking to the BBC when he said he could 'hardly imagine a less beneficial or more deleterious experience than to be raised by a single parent, usually female, uneducated and without a lot of money.' He said the average black performance on SAT test is 200 points lower than that for the average white student and that among the black population almost three quarters of children are now born outside of marriage. Race row: Professor Graglia suggested that being raised in single parent families is affecting the academic performance of Black and Hispanic students . The outspoken professor appeared . slightly flustered when the BBC interviewer pointed out that he was . black and raised in a single parent family himself. But he continued: 'How well do these kids do in maths and reading is basically it and they do less well. 'And race or segregation or history wouldn't matter one bit if that was not the case. 'No doubt the race and segregation may have a lot to do why that's the case, but it is the case and what to do about it now? 'And admitting them into selective schools with large gaps in qualification is not the answer.' Graglia is no stranger to controversy and was accused of racism in 1997 after telling a conservative student group that black and Mexican-American cultures 'set children up for failure'. He said: 'They have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement. 'Failure is not looked upon with disgrace.' In response the League of United Latin American Citizens demanded he resign issuing a resolution which stated: 'Graglia believes that minority students come from a culture of failure. 'He knows nothing of our culture and has never crawled down from his ivory tower to find out.

She has now taken her claim to the Supreme Court Fisher claiming that she was denied entrance into U.T. because she is white, and wasn't afforded the same career opportunities she'd have had otherwise.

"Daisy Coleman, the teen cheerleader who was intensely bullied by her small Missouri town after reporting a rape, is in hospital with possible brain damage following an attempt to take her own life Sunday night. The teen's heartbroken mother revealed the tragic overdose on Facebook just hours after it happened and hit out at two of Daisy's former friends who had written nasty messages to her just days before. Melinda Coleman also begged cyber 'hacktivist' organization Anonymous, which showed support for her daughter late last year when the story was in the headlines, not to abandon the case after she said they failed to follow up on any of her leads. Recovering: Daisy Coleman, pictured on January 4, is in hospital following an attempt to take her own life Sunday night. Her mother says she will keep fighting to prove she was the victim of rape two years ago . 'Where is anonymous now?' Dr Coleman wrote on Facebook Monday. 'My daughter has been terrorized to the point she tried to kill herself last night. She may never be ok. Where are you and your super hacking skills and internet help now.......we really need them.' Daisy was subjected . to constant cyber-bullying from classmates at her high school - and even parents - in the . quiet town of Maryville after she reported in January 2012 that she had . been raped by at least one older football player. She . told police the 17-year-old boy, Matthew Barnett, invited her to a . party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had . sex with her while his friend filmed the incident on an iPhone. All . charges against Barnett, now 19, were dropped in connection with the . alleged rape last January. Dr Coleman and her daughter did a . string of media appearances in October to raise awareness of the case . and the bullying they were suffering but since then it has only . worsened, Dr Coleman said, driving Daisy to such extreme actions. Victimized: The high school student, pictured left and right, was subjected to constant cyber-bullying from classmates - and even parents - in the quiet town of Maryville after she reported in January 2012 that she had been raped by at least one older football player . 'She had been pretty good, when we were doing interviews and she felt like people were supporting her and honestly being in bigger cities where people were more open-minded it was helping her a lot,' she said. 'When we got back here where we had to be quiet, it became really, really hard. For both of us.' On Friday night, Daisy briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends. 'I had let her go to a party with a friend, she was there for an hour . and a half. Then she came home and saw Facebook. (One girl) decided to . write something saying ""you're a fake and a phoney,"" ""you wanted it"" and . ""you're a slut"" because she went to the party,' Dr Coleman told . MailOnline. Another girl allegedly chimed in, calling Daisy a 'hypocrite' for going to the party. Dr Coleman then attacked the pair online, sparking a heated back-and-forth argument. 'I was just really angry. I couldn't believe these girls were writing such horrible things to my daughter and defending it,' she said. Helpless: Daisy Coleman's mother, Melinda Coleman, pictured, said she felt helpless after how her family has been treated . 'She has been through so much and she has done so little. All the other kids are out partying and doing all this stuff and she isn't, she's at home with me all the time. The second they see her at a party for five minutes drinking a Redbull it's all over Facebook and they're tearing her to smithereens... 'They just won't leave her alone, Literally, I have a large grocery bag full of the messages that I've printed off Facebook. Full of them. F*** you comments, get out of town, all of it.' But this time, the victimization got too much. 'She was in her room (Sunday night) then she walked into her brother's room and said she was seeing ghosts and she was freaking out,' Dr Coleman said of the horrific moment she learned her daughter had tried to kill herself. 'She was acting very strangely.' The mother said she and her sons got . Daisy to vomit then they rushed her to the hospital where doctors pumped . her stomach and put her on an IV. It's unclear yet if she'll suffer . permanent damage from the overdose. Party: Last week, Daisy, pictured with blonde hair, briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends . Bullying: '(One girl) decided to write something saying ""you're a fake and a phoney,"" ""you wanted it"" and ""you're a slut"" because she went to the party,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline of the recent comments . 'She's . not coherent, she makes no sense, she's like a two year old,' Dr . Coleman said, breaking into tears again. 'I asked the nurse if she . thought she would get better and she said there was no way of telling.' Dr Coleman, who lost her job at a local veterinarian in the midst of the rape controversy and moved her family some 33 miles out of Maryville to ease the onslaught from the community, claims she has also been followed by a private investigator allegedly linked to the Barnett family. She said the investigator's silver Chevy sedan even ran Daisy off the road the day before Thanksgiving, when she had been driving her mother's car. 'I normally use the Hummer but I was . at the gym and Daisy's car wouldn't start so she took the Hummer to pick . up her brother,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline. 'They . started briding her and they bumping against her bumper and they scared . her so she turned too soon and rolled the car all the way down the . hill. She rolled it six times and totaled it. 'They watched it happen and they waited before driving off,' she added. TV . slots: Dr Coleman and Daisy, who waived her right to anonymity, had appeared on numerous television interviews in their determination to . fight for justice . Never be normal: Daisy says she can't be a normal teenager, because she is constantly being criticized and bullied by her peers . Daisy ended up in hospital but luckily escaped with just bruises. After that, Dr Coleman, who had taken down the car's number plate, contacted Anonymous again because police told her they couldn't look up the vehicle because it wasn't from Missouri. 'If they could find out who this license plate belongs to... At this point I am begging them, if they would just get this information. But they haven't been responding,' she said. Dr Coleman said the group has done very little since it spoke out about the case last year. But she made a desperate plea for the organization to use its hacking skills to help the family now, particularly with Daisy in the hospital. She wants Anonymous to unearth the iPhone video of the alleged rape, which she believes was carried out by four boys, not just one. 'The video is gone - the video of them raping my daughter,' she said. 'I think it was all four boys and they made sure to hide it. They knew they could get the one off the hook but I honestly think it was all four of them. Outrage: . The case sparked national soul searching after all charges were . dropped against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech, right, and then . Daisy and her family were vilified by the community . 'If Anonymous really could get that video it's a slam dunk.' Thirdly, she is begging Anonymous to access emails sent between prosecutor Robert Rice and Sheriff for Maryville Darren White. 'If Anonymous could get that trail and prove it was political it would be another slam dunk.' The mother said she remained near enough to Maryville to ensure her eldest son could continue his scholarship for baseball and her second son, who is a star wrestler, wouldn't lose his chance to get his own scholarship for the sport. After a big state meet in February, she plans to uproot and move to Kansas City. 'I need to get (Daisy) out of here and I need to get my youngest son out of here,' she said. 'We can't do this any more, I don't know what to do. I don't want to run but I don't know what else to do but run.' In the meantime, Daisy is waiting to be transferred to a hospital in Kansas City. Which hospital depends on the family's limited health cover. 'My insurance only covers a certain amount,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline. 'Now the Hummer is destroyed. Quite honestly I don't have the money so I have to find where she can go that she can be covered.' The entrance of Maryville High School - High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported she had been raped in January 2012 . In late October, the family won a small victory when special prosecutor Jean Baker was assigned to re-investigate the case. However, Dr Coleman is bracing for disappointment as the release of Ms Baker's report nears. 'I appreciate so much what she has done but I do think the people before her were covering for themselves and they were lying and cheating and deleting evidence so I think we will learn something but it will not be enough,' she said. 'Unless Anonymous can find it, that evidence will never be found.' For now, the distraught mother is just hoping Daisy's condition will improve enough that the family can attempt to start a new life somewhere else. 'I feel pretty helpless,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline. 'I feel pretty much like there's no justice, like people can destroy my children, my family, my life and take away my career and my home and there's nothing I can do about it.'","Maryville, Missouri, mother, Melinda Coleman, revealed her daughter's overdose on Facebook Sunday .

"While some are throwing fantastical Doomsday countdown parties, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is issuing grave warnings that 2012 Mayan apocalypse rumors pose a real-life threat to frightened children and depressive teenagers. David Morrison, an astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, said on Wednesday that he receives a large number of emails and letters from worried citizens, most often from young people. Some say they can't eat, or are too worried to sleep, while others say they are suicidal, Morrison said. Doomsday fears: Fantastical rumors of the world's end are causing real-life concerns among frightened children and depressive teenagers, NASA scientists says . Ancient signs: The doomsday fears are based on misinterpretations of the Mayan calendar . He made that announcement during an online video 'hangout' event hosted by NASA on Google+, calling the propagation of rumors on the Internet to frighten children ‘evil.’ ‘While this is a joke to some people and a mystery to others, there is a core of people who are truly concerned,’ Morrison said. NASA, a United States government agency, recently set up an information page on its website explaining why the world is not going to end on December 21, 2012. The apocalypse rumors and fears are based on misinterpretations of the Mayan calendar, as SPACE.com reported. The rumors began with claims that Nibiru, a rogue planet discovered by the Sumerians, will crash into Earth on December 21, killing everyone, according to NASA’s website. Rumor debunker: David Morrison, an astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, says the world will not end on December 2011 . Rumor originator: Zecharia Sitchin wrote in 1976 that he had found and translated Sumerian documents identifying a rogue planet that will destroy Earth . The origins of those rumors have been linked to the works of the late Azerbaijani-born author Zecharia Sitchin, who wrote in 1976 that he had found and translated Sumerian documents identifying the rogue planet. Sitchin died in 2010 at the age of 90. There is no such planet, scientists say. ‘If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth in 2012, astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade, and it would be visible by now to the naked eye,’ NASA states on its apocalypse fear debunking page. Other rumors -- including claims that the Earth's magnetic field will suddenly reverse and claims that the planet is heading towards a black hole at the center of the Milky Way -- were also dismissed on Wednesday. Concerns about the planet’s demise would be better directed on more substantiated problems such as climate change, Andrew Fraknoi, an astronomer at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California, said.

'When she’s in an episode, she might get up to go to the toilet or get a drink but she’s not awake. I call it sleep mode. Disorder: She missed nine exams and even her birthday because of a rare condition which leaves her sleeping for weeks at a time . 'When she wakes, she thinks it’s the following day. She doesn’t have any memory of it.' During an episode, Stacey can be in a deep sleep for more than 20 hours a day. She only rises to go to toilet or sip water in a trace-like state. Amazingly in this state she is up just long enough for her mother to give her some food before she goes back to bed. Stacey has lost almost two stone because of her condition. Ms Richards, who is a full-time . mother-of-six, describes it like ‘living with Jekyll and Hyde’ because . the change in her daughter is like a switch flicking. She . said: 'She needs reassurance during an episode. It’s like she reverts . back to being five years old. When she talks, she sounds like a child. 'When . she’s in sleep mode she can be quite moody but she can’t help it. She’s . like a toddler who wants to do things her own way. She stamps her foot . if she doesn’t get what she wants. 'It’s like having two different kids in the house.' Changes: Ms Richards, who is a full-time mother-of-six, describes it like 'living with Jekyll and Hyde' because the change in her daughter is like a switch flicking . Stacey started experiencing symptoms about a year ago, but she was only diagnosed in March as the condition is so rare. When her illness first emerged, doctors put it down to her being a ‘moody teenager.’ Bernie said: 'Stacey was tired all the time. She couldn’t concentrate at school. KLS is a disease of adolescence, and sometimes will begin after infection or illness, . There is no known cause or cure for the sleeping disorder. Stacey is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Tom Rico of the Center for Narcolepsy & KLS Research at Stanford University, California told the BBC: . 'An individual with KLS will have sleep episodes, typically lasting between one and three weeks, with coinciding cognitive disturbance in the few hours of wakefulness. 'During this time period, a patient will sleep anywhere between 16 to 22 hours a day, every day, until the conclusion of the episode.' She’d come home zonked out and have to sleep the whole weekend. When it came to Monday morning, I couldn’t wake her up. 'Then one day I got a call from school to come and pick her up because she wasn’t very well. 'I took her to our GP. I had to pull Stacey’s legs to get her out of the car and get her into the surgery. All she wanted to do was sleep. 'The GP said: ‘I know it sounds awful but she looks like a moody, depressed teenager’.' Stacey was referred to the Princess Royal Hospital, Telford, where doctors feared she had a brain tumour. She was given a brain scan and was also checked for conditions like narcolepsy and epilepsy. When the results came back clear, doctors were left baffled until a neurologist at Birmingham Children’s Hospital eventually diagnosed Stacey with Kleine Levin Syndrome. Ms Richards, said: 'Having a diagnosis means Stacey knows it’s not all in her mind. She’s had that much stick off people. They don’t understand. 'I was even investigated by the local education authority because Stacey’s school thought I was deliberately keeping her out of school. They’ve stopped now we’ve got a diagnosis. 'I always knew there was something wrong. I know my daughter. 'She’s gone from a fresh faced teenager, full of energy to sleeping all the time. 'We can’t plan anything because Stacey might be asleep. 'She could go to sleep tonight and wake up next week. 'We try and laugh and joke about it because it’s the only way to get through it.' There is no known cure for Kleine Levin Syndrome, although some experts believe that some sufferers do grow out of it. Since her diagnosis, Stacey has been put on a high does of a stimulant drug called modafinil to help keep her awake. Ms Richards, said: 'It seems to be working. She’s more awake and it’s improving her quality of life. We will have to see how she gets on.' Stacey, who hopes to go back to school on a part-time basis soon, said: 'I’ve missed nine exams and my birthday in November. 'It’s easier now people know what it is. It’s easier to explain to them. Before, people didn’t believe me. That was the hardest thing. 'People would pull faces at school if I said I was tired and needed to go home.'","Stacey Comerford, 15, from Telford, Shropshire, has a rare condition called Kleine-Levin syndrome, which makes her nod off for lengthy periods .

"Are you one of those people who can't leave a pimple alone - even though you know your skin will look red and sore afterwards? Now, one doctor has revealed the best way to attack blemishes - and claims this method won't hurt. Appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show, Dr Mehmet Oz said up to one in five of us are obsessed with picking blemishes, but most of us go about it completely the wrong way. 'Never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it,' he said. Scroll down for video . 'Never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it,' said Dr Oz. He added the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it. Instead, use a needle cleaned with alcohol . 'What's important is to not jab the needle in', he says. Instead, place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin across . He went on to explain that the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it. 'You're destroying all the healthy tissue with the pressure you are putting on there by squeezing.' Using a revolting-looking giant blemish as a prop, he continued: 'The pimple is the body trying to push way the pus.' Rather than prodding away at the skin with dirty fingers, he advised using a needle that has been cleaned with alcohol. 'What's important is to not jab it in', he says - referring to the technique many of us use. Instead, place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another. 'Then, rip UP,' he declared. 'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead,' he said. Here, there is no sensation, but if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt. The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he added. 'Then, rip UP,' he declares. 'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead' Ripping up means you're attacking a bit where there is no sensation. But if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt. The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he adds. Last year, scientists discovered why some people are more prone to spots than others. The researchers, from UCLA, said the key was finding out more about the bacteria that live on the skin and cause acne. This bacteria contains ‘bad’ strains which cause pimples and ‘good’ ones that may protect the skin. Having too much 'bad' bacteria is what causes spots, they say. This is rather like an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut causing digestive issues. It is not yet clear why some people have more of either type of bacteria, or what comes first - the acne or the bacteria. Other factors, such as an individual's genetic make-up or the sensitivity of their immune system, may also dictate whether good or bad strains grow on skin.","'Never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it,' said Dr Mehmet Oz .

"Despite European Championship elimination, a new list of cities with the most beautiful women in the world reveals men in Russia and Ukraine still have plenty to cheer about. After Wayne Rooney's winner for England last night, people in the Ukrainian capital Kiev will be happily looking to each other for consolation. Travelers Digest's Top Ten Cities With The Most Beautiful Woman says Kiev is 'without a doubt, home to the world’s most beautiful women'. Stunner: Ukrainian born actress Mila Kunis who starred in Hollywood film Forgetting Sarah Marshall comes from the country whose capital city Kiev was named as having the world's best looking women . Eastern beauty: Karina Zhyronkina, the 21-year-old Ukrainian student, (left) who . was crowned Miss Ukraine 2012 in Kiev this year comes from a city with . the worlds most beautiful women as does Stogniy Olena (right) a student from Kiev, crowned Miss Ukraine in Kiev in 2002 . Lookers: Ukrainian fans at Euro 2012 were likely to be better looking than most, especially if from Kiev, according to a new list of the top ten cities with the most beautiful women . In praising its population the online magazine notes: 'A visit to Kiev is truly awe-inducing and it’s almost hard to believe that women this beautiful even exist. 'And for anyone who thinks that beautiful women must be vapid as well, Ukrainian women are ready to disprove that theory. 'The women in the country are well educated and always ready to talk about literature or philosophy.' Russia's team was also knocked out in the group stage to the Greek team, who are renown for winning ugly on the pitch. Close call: Stockholm born actress Malin Akerman (right) comes from the city named as having the second best looking women in the world, while Swedish football fans proved pretty as a picture at Euro 2012 . But men in Moscow were more likely . than most to have a beautiful shoulder to cry on, with their city rated . as having the world's sixth most attractive females. Travelers Digest's says: 'This may surprise the cold-war generation who grew up believing the stereotypes of Russian women being plain and ordinary. 'A quick visit to Moscow should set you straight on that front. Think tall, blonde or brunette and blue-eyed goddesses. 'That’s not to say these girls are easy to talk to; Russians can be an intimidating bunch.' Natural beauty: Israeli model Bar Refaeli is an example for the beauty's found in the country's capital Tel Aviv . Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato (right), wife of singer Michael Buble and model for Ultimo, comes from the country whose capital Buenos Aires was named as having the world's fourth most beautiful women and Russian beauty Irina Shayk (left), who goes out with Real Madrid and Portugal star Ronaldo, who comes from Russia whose capital Moscow came sixth on the list . Stockholm is on the second on this list, with the website saying: 'What you have seen on the beer commercials is true; Sweden really does . have some of the world’s most beautiful women. 'The streets of Stockholm . are literally packed with these gorgeous women, who are as tall as they . are luscious. 'Even better, is that Scandinavians are world renowned for . their friendliness, so there’s a good chance that the girl you’re eyeing . is actually a sweet and down to earth person.' The only American city that makes the list is third placed New York.

"The first potato genetically modified to resist blight may soon be grown in Britain. It was engineered in a three-year project that saw genes from a wild South American potato inserted into a normal Desiree. Scientists say it is fully resistant to blight, caused by the organism Phytophthora infestans, which destroys up to half of British crops in a bad year. Revolution: Professor Joanthan Jones, who led the three-year study, with the two crops which were combined . The disease was responsible for the Irish famine of 1845 and remains potato farmers’ greatest enemy, costing them £60 million a year. However, critics say tampering with genes in crops to create ‘Frankenfoods’ could damage natural ecosystems and affect human health, and insist shoppers would never knowingly buy GM products. The results of the latest research, published today in a Royal Society journal, show 100 per cent of non-GM plants in a trial were infected by blight, while the new variety was fully resistant. Boiling with anger: Will GM spuds soon be in shops? The researchers, at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norfolk, hope to use the technology on the Maris Piper potato, which makes up 15 per cent of the British market. Desirees make up 2 per cent. Consumer fears have so far kept genetic engineering out of British farming. No GM products have ever been commercially grown in this country, and only one – a pest-resistant maize – is authorised for cultivation in Europe. Currently all GM foods have to be labelled, but meat, milk and eggs from farm animals fed on GM products do not, and campaigners are worried about political pressure to accelerate research in the field. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has warned that Britain risks becoming the ‘museum of world farming’ if it does not embrace the technology. But Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the Soil Association, said: ‘There is no market for GM potatoes in the UK. ‘Growing any GM potatoes in the UK could lead to contamination in the supply chain, resulting in massive loss of markets for UK farmers.’ Liz O’Neill, director of the GM Freeze campaign group, said: ‘Experience shows that the UK doesn’t want GM in its shopping basket and British farmers are far too smart to grow something they can’t sell, so just who is this new potato being developed for?’ The campaign group GeneWatch UK accused the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, which funded the trial, of wasting taxpayers’ money. Dr Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, said: 'There are blight-resistant non-GM potatoes already on the market. Why waste money, take unnecessary risks, and end up with a product that no one wants to eat?' Dr Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘There are blight-resistant non-GM potatoes already on the market. Why waste money, take unnecessary risks, and end up with a product that no one wants to eat?’ But Professor Jonathan Jones, who led the research, said: ‘This is the first peer-reviewed report of a GM trial conducted in the UK in which there was clear benefit of the trait – in this case disease resistance – illustrating the potential of the technology.’ It would stop farmers having to spray crops, and Professor Jones hopes to ‘replace chemical control with genetic control’. He said the GM crops would produce three times more potatoes than normal varieties. Scientists are now studying ways to thwart future attacks by blight that becomes resistant to the new variety. Before the potato can be planted commercially and sold to consumers in the UK, it will have to pass notoriously laborious EU tests for toxicity, allergic reactions and the risk of contaminating other crops with modified genes.","Genes from South American potato were inserted into normal Desiree .

"Children were forced to eat their own vomit and have sex with staff at an Australian orphanage run by the Anglican church, an inquiry has heard. A former child resident told the royal commission into the alleged abuse that young children were viciously beaten over decades of systematic abuse at the North Coast Children's Home in Lismore, New South Wales. The witness, known only as CK, said today that some children suffered ritual sexual abuse at the hands of staff. Children were systematically abused at the Anglican-run North Coast Children's Home in Lismore, New South Wales, a royal commission has heard . The Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Sydney was set up to investigate the Church's handling of the abuse when complaints were made from 2005. About seven former residents, who lived at the orphanage between 1944 and 1985, are expected to give evidence at the two-week inquiry. It is estimated that about 200 children suffered physical or sexual abuse at the home. In 2006, the Anglican Church paid compensation to 38 victims but other claims were later rejected. In his graphic account of abuse at the care home, CK told the hearing that he was subjected to a 'cleansing process' in which a minister licked him while a cross was placed on his body. The inquiry was also told that children as young as five were forced to have oral sex. Seven former residents of the home will give evidence to the two-week commission (file picture) CK, who left the home in 1958, said he was once made to sit at a table for ten hours because he refused to eat. 'If you threw up they made you eat the vomit and I was not going to do that', he was quoted by saying by Nine MSN. He . described one incident in which a matron beat three children so badly . in a shower that there was blood running into the drain. Many children went on to commit suicide, the hearing was told. CK . said: 'The pain that we have, we will take to the grave. The ones who . have suicided, they're possibly the lucky ones. We're the living dead . that remain.' He spoke of terrible conditions in which children had no shoes and few clothes. Former resident and campaigner Tommy Campion spearheaded the suit against the church. He . has accused the Anglican Church of fighting claims of abuse and he and . his sister refused to accept compensation that was given to claimants. The church apologised for the abuse earlier this year. The commission is expected to sit for two weeks.","Royal commission opened into Church's response to abuse allegations .

"The last of the six Britons arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic has been freed . Philip Ball from Oxford was granted bail last week but remained in detention before being released by a court in St Petersburg today. Only one of the 30 people arrested by the Russian authorities two months ago - Australian Colin Russell - remains in detention. Finally free: Philip Ball from Oxford was the final British Greenpeace activist to be released from jail in Russia . Relief: Mr Ball's brother, Steve, said they are thrilled he can now talk to his family and friends after two months . Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise was seized by the Russian authorities, who arrested the 28 activists and two freelance journalists on board. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, sitting in Hamburg, has ruled that the ship and those arrested should be released in return for a 3.6 million euro (£3 million) bond. The five Britons previously released were Anthony Perrett, from Newport in south Wales, freelance journalist Kieron Bryan, Alexandra Harris from Exeter, Iain Rogers from Devon, and Frank Hewetson from London. Mr Ball's brother, Steve, said: 'It's absolutely brilliant news. After two months in jail he could have done without another weekend behind bars, but it's a great relief to know he's finally out and able to talk to his friends and colleagues.

"Children with an autism spectrum disorder spend about twice as much time playing video games as those who do not have a developmental disability, according to a new study. Researchers also found that children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD are at an increased risk of gaming addictions, compared to children without the disabilities. ‘What we found is that it looks like addictive gaming is largely driven by inattention,’ Christopher Engelhardt, from the University of Missouri in Columbia, U.S., said. Children with an autism spectrum disorder spend about twice as much time playing video games as those who do not have a developmental disability . Previous studies have found that children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD spend more time playing video games and are at increased risk of gaming addictions than other children, the researchers wrote in the journal Paediatrics. No single study, however, has looked at the three groups to see whether shared features of autism and ADHD - such as inattention or hyperactivity - seem to drive video game use. For the new study, Mr Engelhardt and his colleague surveyed the parents of 141 boys between the ages of eight and 18. Of those, 56 had an autism spectrum disorder, 44 had ADHD, and 41 were developing normally. Overall, they found that children with an autism spectrum disorder played - on average - 2.1 hours of video games per day. Children with ADHD spent about 1.7 hours per day playing video games and normally developing children played about 1.2 hours per day. Children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD were also more likely to have a video game system in their rooms, according to the researchers. Children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD are at an increased risk of gaming addictions . The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends that children do not spend more than two hours in front of a screen per day. The researchers also asked the parents to answer questions about the types of video games their children played the most, about their gaming behaviour, and their symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention. While normally developing children tended to pick first-person shooter or sports games, children with autism and ADHD were more likely to play role-playing games. Role-playing games have been linked to video game addiction in previous studies. The researchers did find that children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD were more likely to exhibit symptoms of video game addiction or ‘problematic video game use’, compared to those with typical development. Overall, they found the number of hours a child spent playing video games and inattention were linked to video game addiction. ‘Among people with autism, the score on problematic video game behaviour was driven by inattention and role-playing video games and not hyperactivity,’ Mr Engelhardt told Reuters Health.","Children with autism and ADHD are at greater risk of gaming addictions .

"Ashley Bell was jailed for four years and nine months after being caught on CCTV raiding a couple's home . A burglar has been jailed after he was caught on a couple's CCTV camera creeping around their bedroom. Ashley Bell, 27, was unaware that he was being recorded as he raided the couple's property in Solihull, West Midlands, on June 26. Bell - wearing a grey hooded tracksuit and black gloves - can be seen carefully tip-toeing around the room before stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery. But officers were easily able to trace the burglar to his home in Coventry on the same day after the family passed on the hidden camera footage to police. Bell was sentenced to four years and nine months in jail on Friday after he pleaded guilty to burglary at Leamington Crown Court. The court heard Bell escaped with a luxury £5,000 Brietling watch and other jewellery from the home after breaking a window in the back patio door. Detective Constable Ian Atherley, from Solihull Police, said: 'Bell thought he was getting away with jewellery worth thousands of pounds but didn’t realise he was being recorded on a hidden camera inside the house. 'We identified him from the clear images really quickly and he was charged a little over 24 hours after the burglary happened. Bell did not know he was being filmed as he tip-toed around the bedroom and stealing thousands of pounds of jewellery . 'The sentence he’s been given sends out a clear message to anyone thinking about breaking into homes - we will catch you and you will end up behind bars. 'He will now be spending several years in prison and the communities of the West Midlands will be safer as a result.'","Ashley Bell, 27, was filmed as he stole thousands of pounds of jewellery .

"A mother is set to be reunited with her two sons after almost a year following a court victory yesterday against her ex-husband who had refused to return them from Russia. Rachael Neustadt - an American who lives . in London - says ex-husband Ilya Neustadt is keeping Daniel, seven, and . Jonathan, five, in Russia in breach of orders made by a judge in England . following a marriage break-up. She had asked Russian judges to intervene - using a piece of international law ratified by Russia just five months ago. Rachael Neustadt (left) has been 'enormously concerned' after her former husband went into hiding with her two sons, Daniel (centre), seven, and Jonathan (right), five. She also has a third son, Meir, who is still with her . And . her lawyers said the Moscow City Appeal Court had recognised High Court . orders made in England in a ruling delivered yesterday. Solicitor . Caroline Korah said she hoped that Ms Neustadt and the boys would soon . be reunited following the 'landmark' court ruling. Ms Neustadt, 36, said: 'I am so grateful to . the judges and the court for taking this decision. 'I can’t wait until . the boys and I are all back home in London - we all have a lot of hugs . to catch up on and I will not rest until they are in my arms.' She has a third son, one-year-old Meir, who she has kept with her. The former teacher from Houston, Texas, had asked Russian judges to order her ex-husband, Ilya Neustadt, to return Daniel and Jonathan to England. Mr . Neustadt, 37, a former London Metropolitan University lecturer, refused . to return the boys to their mother following a Christmas visit last . year. In November Ms Neustadt won a 'landmark' ruling in Russia, when the Moscow City Appeal Court recognised High Court orders made in England and said Daniel and Jonathan should be returned to their mother . She previously said she was 'deeply concerned' about her sons and feared their 'bond' would be damaged by the prolonged absence. She said: 'I love and miss them so much and I know they are missing me and their baby brother too.' London law firm . Dawson Cornwell, which represents Ms Neustadt, said an application had . been made following Russia’s ratification of an international convention . relating to cross-border disputes between parents in June. Ilya Neustadt, 37, has defied demands to return his two sons to England and is now in hiding in Russia, according to his former wife's lawyers . Ms . Neustadt began legal action and a judge sitting in the High Court in . London ordered Mr Neustadt to return the boys to England - but he had . not complied, solicitors said. Lawyers . said Russia ratified the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, . Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of . Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children 1996 . on June 1. England joined the convention in November 2012. They said the case was the first to make use of the 1996 Hague Convention for child abduction in England as well as in Russia. Dawson . Cornwell originally released details of the dispute in July after a . Deputy High Court judge - who had analysed the dispute at hearings in .

"In school we're taught that our tongues have specific areas that are susceptible to different tastes: salty, bitter, sour, sweet or savoury. But scientists say that is a myth, and they’ve found that each of the several thousand sensors on our tongue can recognise any of the tastes. And is it is down to cells in the brain, not in the tongue, to work out which taste is which. Scientists at Columbia University say neurons in the brain not cells in the tongue decide taste. They say our thousands of taste buds can all detect different flavours: bitter (top of diagram), sour (number two), salty (number three), sweet (bottom) and savoury . The research was carried out by scientists at Columbia University. They studied the 8,000 or so taste buds that are scattered over our tongues, reports the BBC. Each taste bud was found to be able to detect the five primary ‘flavours’. This counters the myth that, for example, only the tip of your tongue can taste sweet food. Researchers say they have unraveled the genetic code of the rapeseed plant, and say it could lead to better tasting vegetables. Genomics researchers of the University of Arizona's iPlant collaborative, housed in the BIO5 Institute, have helped unravel the genetic code of the rapeseed plant, most noted for a variety whose seeds are made into canola oil. The findings will help breeders select for desirable traits such as richer oil content and faster seed production. Other potential applications include modifying the quality of canola oil, making it more nutritious and adapting the plants to grow in more arid regions. Instead they found the brain has specialised neurons that would interpret a signal sent by each taste bud. Each taste bud had up to 100 receptors that were used to send signals to the brain. How exactly the brain processes this information is not clear, but the research shows that the decision on taste is made in the brain, not on the tongue. And it puts to bed the theory that there is a ‘tongue map’ of different tastes, as once taught in primary schools. The finding was made by feeding chemicals with specific tastes to mice. Scientists then watched how specific neurons lit up when the mice ate the particular chemicals. This made their ‘taste neurons’ fluoresce when activated. ‘The cells were beautifully tuned to discrete individual taste qualities, so you have a very nice match between the nature of the cells in your tongue and the quality they represent [in the brain],’ Professor Charles Zuker told the BBC. The researchers say one of the benefits of the the findings could be the ability to return taste functions to those that have lost it, such as the elderly. The findings put to bed the myth that our tongues have a taste map (stock image shown). ‘The cells were beautifully tuned to discrete individual taste qualities, so you have a very nice match between the nature of the cells in your tongue and the quality they represent [in the brain],’ Professor Charles Zuker told the BBC .","Scientists at Columbia University say brain not tongue decides taste .

"British soldiers and aid experts will set up a treatment centre for the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, the Government has announced. The 62-bed facility will be based near the capital Freetown. The UK's support follows a direct request from the World Health Organisation and the government of Sierra Leone for assistance in containing the outbreak. The initial phase of the treatment centre will be up and running within eight weeks, the Department for International Development (DfID) said. The tropical virus, transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has killed 2,100 people in four countries since the start of the year -- more than half of them in Liberia . The centre will comprise a 50-bed facility for treating victims of the disease, with a 12-bed unit to provide specialist care for local and international health workers. Military experts will begin to survey and assess the site later this week and the Government is working with Save the Children to design a long-term plan to manage and operate the facility after it has been fully set up. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain is at the forefront of the global effort to tackle this deadly outbreak, having already committed £25million of support, including frontline treatment and funding for medical research to develop a vaccine. International Development Secretary Justine Greening (left) said: 'Britain is at the forefront of the global effort to tackle this deadly outbreak'; while Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said establishing the centre would present the military with a 'unique set of challenges' 'The scale of the problem requires the entire international community to do more to assist the affected countries, which is why the UK is working with the government of Sierra Leone to build a new medical treatment facility near their capital Freetown. 'When it is up and running, it will enable the UK to provide medical care for local and international health workers, as well as treatment for the wider population.' Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'Ebola threatens thousands of people's lives across West Africa and could set back development many decades. 'The key to combating this epidemic is backing frontline health workers and underpinning a fractured health system in Sierra Leone - without urgent action to assist medics, many more children and their families will suffer and die from this most appalling and tragic disease. 'Save the Children is working alongside DfID and the Ministry of Defence on a feasibility study to cement plans to firstly help set up the centre and then take it over with international experts, as well as local staff, to provide the very best life-saving health service under the most challenging conditions.' Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said establishing the centre would present the military with a 'unique set of challenges'. British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus in Sierra Leone.The 29-year-old survived after being airlifted back to the UK for specialist treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in London . He said: 'The people of West Africa need our help and we will not stand idly by. The UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic and our military will continue the great work so far. 'This operation will involve a unique set of challenges but I believe that we have the ability to provide support to the World Health Organisation in helping to bring the outbreak under control.' DfID was unable to provide any figures for the cost of the centre until it is established, but it will be in addition to the £25 million of aid already committed to the Ebola crisis. The dangers faced by international humanitarian workers in countries affected by the Ebola outbreak were illustrated when British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus in Sierra Leone.

"Tragedy: Emma Bennett, 27, from Leeds, died after being attacked by two dogs, believed to be banned breeds . A 33-year-old man was today arrested on suspicion of owning two illegal American pitbulls that mauled to death a mother-of-four, who may have been pregnant. Emma Bennett, 27, died yesterday evening in hospital after suffering fatal bites to the neck and head at her home in Dawlish Avenue, Leeds, on Monday afternoon. This morning Lee Horner was arrested on suspicion of offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act. It also emerged today that Miss Bennett is believed to have been pregnant at the time of the horrific attack. Following her death her boyfriend posted on Facebook: 'R.I.P emma and our bump u was deeply loved by all and will sadly be  missed by me and all that knew u know ur with the angels love u u will always be in my heart and on my mind to the day we meet again xx'. Today her family also paid tribute to the 27-year-old, calling her a 'lively person with a great sense'. Detective Superintendent Simon Beldon, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Early indications are that the two dogs seized from the address are American  pit bull terriers although tests are still ongoing to establish their exact make up. Dogs of this type are subject to restrictions under the Dangerous Dogs Act and our enquiries are focused on this aspect. 'We are continuing to appeal for anyone with information about the incident or the dogs involved in it to contact the investigation team.' Miss Bennett is believed to have been epileptic and may . have been mauled during a fit. Neighbours heard screams from the terraced home and one dialled 999 after hearing shouts of 'no, no, no' coming from the home where Emma lived with her boyfriend. Miss Bennett, who suffered injuries to her neck and head, apparently tried to sell Dollar on Facebook for £100 because of its aggressive nature. Mauled: Neighbours heard Miss Bennett's screams as she was savaged by the dog, one of which is believed to be the pitbull pictured, right . Grief: Flowers and teddies were left on Miss Bennett's doorstep today as her community comes to terms with her death . Terrible: Neighbours says they heard screams and yells of 'no, no, no' from the property in Leeds . Home: The yard of Emma Bennett's terraced property, which lies empty today after her death . A . neighbour said that Miss Bennett had moved into the street around two years ago. The family of Emma Bennett have released a tribute. In a statement they said: 'We are all very deeply upset at Emma's death, not just because she has been taken from us so suddenly but because of the horrific circumstances and the fact she was on her own at the time she was injured. 'Emma was a mother of four and although she had had some issues in her life she loved her children. She was a lively person who had a great sense of fun but she was also strong-headed and had her own opinions. 'She was the eldest of four children and had two brothers and a sister. They were at her bedside in hospital along with her mother and grandparents when she passed away. 'We are all devastated at Emma's death but the whole family has pulled together and are really supporting each other. We are grateful to everyone who has sent messages of sympathy and support. 'We hope that by making this statement and releasing a photo of Emma that the media will respect our privacy at this difficult time.' 'I got a call when I was shopping that they had cordoned the whole street off,' she said. 'I . heard rumours there was a vicious dog attack after someone had broken . into a home but it turned out it was Emma who got attacked by her own . dog. 'We'd heard that a . few weeks back the pitbull started getting really nasty with her because . she is epileptic. 'If she had a seizure and she was on her own he didn't . like it. 'I think she . has had a fit and the pitbull's got hold of her - that's the only thing I . can think of. 'Apparently it wanted to go for her whenever she was . having a fit.' A . West Yorkshire Police spokesman said last night: 'Two dogs were seized . following the incident and police inquiries remain ongoing this evening. 'Officers would like to speak to anybody who has information about the incident and the dogs involved in it.' Armed police said they were called to . 'a woman in distress with serious dog bite injuries'. It is believed . the victim was home alone when she was mauled. One of her dogs fled the . property when police arrived but was contained by officers in an . adjacent street, while another dog was safely removed from the property. Both animals are still alive and being cared for by police. Ms Bennett was taken to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment but police confirmed she died last night. Dog attack: Officers outside the home where Emma Bennett was attacked by at least one of her own pets. Police confirmed she died from her injuries on Tuesday evening . Investigation: A West Yorkshire Police officer guards Emma's home following the attack on Monday . The force added: 'One dog which got loose from the property was contained by officers in Back Dawlish Road and recovered. 'Another was safely removed from the address a short time later.' Neighbours said that the terraced street was sealed off while officers contained one of the dogs. One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They were definitely dangerous dogs. 'There must have been about 15 police officers and it was just crazy. 'The dog seemed to be loose for ages and there were two cars that blocked the street off. 'I was just shocked and saw her in the back of the ambulance and paramedics were pounding on her heart. She was just floppy. It's just madness.'

"These are the roads that offer a 'doorway' into Britain's past. From Roman streets to bustling 20th century markets, these 50 have been named the most historically important in the country. House historian Melanie Backe-Hansen compiled the list from thousands of candidates across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Picturesque: The Street in Castle Combe in Wiltshire has been named in a list of the most important historic roads in Britain and is the favourite of historian Melanie Backe-Hansen . Preserved: The history of Eastgate Street in Chester dates back to Roman times when it was first planned . Opulent: Belgrave Square is one of the grandest of 19th-century London. It was laid out by property contractor Thomas Cubitt for the 2nd Earl Grosvenor in the 1820s and most of the houses were occupied by 1840 . She says she wanted to delve beneath the surface of roads that people walk past every day without knowing their historical importance. The 50 streets that made the list in her book Historic Streets and Squares span hundreds of years. The oldest are Steep Hill in Lincoln and Eastgate Street in Chester, which were originally planned by the Romans. The 50 also includes an array of medieval lanes, Georgian crescents and Victorian squares. Historic: Richmond Green in Richmond has been surrounded by houses for over 400 years . Retained: Merrion Square in Dublin was laid out in 1762 and was largely completed by the beginning of the 19th century and is considered one of the city's finest surviving squares . Important: Kensington Square in Kensington was founded in 1685 and is thus the oldest in London . Ms Backe-Hansen said she wanted to show . how the streets, squares, crescents, avenues and lanes of our cities . reveal much about our past. She told Mail Online: 'I was essentially highlighting the history behind the streets. Many people walk along these roads and not blink an eyelid. 'I wanted to look behind what we are used to. 'It was not just looking at architectural styles but why they were built and the type of people who lived there and look beneath the surface. Famous faces: Great Pulteney Street in Bath was home to William Wilberforce and the mistress to the King . Stately: St Ann's Square in Manchester was built after a 1708 Act of Parliament granted the erection of a church and also stipulated that a space 30 yards wide should be reserved for the fair . Upmarket: Park Circus in Glasgow, filled with large townhouses, is considered one of the most prestigious addresses in the city . 'I lot of these roads are among the . most well known in the country, like Portobello Road, but people won't . know how it got like that.' The book also reveals some of the stories behind the residents of these famous streets. Great Pulteney Street in Bath boasts a notable string of past residents including anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, and the mistresses of George IV and Admiral Nelson. College Street in Winchester was the home of Jane Austen. But Ms Backe-Hansen said her favourite is The Street, in Castle Combe, Wiltshire, the former home of Sir John Falstaff. Architecturally important: Sussex Square in Brighton is filled with classic Regency houses . Internationally famous: Charlotte Square in Edinburgh is part of the New Town, which is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was named after King George III's Queen and first daughter and the first phase of the build was completed in 1820 . She said: 'It is beautiful. It has been retained in its historic form and is pretty special.' The historian hopes many of the unprotected but historically valuable streets and squares in the country can be protected. She said: 'I am a traditionalist so I would like to see them preserved but I realise that is not always possible. 'There are still streets all over the country that have special historical elements but may not be protected. 'I would prefer to see them as they are now.' The historic road of King's Parade in Cambridge features on the list of 50 . Southern England . Richmond Green, Richmond . Sussex Square, Brighton . College Street, Winchester . Gold Hill, Shaftesbury . Wales and Ireland . Belle Vue Terrace, Aberaeron . Merrion Square, Dublin . London . Bedford Square, Bloomsbury . Belgrave Square, Belgravia . Berkeley Square, Mayfair .

"A suspected cannibal accused of tearing out a 90-year-old man's tongue and heart to eat was found with cooked meat remains on a plate with beans. The homeless 26-year-old broke into the elderly man's home in Nouilhan, southern France, and beat him over the head with an iron rod before trying to extract his organs. The suspect, who is a former soldier with the French army, claims to hear voices. The former soldier is accused of ripping out the elderly man's tongue and heart to cook and eat. A plate of meat and beans was found in the victim's home in a chilling echo of the character Hannibal Lecter . The suspect is accused of eating parts of the victim's body before setting fire to his house. It is not clear whether the remains found on the plate are of human origin, French media have reported. The flames alerted the victim's son, who lives nearby, who discovered his father’s body, investigators said. The case has shocked the tiny hamlet in southern France, which is home to just 200 people. It bears chilling similarities to the character of Hannibal Lecter from the film Silence Of The Lambs, who ate human organs with 'fava beans and Chianti'. The former soldier is accused of attacking another villager in France by hitting him against a tractor. The suspect previously served in Afghanistan and only left the army two weeks ago, according to The Local. The suspect is from the village of Tarbes in the picturesque Haute-Pyrenees . A source at the Marine Infantry Tank Regiment said he had rejected an offer to renew his contract and had 'posed no problems during his stint.' The man, from the nearby village of Tarbes in the Haute-Pyrenees, was arrested on November 13 three hours later. Police had been called by the victim's son, who lived nearby, and had been alerted by the flames. The suspect appeared in court in Pau three days later where he was remanded in custody. He has told detectives he heard 'voices and messages' telling him to kill the elderly man.","Homeless 26-year-old accused of murdering elderly man in southern France .

Frost was famous for his charged and revealing interviews with President Nixon (pictured) Agents noted comments that were deemed anti-American or were critical of the Government or the FBI. The secret dossier, which emerged through a Freedom of Information request by the New York Post, also included comments on actress Susan 'Viva' Hoffman and Andy Warhol. Sir David died in August of a heart attack while travelling on the Queen Elizabeth luxury liner. An agent also watched a show live and sat in the audience during the taping of an interview with Ramsey Clark, Attorney General under Lyndon B. Johnson. He was speaking about the Mafia and Sir David ended the show by asking Hoover to appear on the programme.

'Regularly monitoring of this program has proved to be entirely . unproductive... daily monitoring should be discontinued.' Frost does not appear to have been personally put under surveillance by the FBI. The broadcaster fronted a number of shows in the U.S., including The David Frost Show, Frost On America, and a short-lived stint as the anchor on Inside Edition. His famous interviews with Nixon were turned into a play and film starring Frank Langella and Michael Sheen.

"Liverpool expect to take a significant step forward on Monday in their pursuit of Alberto Moreno after agreeing a fee with Sevilla for £16.2million, which will rise on performances. The left back is due to fly to England on Monday and travel to Merseyside with his father and his agent Javier Moya. Moreno was at the wedding of Liverpool’s Luis Alberto on Saturday, according to Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo, where he heard good reports about the Anfield dressing room. International: Liverpool target Alberto Moreno (right) played for Spain in last month's friendly against Bolivia . Luis Alberto, meanwhile, who moved from Sevilla to Liverpool last summer for £7m, has been discussing a loan to Malaga. Liverpool midfielder Suso, who was initially proposed as part of the deal for Moreno, may now move to Portuguese side Porto, who have expressed an interest. The 20-year-old has one year left on contract and Porto are keen to secure a quick deal. Liverpool also plan talks with Iago Aspas, whose agent has stated he wants to stay but they will sell if he is unhappy at being a back-up striker. Wanted: Suso may move to Porto with the Portuguese club expressing an interest in the midfielder . Hughes asks Barca about Traore (after signing Sidwell on a free) Stoke are exploring the possibility of signing Barcelona starlet Adama Traore. Manager Mark Hughes has completed a free transfer deal for experienced midfielder Steve Sidwell, 31, but is also looking to add more flair to his Stoke squad. Impressed by the success of Gerard Deulofeu's loan spell at Everton, Hughes has gone to his former club Barcelona to ask about 18-year-old Traore, who was one of the young stars to shine at the NextGen Series and last year's UEFA Youth League. Rising star: Stoke are exploring the possibility of signing Barcelona's Adama Traore (centre) Traore made his La Liga debut in November at the age of only 17, replacing Neymar in the 4–0 home win over Granada. Three days later he made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League, coming on for Cesc Fabregas in the 82nd minute of the 2-1 defeat loss to Ajax. Born just a few miles away from the Nou Camp to a housemaid mother and a father who works in a shop changing wheel rims, Adama played for Spain’s youth teams up to U19 level but is changing international allegiance to Mali.

QPR move for Rio may stall . Any proposed move for Rio Ferdinand at QPR may stall as the club assesses the profile of player they are chasing. Some within the club would prefer players who are not at the end of their career. While many would recognise Ferdinand's experience and ability will help settle those around him, others believe there is already enough experience in the squad and they should recruit more youthful targets. QPR have offered 34-year-old goalkeeper Rob Green a new three year contract and have offered deals to Clint Hill, 35, and Alejandro Faurlin, 27, while goalkeeper Julio Cesar will return from his loan at Toronto but is expected to move back to Brazil.

"Jailed: David Simmonds, the son of a company director, admitted battering graduate Jia Ashton to death . The son of a company director yesterday admitted battering a young wife to death moments after she left work on a woodland path known as the ‘Yellow Brick Road’. David Simmonds, the father of a two-year-old boy, pounced on Jia Ashton . as she walked her regular 20-minute route home from the headquarters of . chocolate-maker Thorntons. At 19 stone and 6ft 2in, tattooed Simmonds weighed more than three times as much as his six stone, 4ft 11in victim. Officers believe that after beating and attempting to strangle the . 25-year-old graduate trainee, Simmonds either stamped or jumped on his . victim, fatally rupturing her heart. No weapon was used in the attack, which police originally suspected had been committed by Mrs Ashton’s husband, Matthew. Yesterday Simmonds, 21, whose father runs his own machinery and packaging firm, changed his plea ahead of trial to admit murdering the Warwick University economics graduate. Mr Ashton stared intently at the killer throughout the five-minute session at Nottingham Crown Court. The case was adjourned  for sentence. Simmonds has refused to offer any explanation for the March attack, although police say there may have been a ‘sexual element’. While Mrs Ashton had not been sexually assaulted, her clothing had been pulled up, exposing her abdomen, where ‘contact’ DNA was recovered. Matthew and Jia Ashton on their wedding day in China: He called her his 'Pocket Princess' Her purse was also empty, suggesting robbery as a possible motive for the attack, which became known as the Yellow Brick Road murder after the local name for a path which cut through Sleetmoor Woods in Somercotes, Derbyshire, yards from where the victim’s body was found. Following Simmonds’s guilty plea, it can be revealed that he had temporary jobs at Thorntons over the last two Christmas periods, though police do not believe he met Mrs Ashton or her husband. Simmonds enjoyed a middle-class upbringing with his parents Michael and Lesley, both 48, and younger brother Paul, 19, in an executive home a short stroll from the woods. But while Simmonds’s younger brother would go on to win a place at university, his own life was heading in a different direction. After dropping out of technology college at 17, he proved unable to hold down any job of substance. In the run-up to the murder in March, his relationship with his parents had become fraught as they tired of his failure to settle down into a career to help support his young son. Relief: Widower Matthew is accompanied by his mother Sue Ashton and Detective Superintendent Terry Branson outside court after Simmonds pleaded guilty to murder . Simmonds separated from the child’s 21-year-old mother, Laura Leonardi, . around a year before the killing. By early 2011, he had left the family . home and registered himself homeless to obtain temporary accommodation – . a move that would prove to be his undoing. Internet postings revealed that he was in turmoil over his looks and size, which he said were his ‘biggest fall down’ (sic). He was nicknamed ‘Smithy’, after his resemblance to the tubby  character . played by James Corden in the BBC comedy series Gavin and Stacey, and . once wrote on Facebook: ‘Better to be a somebody today than a no one for . the rest of your life.’ Mr Ashton, 27, a music teacher, was initially the prime suspect. He stayed in a Travelodge on the night of the killing after he and his Chinese-born wife rowed over when to start a family. He was arrested on suspicion of murder when the body of his wife, whom he affectionately called his ‘Pocket Princess’, was discovered   hidden under logs and branches three days after she vanished. But footage of him checking into the motel seven minutes after his wife was seen on CCTV leaving work helped eliminate him. Within 48 hours, a dog walker came forward to report seeing an unkempt man ‘darting’ around the woods less than an hour after Mrs Ashton left work.

When police searched the area they discovered more of the victim’s belongings including her mobile phone, snapped into pieces, and her glasses. Both bore unidentified fingerprints. The breakthrough came almost eight weeks later when officers  sifting homeless records turned up Simmonds. He willingly gave fingerprint and DNA samples when officers called at the family home. Realising the net was closing, he fled to an Indian restaurant in Heanor, Derbyshire, where he was a part-time delivery driver. He was arrested loitering upstairs the next day, after the fingerprint matches were confirmed. Officers found a letter to his son, begging the boy not to hate him. After the case, Mr Ashton said there ‘cannot be a sentence severe enough’ for killing his ‘irreplaceable’ wife. Mr Ashton’s father, John, 61, is married to Jia’s mother, Penny, after they met at their children’s 2006 wedding. Mr Ashton (right) pictured after Simmonds admitted to murdering his wife.

A detective who led the inquiry into . the murder of Jia Ashton has described her killer as 'a habitual liar' who tried his best to cover up the brutal killing. Detective Superintendent Terry Branson, of Derbyshire Police, said: 'Without . a doubt Mr Simmonds went to great lengths to hide the body to make sure . that we never found Jia. He made every attempt to frustrate the . subsequent police inquiry.' Simmonds received a number of . injuries to his hands during the attack, Mr Branson said, and explained . those away to friends by telling them he had been chased through woods . by a group of people. But he went on to give numerous varied accounts of how he obtained those injuries. 'What he said then to what he said in . interview and what he's subsequently then said in his defence statement . it becomes clear that David Simmonds is a habitual liar,' Mr Branson . said. It is not known if the injuries on Simmonds' hands happened as a result of Mrs Ashton trying to fight him off. Mr Branson added: 'The only person . who knows what happened in that wood at the moment is David Simmonds and . to what extent Jia fought back, it's only him that knows.' Simmonds left school at 17 and never really had a proper job, Mr Branson said. In the Christmas period of 2009 and . 2010 he was employed as a casual worker at Thorntons, at the same time . as Mrs Ashton worked there, but there was no evidence to suggest they . ever met or that she became a target of his during that time. Simmonds had a good upbringing in . Swanwick, Derbyshire. His parents were a professional couple and his . brother was at university. It was only following the break-up of . his relationship with a local girl, with whom he had a young son, that . his family relations became strained because of concerns over childcare . and he found himself homeless. He registered himself as homeless and . it was this that led detectives to him when they searched the register . after receiving a description of a man in the woods around the time of . the murder who looked dishevelled and unkempt. Almost immediately after Mrs Ashton's . murder, Simmonds got a job as a waiter at the Spice Inn Indian . restaurant in Heanor, Derbyshire, and was able to stay in the flat above . the premises. It was there that he was arrested for Mrs Ashton's murder and subsequently charged.","6ft 2in David Simmons subjected Jia Ashton, who was 4ft 11in and weighed just six-and-a-half stone, to sustained and brutal attack .

"Former White House press secretary Jay Carney has joined CNN as a political commentator, the network said Wednesday. He will start as part of the coverage of his former boss's prime-time speech Wednesday night, shortly after President Barack Obama makes a case for his long-awaited military strategy to combat the Islamic state of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Carney resigned in May after spending three and a half years as Obama's primary spokesman. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House press secretary Jay Carney was a fixture in the briefing room for three and a half years before quitting in May . He was communications director for Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011 and worked at Time magazine for two decades before that. Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief, told the Associated Press that Carney's experience in the administration and as a former journalist makes him invaluable for covering the last two years of Obama's presidency and upcoming campaigns. Carney quickly earned a reputation as a tough but opaque flack for America's chief executive, peppering press briefings with evasive turns of phrase that left some journalists scratching their heads. Under his leadership, the White House press office earned a reputation in Washington as the least transparent in recent memory. Politico surveyed 61 members of the White House press corps shortly before Carney's departure and asked them if the Obama administration gave them better access to information than they had during the George W. Bush presidency. Only 5 per cent said the Obama White House was more transparent. Then-New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson said this year that the Obama White House is the 'most secretive' she had ever seen. More than 2 in 5 White House correspondents agreed.","Former White House press secretary will provide analysis of political news .
