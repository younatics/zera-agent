California's current drought is being billed as the driest period in the state's recorded rainfall history. A pair of satellite images released by NASA reveal the shocking impact of California's drought, which is now entering its third year. The NOAA images show how the state's landscape is parched with minimal snow cover and the land dried out compared to the same time last year. Scroll down for video... Record drought: These satellite images show the parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year . NASA posted the images just days after California governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to low rainfall. Brown . urged Californians to conserve water, warning that the state faces . potential water shortages, crop losses, and an increase in wildfires if . significant precipitation doesn't come soon. The . images, captured on NASA’s Terra satellite, show a steep decline in . snow cover across the Sierra Nevada, Coast Range, and Cascade Mountains. Both the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys appeared parched, with a noticeable drop in greenness. Dry year: Governor Jerry Brown holds a chart showing statewide average precipitation as he speaks during a news conference today in San Francisco after declaring a drought state of emergency for  California .

The . most striking difference between the two years is the amount of snow . cover on mountains. The Sierra Nevada range has very little snow, and . Coast Range and Cascade Mountains are almost completely snow free,' said . NASA in a post on the Image of the Day section of its Earth Observatory . web site. 'California gets a third of its water supply from mountain snow, but with warm, dry weather, little snow has accumulated.' 'Less . striking at first glance, but just as telling is the condition of the . vegetation west of the Sierra Nevada. In 2013—a year into the . drought—the central valley was green with growing crops. The coastal . hills were also green from winter rain. In 2014, everything west of the . forested mountains is brown. Even irrigated agriculture in the center of the state appears to be limited compared to 2013.' A sign outside a market in Willits, Calif.ornia, reminds passerby's about about the short water supply facing area residents. In the midst of a historic drought and area reservoirs holding less than a 100-day supply of water, Willits city leaders have banned lawn watering, car washing and mandated all residents to cut water use . Land is exposed by the extremely low water level of Lake Kaweah on February 5, 2014 near Visalia, California. Now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years. Docks float on extremely low-level water in Lake Kaweah on February 5, 2014 near Visalia, California. About 17 rural communities could run out of drinking water within several weeks and politicians are are pushing to undo laws that protect several endangered species . California . in 2013 received less rain than in any year since it became a state in . 1850. And at least one Bay Area scientist says that based on tree ring . data, the current rainfall season is on pace to be the driest since 1580 . — more than 150 years before George Washington was born. A megadrought today would have catastrophic effects. California, . the nation's most populous state with 38 million residents, has built a . massive economy, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and millions of acres of . farmland, all in a semiarid area. The state's dams, canals and . reservoirs have never been tested by the kind of prolonged drought that . experts say will almost certainly occur again. The . dry year California experienced in 2013 has left fresh water reservoirs . with a fraction of their normal reserves and slowed the normally full . American River so dramatically that brush and dry riverbed are showing . through in areas normally teeming with fish. 'We . can't make it rain, but we can be much better prepared for the terrible . consequences that California's drought now threatens, including . dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased . fires in both urban and rural areas,' Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, . said in a statement. 'I've declared this emergency and I'm calling all Californians to conserve water in every way possible,' he said, in a move that will allow him to call for conservation measures and provide flexibility in deciding state water priorities. In a sign of the severity of the drought, some of the state's reservoirs are at their lowest levels in years. The Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento is so low that the remains of a Gold Rush-era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years. The state's mountain ranges, where runoff from melting snow provides much of the water for California's thirsty cities and farms, have just 20 per cent of the snow they normally have at this time of year, officials noted. Lake Kaweah: Grasslands that support cattle have dried up, forcing ranchers to feed them expensive supplemental hay to keep them from starving or to sell at least some of their herds, and farmers are struggling with diminishing crop water and what to plant or whether to tear out permanent crops which use water year-round such, as almond trees . California, the nation's most populous state with 38 million residents, has built a massive economy, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and millions of acres of farmland, all in a semiarid area. The state's dams, canals and reservoirs have never been tested by the kind of prolonged drought that experts say will almost certainly occur again . Parched: Water levels for many of California's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977 . Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir in California, is down from its historical average by nearly half. Other sources of water, including the massive Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are also affected, prompting cities to dip into reserves and forcing farmers to scramble. Some public agencies may be able to purchase just five per cent of the water that they contracted to buy from the state. Adding to concerns, January and February are usually the wettest months in much of the state, but 2014 has so far been mostly dry, with little precipitation expected, according to the National Weather Service. In declaring a drought emergency, Brown said he did not know if he would be successful in persuading the federal government to free up funds for drought relief but he would try his best. 'It's important, first of all, to awaken all Californians to the serious matter of drought,' he said, also warning of upcoming 'conflicts and different perceptions on how water is to be allocated.' Water has long been a contentious issue in California, where it has been diverted from mountain lakes and streams to irrigate farms and slake the thirst of metropolitan areas. Many of the state's efforts to deal with the problem are controversial, including a $25 billion plan to divert water from above the delta by sending it through a pair of huge tunnels. For many in the state's $44.7 billion agriculture business, water scarcity is a problem made worse by a recent switch to orchard-style crops such as almonds and olives. Unlike vegetables or cotton, which grow in fields that can be left fallow in dry years, the trees need water every year. Already, there were signs of competing priorities among groups that contend for water and will be closely watching how state officials use their new flexibility in allocating it. Assemblywoman Connie Conway, the leader of the Republican minority in the state Assembly who represents a heavily agricultural area in central California, expressed hope that with the declaration more water could go toward 'Valley farmers and workers who depend on water to feed the world.' Low and dropping: Governor Jerry Brown points to images showing the snow depth in the Sierra mountains on January 13, 2013 (left) and January 13, 2014 (center) while declaring a drought state of emergency in San Francisco . John McManus, executive director of the Golden Gate Salmon Association, said his group's concern was for the health of salmon and a fishing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in California and Oregon. 'If the drought declaration results in more attention to saving the salmon that are in the Sacramento Valley rivers, and which are in dire need of attention, then that is good thing,' he said. Doug Obegi, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said California has a complex system that allocates water to areas that laid claim to it first - often over 100 years ago - and which many view the system as unfair. 'Because it's so contentious, there are times when it's hard to make progress,' Obegi said. But in some ways the state has done well. Over the last 40 years, the state's agriculture industry has doubled the revenue per drop of water used, largely from improved efficiency and changes in the plants grown, Obegi said.","Governor Jerry Brown has declared a drought emergency .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:29 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:29 EST, 6 February 2014 . Optimism about the Brititsh economy is now at its highest level since 1997, a new poll shows today. As the recovery gains momentum and growth powers ahead the rest of Europe, half of Brits expected things to improve this year while fewer than one in four expect it to get worse. In a major boost for the Tories, the improvement in the economy has fed through to better poll ratings for David Cameron. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured visiting St Bridgeds Catholic primary school in Birmingham, has seen his poll ratings rise as the economy grows . Asked by IpsosMORI if what will happen to the ‘general economic condition of the country’ over the next 12 months, 50 per cent said improve and 24 per cent said it would get worse, a net result of +26 per cent. The last time the economic optimism rating was so high was in May 1997, when Tony Blair’s New Labour swept to power in a landslide general victory, when it stood at +28. The current rating is higher than anything seen during the Thatcher and Major governments. Overall Labour still has an overall lead . in the poll on 38 per cent, down one point, with the Tories on 31 per . cent, up one, and Lib Dems on 12 and Ukip 10. Do you think the economy will improve, get worse or stay the same? Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI said:  ‘Yet another surge in economic optimism to near-record levels has given David Cameron a personal boost for his stewardship of the economy, while after a difficult month for Nick Clegg his personal ratings have fallen - as have Nigel Farage’s. ‘And yet despite that the party shares – and Labour’s lead – have remained steady. ‘How these different trends play out together - especially as other issues come to the fore - is going to be key as we get closer to an election.’ Some 42 per cent of people now trust Mr Cameron more than the other party leaders to deal with managing the economy. By comparison just 20 per cent trust Labour leader Ed Miliband, 5 per cent Lib Dem Nick Clegg and 3 per cent Nigel Farage. It means Mr Cameron’s lead over Mr Miliband has lengthened to 22 points from 14 points in May last year. Mr Cameron now also has a 5 point lead over Mr Miliband on being trusted to deal with unemployment. New figures show the economy gre by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row . During 35 years of polling by IpsosMori, economic optim9sm has only been higher when Tony Blair won a landslide for Labour in 1997 . The poll boost comes after a raft of positive economic news for the government. Britain's economy grew by 1.9 per cent in 2013, the fastest rate since the economic crash, according to the Offical for Natrional Statistics. The IMF last month revealed it now expects growth of in Britain 2.4 per cent in 2014, just a year after it warned Mr Osborne he was 'playing with fire' by refusing to abandon his austerity programme. The dramatic upgrade from a previous figure of 1.9 per cent puts Britain among the fastest-growing of the world's advanced economies. Latest employment figures also show that an extra 280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s.","50% now expect economy to improve this year, 24% say it will get worse .

For nearly two decades, Richard and Cathy Brown played the same lottery numbers every week – without any luck. But when they set off on a ten-week sailing trip around Britain, they had no idea the tide was about to turn on their fortunes. The retired couple had reached Newcastle – just 250 miles into their 2,500 mile journey – when Mr Brown, 66, checked the results on his phone and found they had won £6million. Scroll down for video . Lucky draw:  Cathy and Richard Brown, from Ipswich, Suffolk, have cut short a 10-week sailing trip around Britain after finding out they've won £6million on the lottery . Cheers! Cathy and Richard Brown, who have been together for 39 years, have been playing the same lottery numbers since 1994 . So the pair did what anyone would do . under the circumstances – hid the ticket under the boat’s chart table . before using their bus passes to go into the city centre and celebrate . with a gin and tonic. An 84-year-old woman became the largest individual lottery winner in American history last night. Gloria Mackenzie claimed a lump sum Powerball jackpot of £241million – spurning the option of 30 annual instalments. She revealed she only bought the £1 ticket because another shopper allowed her to go in front of them in the queue at the store in Zephyrhills, near Tampa, Florida. Mrs Mackenzie overcame odds of 175.2million to 1 to win the prize, drawn two weeks ago. She had been shopping at a grocery store when she bought the ticket with the numbers 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, and a Powerball of 11. The grandmother told lottery officials: ‘I am grateful for this blessing of winning.’ Mrs MacKenzie said she and her son Scott had an agreement to split any winnings. If she had accepted the instalment method, her winnings would have totalled £383million. Although her name was disclosed by Florida law, she did not attend a press conference announcing her win. The next day, they turned around their 40ft yacht, named Brave, and sailed home to Ipswich to claim their prize. As the couple, who have been together . for 39 years, celebrated the win on their yacht at the town’s marina . yesterday, Mrs Brown, 64, said: ‘This is more money than we could spend . in a lifetime.’ Top of the shopping list to get them . started, though, is a £350,000 replacement for their 11-year-old Grand . Soleil yacht and they are considering a top-of-the-range German Dehler. Mr Brown said they had ruled out . buying a much larger yacht with their winnings as they wanted to . continue sailing by themselves and would need a crew if they had . anything bigger. Mr Brown also has his eye on a new . Porsche 911 – but Mrs Brown is content to carry on driving their . three-year-old VW Passat estate. The former journalists, who have been . sailing for 30 years, had swapped their four bedroom country house in . Suffolk for a cheaper home of the same size in Ipswich in 2005 so that . they could afford to buy their £100,000 yacht. They set off from Ipswich on Mr Brown’s birthday on May 25 to sail around Britain for a second time. Before they left, Mr Brown had bought a . month’s worth of lottery tickets from their local Sainsbury’s store. The couple have been playing the same numbers – 3, 5, 25, 33, 34 and 35 – . since 1994 and play twice a week. Winners: Cathy and Richard Brown, from Ipswich, celebrate winning  £6,123,395 lotto jackpot aboard their boat BRAVE moored in Ipswich Marina, in Suffolk, today . Diving in: Former journalists Cathy and Richard Brown may also buy a new house with their winnings . Bottoms up! Cathy and Richard Brown, from Ipswich, now hope to upgrade their current yacht Brave . Life changing: Cathy and Richard Brown abandoned their round-Britain sailing trip after they found out they'd won the lottery 250 miles in to their 2,500-mile journey . They discovered they had won in last . Wednesday’s draw when Mr Brown used the National Lottery app on his . mobile phone to check their numbers the next evening. He said: ‘Cathy . was looking over my shoulder and we both realised we had four, then five . and then six of the numbers. ‘I turned to my wife and said “You’re a . millionaire”. We stashed the ticket in the locker under the chart table . on board and figured it would be safe there for the journey back – . there aren’t many pirates in the North Sea.’ New life: The retired couple, who were taking a dream trip around the coast of Britain, can now afford to buy a larger yacht such as this 98ft Princess Motor Yacht, should they wish to continue the rest of their journey in style . Expensive: But while the couple could afford to buy the £6m 98ft Princess yacht, which can accommodate 10 guests and has a large saloon, pictured, they could probably only keep it running for six months with their winnings . They will now abandon their planned . ten-week voyage, but may sail to France instead. ‘I’m not a big fan of . long-distance sailing so we won’t do an around-the-world trip,’ Mr Brown . said. ‘But we may sail to Brittany for a bit . of sun.’ The couple, who do not have children, worked at the East . Anglian Daily Times – where Mr Brown was deputy editor and Mrs Brown a . features writer – until they were made redundant. Mrs Brown said she had . not decided whether to continue her part time job on sailing magazine . Cruising. She said: ‘We have great friends and . already had a great life before the win.

Taylor Townsend, the 16-year-old number one junior tennis player in the world, has been told to lose weight by the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA). The Chicago native is the reigning junior Australian Open singles champion, the junior Wimbledon doubles champion, and today she won two matches at the U.S. Open's junior tournament. However, despite the fact she is part of the USTA player development program, they refused to fund Taylor's flight to to New York to compete in the U.S. Open, and said they wouldn't finance any other tournament appearances until she lost weight and got into better shape. Slim down: Taylor Townsend, the 16-year-old number one junior tennis player in the world, pictured today the U.S. Open, has been told to loose weight by the U.S. Tennis Association . Patrick McEnroe, the general manager of the USTA's player development program told the Wall Street Journal: 'Our concern is her long-term health, number one, and her long-term development as a player. 'We have one goal in mind: For her to be playing in [Arthur Ashe Stadium] in the main draw and competing for major titles when it's time. That's how we make every decision, based on that.' Her mother, Shelia, who paid her daughter's travel expenses to the U.S. Open herself, said she was confused by the USTA's decision, because after all, her daughter 'is No. 1, not just in the United States, but in the world.' 'It all kind of came as a shock to us because Taylor has consistently done quite well,' she said. However the USTA's decision seems to illustrate that its priorities lie in the importance of developing long-term fitness, successful results and longevity, rather than purely competitive results, in the hope of boosting the current decline of American tennis. 'You have to be fit, but you don't have to look ripped' Earlier this summer, Miss Townsend lost in the first round of qualifying for a professional event in Vancouver, and her coaches asked her to withdraw from the USTA Girls' National Championships in San Diego, return to the Florida-based academy and embark on a more strenuous fitness program. However, winning competitive tennis matches does not necessarily directly correlate to having a svelte figure. In 2007, Serena Williams won the . Australian Open singles title despite being in what has been described as 'the worst shape of her career'. Also, . standing at 6-foot-2 and weighing 175lbs, former U.S. tennis star . Lindsay Davenport ranked among the largest players on the women's tour, . and still became number one. Too heavy? Despite the fact Miss Townsend is part of the USTA player development program said they wouldn't finance any other tournament appearances until she lost weight and got into better shape . Former number one on the men's side, Mats Wilander said: 'You have to be fit underneath, I don't think you necessarily have to look ripped.' While Miss Townsend, a polite and professional teenager who said she is dutifully doing 'everything they ask' her to do, was asked to represent the U.S. in a junior Federation Cup event in Spain later this month, her future schedule will remain up to the USTA. Mr McEnroe said: 'We'll assess when this tournament is over.' 'I've gotten a lot of great opportunities, great fitness, great coaching,' MIss Townsend said of the USTA.

A wealthy slave merchant's 270-year-old notebook and business log has revealed a chilling insight into the slave trade and attitudes to human trafficking. Cranfield Becher's written instructions order the captain of the Jason Gally to swap brandy and guns for ‘as many Negros as our ship can carry’. He specifies that the slaves are ‘not too old or decrepit’ and his entries make it clear that he views the unfortunate people as simple commodities to be bought and sold. A wealthy slave merchant's 270-year-old notebook and business log (pictured) has revealed a chilling insight into the slave trade and attitudes to human trafficking . The financial log details the commissioning of the Jason Gally to sail from Bristol to Africa to buy slaves between 1743 and 1746. Disturbing handwritten instructions demand that the ship's commander should exchange the cargo on board, which was worth £2,742, for slaves in Angola. The enslaved people were then taken to Carolina where they were sold for just £18 each for rice and sugar, which was brought back to Bristol. The calfskin-bound book was bought at auction last year for £7,000 by the Bristol Record Office and has gone on display this week in the city. Extracts from the fragile tome reveal that Mr Becher considered the slaves he bought to be mere 'commodities'. Cranfield Becher's written instructions order the captain of the Jason Gally to swap brandy and guns for 'as many Negros as our ship can carry'. A lithograph of a slave ship evoking the terrible conditions suffered is pictured by artist Bernarda Bryson Shahn . One early entry says: ‘We have put a cargo of goods on board ... amounting to the sum of two thousand seven hundred forty two pounds one shilling and sixpence, which you are to dispose of for as many likely Negros as our ship can conveniently carry, taking care not to purchase any that are old or decrepit nor young children and from the largeness of our cargo, we hope that you will be able to bring off a good quantity of elephants teeth besides.’ Bristol became a wealthy port during the slave trade, with more than 2,000 ships leaving the city to make a trip to Africa and then across the Atlantic with around 500,000 slaves. The details in the notebook include the exact costs of kitting out the ship, the value of the cotton goods, brandy and guns put on board in Bristol and the profits brought back on the return leg. The notebook reveals that slaves were ‘immediately marked on their coming on board’ and contains instructions to sell them for ‘no less price than eighteen pounds sterling money per head round’. Disturbing handwritten instructions demand that the ship's commander should exchange the cargo on board, which was worth £2,742, for slaves in Angola. A plan of a slave ship's hold is pictured . Mr Becher ordered crew members to look after the slaves, but always keep guard to prevent mutiny. He wrote: ‘On board ... taking especial care that your Negroes be duly fed, attended and not abused by your sailors, likewise that such a strict guard be continually kept over them that you may not be surprised by their mutiny, which you are sensible often happens (though so easily prevented) and have been of the most fatal consequences.’ Warning against disease-ridden visitors on board, he added: ‘Epidemics & distempers have been convey'd to the destruction of many voyages, besides the great loss in the lives of many white men.’ Dr Madge Dresser, associate history professor at the University of the West of England, Bristol said the account book offered a ‘rare insight’ into racial attitudes of the times. ‘It details, for example, the transactions between Bristol merchants and their Carolina agents who speak of 'Negroes' as trading commodities for whom a good price must be obtained in precisely the same tone as they discuss the rice and deerskins they also trafficked,’ she said. ‘It also records the networks of prominent Bristolian men who governed the city and also came together to do business in the triangular and transatlantic trades.’ Mr Becher moved from Ireland to Bristol in the late 17th century and rose through the political ranks while trading in a number of goods. Bristol became a wealthy port during the slave trade, with more than 2,000 ships leaving the city to make a trip to Africa and then across the Atlantic with around 500,000 slaves.  An illustration of part of the city in the 1800s is pictured . The book was bought from his family at London's Bloomsbury Auctions in September last year with funds raised by the Friends of Bristol Museums and Archives and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The fragile book has been digitised for future study and assistant mayor Simon Cook said it serves as a reminder that the city was once at the heart of the slave trade. ‘It is a deeply moving account of a particular time in Bristol's history,' he said. ‘Trading in human life to make money in any era makes for chilling reading and it is through access to these original sources that we are better able comprehend the city's past. ‘And while we readily acknowledge and take comfort from the fact that many Bristolians were amongst the most vocal and active abolitionists, we should never forget that some of the city's forefathers were at the heart of the slave trade.’","Bristol merchant Cranfield Becher's 270-year-old log book orders the captain of the Jason Gally to swap brandy and guns for slaves .

Jailed: Paedophile Kenneth Trotter, pictured, was thrown out of Australia after he was jailed for rape. He is back behind bars in Britain for deliberately moving to Blackpool to prey on more children . A 'sadistic' paedophile who was deported from Australia after he was jailed for rape was back behind bars in Britain today for deliberately moving to a seaside town to prey on more children. Kenneth Trotter, 77, who left the UK in the 50s, had been ordered back to England by a judge in Melbourne after he was jailed for 12 years in 1994 for abusing youngsters at his flat. But after landing in London last year, he decided to settle in Blackpool, Lancashire, because he knew there would be lots of children there - either on holiday with their family or living in the town. Despite being monitored by police Trotter soon 'disappeared' from a house where he was staying which turned out to be . the address of a charity. When Trotter was eventually traced three weeks later it emerged he had gone to a church group offering teenage girls the chance to work for him canvassing his skills as a sewing machine repairer on a door to door basis. He also offered the Methodist Church youngsters a place in a home he said he was buying. Lancashire Police obtained a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from employing any children and also having no contact with youngsters unless in the presence of an approved adult. Upon being served with the order, Trotter told magistrates he would prefer go to prison. He shouted at the bench: 'I would rather go to jail now....I have to go to prison.' He then booked himself into a hotel asked if there were any children living there. He also returned four times to the home of a mother-of-four, in the hope he would find one of her children home alone. At Preston Crown Court Trotter denied breaching the sex offender order claiming it 'breached his human rights' as he had to tell police where he was living. But he was convicted and jailed for three years. Passing sentence Judge Graham Knowles QC told him: 'You Trotter, in my view, are an exceptionally dangerous man with nothing to lose. The seaside resort of Blackpool where Preston Crown Court heard the 'sadistic' 77-year-old had moved to because there was a high concentration of vulnerable children . 'You deliberately and flagrantly breached this order by a pre-meditated and wilful act of defiance. 'When you landed at Heathrow Airport you presented a very obvious and major problem to authorities. 'You said you were going to live in Blackpool - the reason, I'm sure, as you know is that Blackpool would have a large number of children present - holiday makers and families - and a high concentration of vulnerable children and young people. - Judge Graham Knowles QC . 'The police were gravely concerned yet you soon decided that you'd had enough of being controlled and the police knowing where you were. 'You gave them a new and false address and the consequences was that the police had no idea where you were. 'I am sure that you deliberately gave the police a false address - the reason is that you wanted to commit further sexual offences to children and young children. 'Some of your Australian convictions arose when you ran a similar business to use it as an opportunity to meet boys and to have boys living with you. 'Police take the view that what you were doing on the streets of Blackpool appear to mirror your offences in Australia.' Trotter who left the UK in the 1950s used his dual citizenship to live in a flat in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda and took over a sewing machine repair business from another Briton in 1974. But he was arrested in 1993 after boys aged between ten and 15 claimed he had sexually assaulted them between 1980 and 1993. A court in Australia was later told he . had persuaded the parents of some young boys to let them work for him, . canvassing suburban homes for sewing machine repairs, and to stay . overnight at his flat a few times a week. Trotter has been jailed for three years. In his defence he had denied breaching a sex offender order claiming it 'breached his human rights' as he had to tell police where he was living . Police who raided his property found child pornographic literature, photographs and films at the flat. Australian . prosecutors said Trotter's business was 'no more than a front' used by . him to lure the boys to his flat for his sexual gratification. Trotter . was initially found guilty of 16 sex charges including indecent assault . and buggery and was jailed for 12 years in 1994. But . two years later he faced another trial in Melbourne after another . victim came forward to say he was abused in 1980 when he was just 11. During the second trial Trotter denied all the offences and represented himself cross examining the victim in the witness box. It sparked calls for a change on the law in Australia about defendants being able to cross examine witnesses themselves. Trotter was ordered to serve at least nine years in an Australian jail before paroled in 2008. Trotter spent 18 years in custody in total and when jailed for the final time, a judge in New South . Wales called him a 'sadistic, callous and most heartless human being'. He was sent back to the UK last year. He . registered himself as staying at the address of a Blackpool charity but . last June when police tried to trace him the charity had never heard of . him and a nationwide manhunt began for him. He was arrested three weeks later in Blackpool town centre. The court heard Trotter had been going to a centre at North Shore Methodist Church where he pretended to have been sent from the Jobcentre to offer employment to girls aged 14 and over to work as canvassers for him. He said girls aged over 16 could live at a house he was buying in Blackpool and he also set up a door-to-door sewing machine repair business. He repeatedly went to one house where two young girls lived four times - despite being told their household did not have a sewing machine. Trotter, who defended himself told the hearing: 'Every address I went to the police effectively had me illegally evicted. 'They would be visiting every day and the landlords asked me to leave because they didn't want the police coming.' 'It meant that I would have to live on the streets. 'I was forced to spend the night sheltering under the window of a disused house in the rain. 'It was a matter of life and death as far as I was concerned. I didn't think I was breaking any law- I had a reasonable excuse. The order that was put against me was an impossibility.' The lifetime Sexual offences prevention order will remain in place and it means Trotter cannot live anywhere in England and Wales without the premises being vetted by specialist sex crime officers first. Trotter is the latest in a line of . British-born criminals who have been deported here after being jailed in . Australia for serious offences. More than 3,200 foreign criminals, failed asylum seekers and EU 'benefit tourists' are using the Human Rights Act to thwart their removal from the UK.","Kenneth Trotter, 77, left the UK in the 50s to move to Australia .

George Zimmerman, the man acquitted of the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2013, said he wanted to fight the hip hop superstar because he 'constantly attacks innocent people'. But now, as the 30-year-old painter continues to try and extend his 15 minutes of infamy, Zimmerman has been confirmed to go fist-to-fist with rapper DMX. The two will compete in a 'celebrity boxing match', according to TMZ, which bizarrely was all Zimmerman's idea. 'I am breaking every rule in boxing': Rapper DMX, 43, has confirmed he will fight George Zimmerman in a 'celebrity boxing match' George Zimmerman, 30, was found not guilty of all charges levied against him after he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida . DMX - real name Earl Simmons - was arrested on August 20, 2013, in South Carolina for driving under a suspended license and marijuana possession . Boxing promoter Damon Feldman confirmed the fight and said DMX was selected out of more than 15,000 applicants. The 43-year-old rap star and actor said he plans to break every rule in boxing 'to make sure I f--k him right up'. He also threatened to urinate in his opponent’s face if he won. 'I will beat the living f--k out of him,' DMX told TMZ. The boxing match will last for three rounds. An exact date, time and location for the fight will be announced at a news conference next Wednesday. All the proceeds Zimmerman earns from the fight will go to charity, Feldman said. Zimmerman has been in boxing training for months in preparation for the fight. It was his idea to stage a boxing match. Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman is now taking part in a 'celebrity boxing match' 'It was my idea,' Zimmerman said in an interview with Radar Online. 'Prior to the incident I was actually going to the gym for weight loss and doing boxing-type training for weight loss and a mutual friend put me in contact with Damon and provided me with an opportunity and motivation to get back in shape and continue with my weight loss goals and also be able to help a charity out,' he said. 'Boxing isn’t new to me. 'It’s something I had picked up well before the incident and it’s something that I liked, I enjoyed, and I kept up with it and I was able to lose a tremendous amount of weight and get a healthy lifestyle.' 'So it’s not a new hobby, it’s something I have been doing and wanting to pursue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.' In a strange coincidence, today would have been Trayvon Martin's 19th birthday. Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges levied against him, after he fatally shot the teen during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The Hispanic man claimed that he had killed Martin with a weapon in an act of self-defence. George Zimmerman initially set his aim for Kanye West, saying he should take part in a fight because he constantly attacks people . Zimmerman remained without charge for 44 days after the shooting occurred, which led to nationwide protests and sparked furious debate over racial profiling and the right to use weapons in self-defence. Further demonstrations broke out after Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013. Federal authorities are currently reviewing the entire case to decide whether Martin’s civil rights were violated. Rapper The Game, who has a tattoo of Trayvon Martin on his leg, had previously registered his interest to challenge Zimmerman in a fight. 'I would not be boxing for me,' The Game told TMZ. 'I'd be boxing for the legacy of Trayvon Martin and for his family. 'I would box him to knock him out. 'I would definitely take pleasure in it. 'It's legal, and I want to show him you can solve your disputes without a weapon.'","George Zimmerman, 30, came up with the idea of participating in a boxing match 'for charity'

Michael King, 53, and his wife Thelma, 57, from South Carolina, were last September found stabbed to death in their beachfront apartment on the Dutch Caribbean territory. The suspects - identified only by their initials - are J.J.W, who was arrested on St Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, J.C.M., who is just 17, and 28-year-old M.K.J., who prosecutors say has confessed to the crime. Murdered: Michael and Thelma King were found . murdered in their holiday home on the Caribbean Island of Saint Maarte. Three men will tomorrow go on trial accused of their murders . Horrifying: The South Carolina couple, who were . starting a rum business on the island of Saint Maarten, were found in . their beachfront home with several stab wounds. Thelma King was found . bound to a chair . The trial, which begins tomorrow, is . expected to last just two days, but the judge is not expected to issue a . ruling until early next month. If found guilty, the three suspects face life in jail. Successful entrepreneurs, the Kings . owned several homes, including their property on St Maarten, and owned . numerous restaurants there. They were found dead on September 21 last . year after friends on the island became suspicious when they didn't . respond to calls. Mr King's brother, Todd, told CNN he and his entire family will be travelling to St Maarten to attent the trial. 'Everybody's coming,' he told the U.S. news network. 'Everybody loved Michael, he was just one of the nicest . guys you would ever meet.' Slain: Local businessman Michael King, right, and his wife, Thelma, right, were killed at their beachfront holiday home; their bodies were found with fatal stab wounds on Friday, September 21, 2012 . Taco Stein, St Maarten's Solicitor General, said the killings appeared to be the result of a burglary that went 'out of hand'. According to local officials, the . couple were repeatedly stabbed. Mrs King was discovered bound to a . chair. 'I'm confident they [the suspects] will be found guilty,' Mr . Stein said. But Brenda Brooks, the lawyer . representing J.C.M., the youngest of the accused, told CNN she thinks . the prosecution's theory 'doesn't add up.' 'I don't believe it, that these guys . kind of went on a joyride with someone else's car, and then went out . drinking and ended up coincidentally by the Kings, and it was initially . said to be a robbery and they end up killing the couple,' she said. 'I think there is something else to that story.' Tragic: Local restaurant owner Topper Daboul . described Thelma King, far left, and Michael King, rear right, as . 'beautiful' people who 'probably had to hang their wings up at night' The killings have shocked the . close-knit ex-pat community on St Maarten, which has a population of . just under 38,000 and a land mass of only 13 square miles. Terry Tamblyn of Isle of Palms, South . Carolina, who was a partner with King in St Maarten rental property, . said last year: 'It's beyond me. It was such a shock. 'I can't figure any reason. It was crazy to me. Everybody loved Mike and Thelma.' Mr Tamblyn added: 'He'd give you the . shirt off his back. They were just the greatest people in the world. I . can't think of any enemies.' Mr King was a retired insurance . executive who later started a successful printing business that he sold, . Mr Tamblyn said. He said Mr King owned a couple of restaurants on the . island and was about to start a new spiced-rum business. Holiday home: The couple, both in their 50s, . were found dead at their home in the Ocean Club Resort in Cupecoy. The . entrepreneurs ran several restaurants on the island and were starting a . new rum business . Local restaurant owner Topper Daboul said that he was a friend of the couple and was building a rum factory with them. 'These two people probably had to hang their wings up at night. That's how beautiful they were,' Mr Daboul said. 'Their life was pretty successful ... They had oodles of dollars. They had everything they ever wanted in life.' Mr Daboul, speaking just after the Kings' bodies were found, said he last saw Mr King on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 19. 'I knew some other friends had drinks with them that night,' he said. 'We weren't able to reach them on Thursday. We called all day on Thursday. The fact that he didn't call made me a little suspicious, but not a lot.' Mr Daboul said he drove over to the King's home at the Ocean Club Resort in Cupecoy on Friday, September 21, and banged on the door. He said he asked a person who had been on the premises at the time to climb over a fence and see if they saw anyone in the house. Mr Daboul said the person told him that he saw a dead man leaning over a chair. Following the murders, the island's hospitality and trade association released a statement expressing outrage at the attack and offering condolences to friends and family of the couple. 'St. Maarten is a small, diverse and close knit community. This tragedy pains everyone in the community deeply,' the statement said.

What began as a campaign against the . redevelopment of Gezi Park in a corner of Taksim Square spiralled into . an massive display of public rage over the perceived authoritarianism of . Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party. Worst unrest in a decade of power: Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has called on protesters to immediately clear the streets . Police firing tear gas and water cannon have clashed with groups of protesters night after night in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities across the country for much of the past week, leaving three dead and some 4,000 injured. Mr Erdogan yesterday demanded an immediate end to the protests, saying they were founded on a 'campaign of lies.' He has branded the demonstrators as looters and has said the protests are being manipulated by 'terrorist' groups. There are rumours that among the liberal protesters there are far-Right nationalists who seek a return to the kind of militant secularism that saw Turkish politics dominated in the 20th century by a string of military dictatorships. Mr Erdogan gave no indication of any immediate plans to remove the tent villages that have appeared in Taksim and a park in the capital, Ankara. But the gatherings mark a challenge to a leader whose authority is built on three successive election victories. 'Let them attack, they can't stop us,' shouted a member of the Turkish Communist Party, shouting through loudspeakers to a cheering crowd from on top of a white van in Taksim Square. 'The AK Party will go. This will be the end.' The protesters have built barricades of . paving stones and corrugated iron on access roads to Taksim to try to . protect themselves against a potential police assault. But their actions . have brought gridlock to part of central Istanbul and it is unclear how . long the authorities will tolerate their presence. The square is lined by luxury hotels that should be doing a roaring trade as the summer season starts in one of the world's most-visited cities. But a forced eviction could trigger a repeat of the clashes seen earlier in the week. During his decade in power, Mr Erdogan has enacted many democratic reforms, taming a military that toppled four governments in four decades, starting entry talks with the European Union, reining in rights abuses by police and forging peace talks with Kurdish rebels to end a three-decade-old war that has cost 40,000 lives.

Per-capita income has tripled in nominal terms and business has boomed under his rule. But in recent years, critics say his style, always forceful and emotional, has become authoritarian. Media have come under pressure, and the arrests of military and other figures over alleged coup plots as well as moves such as restrictions on alcohol sales have unsettled especially secular middle-class Turks who are sensitive to any encroachment of religion on their daily lives. The fierce crackdown, condemned by foreign powers, on what started as peaceful protests in Gezi Park were the final straw, has caused simmering frustrations with Erdogan's leadership to boil over. 'These protests are partly a result of his success in economic and social transformation. There's a new generation who doesn't want to be bullied by the prime minister and who is afraid their lifestyle is in danger,' said Joost Lagendijk, a former European parliamentarian and Istanbul-based academic.

Sources close to the AK Party that Mr Erdogan founded in 2001, and which only a year later crushed traditional secular parties in elections, suggest a sense of siege within the leadership, with influential if disparate forces keen to remove Erdogan. Citing a party source, the Radikal newspaper said an AK Party executive meeting on Saturday may discuss the possibility of calling early elections, although it could also change party rules to enable Mr Erdogan to seek a fourth term as prime minister rather than running for the presidency. Mr Erdogan has made clear he has no intention of stepping aside - pointing to the AK Party's 50 percent of the vote in the last election - and he has no clear rivals inside the party or outside, with the opposition fragmented on the streets and in parliament.","First image of academic Ceyda Sungar since she was sprayed .

Mike Tindall couldn't disguise the after-effects of a tiring trip to Hong Kong to play rugby in the intense heat on Saturday, as today he appeared to nod off during the celebrations to mark 60 years since the Queen's Coronation. The former England captain, who is married to Zara Phillips, the Queen's eldest granddaughter, had his eyes closed on a number of occasions during the short service at Westminster Abbey. Days earlier the centre joined the Barbarians team as they played against the British and Irish Lions, but this morning he was paying the price, as he was persistently rubbing his eyes, giving the impression he might be severely jet-lagged. His tiredness seemed so obvious that at one point Queen's son Prince Edward appeared to point to bags under his own eyes while Prince William giggled while looking at his cousin's husband. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sleepy? Mike Tindall (circled above and below) was struggling to stay awake during the service at Westminster Abbey to commemorate 60 years since the Queen's coronation. The rugby player turned out for the Barbarians against the British and Irish Lions in Hong Kong on Saturday and was clearly jet-lagged . Head in hands: Mike Tindall was shown on live television looking incredibly tired after returning from a rugby match in the Far East . On tour: Celebrated rugby centre Tindall was playing for the Barbarians, who played England (pictured) before heading to Hong Kong to play the Lions . He was evidently feeling the jetlag from the near-12 hour flight back from the Far East, where he played for the Barbarians against the Lions in their first warm-up match ahead of their Australian tour. The Gloucester and former England centre joined the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and more than 20 royals, including the heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge and her husband Prince William, for the religious service. The Queen was crowned on June 2, 1953 . at Westminster Abbey. During his address, the Archbishop of Canterbury . Justin Welby described the Queen's life as one of 'demanding devotion . and utter self sacrifice - a path she did not choose but one she was . called to.' Tindall played 20 minutes for the Barbarians in their 59-8 defeat to the Lions on Saturday. The 'Baa-baas' broke with their long-standing tradition before the match by implementing a self-imposed ‘booze ban’ to enhance their chances of upsetting the Lions. In the aftermath of their abject 40-12 defeat against England at Twickenham three days earlier, Dai Young’s players chose to stay off alcohol for the rest of the week. Their decision went against the invitational team’s age-old pre-match routine, with its heavy emphasis on ‘bonding’ drinking sessions .

Business Secretary Vince Cable said internet firms had to do more to police what people could search for and view online . Senior politicians and child welfare  campaigners have demanded Google show ‘moral . leadership’ and block child porn. As research revealed one in six men who view the vile sites . go on to abuse children, Vince Cable last night broke ranks to become the first . minister to call on the internet giant to do more to restrict access. His intervention came as John Carr, a leading adviser on . online child safety, said there were . simple measures that search engines could take to make it harder for . paedophiles to find illegal pictures. Mr Carr, of Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet . Safety, said: ‘If you stop them viewing child porn, you stop much of the . physical abuse as a result. 'Google’s moral leadership is essential here. They . are the biggest player in this space in the world. 'They can and should be . proactive – if they did it, I think others would have to follow.’ Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life on Thursday, collected . a ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and . Microsoft’s Bing in the weeks before he abducted and murdered five-year-old April . Jones. Both he and Stuart Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no . previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn . on the internet to committing child murder. Business Secretary Mr Cable said yesterday: ‘Mark Bridger . appears to have been influenced by watching child pornography on the internet. ‘Where there is some scope for taking action is getting the . companies that host these sites, Google and the rest of it, to be more . proactive in policing what is there.’ There was no response from Conservative ministers as critics . pointed to the party’s close links with Google. Shadow media minister Helen Goodman said: . ‘Search engines and other technology companies need to be more proactive in . preventing access to child pornography. The industry should be making safe searches the default. If . technology companies are unable to make progress by a set date, we need to see . action from the Government.’ Tory MP Claire Perry, who is David Cameron’s adviser on . parenting and childhood, said: ‘This is a hugely complex problem and there is . no magic bullet, but government, industry and internet users have got to do . more to avert more of these terrible crimes. Jailed: Sexual predator and murderer Mark Bridger is taken from court yesterday to start his whole life sentence in jail . However, Mr Carr claimed search engines were reluctant to . act because any access restrictions could lose them millions of users, causing . advertising revenue to fall. Experts say Google can combat abuse by paedophiles by simply . popping up messages when users type in search terms such as ‘teen sex’ or . ‘barely legal’, warning them that they may be about to access illegal material. People who view child porn, who thrive on anonymity, may be frightened into . going no further, they claim. Mother and daughter: Coral Jones cuddles smiling April tightly. She described how the family will never recover from her death . Mr Carr also suggests search engines should reset their . default search setting to the safest option, which would automatically block . access to all hardcore pornography. To view these sites users would have to set . up a personal account with Google. He added: ‘They could at that point ask them to verify that . they are 18 or above. That would be a huge deterrent for many of these guys. 'That would stop them getting on the pathway that led to the child abuse images. ‘This is not an attack on free speech, this is not . censorship. It is about making child pornography less easily available. 'Pornography has always been around but Google has made it available on a scale . never seen before.’ Mr Carr, who plans to confront Google at a forthcoming . meeting and raise the subject at the next gathering of the Government’s . internet task force, said while the site does not run adverts from . pornographers, bosses may be concerned that blocking porn would mean ‘people . would go to other search engines and this would affect revenue’. He pointed to a British study from 2007, which found a . ‘substantial minority’ of those who watch child porn go on to attack children. David Middleton, of De Montfort University, analysed 213 . online offenders and 191 paedophiles who had physically abused children. ‘The . majority of people [who watch child porn] don’t appear to escalate their . behaviour. But a substantial minority do,’ Professor Middleton said. ‘Various . studies have looked at this and put it somewhere between one in six and one in . ten.’ Over the past month, Mold Crown Court heard how Bridger . murdered April after becoming obsessed with online child porn. Internet giant: Google says that it operates a 'zero tolerance' policy towards child porn . He found shockingly violent images by searching on Google . and Bing for simple terms, including: ‘Naked young five-year-old girls’, . ‘nudism five-year-old’ and ‘pictures of naked virgin teens’. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select . committee, said online images of child sex abuse needed to be removed. Jim . Sheridan, who sits on the culture committee, added: ‘I know it’s extremely . difficult to ban it (but) I think with the political will and the technology, . if you can do it, we should be doing it.’ Phillip Noyes, acting chief executive of the NSPCC, said: . ‘For some time we have been concerned about the growing number of these obscene . images which are becoming more easily available and can fuel the fantasies of . offenders like Bridger.’ Google insisted it does all it can to prevent child . pornography coming up on searches, adding that it employs a ‘zero tolerance . policy on child sexual abuse content’. Spokesman Scott Rubin said: ‘We work with organisations to . proactively find this material, so while safe search might filter this out we . think it is important to go beyond that and we do that all the time. Any . implication that we don’t is simply wrong.’ Asked what they do if they find such sites, he added: ‘We . immediately remove it and report it to appropriate legal authorities.’","Business Secretary says it is 'very, very difficult' to police the internet .

Would-be refugees who have been told to leave the country have received a total of £100million from the State since the Coalition came to power. The support payments are supposed to be temporary - but 2,000 failed asylum seekers have been receiving payments for more than a year. Claim: Failed asylum seekers are currently being given £100,000 a day by the British Government (file photo) Critics described the figures as . 'madness', claiming that Britain should not spend so much on supporting . people who have no right to live here. Asylum seekers who are denied permission . to remain in the UK are entitled to a payment known as 'Section 4 . support' if they have no other means of supporting themselves. This money pays for their accommodation and gives them £35.39 a week to spend on groveries and other necessities. It is supposed to be handed out on a temporary basis, but 2,000 failed asylum seekers have continued to receive the funds for more than a year. 'Madness': Labour MP Frank Field says the money spent on supporting the immigrants should be cut . Since the Coalition Government came to power in 2010, more than £100million has been handed out in Section 4 support. A leading Labour MP criticised the figures, saying they showed that immigration policy was 'madness on stilts'. Frank Field told The Sun: 'Can you imagine the wall we could build around the country for £100million?' Section 4 support can be claimed by failed asylum seekers while they are trying to leave Britain if they are judged to be at risk of becoming 'destitute'. Immigrants who are appealing against the decision to kick them out of the country are also eligible for the payments. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'The number of failed asylum seekers claiming and being granted asylum support has more than halved in the past three years - along with the cost to the taxpayer. 'In some cases, destitute failed asylum seekers are unable to leave the UK immediately and can apply for support until their situation is resolved. 'The Home Office is clear that Section 4 support is limited, temporary and should not be capable of providing any incentive to remain in the UK.' A report last week found that new contracts supposed to save £20million a year on housing for asylum seekers had cost £12million more than expected over its first 12 months. The National Audit Office also revealed that one in 10 properties occupied by asylum seekers showed 'signs of wealth' such as electronic gadgets.","Asylum seekers whose claims failed are entitled to temporary payments while they wait to leave Britain .

""[We] couldn't get out of the garage,' Eddie Ward told KRQE. 'We've lived here 23 years and never seen this. So it's pretty crazy. Ward and his mother were among the dumbfounded residents of Clovis who woke up Monday morning to the mountains of Salsola iberica, or Russian thistle. The noxious invader that arrived from the Eurasion steppe in the 1800's is now common weed throughout the West. Too common if you ask Lee Cassidy of Clovis. Trapped: Some people became trapped inside their homes and had to call 911 . Tumbleweeds AKA Russian Thistle AKA Salsola iberica is native not to the barren American West, but to the frigid steppe of central Asia. The tumbleweeds hitched a ride with settlers, likely landing somewhere in the Dakotas prior to the 1880s. The tenacious plant, which saps water from already parched lands and has few if any uses, quickly became ubiquitous in the central western states. The largest specimens can grow as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Each winter when the plants dry up and die, the break off their stems and roll away with the winds to spread their nefarious seeds, hundreds of thousands of them, for miles around. 'It looked like a herd of cows coming,' she said of the invasion. 'The tumbleweeds were just rolling in.'

Dozens of cars left trapped by floodwater and landslides were shipped to safety aboard Royal Marine landing craft yesterday, and it was all thanks to a brilliant ten-year-old boy. Around 30 vehicles had been . left stranded on a dead-end after a 20 metre stretch of road collapsed at . Calstock, Cornwall, on Christmas Day. With repairs to the flood-ravaged lane . likely to take months, it seemed there was nothing that could be done, until schoolboy Charlie Southcott came up . with a plan to reach the marooned motors by water. Scroll down for video . All aboard: Royal Marine Commandos oversee the rescue of dozens of trapped cars in a mission dreamed up by a 10-year-old-boy . In an operation approved by the Government’s Cobra emergency committee, four amphibious landing craft were able to collect the vehicles from an old WWII slipway and ferry them down the River Tamar. Charlie and his serviceman dad Christopher, 44, had attended a Navy carol service where the two met the Royal Marine’s Commodore Graeme Little. Mastermind: Schoolboy Charlie Southcott has been hailed a hero in his local community after coming up with the plan to rescue the vehicles . When the Southcott's car was stranded days later, Charlie handed the commodore’s card to a local councillor and suggested they borrow his boats. Cornwall Council then contacted the Commodore and fleshed out Charlie’s suggestion into a full-scale rescue operation. Ministers and disaster planners on the Government’s Cobra committee - only held at times of national emergency - pored over the details before giving the mission the green light. Marines from 1 Assault Group swung into action, launching four amphibious landing craft on the River Tamar - just as Charlie had envisaged. The trapped cars were then driven down to the slipway at Calstock - built for the US military in 1943 - before being loaded onto the boats one by one. They were then taken a few miles down the river to Cotehele Quay to be unloaded and driven away by their owners. Charlie lives with his dad and mum Vanessa, 37, on scenic Lower Kelly, which began to subside on Christmas morning and experienced a second shift later in the day. The collapse effectively sheared the remote village of Calstock in two, leaving 20 homes and a row of parked cars marooned. Five families were forced to evacuate amid fears their houses could topple into the Tamar, which separates Devon and Cornwall. Residents were able to skirt around the collapsed road and walk through woodland to reach their homes and cars. Cause: Heavy rains and flooding caused a landslide on Christmas day that left around 30 vehicles trapped on a dead end road . A Royal Marine inspects a row of vehicles left trapped after the 20 metre stretch of road collapsed at Calstock, Cornwall . Action plan: Young Charlie's rescue plan involved shipping the cars a few miles down the River Tamar to Cotehele Quay . But their was no way to drive them away without plunging into the river or hacking down hundreds of trees. Charlie’s mum Vanessa, a civil . servant, added: 'We went down to Devonport Naval base in Plymouth on . Christmas Eve as my husband works down there. 'Charlie saw the commodore and asked if we could go up and speak to him at the end as he had never spoken to one before. 'So . we went over and had a chat with him for about 10 to 15 minutes then at . the end Commodore Little gave Charlie his business card. 'We didn’t think anything of it until Christmas Day when our cars and several others got stuck. 'Charlie . came to a public meeting with me on Boxing Day and he suggested to the . local councillor that she called Commodore Little and passed on his . number. Operation: Cars are loaded aboard a Royal  Marines' landing craft from an old WWII slipway on the River Tamar . Easy does it: Four amphibious landing craft were able to collect the vehicles from the slipway and ferry them down the River Tamar . Turnout: Locals wave from the riverbank as one of the cars is ferried away . 'I don’t think she could really believe it when he gave her his number. Charlie has lived in Calstock all his life and knows it very well. 'He suggested they use the Marines to transport the cars - he’s chuffed to bits and is thrilled that he’s been able to help out with all of this. Charlie, . who was given the afternoon off school, was among the . crowds who gathered at the banks of the Tamar to watch the Royal Marines . loading the cars on to their landing crafts. He said: 'When I went to the . service on Christmas Eve I spoke to the Commodore about how Plymouth . Naval Base was the biggest base in Europe. After we spoke he gave me his . card with his number on it - he was very nice. 'They . held a meeting in the village a few days later and weirdly I had the . Commodore’s phone number in my pocket. I gave it to a councillor and . then she called the Commodore and spoke to him about it. Rescue committee: Three of the four landing craft head off along the River Tamar. Charlie's brilliant plan was approved at the highest level by the government's Cobra emergency committee . On their way: The cars were taken a few miles down the river to Cotehele Quay to be unloaded and driven away by their owners . Brainchild: Charlie suggested the idea to local councilors and was even able to hand them the business card of Navy Commodore Graeme Little who he had met at a carol service . That's the ticket: Proud Charlie with the business card given to him by Royal Navy Commodore Graeme Little . 'I . thought it would work really well if they got the cars onto a boat and . down the river. The boats pass here so I see them quite a lot. The Royal .

Community Primary School, said it was 'awesome' that the marines had . agreed to put his plan into action. Colonel . Garth Manger, Commanding Officer of 1 Assault Group, based at Devonport . Naval base, said the landing vehicles were normally used to carry . troops. Named after the Cabinet Office briefing rooms where it meets, the Cobra, or Civil Contingencies Committee meets during national emergencies such as natural disasters or acts of terrorism. Chaired by the Home Secretary, it is supported by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which forms part of the Cabinet Office. Its primary role is to coordinate the actions of the various bodies within the UK, including local authorities, fire and rescue, the police and the armed forces. It will also meet to discuss events happenening in foreign countrues which are deemed to have major implications for the UK. The Prime MInister has the authority to convene Cobra whenever he feels the country is facing an emergency situation. Examples of when the Cobra committee has met include foot-and-mouth scares, the fuel crisis of 2000 and the Icelandic volcanic eruption that shut down UK airspace in 2010. He said: 'The Royal Navy is delighted to come to the aid of the civilian authorities who would normally assist the public. 'In this case we are using Royal Marine expertise in providing amphibious boats where there is no other feasible access to repatriate vehicles to the national road network. 'My men train to conduct disaster relief around the world and while this is slightly different it is a fantastic opportunity to do some real training while helping the community in which we live.' Cornwall Council provided a fleet of hire cars for all the stranded motorists. They said the entire rescue operation could last as long as two days. Cllr Dorothy Kirk said the drivers would likely have been without their vehicles for months had Charlie not bent the Commadore’s ear. She joked: 'I doubt very much whether COBRA had heard of Calstock before.' A total of 39 vehicles will be floated to safety in a two day operation. Charlie has lived in the pretty Cornish village all his life with his parents and younger brother William, seven. Charlie’s mum Vanessa said the family had been without their Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus since Christmas Day and were forced to use hire cars. She said: 'It’s been a pretty expensive January as we’ve had to rent two cars ourselves which has cost us £1,500. The council say they're going to reimburse us, but it’s a lot of money to pay out.' The family, who live on Lower Kelly, were able to stay in their house when the road collapsed, unlike a few of their neighbours who were forced to move out amid safety concerns. Councillor Bert Biscoe, responsible for Transport and Waste at Cornwall Council, said: 'Charlie had a bright idea - he looked at the situation and used his noddle, he’s clearly a problem solving boy. 'He approached a couple of members of our staff and asked if the phone number would be of any help and so here we are. Its a really good liaison between the council, the police, the community and the Marines.","30 vehicles left stranded on a dead-end road after Christmas Day landslide .

Motorists could pay almost £200 a year more for petrol when a new green fuel is introduced in line with EU rules, experts have warned. Their tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient, increase CO2 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles. It is set to be introduced because of an EU directive saying that major suppliers must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol. New green fuel: Tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient, increase CO2 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles (file picture) Many oil companies have decided to use bio-ethanol, made from corn, sugar cane and rapeseed. The new eco-fuel, E10, contains 10 per cent bio-ethanol, compared with up to 5 per cent in the E5 unleaded blend currently on sale. The Renewable Energy Directive requires 5 per cent of road transport energy to be from renewable sources this year, and 10 per cent by 2020, in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. But while ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol, it supplies around 30 per cent less energy. This means cars will use more of the new fuel, costing drivers more. Tests by motoring magazine What Car? found that big, powerful cars coped better, while the small-engined models often bought by families on a budget were the worst affected. Its tests showed cars’ fuel economy fell by as much as 11.3 per cent, and by 8.4 per cent on average, with E10 compared to pure unleaded petrol. View: Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said it was up to fuel sellers to decide how to meet EU targets . That is the equivalent of two extra full tanks a year, or £170 assuming both fuels cost the same, it said. The report added: ‘Apply this to all compatible cars and you’re looking at a national annual fuel bill hike of £3.4billion.’ When the new fuel was compared with E5, it said, ‘the effect would be smaller but still significant’. Tests in the US – where car engines tend to be far bigger – showed falls in fuel economy of only 3 to 4 per cent. Not every car can use E10, which can melt, corrode and wreck some components in older engines. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and . Traders said 92 per cent of UK cars are compatible with E10, but that . leaves around 1.5million vehicles, mostly those built before 2002, . potentially at risk. What Car? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump, hose filter and injector blockages. It is also corrosive to some seals, plastics and metals ‘and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure’. The fuel leads to increased CO2 emissions from car exhaust pipes.

Killer: Joanna Dennehy pleaded guilty to murdering three men before dumping their bodies in ditches . A woman grinned at the Old Bailey yesterday as she admitted murdering three men and attempting to kill two others. Joanna Dennehy, 30, stabbed to death her landlord Kevin Lee, 48, and her two housemates Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and John Chapman, 56, before dumping their bodies in two separate ditches. The killings occurred after Mr Lee served an eviction notice on Dennehy and her two housemates. Last night, Dennehy’s horrified family told the Mail she had the perfect middle class upbringing in the Home Counties before she ran away from home as a teenager and got in with the wrong crowd. They said they had ‘no way to cope’ with the reality that their ‘bright’ girl who excelled at school had turned into a triple killer. Dennehy’s sister Maria, 29, said her parents Kevin, 56, and Kathleen, 51, have had no contact with Dennehy since she was a teenager but her mother had been devastated by news of her crimes. She said: ‘It has ruined my mum completely. If you can imagine being a mother and giving birth to someone who causes a family so much hurt. It is indescribable how she is feeling. ‘My mother has not been able to cope, from one day to the next the only thing she ever talks about is the families that Joanna has caused this to. I hope justice is served correctly and brings peace to these poor families she has devastated.’ In court: Dennehy, who sat in the dock, appeared to surprise her defence barrister by pleading guilty . Murdered: Lukasz Slaboszewski (left), 31, and John Chapman (right), 56, were found dead at Thorney Dyke . Dennehy, who had been due to stand trial for the killings in January, stunned the court when she pleaded guilty to the murders. In extraordinary scenes, her barrister . asked the judge if he could have more time with his client for her to . consider her admissions, but Dennehy insisted: ‘I have pleaded guilty . and that’s it.’ She also admitted ‘preventing the lawful and decent . burial’ of all three men and the attempted murders of Robin Bereza and . John Rogers. Discovered: Property developer Kevin Lee's body was found in a ditch in Newborough, Cambridgeshire . Nigel Lickley QC said: ‘The course is not one I had anticipated. We ask for more time given what has just occurred.’ The case was briefly adjourned before . Mr Lickley told the judge that he planned to see his client this week . before informing the court next Monday whether the pleas would be . maintained or changed. But Dennehy shouted from the dock: . ‘I’m not coming back down here again just to say the same stuff. It’s a . long way to come to say the same thing I have just said.’ Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘She has . pleaded guilty to a large number of counts, clearly intentionally, and . in the circumstances if there is to be any application for a change than . I will consider it but otherwise she has pleaded guilty.’ Police launched an appeal to find . Dennehy, who has a green star tattoo on her right cheek, following the . murders and urged the public not to approach her. Mr Slaboszewski, who was stabbed in . the heart, was murdered between March 19 and Good Friday, March 29. Mr . Lee, who died from stab wounds to the chest, and Mr Chapman, who was . stabbed in the neck and chest, were both killed on Good Friday. Mr Lee’s body was found in a ditch in . Newborough, Cambridgeshire, on Easter Saturday before the two other . victims were found a short distance away at Thorney Dyke four days . later. It is understood that Mr Lee had served an eviction notice on the shared house in Peterborough. At the time of the murders, Toni . Roberts, 25, who used to live there, said the tenants had been ordered . out so it could be renovated. Investigation: Police searching the scene at Thormey Dyke where two bodies were found in a ditch . Scene: Police were called in April to Fenland field in Thorney, near Peterborough, after a member of the public stumbled across the bodies of Mr Slaboszewski and Mr Chapman . On location: The ditch next to a lane off Thorney Dyke where the bodies of the two men were discovered . A neighbour said the housemates were told they must go by April 25. Maria Dennehy told how her ‘very . clever’ sister, who attended a comprehensive school, had a good . upbringing, with their parents paying for private tuition and music . lessons. But at the age of 15, she became involved with drugs and left . the family’s £315,000 four-bedroom home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Case: Dennehy's partner, 7ft 3in tall Gary Stretch, 57, denied the two attempted murders and helping her to dump the bodies . Miss Dennehy, a former signaller in . the Army who also worked for Nato, said: ‘She was my sister but I . haven’t seen her for many years... she left us a long time ago. I was . only 13. She was getting into the wrong crowd at school and she decided . to leave our home. ‘By the time we found her it was too . late, she was 16 years old and had the right to choose not to come home. I have heard many stories.  She was in the wrong crowd, getting upset . and things with drugs.’ Miss Dennehy said her sister had not always been . troubled. She said: ‘No she was fantastic, great at school. We went to . different clubs, she was always into music. ‘She was very clever, I wouldn’t say . she was the brightest in the class but we had extra tuition as kids to . help us with our studies.’ A former neighbour of the family, who . didn’t want to be named, said of Dennehy: ‘When she was getting near . school-leaving age she met a boyfriend and it started there. ‘She ran away from home and turned to prostitution.’ A neighbour at another former home of . the family in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, said in recent years the parents . had not acknowledged they had two daughters. He said: ‘I would never . have known they had two daughters as they specifically said they had . one. I spoke to Maria now and then when she was back but she never . mentioned a sister.’ Dennehy appeared in court alongside . her boyfriend Gary Richards, who denied three charges of preventing . burial and the two attempted murders.

Battle with drugs: Philip Seymour Hoffman was often seen around the West Village in Manhattan before his death and he is pictured here in October of last year - five months after he sought treatment for his relapse into heroin addiction . It was the last message Philip Seymour Hoffman ever sent - an 8.58pm text on Saturday to his good friend David Katz asking if he just wanted to come over and catch the Knicks game on television. Katz missed it, then his own 11.30pm text back to the Oscar winner went unanswered. The next morning, Katz discovered his friend slumped on the floor of his bathroom - dead from an apparent heroin overdose at 46-years-old. The penultimate message Hoffman sent at 8.44pm read, 'you wanna watch the second half of the knick heat game at Bethune,' revealed Katz to the New York Times. At 8.58pm, Hoffman, keen for company, wrote another message, 'like 10:15.' Katz was at a restaurant and did not text back at the time. At 11.30pm he sent, 'just got out of dinner. Where r u?' to Hoffman. The actor did not write back. Piecing his final days together, it becomes clear that Hoffman's spiral into the throes of addiction was rapid and distressing for his family and even strangers who mistook the multi-millionaire for a homeless person. Indeed, Hoffman's last days were . ominously preceded by his bare confession that he was 'a heroin addict' at the Sundance Film Festival . to a magazine publisher he did not know. Returning . to New York City after promoting his films God’s Pocket and A Most . Wanted Man at the January 19 meeting, Hoffman settled back into a rented . $10,000 a month apartment on Bethune Street. Scroll Down for Video . Tragic scene: Philip Seymour Hoffman tried to contact his friend David Bar Katz twice the night before he was discovered dead at his Bethune Street apartment (pictured). Katz failed to respond to these messages at the time and he discovered his friend dead in the morning at around 11am . Downward spiral: A glassy eyed and pockmarked Philip Seymour Hoffman is pictured here on January 19 at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah - where he told a complete stranger that he was a heroin addict . Friends: Philip Seymour Hoffman sent a text message to his friend David Bar Katz (center) asking him to come around to his house and watch basketball the night before he died - Katz failed to respond to the message in time and found Hoffman the next day dead on his bathroom floor . Tragic: The body of Philip Seymour Hoffman was removed from his apartment after being discovered by his friend David Bar Katz and his personal assistant Isabella Wing-Davey at 11am on Sunday morning . He had moved into the two bedroom home two months before - after his partner of 14-years Mimi O'Donnell asked him to leave the home they shared with children, Cooper, 10, Tallulah, 7, and Willa, 5, because of his relapse into heroin addiction. Clean for 23 years, Hoffman had fallen off the wagon earlier in 2013 and checked himself into rehab in May. However, he clearly was struggling to stay sober and so set up himself up only two blocks away from his children and girlfriend - seeing them as often as he could. A member of the Narcotics Anonymous group in the West Village that Hoffman attended, said that in December, the actor laid bare his struggles with sobriety. Drinking binge: Philip Seymour Hoffman was seen at an . Atlanta bar on January 30th - three days before he died - and were taken . by a diner who said the Oscar winning actor was drinking, smoking and . making repeated suspicious trips to the bathroom . Shambolic: Philip Seymour Hoffman is pictured . (left) unconscious on his New York bound flight from Atlanta after . spending the afternoon drinking on January 30th before he boarded and (right) being . driven away from the flight by an airport cart on landing in the Big . Apple . Asked if those in attendance were counting their time sober in terms of years, months, weeks or days. Mr. Hoffman said, 'I am counting days,' according to an attendee who spoke to the New York Times. 'He raised his hand and he said his name and he said he had 28 days or 30 days sober,' the person said. Indeed, it has been reported that his path back into addiction began when he celebrated the wrap party of his 2012 movie, The Master - for which he was nominated for another Oscar. According to TMZ, Hoffman took a drink, which quickly became a binge session after 23-years on the wagon. Hoffman is supposed to have told his friends that this opened the floodgates and although he didn't begin taking heroin again - firstly by snorting it - in 2013 - that one drink is what led him to his untimely death. And as his battle with drink and drugs continued it was taking its toll on his appearance too. Hoffman's skin had become visibly red, raw and pockmarked - all tell-tale signs of substance abuse - particularly heroin. On January 25, his friend and writer Tatiana Pahlen ran into Hoffman at the 92nd Street Y in Manhttan where the actor was picking up one of his children. Favorite: This is the Chocolate Bar in the West Village where Philip Seymour Hoffman bought his regular espresso coffee on the day before he was found dead . She noticed that Hoffman seemed happy, if a little hyperactive, but saw that 'his skin was not healthy; his skin was in very bad shape.' His physical deterioration became so bad that during his return from filming the final Hunger Games movie in Atlanta on Friday January 31st last week, he was mistaken for a street person. A diner in a downtown restaurant photographed the award winning actor drinking at the bar and making 'multiple', conspicuous trips to the bathroom. Later that evening, Theresa Fehr saw him at Atlanta Airport, visibly intoxicated, being escorted through a security checkpoint by a Transportation Security Administration agent, . 'I just thought it was really odd that this street person was at the airport,' she said to the New York Times. 'He put his shoes on the belt and just threw his belt there. You could tell he was very intoxicated.' Friend: David Bar Katz arriving at . the home of Mimi O'Donnell on Tuesday in Manhattan after Philip Seymour . Hoffman died on Sunday . Struggle: Mimi O'Donnell - Philip Seymour . Hoffman's long time girlfriend and mother of his 3 kids looked visibly . shaken as she left the West Village apartment they once shared on Wednesday . Fehr watched as the man struggled to put his belt back on after screening and watched his belly hanging out of his pants. She turned to the nearest agent and said, 'You know, it’s funny, he looks like that actor that has three names.’ She looks at me and goes, ‘Yeah, it is.’ Hoffman was photographed on the flight back to La Guardia slumped in his seat, unconscious and also was pictured being driven away from the gate in a motorized cart. 'He passed me and my fiancée,' said Andrew Kirell, editor of Mediaite, a blog that covers the media. 'It was remarkable how awful he looked.' However, despite this unedifying public display, Hoffman was up and about on the morning of Saturday, February 1st to order his usual four-shot espresso at his local coffee house. His friend, screenwriter David Katz, contacted him to ask if he wanted to go for steak soon. Hoffman said he did and the two made plans. O'Donnell then met the father of her three children at a playground at around 2pm on Saturday afternoon with their kids and told police following his death that he seemed high. Automatic Slims: This is the West Village bar where Philip Seymour Hoffman was drinking before he went home on the night before he died . Final withdrawal: The D'Agostino's grocery store, located near Philip Seymour Hoffman's west village apartment where Philip Seymour Hoffman allegedly withdrew the cash from this ATM (right) used to purchase the fatal heroin stash before he died . So close: This map shows how near the ATM where Philip Seymour Hoffman withdrew $1,200 to pay his drug dealers is to the West Village apartment he was found dead in . Later on that afternoon at 5pm, Paul Pabst, an executive producer of sports program, the Dan Patrick Show was walking through the West Village with his sister and saw the actor. 'My sister looked at me and said, ‘Wow, he didn’t look good,’ recounted Pabst on the show on Monday. As Hoffman seemingly staggered through the haze of his last day, he went for dinner at 7.30pm at Automatic Slim's, a popular West Village bar with two other friends. Hoffman left well before that and was witnessed at the D'Agostino's a stone's throw away from his apartment withdrawing $1,200 in six different transactions over the course of an hour. The actor was seen with two men who were wearing messenger bags and speculation is rife that they were selling him the drugs that ended his life. There is no surveillance footage of this transaction and the police are still looking for the drug dealers who sold the Oscar winner heroin. When Hoffman didn't arrive to collect his children O'Donnell phoned the actor's friend, David Bar Katz and the Oscar winner's personal assistant, British film maker, Isabella Wing-Davey to check on him. They made the horrifying discovery inside Hoffman's drug den at around 11am on Sunday. When O'Donnell was told that he had been discovered slumped on the bathroom floor she put her kids in her car, rushed to the West Village apartment and left her children in the running vehicle as she dashed inside, shouting, 'I have to see him!'","Philip Seymour Hoffman sent a final text to his friend, David Bar Katz, asking if he would like to come over and watch a basketball game on the night before he was found dead .

Government plans to overhaul legal aid threaten to destroy Britain's 'world renowned' system of fair justice, a former judge warned today. Sir Anthony Hooper, who retired as a Court . of Appeal judge last year, hit out at Ministry of Justice . reforms to cut £220million from the legal aid budget. Under the proposals, organisations would . compete for contracts by offering the lowest price, with companies like . logistics group the Stobart Group among those bidding. But Sir Anthony said this would deny defendants the long-held right to choose their solicitor and instead create a system where the quality of representation on offer would be vastly reduced. Chairman of the Bar Council, Maura McGowan (left), and retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper (right) have criticised plans to cut £220million from the legal aid system . Speaking on BBC4's Today Programme, Sir Anthony said: 'At the moment, solicitors compete on quality. 'In the new system, there will be no competition on quality because they will be randomly allocated. ‘The government says it is . replacing competition with something called Robust Quality Assurance – . which, quite frankly, just sounds like gobbledygook.’ In the case of people with disabilities, this . may result in a lawyer who doesn't have the right expertise for their . particular needs being selected, he told the BBC. Sir Anthony claimed the new system would see who firms of specialist law firms, such as those who help war veterans and the mentally ill, will simply 'disappear off the map'. He told the Law Society Gazette: ‘These proposals by the inaptly named justice secretary are fundamentally flawed and must be rejected in whole.’ He was speaking after the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, has published its response to the reforms. The 150-page response said . price competitive tendering (PCT) promotes the 'lowest possible quality . of service' and will result in further changes to civil legal aid, . hitting society's most vulnerable people. 'Threat to justice': Under the proposals, organisations would compete for contracts by price, with companies such as logistics firm the Stobart Group bidding for work . Other changes will see criminal . defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or . more stopped from automatically accessing legal aid, while prisoners' rights to the support will also would be curbed. Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar . Council, said: 'There is no avoiding the simple fact that these . proposals would move us from having a justice system which is admired . all over the world, to a system where price trumps all. 'PCT . may look as though it achieves short-term savings, but it is a blunt . instrument that will leave deep scars on our justice system for far . longer. 'Further cuts to the scope of . civil legal aid will limit access to justice for some of the most . vulnerable. That is a legacy of which no Government should be proud.' She added: 'The proposals simply do . not have a sufficient evidence base on which to attract support. We . believe that if these proposals are implemented as they stand, the . system will go very badly wrong. Once implemented, these measures cannot . be easily reversed.' Ms . McGowan QC said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling should achieve any . required reforms 'without destroying a world-renowned institution'. The Bar Council response said that the . proposals would destroy the livelihoods of many smaller solicitors' firms and the criminal defence Bar. Standing firm: Justice secretary Chris Grayling says the legal sector cannot be immune from government cuts and costs paid to lawyer should 'reflect this' Criminal legal aid costs taxpayers more than £1 billion every year and the proposals should cut the bill by £220 million. In April, reforms to the Legal Aid, . Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) came into effect, . removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid. Some . law firms estimated the reforms will reduce the number of people who . qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent, meaning around 200,000 fewer . cases, while barristers warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal . aid since the system was introduced in 1949. In its response to the consultation, the Bar Standards Board (BSB), the body responsible for regulating barristers, said plans to pay legal aid lawyers the same amount for a 'guilty' or 'not guilty' plea could lead to defendants being pressurised into pleading guilty. It said cases where the defendant enters an initial guilty plea are typically shorter and so cheaper than trials to assess guilt. Setting the same fee for cases where a defendant pleads guilty and for longer trials may create an incentive for lawyers to encourage clients to plead guilty. Bar Standards Board chair Baroness Ruth Deech said: 'These reforms may endanger the ability of our legal system to guarantee everyone a fair trial. 'While we accept that the current austerity measures are a consequence of the financial climate, protecting the public, and ensuring criminal cases are dealt with fairly and justly, remain of the utmost importance.' Mr Grayling said: 'We have one of the best legal professions in the world. 'But at a time of major financial challenges, the legal sector cannot be excluded from the Government's commitment to getting better value for taxpayers' money. We believe costs paid to lawyers through legal aid should reflect this. 'Professional, qualified lawyers will be available, just as they are now, and contracts will only be awarded to lawyers who meet quality standards set by the profession. 'Wealthy defendants who can afford to pay for their own legal bills should do so. Our proposal is to introduce a threshold on Crown Court legal aid so that people earning around £100,000 a year are no longer automatically granted legal aid. 'We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, with about £1 billion a year spent just on criminal legal aid. 'These changes are about getting the best value for the taxpayer and will not in any way affect someone's right to a fair trial.'","Bar Council says £220m cuts would destroy 'world-renowned' legal system .

Lloyds Bank has pledged that 40 per cent of its top jobs will be occupied by women by the end of the decade. In an unprecedented announcement, the company committed to filling 2,000 of its 5,000 most senior roles with women by 2020. It is the first major company in Britain to set such a gender quota. British firms are under pressure to increase the number of women in senior roles, amid criticism many never reach the top once leaving their careers to have children. Lloyds Bank will become the first to set a gender quota when it commits to filling 2,000 of its 5,000 most senior roles with women by 2020 . Critics say this leaves the upper echelons of corporate Britain a male-dominated world. Currently only four of the FTSE 100 companies have female chief executives. But Lloyds boss António Horta-Osório will tomorrow officially set out plans for a quota inside the company. In a speech at the London Stock Exchange he will say that Lloyds ‘will commit to better represent the diversity of its customer base and its communities at all levels of the group’. Of the 5,000 most senior positions, 40per cent must be filled by women by 2020, he will say. Senior managers, human resources directors and anyone running a group of regional branches will be counted as having a ‘senior’ role. Lloyds boss António Horta-Osório will deliver a speech at the London Stock Exchange outlining the plans . Currently only 28per cent of such jobs are done by women, meaning the bank will have to appoint around 600 women in the next six years - a rate of around two a week. Fiona Cannon, diversity director at the bank, said the target was ‘stretching but achievable’. She added: ‘There is a whole body of research suggesting that where organisations have a diverse senior management team they are much more financially successful than those that do not.’ In the speech Mr Horta-Osório will also announce a package of measures designed to rebuild trust in the bank, which has been hit by a string of scandals including PPI misselling and rigging market lending rates. He will pledge to boost small business lending by £1billion this year and will commit to giving £100million to charities by 2020. The government is trying to increase the number of women in Britain’s boardrooms. It has told FTSE 100 companies to commit to having a quarter of their directors as women by next year, and has appointed former trade minister Lord Davies to oversee the process. Since the initiative was launched, the proportion of women in boardroom positions has risen by 12per cent to 20per cent. The 12-member board of Lloyds Bank has three women sitting on it - although all three of the board’s ‘executive’ positions are occupied by men. Business secretary Vince Cable, who will attend tomorrow’s speech, said: ‘All the evidence we have suggests that companies which do make use of the female labour force do very well at the top end. ‘We need to make sure that becomes standard practice in the UK.’ He added: ‘We are not tapping into the talents of half the population. If we are going to get proper balanced representation in companies, it has got to start with senior executives.’","Company will fill 2,000 of its 5,000 most senior roles with women by 2020 .

A little-known Scottish photographer who became the first person to picture casualties on the battlefields of the Civil War has finally been recognised in a new book. Alexander Gardner, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, risked his life to capture the conflict on film but was robbed of most of the credit by his employer. Gardner emigrated to the United States in 1856 and captured some of the most startling images on the bloody battlefields of Antietam and Gettysburg. But most of his work was attributed to his boss Matthew Brady, who was the manager of a gallery in Washington. Battlefield of Gettysburg: Dead Confederate sharpshooter at foot of Little Round Top taken on July 1863. Alexander Gardner, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, risked his life to capture the American Civil War on film but was robbed of most of the credit by his employer.

As the 150th anniversary of the end of the war draws nearer, a new book giving an incredible account of the pioneer's work is set to finally give him the recognition he deserves. Author Keith Steiner, from Banff, Aberdeenshire, said yesterday (Tue): 'I wanted to right an injustice.

Gardner's pictures have been showcased in a new book . History remembered: The spot were the famous image of Dead Confederate artillery men, as they lay around their battery after the Battle of Antietam, was taken . 'When I was a teenager I found his photographs quite an eye-opener; they had quite an impact on me. Gardner has come under fire for . staging some of his most iconic images for dramatic effect by moving . corpses and weapons for a better picture. One of his most famous photographs, . 'Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter', has been argued to be one such fabrication. Critics, having compared it to other images, claim he moved the body some 40 yards into the more photogenic surroundings of the Devil's Den to create a better composition (see the two pictures below). However, others have argued that  that the manipulation of photographic settings in the early years of photography was not frowned upon and in no way detracts from his achievements as a photographer. Is this the same soldier? 'I retired as a teacher and had an opportunity to explore the sites where he took his photographs. 'They were a sensation at the time and I believe the photographs have relevance in modern times.' Gardner was born in Paisley in 1821 and trained as a jeweller before moving into the world of newspapers. An idealist and socialist, he formed the left-leaning newspaper the Glasgow Sentinel in 1851. His keen interest in photography led to him emigrating across the pond in the hope of furthering his career. He was headhunted by Brady and at the outbreak of the war was well-positioned in Washington. He was recruited as a staff photographer by General George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, and made history on 19 September 1862 when he took the first photographs of casualties on the battlefield at Antietam. In 1863, Gardner split from Brady and formed his own gallery in Washington with his brother James. In July of that year, he photographed the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg, developing images in his travelling darkroom. Retired teacher Keith, 60, said: 'Gardner was essentially a photojournalist. 'He had to process and develop the photographs on the move and in the middle of a battlefield which was not easy. 'He was highly regarded and Walt Whitman once said that he 'saw beyond his camera'. 'I wanted to assert his prominence in the history of photographers. 'He is overlooked and most of my Scottish colleagues have never heard of him. That's a big problem. 'As a Scotsman, he was a pioneer. 'He was an artist, in some ways a scientist and a publisher. He was the complete package.' Gardner was also the official photographer to President Abraham Lincoln. He captured him seven times, including . before his inauguration in March 1861 and in February 1865, just weeks . before he was assassinated. The . war-time leader personally visited Gardner to have his photograph taken . every year instead of the Scotsman visiting the White House. Keith said: 'Most of the photographs you see of Lincoln were taken by Gardner and chart how he aged physically. 'He was pictured in 1861 then a few years later and it is like a different man. 'In February 1865, he is a broken man and has aged about 20 years through the stress of the civil war. 'It is an incredibly revealing photograph.'

The former girlfriend of billionaire George Soros hit the philanthropist in the head and knocked the glasses clean off his lawyer's face during a deposition for her $50 million lawsuit against him, according to papers filed in Manhattan today. Adriana Ferreyr, 30, became irate during Tuesday's hearing, physically attacking Soros and his lawyer Martin Singer and verbally abusing another lawyer, William Zabel, before turning her wrath on her own attorney William Beslow, according to Singer. The Brazilian soap actress is suing 83-year-old Soros for allegedly breaking his promise to buy her a $1.9 million Manhattan apartment. Composed: Adriana Ferreyr leaves the courthouse with her lawyer William Beslow after allegedly causing a scene during George Soros' deposition . Billionaire: Hungarian-born George Soros has five children with two different wives and married his third, Tamika Bolton, last year . The $50 million suit was launched in 2011 after Soros gifted the apartment to his now-wife Tamika Bolton, 42. Papers filed by Singer on Friday say Ferreyr screamed that Soros was a 'f***ing a**hole,' before lunging at him 'suddenly and without warning,' reports Page Six. She struck the octogenarian on the head, knocking off the headphones he was wearing to amplify the audio before she was restrained by Singer, according to the papers. 'I let go of her arms. Ms. Ferreyr immediately swung at my face, knocking off my glasses. She then moved toward my glasses that had landed on the floor as if she were going to jump on them,' Singer alleges. 'I again grabbed her arms and moved her away from my glasses. After I let go of her arms, she resumed swinging at me and attempted to kick me.' Another aide who stepped in to help, Jose Santos, received a slap across the face and a kick in the shins from Ferreyr for his efforts, claims Singer. Flipped: Adriana Ferreyr's alleged outburst today came after she was told she would not be permitted to film her ex-lover George Soros' deposition . Newlyweds: Billionaire investor George Soros pictured with wife Tamiko Bolton who is now the owner of a Manhattan condo Ferreyr claims was promised to her . Ferreyr's outburst occurred after she arrived at the deposition with a cameraman only to be told she was not permitted to film Soros' deposition. According to the New York Daily News, Singer and Ferreyr's attorney Beslow agreed that Soros' deposition would not be filmed, provoking Ferreyr to hit Beslow in the arm and storm out of the room. 'You piece of s***!' she screamed at Soros as he passed her in the hallway, according to the court papers. After Ferreyr tried to film on her mobile phone and proceedings were again interrupted, the lawyers agreed to break for lunch. According to another attorney for Soros, the enraged Brazilian told Soros attorney Zabel, 'You're gonna go down, Zabel. You're gonna go down. You should go to prison and get beat up,' reports the Daily News. Ferreyer and Soros dated for five years up until 2011. One for the team: Beslow and Ferreyr smile after the hearing despite her violent outburst that was directed at Beslow as well as Soros and his lawyers . Ferreyr said she was monogamous during their time together, and was hoping to 'settle down' with Soros, who she said never lavished her with money or gifts during their first few years together. Eventually, however, she said he offered to buy her an apartment. And she found her 'dream home' - a $1.9 million condo at 30 East 85th St - just two streets from him. 'I did a lot of research on it. I made sure it was a good investment. I explained to him what good a deal it was, why I loved it, why it would be a great place to live... He told me, ""I am going to buy it. I am going to do this for you, ""' she said. But Ferreyr claims the day after they signed off on the paperwork, Soros had a change of heart, and offered the apartment to 39-year-old Tamiko Bolton, described as his 'traveling nurse' at the time. Twisted affair: Ferreyr claims she believed herself to be in a monogamous relationship with Soros (pictured with wife Tamiko Bolton), whose lawyer says they were 'on-again, off-again' 'We were in bed, and he just replied coldly and bluntly that he had given (the apartment) to his other girlfriend. I got emotional and cried... He just said, ""I don't care."" I was in bed with him. It was horrifying for me,' Ferreyr said. The soap star has also claimed that Soros slapped her in the face and attempted to choke her as they argued over the property in bed together. She claims their confrontation traumatized her to the point she was ‘unable to function in her day-to-day life’ and that she has since had to have treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Ferreyr is suing for 'intentional infliction of emotional distress.' William Zabel, Soros’s lawyer, called the suit ‘frivolous and entirely without merit’. Although he admitted his client had an ‘on-again, off-again’ relationship with Ferreyr, he said the complaint was ‘riddled with false charges and is obviously an attempt to extract money from my client, who is known to be a very rich man’. Soros and Bolton were married in September last year, in her second and his third marriage.","Adriana Ferreyr physically attacked billionaire George Soros during a deposition in her lawsuit against him .

'I probably shouldn't have attacked another person. I don't mean to attack him. And that was immature. And I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that.

The National Security Agency has broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since Congress granted the agency broad new powers in 2008, The Washington Post reported Thursday. Most of the infractions involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order. They range from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interception of U.S. emails and telephone calls, the Post said, citing an internal audit and other top-secret documents provided it earlier this summer from NSA leaker Edward Snowden, a former systems analyst with the agency. Busted: The National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times since it was granted broad new powers in 2008 . In one of the documents, agency . personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic . language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the . Director of National Intelligence. The Post cited a 2008 example of the interception of a 'large number' of calls placed from Washington when a programming error confused U.S. area code 202 for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt, according to a 'quality assurance' review that was not distributed to the NSA's oversight staff. In what the Post said appeared to be one of the most serious violations, the NSA diverted large volumes of international data passing through fiber-optic cables in the United States into a repository where the material could be stored temporarily for processing and selection. The operation collected and commingled U.S. and foreign emails, the Post said, citing a top-secret internal NSA newsletter. NSA lawyers told the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the agency could not practicably filter out the communications of Americans. In October 2011, months after the program got underway, the court ruled that the collection effort was unconstitutional. The New York Times reported that 1,904 of the incidents appeared to be 'roamers' - foreign nationals whose cell phones were being wiretapped without warrants who then came to the U.S. According to the audit, a sharp increase in such incidents in a single quarter could have resulted from Chinese citizens traveling to the U.S. to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year with family. 'We're a human-run agency operating in a complex environment with a number of different regulatory regimes, so at times we find ourselves on the wrong side of the line,' a senior NSA official said in an interview, speaking to the newspaper with White House permission on the condition of anonymity. He added, 'You can look at it as a percentage of our total activity that occurs each day. You look at a number in absolute terms that looks big, and when you look at it in relative terms, it looks a little different.' The NSA audit obtained by the Post dated May 2012, counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications. Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure. The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders. The Leak: Edward Snowden gave documents outlining the infractions to the Washington Post earlier this summer . The documents included a level of detail and analysis that is not routinely shared with Congress or the special court that oversees surveillance, the paper said. In one of the documents, agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In an emailed statement to The Associated Press late Thursday, John DeLong, NSA's director of compliance, said, 'We want people to report if they have made a mistake or even if they believe that an NSA activity is not consistent with the rules. 'NSA, like other regulated organizations, also has a ""hotline"" for people to report - and no adverse action or reprisal can be taken for the simple act of reporting. 'We take each report seriously, investigate the matter, address the issue, constantly look for trends and address them as well - all as a part of NSA's internal oversight and compliance efforts. What's more, we keep our overseers informed through both immediate reporting and periodic reporting.' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper claimed during a Senate hearing that the NSA doesn't collect information on innocent Americans . President Barack Obama recently pledged to provide more transparency and oversight in the NSA surveillance programs. The issue has divided the U.S. Congress, with some representatives  among them New York Republican Peter King, insisting that data collection is critical to national security, while others criticizing the intelligence agency for going to far in their efforts. Some members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have been trying for some time to get the NSA to give some kind of accounting of how much data it collects ""incidentally"" on Americans through various electronic dragnets. The Obama administration has strongly resisted such disclosures.","The violations range from significant violations of .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:22 EST, 26 January 2012 . A poster released by a South African political party that shows a young interracial couple in a loving embrace has sparked huge debate in the country. The image was released by the student arm of the Democratic Alliance, the nation's opposition party, and distributed around university campuses earlier this week. The image shows a white man and black woman, apparently naked, and has the tagline: 'In OUR future, you wouldn't look twice'. Controversial: This poster released by a South African political party showing an interracial couple embracing has sparked huge debate in the country . But since the poster was released it has sparked fierce debate, with most of the reaction being supportive, but some elements being clearly racist. It has dominated the news agenda and shown that issues that last appeared during the apartheid era have not entirely disappeared from the nation's consciousness. Hundreds of people have taken to social-networking sites to voice their feelings. One Facebook user described the picture as 'an abomination'. Shocking: The African National Congress, of whom Nelson Mandela was a former leader, used clearly racist language in their reaction to the poster . Some of the South African political parties' reactions are perhaps the most shocking however. Most disturbing of all is the comments of the ruling African National Congress - the party once led by Nelson Mandela. They use clearly racist language in their reaction to the poster. Another party, the Christian Democrats, say the poster was 'clearly promoting sexual immorality'. And a trade union also said that the poster implies 'join the party to have an affair'. While the negative reaction has gained the headlines, most has been supportive. Another Facebook user wrote: 'That something so humanly beautiful, an embrace between two people, can cause so much disharmony and conflict . 'We live in such a beautiful country but we are so divided through sheer ignorance!' The political party that released the image sad they were pleased with the strong reaction the poster had created. Mbali Ntuli, the federal chairperson of the Democratic Alliance youth wing told the Globe and Mail Newspaper: 'With all the comments, good and . bad, we have achieved our goal of engaging South Africans in a frank . debate about one of the most defining issues in our country today â€“ . tolerance.

Having a fall and a bump to the head should be a cause for concern, but for one color-blind man the black-and-white fact of the matter is that it was a blessing in disguise – because afterwards he could see ‘the colors of the rainbow’. Richard Riggs, 70, from Yakima in Washington State, was born color-blind, but his sight was transformed after he fell over and hurt his head. Scientists were baffled and the music teacher, unsurprisingly, was delighted. He told Kima TV: ‘As a 70-year-old man I fall quite a lot, as a matter of fact, cause my legs are not strong. I've been color-blind since I was born, and at age 70 I see colors of the rainbow now. ‘Every March we take a trip to Hawaii, I can't wait to get there with my new color sense and watch the flowers... and the bikinis.’ He added: ‘The old-fashioned Walt Disney slogan was “The world is a carousel of color”. I get it now. I'm seeing the world that way.’ Color-blindness affects one in 12 men and one in 200 women, according to Colourblindawareness.org. It’s normally caused by a genetic pigment defect in the eye, so falling shouldn’t be able to cure it. A doctor told Kima TV that he was unable to explain Mr Riggs’ new-found colorful sight, but speculated that he may just be perceiving colors differently.

Adolf Hitler's 1923 racist manifesto Mein Kampf consistently tops lists of bestselling ebooks and a new essay suggests that's become of its similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey. Chris Faraone argues that Hitler's argument outlining a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, which sees little in the way of hardcopy sales, is perfect for the more discrete and disposable world of digital books. Like erotica and romance novels, writes Faraone, readers who would otherwise be embarrassed may anonymously buy a copy of the text and stay under the radar while using an e-reader. Strange parallel: A recent essay suggests that the years-long popularity of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf is akin to the success of erotica and romance ebooks . Taboo subjects: There are many digital English translation versions of Hitler's racist manifesto. One was recently on top of Amazon's best selling Propaganda & Political Psychology. Others versions continuously hover on other Amazon and iTunes bestseller lists . One version of the manifesto tops Amazon's list of most downloaded Propaganda & Political Psychology books. Two others hovered on the iTunes Politics & Current Events list. 'Mein Kampf could be following a similar trend to that of smut and romance novels,' Faraone writes, which may both 'be quietly perused then dropped into a folder or deleted.' The success of 50 Shades of Grey, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. While Mein Kampf isn't as popular as the E. L. James novel, it is much cheaper. While . an iTunes copy of Fifty Shades costs $4.99, a Kindle edition of Mein . Kampf--which translates to My Struggle--can be had for just 99 cents. According . to Faraone, Men Kampf's electronic success has been worldwide and . follows its hardcover popularity in India, where it has sold 100,000 . copies since 2005. In 2005, he writes, a Turkish translation sold that many copies in just two months. Whether . hardcover or ebook edition, Faraone suggests it is curiosity about a . taboo book that is at the core of the books continued sales. While generally derided as the ravings of a genocidal anti-Semite, Mein Kampf retains its appeal for some because of its historical importance. As an ebook, readers are apparently able to inulge their curiosity without having to keep the taboo tome on a shelf or be seen reading it in public .","Writer Chris Faraone argues the racist tome's popularity is akin to that of Fifty Shades of Grey .

It might not be the kind of race that United and Liverpool fans are used to, but the battle for fourth spot and Champions League football could come down to the two great rivals. Everton and Tottenham fans might disagree but, despite their ongoing struggles, sooner or later United will go on a run. Seven points is a big gap, but it’s not insurmountable. Liverpool still have to go to Old Trafford and United can turn it around, particularly when Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney combine. There is absolutely no love lost between the clubs, so it will be a real test of nerve. Whatever happens, it will be a game-changer for either side. Roaring success: With Robin van Persie back in action, Manchester United can reach the Champions League . Talisman: Liverpool can keep Luis Suarez (left) if they secure Champions League football . Playmaker: Juan Mata, battling Stoke's Erik Pieters, could be the difference in United's fight for fourth . Liverpool have been without Champions . League football for three seasons now, so to get back in would be huge. They could attract more players and increase the chances of hanging onto . the likes of Luis Suarez for the long term. For . United, dropping out of Europe’s top competition is almost . unthinkable.  They have been in it since 1995 and the impact would be . massive financially and for keeping their best players.

Zaha touch map v Norwich . It’s a hard job picking the best signing of the transfer window. We have not seen them all play and some will take time to settle, but you would be hard pressed to find a more exciting player than Wilfried Zaha. He has barely featured for Manchester United, but we are not always privy to what happens on the training ground so can’t say why he’s not been playing. But he is a talent that gets bums off seats. He had an instant impact on Saturday, hugging the touchline, as his pitch map (right) shows, and setting up a goal. In 52 minutes he achieved more than in his two games for United and I’m sure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will want to unleash him in the Welsh derby on Saturday Night Football. Wing wonder: Wilfried Zaha showed why he is the most exciting signing of the January transfer window . Only a few months ago I was talking to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and he had his knee in a brace. He won’t have felt further from the World Cup, but against Crystal Palace he was back with a bang. Roy Hodgson will see him as a real option now and the good news is there won’t be any worries about him playing too much football and being fatigued. He’s a nice lad and he’ll be chomping at the bit. And don’t forget he knows what it’s like to score in the Maracana... Beaming: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was back with a bang against Palace, celebrating his second goal . Southampton lost form before Christmas but at Fulham, they were back to their best. In Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez they have two of England’s best young players and they were exceptional. Lallana scored from a tight angle while Rodriguez went one better with a superb curling effort. Don’t be surprised if both end up on the plane to Brazil in the summer. Southampton have won 3/3 Premier League games when Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez have both scored . Charlie Adam never really achieved hero status at Liverpool but, with two goals and a win against United on Saturday, I’m sure he will have had the fans on Merseyside smiling. There was more than a touch of fortune about his first goal, which took a huge deflection to beat David de Gea, but there was nothing lucky about his second — it was an absolute screamer right into the top corner.

Burnley’s young right back Kieran Trippier is one of the best passers I’ve seen in his position while Danny Ings underlined his quality with yet another goal. Kevin Doyle made a good debut for QPR and Joey Barton, the league’s best midfielder, was excellent. Just three points separate the sides, so this promotion race could go to the wire.

The amazing images show the unique transparent prototypes used by Apple's engineers as they worked out how to create the firm's best known machines - and some of its flops. It comes as Apple's Macintosh celebrates its 30th birthday. Scroll down for video . An incredibly rare Apple III machine. It was never made in this format, but this early unit was built especially for Steve Jobs in a transparent briefcase so he could take it to show customers. Apple's first Macintosh was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 24, 1984, two days after the Ridley Scott-directed TV commercial introducing the idea of the Macintosh appeared during the Super Bowl between the Washington Redskins and the Los Angeles Raiders. The first mass-market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse, the first version boasted 128k of memory and sold for $2,495. The brand continues until this day, with Apple's iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro on sale. The amazing prototypes were tracked down by Software engineer Jonathan Zufi, who spent four years on the project, taking 150,000 photos in total, buying 500 products and persuading collectors to give him access to 50-60 prototypes. 'The project started in 2009, when I was reminiscing about an old game, Robot War,' he told MailOnline. 'I went onto eBay to buy it, and then looked for an Apple II to play it on - and thought it would be cool to see them all in the way Apple show them today in their promo photographs.' The Apple IIc, the fourth model in the Apple II series of personal computers, was Apple Computer's first attempt at a portable computer. It went on sale in 1984 for $1295. The finished version of the Apple IIc, which was designed to be easily carried around . Zufi then worked with photographers to learn how to take photographs in an 'Apple' style, before beginning his quest to try and photograph every Apple machine. He said collectors were keen to show off their devices. 'The underlying theme is that these collectors love their treasures and were more than happy to have them documented for the world to see.

The final version of Apple's Newton MessagePad . 'And of course, they contributed to my own personal quest to photograph every product that Apple has ever produced and brought my dream just that little closer to reality . 'All the prototypes were really interesting, the whole transparent design was fascinating,' he said. The products include everything from Apple's first Macintosh machines to the Newton' it's first attempt at a handheld tablet-like device. The device was a failure, but laid the groundwork for Apple to pursue the area, eventually culminating in the iPhone and iPads we know today. Zufi said the prototypes were needed because of the way Steve Jobs worked. 'Apple worked in a different way to most firms, Steve Jobs would say I want it to look like this, so they would built these transparent machines and shove the guts into the design - in most other firms it was the other way round.' 'A very large number of those machines used these prototypes, and they were so engineers could see where every component was. The Macintosh portable, the first battery-powered Mac, was released on September 20, 1989 with a mono screen, and sold for $6,500 . The finished version of the Macintosh Portable, which weighed 16 pounds (7.2 kilograms) and was 4 inches (10 centimetres) thick. The ProFile was the first hard drive produced by Apple Computer in 1983, initially for use with the Apple III personal computer. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB . 'People took them home, many many years ago, and I managed to track them down. They do still leak out, but less and less. This week sees the 30th anniversary of the Macintosh, Apple's most famous computer - and the name which is still in use today in the iMac and MacBook lines. 'The Mac was the machine that brought Apple to the fore, Mac was so compact, such a different experience,' said Zufi. 'The Mac brand has stayed all the way through, and it all stems from the Macintosh.'

'I received an email one day on my website from an ex Apple engineer telling me how much he loved the site. 'He included his phone number so I gave him a call and we got to chatting about his history. 'He started to tell me about a storage locker he has in Sunnyvale that he hadn't opened in 20 years and 'thought he might have some interesting stuff in there'. 'I hopped on a plane and flew out to meet him and it turned into a scene straight out of 'Storage Wars' - I was rummaging through this massively cluttered storage unit pulling out piece by piece and asking him if he understood how much these things were worth - he literally had no idea. 'Daniel Kottke, an early Apple engineer, also has a large prototype collection and he allowed me to visit him in Palo Alto, take all of his machines to my hotel room and photograph for a day, then bring them back. 'He also got hold of a very rare Twiggy Macintosh and allowed me to photograph that - as it turns out that Mac belongs to Gabreal Franklin who is running the 30th anniversary event this weekend (mac30th.com). 'There is another very prolific collector of prototypes over in Portland and this guy has a MASSIVE collection. Each of the devices is a top secret internal prototype that staff were - supposedly - not allowed to take outside the office . 'He recently quit the software business and decided to become a cop - I went to visit him and showed up in my rental car - we both packed all of his gear into my car and then I turned to him and said 'ok let's go' (I had rented a professional photo studio 10 miles from his office) and he said 'no that's ok - I have stuff to do today - I'll see you later'. 'I am certain that I would have had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rare Apple gear and he was happy for me to just drive off with it. 'Finally, there was one item that was being auctioned on eBay (the UniFile drive) and it sold for nearly $5000. 'I contacted the winner who was overseas in Europe and asked if there was anyway I could photograph it before it left the US - he agreed to have the seller ship me the drive, photograph it, then ship it across to the seller.

Jailed: Lawrence Popp, 58, said he was blind and collected fraudulent disability checks . A man who claimed he was blind in order to fraudulently collect $175,000 in disability checks was caught after he was seen driving a speed boat and a snowmobile - and even drove a car to collect the payments. Lawrence Popp, 58, from Greendale, Wisconsin, was sentenced to a year in federal prison on Tuesday for collecting the Social Security benefits and lying on his taxes. The successful businessman claimed in interviews at the disability office that he couldn't work, drive or read without help. Yet videos recorded by agents working for the Social Security Administration and the IRS show him driving to the office, parking a block away and walking inside, before returning and driving off again. Other footage reveals him driving a boat while a water skiier follows behind, the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reported. Popp was declared legally blind in 2004 following an illness, and he started receiving benefits. But alongside the payments, he continued to work at his kitchen equipment business. Popp fraudulently collected $175,000 in . disability payment and $115,000 in Medicare benefits between 2004 and . 2009. He also evaded taxes totaling about $178,000, authorities said. Scroll down for video . High life: Agents uncovered a video of Popp driving a boat (right) with a water skier attached . Well traveled: Popp, believed to be pictured with his daughter, took lavish trips and splashed out on jewelery . He used the benefits to supplement his lavish lifestyle of trips and expensive jewellery for the then-wife Kimberly, who told authorities he bought her a $25,000 diamond and emerald necklace. A video from 2008 shows him at a benefits review at a Social Security Administration office in Milwaukee. It shows him repeatedly saying he could not drive or read small text. 'I loved to work,' he said. 'I thought there was . never anything that would stop me from working. My lifestyle has just changed radically... This [interview] is kind of like reliving it.' But as he left the office, agents filmed him reading his mobile phone and getting inside his car. He drove to a hardware store before driving home via the freeway.

He wore tinted glasses to his sentencing earlier this week and apologized for the fraud. His attorney, Raymond Dall'Osto, told the court his client was guilty but added that the money and taxes would be paid back quickly. He had recommended probation, citing his client's health issues.

Hundreds of Goldman Sachs bankers are expected to be handed a new type of pay deal to prevent their bonuses being cut. The Wall Street giant has drawn up plans that will help it side-step laws designed to curb excessive City payouts. EU rules which came into force on January 1 are supposed to stop the casino-style behaviour that led to the financial crisis. They state that annual bonuses can be no higher than base salary. Ruse: Workers at Goldman Sachs are expected to be handed 'role-based allowances', separate from pay . But bosses at Goldman Sachs have devised a way to get around the rules and let them continue to lavish vast rewards on their staff. As well as their basic pay – which at Goldman is already an average of £367,000 a year – hundreds of top bankers at the firm will receive ‘role-based allowances’. Although details are yet to be confirmed, these could be paid several times a year – possibly monthly – and are likely to be in shares. Giant: The firm's London headquarters . Unlike bonuses, they will not be conditional on performance and will not count towards the calculations of the bonus cap. Goldman joins Barclays and HSBC, which are already planning to hand staff extra shares to get around the Brussels edict. Once the scheme comes into force, the added pay will be back-dated to the start of the year. Goldman employs around 5,000 in London and it is thought hundreds of staff will be included in the new pay scheme. It is understood the plan is yet to be signed off by the regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which could still block it. The Bank of England, which runs the PRA, said it would not discuss individual firms. When the EU was drawing up the rules, critics said it would only lead to banks hiking the pay of their staff. Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff. Barclays and HSBC are already planning to hand out multi-million shares in a bid to avoid the cap. They were accused of ‘concocting elaborate schemes’ to dodge the rules. City workers saw their pay rise by a third last year. The top 2,700 London bankers took home an average £1.6million each, making Britain’s financial elite the highest paid in Europe. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby previously said foreign-owned banks in the City of London were ‘in denial’ about their role in the financial crisis. Luke Hildyard, director at the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Goldman Sachs clearly think they can continue to throw around obscene and unmerited pay packages for their top bankers, while wages for ordinary UK workers remain lower than they were ten years ago. ‘This doesn’t seem to be within the letter or the spirit of the new bonus cap rules.’ Goldman Sachs refused to comment.","EU laws on January 1 were to curb 'casino-style' dealings which led to crash .

A Ukip campaigner who helped to boost the party’s multi-cultural credentials has been revealed as the former leader of a Pakistani kidnapping gang. Mujeeb ur Rehman Bhutto, the party’s  Commonwealth spokesman, organised a visit to a mosque for Ukip leader Nigel Farage and helped canvass in a key by-election in which the party came close to gaining its first MP. But – in the latest embarrassment for the party – the 35-year-old has admitted being the ‘boss’ of a high-profile gang which struck in Karachi in 2004, in a kidnapping that netted him a £56,000 ransom payment. Bhutto admitted charges in a British court the following year and received a seven-year jail sentence. Last night, Ukip tried to distance itself from Bhutto, saying he resigned from the party after being confronted about his criminal history. Bhutto’s past – revealed on BBC Newsnight – comes just a month after David  Silvester, a Ukip councillor in Oxfordshire, provoked ridicule by claiming that this winter’s floods were God’s revenge for the new law allowing gay marriage. And last summer MEP Godfrey Bloom, who represents Yorkshire and The Humber, caused outrage when he said Britain should not be sending overseas aid to ‘bongo bongo land’. Bhutto, from Leeds, told Newsnight he had admitted charges against him rather than risk being sent back to Pakistan and hanged. He said: ‘The evidence which was brought against me was from Pakistan. The allegation was simply because of political rivalry.’ He said he planned to appeal against his conviction for conspiracy to blackmail. He . claimed the case against him in Pakistan had been thrown out by the . country’s Supreme Court. But senior Pakistani police sources told the . BBC that Bhutto is still wanted.

David Cameron yesterday cited the success of fictional television spies as a reason for reviving the controversial ‘snoopers’ charter’. The Prime Minister said he wanted to resurrect plans to allow the police and security services to eavesdrop on the public’s internet and mobile phone use. The contentious legislation was dropped last year amid a storm of protest from civil liberties groups and the Liberal Democrats. But I saw it on TV: The Prime Minister cited fictional spies in his appearance before the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy yesterday, prompting anger from backbench Tory David Davis . Did I just say that? Cameron was defending proposed new powers for spies to search through e-mails . Mr Cameron said: '¿In the most serious crimes [such as] child abduction, communications data... is absolutely vital ¿ who called who and when, and where was the telephone at the time. Not the content, but the data' But in an extraordinary intervention, . Mr Cameron pledged to introduce ‘essential’ new laws after watching TV . shows Spooks, Homeland and US Sherlock Holmes spin-off Elementary. The . award-winning - but fictional - TV crime dramas all portray police and . intelligence officers using communications data to catch villains. Life imitates art: Mr Cameron may have been inspired by Homeland, pictured . He told a parliamentary security committee that monitoring private information was essential to keep citizens safe from terrorist attack and serious criminals. He said: ‘In the most serious crimes [such as] child abduction, communications data... is absolutely vital – who called who and when, and where was the telephone at the time. Not the content, but the  communications data. ‘I love watching crime dramas on the television. There’s hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device.’ ‘We have to explain to people is . that... if we don’t modernise the practice and the law, over time we . will have the communications data to solve these horrible crimes on a . shrinking proportion of the total use of devices and that is a real . problem for keeping people safe. ‘Everybody . raises questions about who has access to my data and why but I’m . absolutely convinced that proper rules for communications data is . essential.’ But Mr Cameron faced ridicule, including from those in his own party. Tory MP David Davis, who has opposed the snoopers’ charter, said: ‘Sadly, you can’t derive policy from watching fictional crime dramas on TV. Policy should be made using hard evidence, strong arguments and proper data, not the exploits of fictional crime fighters.’ Lib Dem chairman Tim Farron said: ‘Serious policies should be based on evidence, and after to listening to experts,  and not based on what you saw on Homeland.’ Information superhighway: Data analysis features heavily in TV shows like Spooks, pictured . And Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said the proposed snoopers’ charter  would have put every citizen under surveillance ‘in a way that the Home Office now acknowledges went too far’. She added: 'These are very complex issues with enormous implications for privacy. Perhaps the Prime Minister should read President Obama’s independent surveillance review rather than relying on television programmes.' During an appearance before MPs and Peers on the Joint National Security Strategy Committee, Mr Cameron acknowledged that reviving the unpopular legislation was ‘contentious’. The new security Bill, which would have forced internet companies to store for a year details of all Britons’ online activity, was blocked last year by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But Mr Cameron believes action is still needed to reflect the fact criminals are increasingly using internet phone calls or social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate. Grilling: Mr Cameron gave evidence yesterday to the committee, chaired by Labour's Margaret Beckett . The police can already tell when, where and who made a mobile phone call or sent a text message. But they cannot always trace the origin of an email, a message sent via instant messaging or a phone call made over the internet. Revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who lifted the lid on the scale of GCHQ’s role with America’s National Security Agency in monitoring electronic communications around the world, have also seen demands for the law drop down the agenda.","'There’s hardly a [TV] crime solved without using... a mobile', PM claimed .

Credit card companies rake in £1.4billion a year by shrinking the minimum amount cardholders have to pay back (library image) Credit card companies are quietly raking in an extra £1.4billion a year by shrinking the minimum amount cardholders have to pay back. Around one in ten borrowers repays only the minimum sum requested every month and each now finds themselves more than £400 worse off each year. Set by the bank and intended to help households manage their debts, minimum repayments are set at a percentage of the outstanding debt plus interest or £5 – whichever is the greater sum. In 2010, the average was 2.15 per cent – today it is just 1.53 per cent, according to TotallyMoney, a credit card comparison website. Based on the UK’s average £1,905 credit card debt, this adjustment costs a borrower an extra £411 in interest a year – and means it will take them two more years to clear their debts. In total, card firms are raking in an estimated extra £1.4billion a year from the 3.3million customers who pay only the minimum. Britons owe more than £55billion on credit cards – nearly three times as much as in 1998. Will Becker, chief executive of TotallyMoney said: ‘Many making the minimum repayment are never going to realise this has happened and are certainly never going to figure out how much it is going to cost them. ‘With lower minimum repayments, getting rid of that credit card debt could be a long and expensive process for borrowers.’ The repayments cover at least the interest on cardholders’ debts, so the outstanding balance will fall each month. But the less customers repay, the longer it takes them to clear their debt, and the more interest the credit card company makes. If a borrower spends £2,000 on a credit card with interest at a typical 18.9 per cent and repays only a minimum 1pc plus interest, it would take 19 years and 10 months to clear what is owed. Britons owe more than £55billion on credit cards - nearly three times as much as in 1998 . The total interest payable would be £2,551 on top of the original £2,000 debt. However, if the same customer repaid 5pc of the outstanding balance each month, they would pay just £287 in interest – and be free of debt in three years and 10 months. David Black, banking specialist at independent analysts Consumer Intelligence, said: ‘This can cause real pain. If you’re only making the minimum payment on your credit card each month, it could take years extra to clear your balance with all the extra interest.’ A spokesman for Moneyfacts consumer group . said: ‘Whilst credit cards allow shoppers to have a bit of breathing . space they will be shocked by the amount of time it will take to pay off . relatively small amounts of purchases. ‘You should always aim to pay over the minimum required to substantially reduce your balance over time.’ Richard Koch, head of card payments at the UK Cards Association, said customers were repaying more debt overall. ‘The average amount that cardholders repay each month has risen over the last two years,’ he said. ‘Cardholders now pay off 21pc of their outstanding bill in a month on average – up from 18pc in 2011.’","One in ten only repay minimum each month and are £400 worse off .

Brittany Murphy's father has sensationally claimed that the tragic ‘Clueless’ actress was poisoned to death by after offering her celebrity backing to a whistleblower fighting the government. Angelo Bertolotti, 87, alleges that at the time of her death his daughter was under surveillance from shadowy government operators who wiretapped her phone and terrorized her after she spoke out in support of a Department of Homeland Security whistleblower. Julia Davis, who claims to have once worked as a stunt double for Angelina Jolie, says Brittany was being persecuted for standing up for her. Scroll down for video . Revenge? Brittany Murphy's father claims that her death - and that of husband Simon Monjack - is linked to her support for a government whistleblower . Suspicions: Brittany's father, Angelo Bertolotti, 87, left, is steadfast in his belief that the actress' support of Julia Davis, left, in her border guard whistleblowing case was behind the mysterious and tragic deaths . Davis claimed she was branded a ‘domestic terrorist’ after she exposed security flaws that were allowing terrorists to sneak into the U.S. while she was working as a border security guard in California. The extraordinary claims are what drove Brittany’s father to campaign to have a separate toxicology test conducted on the star. The new report found rat poison may have caused the shock death - in stark contrast to the official coroner's report that concluded it was natural causes. The latest twist to the growing mystery over the actress’s death came as relatives called on police in Los Angeles to re-open the investigation. ‘I called it two weeks after it happened,’ one family member told MailOnline. ‘You just don’t have two people die like that under those circumstances.’ Officials insist there is no evidence to support a more sinister motive behind 32-year-old Brittany’s sudden death in the bathroom of her Los Angeles home on December 20, 2009. Discover more about Top Priority: The Terror Within . 'Poison': Ms David revealed independent toxicology tests had found that Brittany had ten times the safe WHO levels of some heavy metals in her body - chemicals commonly found in rat poison or bug killer . Her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, 40, died in similar circumstances five months later. The Los Angeles coroner ruled the deaths were due to pneumonia and anemia.  Health officials later reportedly suggested toxic mold in the house could have played a role in the tragedy. But the actress’s father is steadfast in his belief foul play was behind the mysterious deaths and launched a lawsuit last year demanding the release of hair samples from Brittany’s body to carry out the new tests. Although the legal action – which named arsenic as a possible cause of death – was dismissed, the father was given hair, blood and tissue samples to carry out the independent laboratory tests. Scene of the crime? Brittany Murphy died at her home in the Hollywood Hills on December 20, 2009. Her husband followed her in death five months later . In a report for Examiner.com, Ms Davis wrote that scientists at independent Carlson Company laboratories found ten heavy metals in Brittany's system which were several times higher than World Health Organization high levels at the time of her death. 'If we were to eliminate the possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with likely criminal intent,' the report says.

Mr Monjack also exhibited similar symptoms before his death, leading some to believe he too was poisoned. Conspiracy: Davis claims in a YouTube video that her supporters were followed by Blackhawk helicopters, wiretapped, and that Brittany was afraid to go home because of 'sneak-and-peek excursions' on their home . Stormed: Ms Davis posts footage in the YouTube video of her documentary 'Top Priority: Terror Within' of wht she claims is a raid on her home by agents costing taxpayers thousands of dollars . His mother-in-law Sharon discovered his body after moving in with him following her daughter's death. In a recent interview with Los Angeles-based Fleur De Lis Film Studios, Mr Bertolotti said:  ‘They were, in fact, under surveillance, including helicopters. Their telephones were wiretapped, Brittany was afraid to go home, because of the sneak-and-peek incursions into their residence and other terror tactics she suffered after speaking out in support of Julia Davis and being named as a witness in her lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security.’ At the time of her death, early speculation was that the actress died of a drug overdose or anorexia after years of shocking weight loss. Prescription pills were found in the actress' system, but they were treating a cold and respiratory infection. Mr Bertolotti and Ms Davis are writing a book, ‘Britt’ detailing what they really believe happened to the star and a documentary, ‘The Terror Within’, which has not yet been released. Ms Davis claimed that while working at the US border with Mexico she uncovered evidence that dozens of potential terrorists had entered America in shady circumstances that may have involved the bribery of customs officials. Campaign: Mr Bertolotti is writing a book with Ms Davis on the mystery. A family member told MailOnline: 'You just don’t have two people die like that under those circumstances' On a whistleblower website, Ms Davis wrote that family members and witnesses who dared to support her were ‘subjected to land and aerial surveillance, to the tune of millions – at the expense of American taxpayers. ‘This included warrantless aerial surveillance with fixed-wing airplanes and Blackhawk helicopters, vehicular surveillance, OnStar tracking, Internet monitoring, wiretaps, warrantless searches and seizures and series of other outrageous, unwarranted retaliatory measures.’ On the National Whistleblower Center website, Julia Davis said she 'prevailed' in court against the Department of Homeland Security despite a total of 54 'retaliatory' investigations being launched against her in an 'attempt to discredit Julia as an upstanding law enforcement officer and a staunch American patriot.' On the site, she says that when her fears about terrorists being able to slip into the U.S. were ignored by her bosses she went to the FBI, infuriating her bosses. Last year, a trailer for the documentary about the whistleblower case, called 'Top Priority: The Terror Within,' was posted on YouTube. It features photos of Angelo Bertolotti with his daughter and visiting her grave. He also says that Brittany 'was called as a witness in the Julia Davis case.' He added: 'Brittany did tell me she was under surveillance and incidentally so was I.' The video claimed Miss Murphy and her husband were subjected to the same 'terror tactics' as Ms Davis. The video also featured footage of a Blackhawk helicopter raid on Ms Davis's Yucca Valley, California, house. Ms Davis says in her blog that a judge sided with her to rule the 2005 raid on her home was an 'abuse of process.' Write caption here . Miss Murphy was perhaps most famous for her role in 1995's Clueless, but she also had more serious roles in Girl, Interrupted and played Eminem's love interest in 8 Mile - the movie about the rapper's life.

Before marrying Mr Monjack, the actress dated Ashton Kutcher, her co-star in the film Just Married.

A crew member has said Dame Judi Dench needed help reading her scripts on her latest movie Philomena . Dame Judi Dench has been nominated for an Oscar for her latest role despite not being able to read her scripts or recognise faces on set due to her failing eyesight, it has been claimed. The James Bond actress revealed in 2012 that her eyesight was deteriorating and that she suffers from age-related macular degeneration - a painless eye condition that generally leads to the gradual loss of central vision. Now a crew member who worked with the 79-year-old on her latest movie Philomena, which also stars Steve Coogan, has said Dame Judi was 'inspirational' for how she coped with her failing sight. He told The Sun: 'There were many times during filming where her sight was a problem for her recognising faces or objects, and often someone would jump in and help her move about so she didn't lose her footing. 'Judi was totally inspirational. She can't read her own scripts so her friends have to go through them with her or she'll learn them on a tape recorder. 'She was absolutely wonderful because she was totally open about her eye condition and would just ask for help when she needed it or apologise for not recognising someone. 'But she was always line-perfect. 'She may not be able to see her scripts but she delivers lines like no-one else.' In 2012 Dame Judi admitted she could no longer read her scripts and that someone usually helps her. She said: 'It's usually my daughter or my agent or a friend and actually I like that, because I sit there and imagine the story in my mind. ‘I’ve got what my ma had, macular degeneration, which you get when you get old.

However, she said it was a condition experienced by thousands of people all over the world and that it should not be blown out of proportion. In March last year the actress revealed she takes memory supplements because she struggles to remember her lines. Asked on Channel 4 News she said: '‘I don’t know how I retain it. ‘I take that wonderful thing called Eye Q every morning because the Master of Magdalen College [Cambridge] told me about it ages ago and he said “Oh you should take that for your memory, it’s wonderful” and I’ve taken it ever since. ‘It is of course more difficult to remember, to retain something, but it’s really a question of retaining the story. ‘I don’t know how I retain it.

As a teenager in Ireland, Philomena Lee (right) was banished to a convent for the ‘sin’ of having a baby out of wedlock, and forced to give him up. Journalist Martin Sixsmith first heard of Philomena at a New Year's Eve party in 2004 when her daughter Jane approached him for help. She told him her mother had just revealed a shocking secret - that she had a long-lost brother. Philomena had fallen pregnant as a teenager in Ireland in 1952 when such things were considered shameful and had been sent to Sean Ross Abbey, a convent in Roscrea, County Tipperary, to give birth as a ‘fallen woman’. She was forced to spend three years in the convent, slaving in the laundries while also caring for her son, Anthony. But her child was taken from her to be adopted in America – in return for a hefty ‘donation’. Philomena spent the past 50 years searching for him while Anthony was also searching for her. Separately, and ignorant of each other’s quest, they had both visited Sean Ross Abbey. Sixsmith travelled to Ireland, America and eventually to the White House over a period of four years which eventually became the subject of his book, Philomena. The book would go on to inspire the poignant film starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan who plays Martin Sixsmith.","Actress revealed she has age-related macular degeneration in 2012 .

Europe’s billion-star surveyor Gaia is slowly being brought into focus as it begins its mission to create the most accurate map of the Milky Way begins. Launched in December, the satellite has now reached its destination 1.5 million km from Earth. Engineers are currently commissioning Gaia's two telescopes and its three instruments, getting them ready to begin mapping the precise positions and motions of one-thousand-million stars. Scroll down for video . First light: The young star cluster NGC1818 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, taken as part of calibration and testing before the science phase of the Gaia telescope mission begins. Gaia’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1% of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs of data . Its first test image shows a dense cluster of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Once Gaia starts making routine measurements, it will generate truly enormous amounts of data. To maximise the key science of the mission, only small ‘cut-outs’ centred on each of the stars it detects will be sent back to Earth for analysis. This test picture, taken as part of commissioning the mission to ‘fine tune’ the behaviour of the instruments, is one of the first proper ‘images’ to be seen from Gaia, but ironically, it will also be one of the last. Professor Gerry Gilmore, from the University of Cambridge and UK Principal Investigator for Gaia, said: 'Seeing the first magnificent images from Gaia’s UK-built billion pixel camera first of all generates a huge vote of thanks to all those scientists and engineers who have worked so hard to make this happen. 'Second, it provides just a tiny taste of the excellence and challenges ahead, to turn Gaia data into human understanding of the Milky Way's origins. 'One substantial step for astronomy, one huge leap still to come.' Gaia’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. Artist's impression of Gaia, an ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way . It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1% of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. UK participation in the mission is funded by the UK Space Agency and scientists and engineers from around the UK have played key roles in the design and build of Gaia. Dr Chris Castelli, Acting Director of Technology, Science and Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: 'Gaia is an important space mission for the UK; we’ve won around €80 million of contracts from the European Space Agency to build the spacecraft and are providing a state of the art data centre that will turn the mission’s raw data into the largest stellar catalogue ever made.' Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. Liftoff! Soyuz VS06, with Gaia space observatory, lifted off from Europe's Spaceport, French Guiana, on 19 December 2013. To achieve its goal, Gaia will spin slowly, sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing the light from their separate fields simultaneously onto a single digital camera – the largest ever flown in space, with nearly a billion pixels. But first, the telescopes must be aligned and focused, along with precise calibration of the instruments, a painstaking procedure that will take several months before Gaia is ready to enter its five-year operational phase. While all one billion of Gaia’s target stars will have been observed during the first six months of operations, repeated observations over five years will be needed to measure their tiny movements to allow astronomers to determine their distances and motions through space. As a result, Gaia’s final catalogue will not be released until three years after the end of the nominal five-year mission. Intermediate data releases will be made, however, and if rapidly changing objects such as supernovae are detected, alerts will be released within hours of data processing, its operators say. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs of data.","Space telescope will create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way .

North America’s woolly mammoth, giant ground sloths and sabre-tooth tigers were wiped out by a devastating comet 12,900 years ago. This is according to a controversial study by Californian Professor James Kennet which suggests that an ancient cosmic impact triggered a vicious cold snap. Now a research team from University of California, Santa Barbara, claims to have further evidence to back up Professor Kennett's 2007 ‘Younger Dryas impact theory’. Scientists from University of California, Santa Barbara, found nanodiamonds around rock sediment that formed during the Big Freeze 12.900 years ago. In these images nanodiamond textures in the sediment are shown using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope . The Younger Dryas, or the ‘Big Freeze’, saw a rapid return to glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere between 12,900–11,500 years ago. Researchers claim that debris thrown into the atmosphere from an impact may have tipped the Earth into global cooling, wiping out megafauna along with native cultures such as the Clovis people. The theory is partly based on the presence of nanodiamonds along Bull Creek in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which is one type of material that could result from an extra-terrestrial collision. North America's woolly mammoth, giant ground sloths and sabre-tooth tigers are thought to have been wiped out by a devastating comet 12,900 years ago . The research team re-examined the distribution of nanodiamonds in Bull Creek’s geological record to see if they could reproduce the original study’s evidence. ‘We were able to replicate some of their results and we did find nanodiamonds right at the Younger Dryas Boundary,’ said Alexander Simms, an associate professor the University of California. Researchers analysed 49 sediment samples representing different time periods and environmental changes. They identified high levels of nanodiamonds immediately below and just above Younger Dryas deposits and in late-Holocene near-surface deposits. The research team re-examined the distribution of nanodiamonds in Bull Creek's geological record to see if they could reproduce the original study's evidence . The excavation at Bull Creek shows the paleosol - ancient buried soil; the dark black layer in the side of the cliff -- that formed during the Younger Dryas . The late Holocene began at the end of the Pleistocene 11,700 years ago and continues to the present. The researchers believe that the presence of nanodiamonds was not caused by environmental changes, soil formation, cultural activities, or the amount of time in which the landscape was stable. They believe whatever process produced the elevated concentrations of nanodiamonds at the onset of the Younger Dryas sediments may have also been active in recent millennia in Bull Creek. A ‘recent’ meteorite impact did occur near Bull Creek but scientists aren’t sure exactly when. However, they claim this provide compelling evidence that the nanodiamonds were the result of a comet collision. The Younger Dryas comet theory has been criticised for a number of reasons, including suggestions that the human population didn't decline at the time, . Some scientists believe that the Big Freeze was a result of the North American ice sheet breaking apart and flooding the Atlantic Ocean with freshwater. This, they claim, prevented currents taking warmer water north, which caused a colder climate. A separate study last year found further evidence that a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘Clovis’ people of North America. A layer of platinum from an ice core taken in Greenland was dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition, known as the 'Big Freeze' that led to their demise. According to researchers at Harvard University, this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase, making dozens of species extinct. Researcher Michail Petaev and Harvard colleagues, writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found a 100-fold increase in platinum concentration in ice that is around 12,890 years old.","Researchers looked for presence of nanodiamonds in Oklahoma .

Many people take up to four months to lose the weight they put on over the festive season, a new study has revealed . Next time you reach for another chocolate or mince pie, you might want to bear this in mind. Many people take up to four months to lose the weight they put on over the festive season, a new study has revealed. The average person will put on 4lbs between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day after consuming twice their recommended calorie intake. And the bad news is that it can take until Easter to repair the damage. More than a third of those surveyed (34 per cent) said it would it would take four months to get back into the same shape they were in before Christmas. The results were revealed in a survey of 1,000 people for the diet company Forza Supplements which looked at excessive consumption over the Christmas and New Year holiday. The vast majority of people (94 per cent) take a break from their normal eating habits as they relax with friends and family. For 18 per cent of respondents this holiday lasts only from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day - with healthy eating resuming on December 27. However, 44 per cent let themselves go completely through Christmas and New Year and 32 per cent party for more than a month - starting at the beginning of December. Just three per cent said they didn’t over-indulge. Half of those surveyed (52 per cent) admitted to eating twice their recommended calorie intake over the holiday - largely because of the increased alcohol intake. Christmas Day was by far the most fattening day of the festivities. Just under a third of those polled said they completely let themselves go on December 25 and had a ‘complete blow-out’ - with consumption of a staggering 8,530 calories. That is more than triple a man’s daily 2,500 calorie intake and four times a woman’s 2,000 daily limit. Boxing Day was the second most fattening and New Year’s Eve was third.The survey found that just three per cent don’t over-indulge over the entire holiday. For nearly everyone else, it is bad news . with 24 per cent putting on between 1-3lbs, 39 per cent between 3-5lbs . and 21 per cent between 5-7lbs. Five per cent will put on more than half . a stone. Weight gain: More than a third of those surveyed said it would it would take four months to get back into the same shape they were in before Christmas . While it is easy to pile on the pounds, shifting it afterwards is a lot more difficult. New Year diets clearly have a positive effect for some because 31 per cent have lost the extra weight by the end of January. A further 24 per cent take two to three months to get back to normal. But 34 per cent said it would take at least four months to get rid of the flab. Just 11 per cent said they would lose no weight at all or get heavier. Forza Supplements Managing Director Lee Smith said: “We all want to let our hair down at Christmas and enjoy ourselves. “But it can take months to repair the damage if you really let yourself go. 'Easter Sunday is on April 20 next year and a lot of people will still be feeling the effects of Christmas even then.

Abbie Levens, a 32-year-old prison officer who sent explicit photographs of herself to armed robber Sherome Blair . A woman prison guard who sent an explicit video of herself performing a sex act to a male inmate she fell in love with, was jailed for eight months today. Abbie Levens admitted she formed an 'inappropriate relationship' with armed robber Sherome Blair while he was serving a nine-year jail sentence on the wing where she worked. The 32-year-old prison officer became besotted with Blair - telling him she loved him, wanted his children and calling him her husband in phone calls and text messages. She sent him a pornographic video of herself and sexual texts to two mobile phones he had illegally smuggled into prison during an eight-month fling, a sentencing judge heard. Their illicit relationship had continued even after the prisoner was transferred away from High Down jail in Surrey, where he was serving time for his role in a £300,000 diamond heist and was on remand as a suspect in an attempted kidnap case. The pair met in May 2010 after Levens had been transferred to High Down from nearby women’s prison HMP Downview after she became a prosecution witness in a corruption case against a former Downview Governor. She denied she ever had sexual contact with Blair. However, she admitted she did send him a self-filmed pornographic video of herself on June 12, 2011. The video was sent the day before he was transferred to HMP Pentonville in London. Levens carried on communicating with Blair via texts and calls to mobile phones he had smuggled inside prison, even after he had moved from her care. She also burned him music CDs which were posted to him in Pentonville via his mother’s address. Following a tip-off in June 2012, police officers raided Levens’ home in Wallington, Surrey, and seized 'a large number' of love letters Blair had sent to the prison warder. The letters, found stashed in a bedroom wardrobe, appeared to reference fleeting sexual moments the pair had stolen together while she was supposed to be on duty at High Down prison. Levens sent Blair a pornographic video of herself and sexual texts to two mobile phones he had illegally smuggled into prison during an eight-month fling . However, Levens successfully claimed to a judge at Guildford Crown Court that the undated letters were 'purely fantasy' and extracts from an erotic novel the pair were writing to each other while he was inside Pentonville jail in 2011. Blair, 32, of South London, was jailed for nine years in March 2004 for his part in a violent raid on the Ace of Diamonds jewellers in Holborn, London. He and 11 others wearing helmets pulled up outside the shop on high-powered motorbikes, threatened staff with sledgehammers and escaped with a tray of diamonds worth £263,000, which were never recovered. She admitted she did send him a self-filmed pornographic video of herself . Blair was released from prison early in 2008, but recalled on licence in 2009 because he had been placed on remand to face charges of kidnap and attempted robbery. That case was later dropped by prosecutors. He was sent to High Down prison in April 2010 and started his relationship with Levens shortly before being transferred to Pentonville in June 2011. The court heard Levens had been diagnosed with suffering from severe depression and anxiety at the time after she became a key prosecution witness in a corruption case against the former Governor of HMP Downview women’s prison, where she had worked from 2003 to 2010. Her evidence led to Russell Thorne being jailed for five years in July 2011 for having a three-year affair with a woman inmate. Levens claimed that she was 'in a bad place' when Blair made his advances on her, due to death threats she had allegedly received prior to the trial beginning. She told the judge Blair first contacted her in a letter he wrote to her around June 2011. Days later, he made a surprise phone call to her home, saying he knew what she was going through and wanted to help her. Levens admitted she was 'lonely and depressed' and sought solace in the inmate’s interest in her. 'I was obviously going through a bad time. I’m not saying it was right, but at the time I was not in the right state of mind,' she told the judge. She claimed Blair had helped her through her tough times, adding: 'I’m honestly telling you if this had not happened I don’t know if I would even be here.' She later admitted she became besotted with Blair, adding: 'I was in love, your Honour, I’m not going to lie.' However, the relationship fizzled out after he was released from prison in February 2012, the court heard. Levens admitted one count of misconduct in a public office. Her defence barrister, Gerry Mohabir, had asked Judge Peter Moss to suspend her prison sentence for two years in an 'act of mercy' to his client. However, the judge ordered eight months immediate imprisonment. He said: 'You knew the rules. Despite your loneliness and depressed state, you flaunted those rules. You embarked on a relationship and permitted a man facing serious crimes and a long sentence to have access to mobile phones. 'There was a very high degree of infatuation in you sending him that explicit video; in saying you loved him; that you wanted to have his children and calling him your husband.'","Abbie Levens formed an 'inappropriate relationship' with armed robber Sherome Blair .

Builder Paul Lawton spent five years building his dream home – but only five hours demolishing it with a JCB to prevent a former lover winning a bitter money wrangle. Mr Lawton said flattening the imposing six-bedroom house on a remote Scots isle was preferable to seeing his former partner Valerie Keith profit from his hard work. Three-times married Mr Lawton, 66, from Eday, Orkney, took the bizarre revenge after Miss Keith launched legal action to repossess the property and evict him over his failure to repay a six-figure loan after their relationship broke down. From this: Builder Paul Lawton's imposing six-bedroom house as it once stood, on a remote Scots isle . To this: Mr Lawton said flattening the house was preferable to seeing his ex-partner profit from his hard work . The great-grandfather decided to demolish the three-storey home, which has beautiful views over Eday Sound, after his ex refused to allow him time to sell the property for more money in a public auction. When Miss Keith called in lawyers to recover her six-figure investment, a crushed Mr Lawton decided to flatten the house with the digger rather than hand it over. Last night, he said: ‘I built the house to last forever and I had spent five years putting it up and strengthening it. I was upset [knocking it down] but I felt I was losing it anyway and I didn’t like being dictated to in that way. ‘It is sad my dream has ended this way. I wish to God I had never met Valerie. But there’s no point wasting emotion worrying over things that have happened.’ Mr Lawton, originally from Halifax, West Yorkshire, moved to Eday with his then wife, Jackie, in 2001 after falling in love with the island on a holiday. They bought land and a one-bedroom cottage called Castles, complete with private beach. They built another house with six bedrooms – intending to turn it into a family home plus B&B, but their  marriage fell apart before it was finished and Mr Lawton faced losing the property in a divorce settlement. In 2010, he met divorcee Miss Keith on online dating site Match.com and she agreed to loan him her life savings so he could pay off his wife and keep the property. Mr Lawton said: ‘Valerie offered to . lend me the money to pay Jackie off and just speed up the divorce, so we . could sell the house at our own speed. The idea was to sell it and move . on with our new life together, Val and I.’ He . said he borrowed £202,000 from Miss Keith, secured against the . cottage, the house and a small plot of land – together valued at a . conservative £310,000. The . subsequent sale of a hangar-style shed netted £50,000 which he paid to . Miss Keith, cutting his debt, including interest, to £170,000. However, things started to go wrong with their relationship during a holiday to Spain a year ago. Conflict: When Valerie Keith (right) called in lawyers to recover her six-figure investment, a crushed Paul Lawton (right) decided to flatten the house with the digger rather than hand it over . He said: ‘We went to Spain for three months in February because Valerie fancied buying a property and wanted to see what she could get, but we separated while we were there and she came home three weeks early. ‘We talked about our financial agreement and she said she would give me two months to sell the properties and if I couldn’t manage it, they would go to public auction with a reserve of £170,000 for all three properties, enough to cover the remainder of her loan. ‘But three days later, I got an email from her solicitor in Aberdeen saying they were starting repossession proceedings.’ Mr Lawton added: ‘I was upset about . the way things went. It was not done out of rage; possibly hurt pride. That night, I knew I was going to lose the property. 'It is sad my dream has ended this way. I wish to God I had never met Valerie. But there’s no point wasting emotion worrying over things that have happened' Paul Lawton . ‘Valerie . said she had an offer for £170,000 from someone on Orkney looking to . buy all three properties for just the £170,000 she was owed. ‘So . basically, it felt they would all have been laughing at me behind my . back. She had me by the short and curlies and I felt backed into a . corner. ‘The proper way to . have dealt with it would have been to put it to public auction. She . would have got her money and I would have received some money too but . Valerie wouldn’t let me do that. ‘It seemed very unfair. I decided that flattening the house was one way to do something about it.’ It took the former building contractor only five hours to reduce the property to rubble last August. He . went on: ‘I demolished the house at night, starting at midnight and . finishing at five o’clock in the morning. There was no going back from . that. I’ve lost everything. I’m facing bankruptcy shortly. ‘I . had actually emptied the furniture and everything out of the cottage . and was going to demolish the cottage as well, but at the last minute as . I drove the machine up to the front door I thought, ‘No, that’s . completely wrong’. Choice: The great-grandfather decided to demolish the three-storey home, which has beautiful views over Eday Sound, after his ex refused to allow him time to sell the property for more money in a public auction . ‘I didn’t want to ruin Val or take all her savings, I just wanted to let her know she couldn’t do what she was doing without having to pay a price. ‘She would still have the £95,000 that the cottage was worth and the £20,000 from the land and she would have the remains of the house and the two acres of land that comes with it. ‘The infrastructure is still there and all the services are in, so it would be a house you could sell for £50,000. So she would get most of her money back.’ Police were called in but as Mr Lawton was the sole name on the deeds for the property, Miss Keith was informed it was not being treated as a criminal matter. Last night, Miss Keith declined to . comment at her home in Aberdeenshire. A close friend said: ‘She felt . sorry for him. She’s no mug – lawyers got involved and contracts were . drawn up. She thought  nothing could go wrong.’ 'She's no mug – lawyers got involved and contracts were drawn up. She thought nothing could go wrong. Both of them have lost out because of his stupidity' Friend of Valerie Keith . The friend added: ‘He just drove the JCB right through the middle of the house. All the time, money and effort that had gone into it was wrecked out of spite. My friend felt sick when she was told. ‘She doesn’t expect to see a penny from that man. Both of them have lost out because of his stupidity.’ Mr Lawton, who moved into the cottage until November when it was repossessed, now lives in rented accommodation in Kirkwall and uses a caravan stored inside a friend’s hangar when he is on Eday. He thinks he will have to go back to work to supplement his state pension, his only form of income, adding: ‘I’m in a bad financial situation now.’ Reflecting on his demolition job, he said: ‘It is quite extreme and I have never done anything like that before. If she had just stuck to our original agreement, all of this could have been avoided.’ Orkney Islands Council confirmed officials were called out to the  property after concerns were raised that it had been flattened without a warrant for demolition. Roddy Mackay, head of planning at Orkney Islands Council, said: ‘Building standards and planning enforcement officers visited Castles, Eday, last year to follow up on concerns about the site. We are not pursuing further action.’ Police said that they were aware of an ‘ongoing civil matter’ on the island.","Paul Lawton spent five years building dream home in Orkney, Scotland .

A newborn baby died at just eight hours old after her mother was made to wait three-and-a-half hours for a caesarian, an inquest heard. Mary-Jayne Harrison’s baby Jessica died at Southend Hospital, Essex after picking up an infection before her birth. The one specialist in duty ordered a caesarian but was then called to deal with another birth and midwives decided not to call for another specialist because they 'hoped for a good outcome'. Jessica Harrison died after her mother was kept waiting three-and-a-half hours for an unplanned caesarean, an inquest heard . Mary-Jayne Harrison (left) pictured with her husband Simon (right) and their 20-month old daughter Rebecca (centre) Pauline Moore, the midwife in charge of coordinating staff that night, was asked why she didn’t call the extra consultant, during the case at Chelmsford Coroner's Court on Wednesday. Assistant coroner Yvonne Blake asked: 'Women give birth at inconvenient times, you must have called for help at inconvenient times before, why didn’t you call for help on this occasion?' Mrs Moore replied simply: 'Because we hoped for a good outcome.' There was a muted response. The mother went into labour shortly around 9.40pm on September 29 last year. By 3am the pregnancy had not progressed at adequate speed, and Dr Fozia Malik, the specialist registrar, decided to send her for a caesarean. However, he was then sent into theatre to help a woman two rooms away who had been fully dilated for two hours, was not on painkillers and was slightly overweight. By 4am, Ms Harrison was showing signs that she was suffering from an infection and was given antibiotics and paracetamol through a drip. The inquest is being held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court (pictured) and is expected to conclude today . Baby Jessica died at Southend Hospital (pictured) after picking up an infection before her birth . She was not seen again by Dr Malik until about 6am, by which time it was too late to perform a caesarean, and Jessica was born around 6.30am by forceps delivery. Jessica showed signs of inhaling meconium, a baby’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb, and doctors tried to get her breathing on her own. However, they were unable to help her survive longer than eight hours. She had no other underlying health issues. Dr Malik and two midwives told the inquest that with hindsight they would have acted differently, but said Mrs Harrison didn’t appear to be an emergency case and that the other birth took longer than expected. Mrs Harrison, questioning Dr Malik, said: 'Three-and-a-half hours, I think that’s too long, so much could be done in that time.' The doctor replied: 'I wouldn’t have planned three-and-a-hours hours but there was an emergency, I was tied up elsewhere.” The inquest also heard evidence suggesting that a speedier delivery may not have helped Jessica. Pathologist Michael Ashworth said: 'The infection must have been picked up from the umbilical chord in the womb, so it was before birth, but I am unable to say if it was hours, days or whatever period.” The inquest is expected to conclude today.","Jessica was just eight hours old when she died at Southend Hospital .

If you live in the American Midwest or East Coast, you may want to hold off on putting away your winter gear. Just as temperatures are beginning to warm in much of the U.S, another arctic blast in the form of a polar vortex appears to be on the horizon. The upcoming front of icy temperatures is expected to bring arctic air to southern Canada and then move into the northern plains of the U.S. before moving to the Midwest and East Coast - each of which is still recovering from last week's frigid temperatures. Blocked: Ice piles up on the Delaware river near Trenton, New Jersey, on Saturday, causing flooding . Jim Kuciel takes photos of the frozen Delaware on Saturday, where the build up of ice is causing a flood risk . Mist rises from the Delaware as chunks of ice ride up near Trenton, New Jersey at the weekend . Many areas are still recovering from the extreme weather last week, which has caused a dam of ice to block the Delaware river in New Jersey, forcing roads to close and causing a severe flood risk. A Coast Guard ice cutter has been called in to try to clear shipping lanes but after 2 and half miles the 2ft ice had become to thick to break up. Chunks of ice have been building up for days near the Trenton Makes Bridge, ABC News reported. But with the sudden warm temperatures, it is feared a fast thaw will flood low-lying areas. 'If in fact the ice jam breaks then we'll have a rush of water which could cause flash flooding,' Qareeb Bashir, of Trenton Emergency Management, said. Flash flood warnings are in place in several of the regions affected by the polar vortex, as rain falling on the already frozen ground is forced to run off. Nearly all of Pennsylvania is under a flood warning after the sudden rise in temperatures caused a faster than usual thaw. A chaotic scene of ice chunks could be seen stretching across the state's Susquehanna river near Harrisburg on Saturday morning. But the thaw is likely to be halted by the new cold front coming in, even though it is not expected to be as severe as the one last week.

'Following the retreat of arctic air . this weekend, waves of progressively colder will move southward over . Canada next week,' AccuWeather.com Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul . Pastelok told AOL.com. Forecasters . expect the first stage of the new arctic blast to hit the northern . plains by Monday, the lower Mississippi Valley and Midwest Tuesday and . Wednesday then the East from Thursday. Like the last bout of icy air, this one is the result of a portion of the polar vortex breaking away from the Arctic Circle. 'We will likely see a piece of the polar vortex break off and set up just north of the Great Lakes spanning Jan. 16 to 20,' Mr Pastelok said. 'This next main arctic blast will not rival, nor will be as extensive as the event this past week,' he continued. Unlike the last push of cold air, weather experts expect temperatures to stay above zero in most locations in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest. Weather maps for the middle of next week show the polar vortex creeping back across the U.S. The polar vortex last week was so cold that Niagara Falls froze in an incredibly rare occurrence . North Central states and states in the interior Northeast, however, are expected to see temperatures at or below zero. Additionally, anyone near the Great Lakes should also expect lake-effect snow.

Apple's latest iPhones: The firm is believed to be preparing to release two new large-screen phones in June . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the . record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, . at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. According to MacRumours, the new filter will replace the hybrid IR filter used on the iPhone 5s with a resin lens filter manufactured by Japanese company JSR. Recent rumours also claim there will be two models, one with a 4.7inch screen, and one with a 5.7inch screen. Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which could be the smaller handset. The two new handsets are expected to be revealed at Apple's annual annual developer conference, held in San Francisco in June. It is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements. Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis. This concept, by Italian-based firm SET Solution, predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom, in order to retain the home button . If announced, the handsets are expected to go on sale within weeks. Chinese analyst Sun Changxu told Chinese-language website QQ Tech that Apple will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes. According to Sun, the iPhone 6 will come with a 4.7-inch screen, with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels. The company would then launch a larger 5.7-inch model shortly afterwards. Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. By comparison, Apple's current iPhone 5S, pictured, has a depth of 7.6mm. This makes it 1.7mm thinner than the iPhone 4S and 1.37mm thinner than the iPhone 5C . Two concept images have emerged that show Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the 'iPhone Air' - will be 4.5mm thick, while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom.

In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken’s concept suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. [embed . In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken's concept - dubbed iPhone Air - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls . Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, pictured, which was 20% thinner than previous models . SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices.

A Chinese military official has blamed the US government for the new strain of bird flu affecting China, calling it a secret biological attack. People's Liberation Army Senior Colonel Dai Xu said America released the H7N0 bird flu virus into China, in an act of biological warfare, in a blog on Saturday. Writing on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site similar to Twitter, Dai alleged the new bird flu strain had been designed as a weapon, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), that affected the country in 2003 and which he claims was also developed as a US bio-weapon. Workers from the local centre for disease control and prevention take part in a drill in Hefei city, Anhui province. A Chinese officer has accused the US of creating the latest bird flu virus strain . Workers from the local center for disease control and prevention collect samples from participants during a drill in Hefei city, Anhui province . The US has dismissed the claims. State Department spokesman Jason Rebholz told the Washington Free Beacon: 'There is absolutely no truth to these allegations.' Dai's post suggests the new outbreak of bird flu should not be a cause for concern. He wrote: 'The national leadership should not pay too much attention to it, or else it'll be like in 2003 with SARS! 'At that time, America was fighting in Iraq and feared that China would take advantage of the opportunity to take other actions. This is why they used bio-psychological weapons against China.' He said the country fell into turmoil, which he claimed is what the US had wanted, and now they were using the 'same old trick'. Nine people have died from the 33 confirmed cases of the virus, all in eastern China, according to data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. State media quoted authorities as saying a vaccine should be ready within months. The US has dismissed the claims by the Chinese Air Force officer.

The paper reported that the accusation inflamed widespread responses on Chinese websites, while Luo Changping, deputy editor of Caijing, said most soldiers in the People's Liberation Army would not support Dai's comments. Chinese police have detained at least 10 people for spreading rumours about the H7N9 bird flu as the death toll from the new strain of the virus continued to rise.","Senior Colonel Dai Xu says US released virus in act of biological warfare .

Adopting a raw food diet has helped one woman shed nine stone and cured her of a crippling medical condition. Stephanie Jeffs, 43, from Hertford, used a raw juice diet to cure her polycystic ovaries, and help her lose 126lbs in weight. The former city worker adopted the diet as a way to cleanse out her overworked body after a lifestyle of drinks parties, late nights and high stress left her overweight and run down. But she never expected her change in eating to have such a transformative effect on her life. Stephanie Jeffs, pictured before she lost weight, used to eat a rich dairy-filled diet and her lifestyle included lots of nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising . Stephanie has lost nine stone since embarking on her raw food diet and has also been relieved of her polycystic ovary symptoms . Stephanie thought she ate reasonably healthily as she ate a pescatarian diet . A recent trip to the doctors informed her she has dropped from 22 stone 7lbs to 13 stone 7lbs, slim for her 5ft 9in height. In fact Stephanie was so inspired she quit her high flying job and set up her own company Explore Raw, which advocates the advantages of the no-meat, no-dairy and no foods heated over 38-43°C diet. While her diet today may sound extreme, Stephanie was once a very normal, career-driven young woman, who, while she made attempts to keep healthy, was ultimately worn out. ‘I was not always raw – and far from it! In my late twenties career success became my prime focus and hand in hand with that came the absence of looking after myself. ‘I piled on the weight. I did no exercise. I had never been an exerciser! I had PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) which is a chronic disease. I was overworked, undernourished and toxic.‘I had been a vegetarian (well a pescatarian really) since the age of 20 so considered myself pretty healthy as I wasn’t eating meat but the truth be told I was eating anything that wasn’t meat. ‘I had a rich dairy-filled diet that included lots of boozy nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising. Stephanie says her lifestyle had left her feeling toxic and her weight had gotten out of control . ‘By my early 30s my weight was out of control – I was still focusing so much on my career I didn’t really focus on anything else. I had lost sight of me.’ Like many women, Stephanie had an ongoing nagging sense she should be taking care of herself more. ‘Towards my mid 30s I realised that I had to take action and began experimenting with going to the gym. I had no idea what I was doing. ‘I was instinctively focusing on cleansing my body - again, I had no guidance really and was feeling a bit lost - so began to have colonics and rein the booze in a little. Stephanie was given her first book on raw eating as a birthday present and says she lost 10lbs in her first week of juicing . She says she now looks and feels much younger than she has for years . ‘Over the years a few meaty dishes had crept into my diet and so I focused again on my vegetarian roots. It was working and slowly I began to lose a few pounds.’ Each day I try to consume: . However it was another few years before Stephanie began to discover the concept of ‘eating raw’ which essentially involves eating a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables which are never cooked above about 40 degrees C in order to preserve their enzymes. Stephanie says: ‘It was on my 38th birthday that things took a turn. A friend of mine gave me a book as a gift.  It was Jason Vales 7lbs in 7days and I was immediately insulted! ‘Are you trying to say that I am fat..!?’ I thought. 'Once I had gotten over it I worked my way through that book and dabbled in a few juices. Eventually I made it to a raw retreat in Turkey and suddenly I was hooked. ‘I lost more than 10lbs in a week! It was an unbelievable wake up call for me that even though I had PCOS I could lose weight, even though I had previously been told there is ‘no cure’ and that it would be incredibly difficult to lose weight without medication.’ ‘As the weight falls off the more capacity the body has to heal. It’s a wonderful cycle.’ Stephanie now eats what she describes as a high plant-based high raw diet. ‘I carry my juicer everywhere. I lug it across London in a cool bag if I’m on the move. Wherever I go my juicer goes.’ ‘I have so much to be thankful for. I have cured myself from polycystic ovaries and a wonderful side effect has also been that I have lost lots of my weight. Which is blissful! ‘My skin is glowing and I look and feel much younger than I have for years. Looking back at old photos I hardly recognise myself.’ Around 7am/on rising – ginger tea: hot water with lemon, raw fresh ginger and sometimes some raw honey I drink as much ginger tea as I fancy throughout the day. Around 8am - Breakfast – green juice -  2 golden delicious apples 1 cucumber 1 peeled lemon 1 peeled lime  blended with two or three large fistfuls of greens (spinach or kale etc.). If I am not in the mood for a juice (which is rare!) I might have some chia pudding – which is chia seeds soaked in home made almond milk and served with honey and fruit. Throughout the morning – green waters – water with a teaspoon of ‘green powder blend’ such as wheatgrass, spirulina, chlorella and barleygrass. Around 11am/Mid morning snack – if needed – stuffed dates: organic medjool dates stuffed with wet activated almonds (soaked in water overnight so they are softer, more easily digestible, enzyme rich and tastier). Around 1pm/ Lunch- Salad for example: 10oz or large bag of kale, Juice 1 lime 1 tsp. Himalayan pink salt, 1 tbsp. virgin olive oil, 1 tsp. linseeds, 1 tsp. sesame seeds, 1 pinch pine nuts.  ‘Make love to the Kale! – using a large bowl massage the kale with the lime juice, salt and olive oil until the kale is soft and wilted but not too limp. Remove any final stalks or tough bits as you feel them. Mix in the linseed, sesame seeds and a big pinch of pine nuts. The portion for this dish is one cup per person. But I tend to eat as much as I feel I need. Served with blueberries and perhaps a toasted pitta bread (not raw!). Around 3pm /Afternoon snack – if needed some organic fruit or vegetables, bananas, apples, oranges, carrots, cucumbers... Around 6pm/ Supper- for example: Raw Curry – recipe serves 4: 1 cup soaked cashews (soak in filtered or pure water for at least two hours) 2 cups or more of filtered water, ½ chopped red onion, 6 organic cherry tomatoes, 10 sundried tomatoes (soaked or if from a jar then washed) juice of half a lime, ½ cup desiccated coconut, 1 ripe avocado, 1 inch ginger peeled and grated 1½ tsp. cumin, 1 or 2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. garam masala 2 clove organic garlic. Basically blend until a smooth paste is formed and serve! Sometimes I might let it sit in a bowl in the oven with the door open on low if I don’t fancy eating it at room temperature. Served with salad or rice. (you can serve with cooked rice or make ‘raw rice’ by putting half a cauliflower in the food processor – chop finely so it resembles rice and add a handful or pine or other nuts).","Stressful job meant Stephanie often worked late and drank with colleagues .

The survivors of Typhoon Haiyan are in desperate need of food and water and a huge relief effort is under way – but a shocking claim has emerged from an aid worker in the Philippines that government officials are prioritising aid based on who they think will vote for them. The worker told MailOnline that the system there is so corrupt that he feared he would ‘vanish’ if he was identified. He said: ‘Relief is not being distributed fairly in the Philippines. The government is prioritising the areas that vote for them. This is happening with all the large aid. The government is holding funds back and distributing on vote.’ However, a spokesman for the Disaster Emergency . Committee said: ‘The DEC has had no reports from our member agencies . that aid is being prioritised by the Philippines government on the basis . of potential political support. ‘The . DEC charities will fight tooth and nail to make sure aid goes to . survivors according to their need alone, without regard for irrelevant . factors such as people’s political views, religion or race.’ Shocking: An aid worker has claimed that the Philippine government is distributing aid based on voting patterns. Pictured is the devastated Leyte province . Horrifying: The worker explained that this issue with distribution wasn't just happening on a national level – but at a village level, too. Pictured is the ravaged city of Tacloban . The claim makes for horrifying reading as pictures of survivors desperately pleading for food and water are beamed around the world. The worker explained that this issue with distribution wasn’t just happening on a national level – but at a village level, too. He said: ‘It is being reported to us by the locals in one village that the head of the Baranguays [villages] gave additional vouchers for relief packs to families they favoured. So by the end of the relief, even though we had given exactly the right number of packs for the number of families in the village, several went without. ‘They were all telling us that it was done by favouritism.’ The worker was distressed that ‘only Leyte and Tacloban are getting the international coverage’ and that the plight of those in other, more remote, areas of the Philippines was being made worse because ‘no one even knows about them’. Powerful: A computer-generated image of super typhoon Haiyan making landfall over the Philippines on November 7 . Desperate: The words 'SOS, Food, H20, Help!!!' are painted on the roof of a house as seen from a Philippine Air force helicopter in the super typhoon devastated Leyte Province . He added: ‘I don’t want to upset people over here it’s very corrupt and I don’t want to vanish.’ The Philippine government, meanwhile, has defended its efforts to deliver assistance to victims of the typhoon. ‘In a situation like this, nothing is fast enough,’ Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said in Tacloban, most of which was destroyed by the storm one week ago. ‘The need is massive, the need is immediate, and you can't reach everyone.’ The number of confirmed dead jumped more than 1,200 to 3,621, Eduardo del Rosario, executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said on Friday. Help arrives: Philippine Army rescue teams clear the road to a hospital in Leyte . Neutralising: A Filipino officer dispenses mosquito poison at a damaged residential area in Tacloban . Survival measures: A man sells pigs in Tacloban city . Make-shift: Survivors carry metal sheets they've collected and head back to their destroyed village of Marabut . Some officials estimate that the final toll, when the missing are declared dead and remote regions reached, will be more than 10,000. At least 600,000 people have been displaced. The pace of the aid effort has picked up over the last 24 hours, according to reporters who have been in the region for several days. Foreign governments are dispatching food, water, medical supplies and trained staff to the region. Trucks and generators are also arriving. But many people complain that the amount of food being given out is too small. Renee Patron, 33, an American citizen of . Filipino descent who was in Guiuan city on eastern Samar province when . the typhoon struck, told the Associated Press news agency: 'The government's distribution system is not enough. 'They are handing out small food packets to each household. But when you have three families inside one home, one little packet is not enough.' Her friend, Susan Tan, whose grocery store and warehouse were completely looted after the typhoon, is despondent but determined to carry on with her life and help others. A Landrover is loaded into the hold of a Royal Air Force C17 at RAF Brize Norton preparing to carry UK Aid for victims of the Phillipines typhoon.

On its way: The C-17 aircraft, operated by No 99 Squadron, takes off . She's now using her empty warehouse as a center from where people can make calls on a satellite phone she got from a friend who works for local telecoms company Smart. There has been no cell phone service in the town since last Friday. 'This was my store. Now's it's a relief center and a call center,' said Tan, 43. 'It was ransacked by panicked... people desperate for food. There was no way to control them. We had stocked up on food for the Christmas holidays. They took everything, and not just the food. They ransacked my office too, anything they could find. They took away our furniture.' Now, the barren blue shelves are empty. Still, it is serving a purpose, with about 100 people queued up outside waiting to make calls. The free calls are limited to one minute each. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told The Associated Press that armed forces have set up communications lines and C-130 transport planes are conducting regular flights to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte. While the navies of the United States and its allies rushed to the aid of the typhoon-hit Philippines, a state-of-the-art Chinese hospital ship has stayed at home and in doing so has become a symbol of China's tepid response to the crisis. Generous: America and its allies have rushed to the aid of the Philippines.

The decision not to deploy the 14,000-tonne Peace Ark, one of the newest and biggest hospital ships in the world, is one that contrasts with a recent charm offensive across Southeast Asia by China as it seeks to bolster ties and ease tension over the disputed South China Sea. Even China's usually hawkish Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People's Daily state mouthpiece, on Friday called for the Ark to sail to the Philippines, where an international naval flotilla, headed by a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group, is delivering food, water and medicine. Initially, China pledged $100,000 in aid to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan roared across central islands a week ago, and a further $100,000 through the Chinese Red Cross - figures dwarfed by multi-million dollar donations from countries and corporations around the world.

Sheila Jones has had a total of 286 tattoos inked all over her body, starting at just 15 years old . Sheila's obsession started as a schoolgirl experiment with a sewing needle and pot of Indian ink. Sheila, then 15, had a crush on a boy and decided to get her friend to ink his name on her arm . Shelia has a large koi fish on her thigh, birth sign Aquarius, butterflies and eyes on her back along with Jesus on the cross and eyes on each knee . They included roses on each forearm and left leg, a Celtic-style band on her left upper arm and crosses on both her arms.

It is known that having an epidural increases the time it takes for a woman to deliver her baby. But new research suggests it may prolong the birth for longer than originally believed. U.S. researchers found some women who are given an epidural during labour take more than two hours longer to deliver their child than women who don’t get the pain relief. Having an epidural can increase the amount of time it takes a woman to push out her baby by up to two hours . ‘The effect of epidural can be longer than we think and as long as the baby looks good and the women are making progress, we don't necessarily have to intervene [and perform a Caesarean section] based on the passage of time,’ lead author Dr Yvonne Cheng, from the University of California, San Francisco, said. Dr Cheng, who reported her findings in the journal Obstetrics and Gynaecology, says doctors were traditionally taught that women who receive an epidural will take about an hour extra to push their baby out. This is because they are unable to feel when they have a contraction and find it hard to feel if they are pushing effectively due to the numbness the epidural causes. For her research, she compared data from more than 42,000 women who delivered their children in San Francisco between 1976 and 2008. About half of these women received an epidural while the other half did not. Dr Cheng and her colleagues discovered that 95 per cent of women who were having their first child got through the pushing stage within three hours and 20 minutes if they had not had an epidural. In contrast, for those who had had an epidural, it was five hours and 40 minutes before 95 per cent of women had delivered their babies. Some 95 per cent of women having their first child get through the pushing stage within three hours and 20 minutes if they have not had an epidural. For those who have an epidural, it can take five hours 40 minutes . For women who had previously had a child, 95 per cent without an epidural had delivered their baby within hour and 20 minutes of beginning to push. For those who had had an epidural, the figure was four hours and 15 minutes. Overall, the researchers found the second stage of labour took about two hours longer when women had an epidural. For women who have a more typical, quicker, delivery the epidural probably adds less time, Dr Karin Fox, from the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital, told Reuters Health. Dr Christopher Glantz, a high-risk pregnancy specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Centre in New York, cautioned that although the health of babies in the epidural and non-epidural groups was similar, mothers tended to have more complications if they had longer labours. ‘It would appear that the upper limit of what can be tolerated is greater than what was previously thought, which takes away some of the impetus to intervene (with C-section) in what appears to be a premature fashion,’ he said. In the UK, a woman who is having her first baby is expected to give birth within three hours of the start of the second stage of labour. As a result, if birth is not imminent after two hours, doctors will consider intervening. If a woman has previously had a baby, she is expected to give birth within two hours so intervention is considered after an hour.","It was already known that the second stage of labour can take longer after an epidural - but new research suggests it extends it even further .
Without an epidural, most first time mothers deliver within 3 hours 20 mins .
With an epidural, it can take up to 5 hours 40 minutes, say researchers .
In the UK, this stage of labour is not allowed continue for more than three hours - so doctors start to consider intervening after two hours ."

Woody Allen has yet to respond to resurfaced allegations he molested his adopted daughter Dylan when she was 7-years-old, but he has spoken out on the issue before. In 1992 Allen gave a rare interview with 60 minutes, describing the allegations as calculated revenge by former-partner Mia Farrow for falling in love with her then 21-year-old daughter Soon-Yi Previn. While the two were in the midst of a bitter custody battle, Allen says Farrow threatened his life on several occasions, and even sent him a voodoo Valentine. Scroll down for video . Reaction: Filmmaker Woody Allen previously defended himself against claims he molested his adopted daughter Dylan in a 1992 interview with 60 minutes . Scary: Allen shared a picture of a voodoo Valentine Farrow sent him after their breakup, with pins stuck through all her children and a steak knife stabbing her image . She did it: Allen said he believed Farrow coached Dylan into implicating him for molestation (Dylan pictured with blonde curls, at bottom) Just weeks before the molestation claims, the two got into a fight over the phone and Allen recalls Farrow saying: 'I have something very nasty planned for you'. On another occasion, Farrow said: 'You took my daughter, and I'm gonna take yours.' In addition to the verbal threats, Farrow hand-delivered a Valentine to Allen. When he opened it up is showed a family picture with Farrow and her children with needles sticking through each of the children, and a steak knife through Farrow. Then in August 1992, after visiting his children at Farrow's country home in Connecticut, his ex accused him of taking Dylan into a room and molesting her. Allen and Farrow were partners for nearly 12 . years before breaking up when he fell in love with her 21-year-old . adopted daughter Soon-Yi. From left to right, Dylan, Allen, Farrow and . their only biological son Ronan (born Satchel) - though Farrow recently said Ronan could be the son of her ex, Frank Sinatra . In his 60 Minutes interview, Allen claimed that there was no basis for the allegations - not even an innocent incident that exaggerated. 'There is no possibility that anything remotely ever happened to Dylan,' he said. Allen said he believed Farrow coached Dylan to implicate him. Allen's then-girlfriend and current wife Soon-Yi believed Farrow did it out of spite. 'Soon-Yi believes that [Mia] does not believe it. Soon-Yi thinks it's absolutely in character that she has made it up quite calculatingly.' Warning: When Allen attended Dylan's birthday party, he says Farrow put up this handwritten sign on the door . Allen was never formally charged with sexual assault, though Connecticut state's attorney Frank S Maco said he found 'probable cause' to prosecute Allen. However, Maco decided not to peruse the case because he felt Dylan was too 'fragile' to go through the trial process and Farrow agreed. The allegations resurfaced last month when Allen was awarded the Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes. During the ceremony, estranged son Ronan Farrow tweeted: 'Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?' That started a media firestorm that eventually resulted in Dylan writing about the abuse for the first time this weekend in a New York Times open letter. Coming forward: Dylan Farrow spoke out for the first time about the alleged abuse in a letter to the New York Times last weekend . She described the incident, saying Allen led her to the home's attic and told her to lay on her stomach and play with her brother's toy train set. 'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I'd be a star in his movies.' Critic: Dylan's adopted brother Moses Farrow spoke to People this week, saying he doesn't believe the molestation ever happened . Some have criticized Dylan for attacking her father again, saying it may have been a calculated move to damage his award-season chances for film Blue Jasmine. Her own adopted brother Moses Farrow is one of those critics, telling People magazine he doesn't believe the molestation ever happened and that his mother turned the whole family against Allen after their split. 'My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister,' he said. Shortly after hearing her brother's statement, People reached out to Dylan to get a response, and she was clearly emotional. 'I'm sorry,' she apologized. 'I'm shaking right now.' 'My brother is dead to me,' she said. Yesterday, the New York Times announced that Allen had reached out to them asking for the opportunity to respond to Dylan's letter. The Times agreed, and the response could be published within days.","Allegations that Woody Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan when she was 7-years-old resurfaced last month .

Penny Palmer, from Manchester, says the Re-Timer frames- which resemble goggles - have relieved her insomnia so much that she ‘no longer feels like a zombie’. The glasses, which look like a pair of white frames without lenses, have small green LED lights at the bottom. Penny Palmer, 29, suffered from severe insomnia which meant she always felt tired and emotional. Now, she is now able to get a good night's sleep thanks to using Re-Timer sleep glasses . These shine into the wearer’s eyes and are designed to help regulate their sleep patterns. Ms Palmer, an events manager, said: ‘I'm not exaggerating when I say that it really has changed my life so much for the better. ‘I don't feel like a zombie anymore and I don't get as tired or emotional. I have greater patience with people and more energy to get involved with things. ‘The glasses do look a little wacky when you first see them, however, I do think that people should give them a try. ‘They are the only thing that has worked for me, and in a funny way they worked without me even realising it.’ Ms Palmer says insomnia was always her biggest health problem and that she suffered from it since she was a child. The glasses work by shining LED lights into the eyes to mimic natural light. This helps to reset the body clock . She struggled to get to sleep and was usually unable to sleep for more than two or three hours at a time before waking up again. As a result, she was constantly exhausted and the problem made her feel frustrated and angry. She said:  ‘At school, I would always fall asleep in lessons, and was always in trouble with the teacher who didn't understand how bad my insomnia was. The Re-Timer sleep glasses work on . the principle that the body has a natural sleep-wake cycle which is . governed by the body clock. This, in turn, is governed by light exposure. When the body clock is working correctly, people are able to fall asleep and wake up at the right times. However, if the body clock becomes out of sync, sleeping problems can develop. This . is particularly common in the winter and in people who work shifts . because the body clock is controlled by the natural cycle of light and . dark and this can be disrupted by not receiving light at the right . times. The Re-Timer . glasses, which were developed by researchers at Flinders University, in . Australia, emit a green light which helps to reset the body clock by . mimicking natural light. They are said to be able to help with jetlag, sleep problems associated with working shifts, winter blues, falling asleep too early and struggling to get to sleep. ‘It affected my health in other ways too - being tired made me feel run down and I was always getting viruses and infections. ‘Also, being tired often made me feel very emotional - sad, angry, frustrated. ‘If you caught me on a bad day when I hadn't slept the night before, I could just as easily bite people's heads off as burst into tears.’ She added: ‘I am quite an energetic person usually but on a night when I'd had no sleep I just wanted to crash and burn all day.’ Ms Palmer says she was often so tired that she had to cancel plans with her friends and call in sick to work. She also avoided going on holiday anywhere in a different time zone as the jetlag would make her insomnia worse. She said: ‘It really hampered my life and stopped me from doing everyday things that most people take for granted.’ She tried prescription sleeping pills which worked at first, but made her feel ‘like a zombie’ and left her concerned she would become dependent upon them. As a result, she stopped taking them and her insomnia became worse than ever. She also tried natural remedies, yoga and meditation but none of these things worked. She says she also eats a healthy diet and takes regular exercise but this did not help either. However, everything changed when she found out about Re-Timer glasses. These work on . the principle that the body has a natural sleep-wake cycle which is . governed by the body clock. When this is working correctly, people are able to fall asleep and wake up at the right times. However, if the body clock becomes out of sync, sleeping problems can develop. This . is particularly common in the winter and in people who work shifts . because the body clock is controlled by the natural cycle of light and . dark and this can be disrupted by not receiving light at the right . times.

The Re-Timer . glasses, which were developed by researchers at Flinders University, in . Australia, emit a green light which helps to reset the body clock by . mimicking natural light. She said: ‘I first heard about the Re-Timer glasses from a friend who had seen an article about it online. ‘I found it online and read a number of very positive reviews about it from people who sounded like they had a similar terrible experience to me with sleeping issues. Ms Palmer wears the glasses for 20 minutes every morning when she is getting ready for work . ‘I was at the end of my patience and decided that it was the last thing I was going to try before accepting that I’d be always have sleep problems and was just going to have my life ruined because of it. ‘They seemed quite expensive at £199 but there was a money back guarantee if they didn't work in the first 30 days and so I thought it was worth a try -  I had nothing to lose.’ Ms Palmer started by wearing the glasses for 20 minutes every morning after waking up. She says that she didn't expect them to work  - but within a couple of weeks she noticed she was getting to sleep earlier and waking up earlier after a good night’s sleep. As a result, she says she felt more refreshed, less groggy and generally happier. She said: ‘That was six months ago and I am still using Re-Timer on a weekly basis to help me sleep. ‘I usually use them on Sunday and Monday mornings as this helps to set me up for a good week of sleep throughout the rest of the week. ‘I am actually going to bed at a reasonable hour and it's not unusual for me to sleep through a full eight hours now.’ They are said to be able to help with jetlag, sleep problems associated with working shifts, winter blues, falling asleep too early and struggling to get to sleep.

A woman picked on for her extremely pale skin and hair has managed to overcome adversity and find success, and self-confidence, as a model. Born with Albinism, a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, Sarah Wright was subjected to a horrific campaign of bullying at school. Often being pelted with stones and drink cans by fellow students at school, Sarah’s self-esteem plummeted to an all-time low and it was only discovering – and winning - a national competition for alternative models that restored her faith in her own beauty. Scroll down for video . Sarah Wright was subjected to a horrific campaign of bullying at school but has now been crowned the UK's alternative Model of the Year . Sarah was born with Albinism, a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin . Born albino, Sarah, 18, from Whitby, North Yorks not only had the snow white hair and skin characteristic of the condition, but was also almost blind due to her eyes being under developed. ‘People kept telling my mum I wouldn’t be able to do the things other kids could.  But she refused to listen and encouraged me to take part in all the normal childhood activities.’ As the years went by Sarah’s vision slowly improved and she didn’t give her looks much thought until she hit puberty at secondary school. That’s when she realised her looks were unusual. ‘Girls would sneer and ask why I was so pale as they changed for PE,’ she recalls. Every day Sarah would carry the social stigma of being different. She had chips spat at her as she walked into the school canteen and was even pelted with stones and empty drinks cans when she went into town. Sarah's misgivings were soon alleviated when a huge cheer erupted when she walked on in a black latex catsuit and full make up with her hair coaxed up into an outrageous style . Sarah was also a victim of cyber bullying. Friends told her that unbeknown to her one of her tormentors had taken a picture of her on their mobile. They then posted it on Facebook with the caption ‘Freak’. This sustained bullying continued for years leaving Sarah feeling ugly and worthless. ‘I didn’t feel like a person, only a condition. ‘My mother told me not to listen to them, that I looked striking and one day my chance to shine would come. But I didn’t believe her and covered my face by hiding behind my long hair.’ Then a friend showed her how to experiment with make up. ‘It made her feel like a different person and when I wore it my confidence increased.’ Sarah has overcome the years of bullying, and with the support of her mother has gained self confidence . Sarah left school at 16 and started A-levels at college. With her hair cut into a bob and new found makeup skills the bullying subsided and a newly confident Sarah came across auditions to find the UK’s Alternative Model of the Year. Despite her nerves, and with her mother’s encouragement Sarah entered the competition . ‘When the day arrived (last September) I was petrified as I stepped out onto the stage at the Live Theatre in Newcastle.’ But Sarah’s misgivings were soon alleviated when a huge cheer erupted when she walked on in a black latex catsuit and full make up with her hair coaxed up into an outrageous style. She went on to be crowned Alternative Model of the Year and be given a modelling contract. ‘Mum couldn’t stop hugging me.  ‘I told you you’re day to shine would come,’ she told me. ‘And I’m glad I’ve proved my bullies wrong. For years they made my life hell. But in a way they did me a favour because never in million years did I think I’d get to where I am today. ‘Now I know longer feel the need to hide, instead I’m proud of who I am.’","Sarah was born with albinism, lacking pigment in her skin and hair .

Britain’s victory in the First World War must not be celebrated, the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the Great War has warned. Helen Grant said although the war was an ‘absolute vital victory’ for Britain there should be no ‘triumphant fanfares’ throughout the next four years of commemorations. But historians warned the stance showed a ‘lack of understanding’ about how the war was won. Events to mark the centenary of the First World War must not repeat the jubilant scenes in 1918 when the Armistice was announced, ministers warned . David Cameron has pledged a ‘truly national commemoration’ in 2014 to remember the start of the ‘war to end all wars’. The Prime Minister has promised a four-year £50million programme to commemorate the 100-year anniversary, culiminating in events in 1918 to mark the end of the conflict. But Miss Grant warned against striking the wrong tone, insisting there must be no ‘daning in the streets. She wrote in The Lady magazine: ‘We won't be shying away from the fact that, in the end, it was an absolutely vital victory for us that changed the course of world history in countless ways, but we won't be celebrating that fact or sounding triumphant fanfares. ‘Don't forget that, as well as changing history, the conflict claimed the lives of around sixteen million people across the world, and injured a further twenty million. ‘The tone has to be right, not four years of gloom and misery, but no dancing in the street either.’ The government has promised a four-year £50million programme of events to mark the centenary of the First World War . The government has been faced with a . difficult balancing act over how to mark the war, in which Britain . emerged victories but millions died. Historian . Gary Sheffield, Professor of War Studies at the University of . Wolverhampton said: ‘What I think they’ve got wrong, and it’s caused . some concern among military historians for example, is that among the . great set-piece commemorations they are not including the great . victories of 1918 which actually ended the war. ‘That shows a lack of understanding of the basic facets of the history of the First World War,’ he told The Times. ‘I . think avoiding triumphalism is absolutely correct. Nobody wants a . triumphalist approach. But we’ve got to be aware that celebrating can . mean different things. Celebrating in the sense of acknowledging the . national effort made during the war is entirely appropriate. ‘We . must not lose sight of the fact that the war was fought by Britain to . counter largely German aggression and involved a huge national effort on . the battle front and home front.’ The . debate follows a row sparked by Education Secretary Michael Gove when . he suggested popular shows like Blackadder were being used as a . propaganda tool by ‘left-wing academics’. Mr . Gove told the Daily Mail that the left insisted on peddling myths about . the First World War, which have served to ‘denigrate virtues such as . patriotism, honour and courage’. Tory minister Helen Grant said there must not be four years of gloom and misery, but also 'no dancing in the street either' while Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has also cautioned against a triumphalist tone . He wrote: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What A Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’ His remarks saw him clash with Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinson who accused Mr Gove of making a ‘very silly mistake’. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt also waded into the argument condemning the Conservatives for attempting to politicise the 2014 anniversary of the start of the war. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg later stepped in to insist the Government was taking a ‘dispassionate’ reflection of the lessons learnt from the ‘shocking scale of bloodshed’. Last night Mr Hunt told The Times he was pleased the Government had now adopted a more reflective and respectful tone following Ms Grant's comments.","Culture minister Helen Grant issues warning on getting the tone right .

Dawn Lowe, 50, from Hulme, Manchester, took to the site to berate the 'lying Judas’s' as they gave evidence at her three-week trial. The mother-of-two and foster carer even posted one message during a break for lunch. One of the series of ranting messages read: 'One [victim] looks like a rat anyway and the only truth she told was her name, hahaha.' Another said: 'Watch because my condemner will themselves in turn have to face the truth of their own lies.' Lowe is facing up to two years in jail . after being convicted on Wednesday of 16 counts of carrying on a . consumer credit business without a licence. But she was found not guilty of one charge of blackmail. The Facebook messages emerged after she was remanded in custody at Manchester Crown Court to face sentence. It is not believed the court knew of the open profile postings during the trial. The Facebook page was disabled on Thursday. Earlier the jury was told Lowe had run her illegal 'payday-style' cash loans business whilst she looked after children for Manchester City Council. She was paid around £24,000 of taxpayers' cash for her role as a carer whilst accepting almost £300,000 from debtors over a seven-year period from 2005.

No paperwork was provided by Lowe, and no records kept by her 11 'vulnerable' victims including a mentally ill woman who cannot read. Lowe also ran an illegal catalogue business for 13 years, ordering goods for nine people and charging them ‘commission’. She will be sentenced on March 3. Manchester Police said today they were not currently investigating the posts. Lowe began her online commentary in the run up her trial - posting a New Year message on December 31 that read: '2014 . Is going to be a good year for me. It is the year I am going to watch . the downfall of all the fake friends who tried to bring me down but . failed. 'All they really did . was make me find the strength inside myself that i didn’t realise I . had. Happy New year to all the GOOD REAL ppl out there.' Another of the woman's posts - uploaded during a break for lunch. The court heard how one victim was forced to pay £125,000 to Lowe before she was arrested in 2012 . Lowe was convicted of 16 counts of running a consumer credit business without a licence at Manchester Crown Court - and the messages were revealed while the woman was remanded in custody facing sentence . But on January 15 two days after her trial started and featured in a local paper Lowe posted a foul mouthed message saying: 'F*****g Dirty Lying B******s. Well folks DO NOT believe everything you read. 'YES . this is what so called friends who I CANNOT NAME AND SHAME yet but I . will because after 18months of hell My TRIAL has just started and the . truth shall prevail. 'Watch because my condemner will themselves in turn HAVE TO FACE THE TRUTH OF THEIR OWN LIES....' On January 17 she posted a lengthy message which included: 'Well . folks just getting ready for another grueling day in court to listen to . more lies...the tales of the Judas’s are being ripped apart. 'It . is really hard and stressful to hear and watch the people who you cared . about and helped for many years, stand in front of you and your family . and lie, when in their heart they know the truth (not sure if they have a . heart tbh) especially when one of them was like my sister, that is the . one that hurt the most. Lowe, who was working as a carer for Manchester City Council, also ran an illegal catalogue business for 13 years, ordering goods for nine people and charging them commission . One of Lowe's victims, Maria Turner,  said she considered taking her own life after she borrowed £50,000 in a bid to ease her her financial problems . 'At least she told half-truths..The second one looks like a rat anyway and the only truth she told was her name, Hahaha. 'The third one of the day realised what she had done and I . don't think she know it would escalate this far cos she does this in . anger all the time, I even believe she got someone sacked from their job . because of her outburst of anger. 'Either . way I forgive them all because they know not what they have done. In . hindsight they did me a favour, when I think about it, and they should . think about it too. I know they will all miss me far more than I will . miss them......To be continued...' Her final posting on January 22 read: 'At court. Lunch break.....stressful but the truth is being heard, let’s hope It’s believed.' During the trial the jury heard how one of Lowe’s 11 clients was sent abusive text messages in a bid to make her repay over £100,000 interest. Lowe is facing up to two years in jail following her conviction. She will be sentenced on March 3 . Businesswoman Maria Turner, 49, said she considered driving her car off a bridge or taking a drug overdose after she borrowed £50,000 in a bid to ease her her financial problems. But she was then landed with demands for repayment totalling £165,000. Over a seven year period Mrs Turner, who ran a sandwich shop and other businesses, claimed she was 'mithered to death' by childhood friend Lowe who allegedly threatened to reveal the loan to her family if she did not pay up. One text message Lowe allegedly sent to her read: 'You better get the f*****g money in or I will tell your son. ‘I will come to the shop and will take it out of your till. Don’t think you can get away with missing this week. I need my money.” It was claimed other texts from Lowe included: 'Please let’s not be playing catch up, don’t think you know how p****d off I am, I need my money ASAP, if you don’t pay I will tell.' A third read: 'Sorry for the text but you bring it on. I want £575 in my bank so start putting it in now. Can’t believe after how I’ve been. I’m sick of playing catch up. I’m being as fair as I can.' 'I don’t want it split in drips and drabs, my patience is running really thin. I’m struggling because of you, friend or not.' Mrs Turner handed over £125,000 before Lowe was arrested in July 2012 during an investigation into her unlicensed money lending operation. She had been due to pay a further £40,000. Councillor Kate Chappell, Executive Member for the Environment, said after the case: 'Loan sharks are ruthless criminals who target some of the most vulnerable members of society and exploit the fact that the economic downturn has left many people struggling to make ends meet. 'But the days when loan sharks could expect to get away with causing misery are over, and the illegal money lending team is working closely with the police and council to bring these people to justice.'","Dawn Lowe, 50, berated the 'lying Judas's' online as they testified .

Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Scotland, a horrified mother went public with a shocking picture of her unconscious son in an attempt to . end the Neknominate craze. Nikki Hunter found her 19-year-old son Keiren passed out on the sofa after drinking three bottles of spirits as part of the internet dare. The 40-year-old at first feared he might be dead or dying and placed the teenager in the recovery position to assist his breathing. Terrified that her son could easily have killed himself, Mrs Hunter, 40, posted the picture online and asked everyone to share it. She wrote: 'I don’t want another parent to walk into this scene or, God forbid, something worse.' Keiren had accepted a dare to film himself downing a deadly mixture of vodka, whisky, rum, sherry and Irn-Bru. Hours after his mother posted the picture of him comatose and covered in vomit, the pictures had been shared 15,000 times.

'That’s why you’re getting abuse and paying for a professional cleaner to clean my settee.'

The United Nations has demanded that the Vatican 'immediately remove' all clergy who are known or suspected child abusers and turn them over to civil authorities, in an unprecedented and scathing report. The U.N. watchdog for children's rights said the Holy See should also hand over its archives on sexual abuse of tens of thousands of children so that culprits, as well as 'those who concealed their crimes', could be held accountable. The watchdog's exceptionally blunt paper - the most far-reaching critique of the Church hierarchy by the world body - followed its public grilling of Vatican officials last month. Scroll down for video . The United Nations has demanded that the Vatican 'immediately remove' all clergy who are known or suspected child abusers and turn them over to authorities. Pictured: Kirsten Sandberg, centre, chairperson of the U.N. human rights committee and committee members Maria Herczog, right, and Benyam Mezmur, left . 'The Committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators,' the report said. The Vatican was expected to issue a statement on the report later on today. Pope Francis arrives for his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican today. The watchdog's exceptionally blunt paper - the most far-reaching critique of the Church hierarchy by the world body - followed its public grilling of Vatican officials last month . A commission created by Pope Francis in December should investigate all cases of child sexual abuse 'as well as the conduct of the Catholic hierarchy in dealing with them,' the report said . Pope Francis greets the faithful as he arrives for his weekly general audience. Pope Francis called the  decades-long sexual abuse of minors by priests 'the shame of the Church' Over a period of 70 years, an estimated 10,000 were sent to the . ‘Magdalene laundries’ to carry out unpaid manual labour under the . supervision of nuns. Some were sent because they were the children of unmarried mothers, others for crimes as minor as not paying a train ticket. Incredibly the last of the ten laundries,  which washed clothes and linen for major hotel groups, the Irish armed forces and even the brewer Guinness, was in operation until 1996. They were established in 1922. Last February the women received a qualified apology from the Irish government. Irish prime minister Enda Kenny apologised for the stigma and conditions saying they were a product of a ‘harsh and uncompromising Ireland’. He expressed his sympathies with survivors and the families of those who died but stopped short of a formal apology. His words drew scorn from victims’ groups, who insisted the institutions were worse than prison and demanded a much stronger statement. The move followed an 18-month inquiry which found one in four of the women sent to the laundries had been sent by the state. The U.N. committee on the Rights of the Child said the Catholic Church had not yet taken measures to prevent a repeat of cases such as Ireland's Magdalene laundries scandal, where girls were arbitrarily placed in conditions of forced labour. It called for an internal investigation of the laundries and similar institutions so that whose who were responsible could be prosecuted and that 'full compensation be paid to the victims and their families'. A commission created by Pope Francis in December should investigate all cases of child sexual abuse the report said. It also said it should investigate 'the conduct of the Catholic hierarchy in dealing with them.' Abusers had been moved from parish to parish or other countries 'in an attempt to cover-up such crimes,' it added. 'Due to a code of silence imposed on all members of the clergy under penalty of excommunication, cases of child sexual abuse have hardly ever been reported to the law enforcement authorities in the countries where such crimes occurred,' the U.N. body said. At a public session last month, the committee pushed Vatican delegates to reveal the scope of the decades-long sexual abuse of minors by Roman Catholic priests. Pope Francis called abuse 'the shame of the Church'. The Holy See's delegation, answering questions from an international rights panel for the first time since the scandals broke more than two decades ago, denied allegations of a Vatican cover-up and said it had set clear guidelines to protect children from predator priests.","Demanded the Vatican 'immediately remove' all clergy who are known or suspected child abusers and turn them over to civil authorities .

A teenager nearly died after the car she was driving hit a pothole, catapulting her 20ft through a fence and into a ditch. Christie Councer was driving to college when she lost control of her Ford Ka and ended up crashing into a tree before her car came to a stop in a hedge. The 19-year-old hairdressing apprentice is calling on Gloucestershire County Counil to fill in the  holes to prevent future accidents. Christie Councer, 19, was left with glass embedded in her face and head after her car hit a pothole, catapulting her 20ft into a ditch before she hit a tree and came to rest in a hedge . Miss Councer's Ford Ka was written off in the accident caused by a pothole . She was left with fragments of glass embedded in her head and face as well as concussion after the accident, which happened on January 27. The teen, from Stroud in Gloucestershire, said her car hit two potholes, measuring around 40cm by 10cm, while driving along the A4173 in Gloucester. The car was written off, leaving Miss Councer having to pay £500 for a new vehicle. She said: 'I was on my way to college at about 10am. 'I hit a pothole when I was doing about 35 or 40mph - which is well under the recommended speed limit there. 'I lost control of the car. I didn't know what to do so I ended up on the other side of the road. The apprentice hairdresser is calling on her local council to fill in the potholes to stop other drivers from suffering the same fate . 'Then I went through a fence and into a tree. I would have gone further but I went into a hedge which stopped me. 'At some point during all of this my air bags deployed, I'm not sure when though. 'I was really scared. I looked for my phone to call 999 but I couldn't find it and I started to panic. 'Then some men came running up to me and helped get me out my car and called 999. 'I was taken to hospital where they had to give me some really strong pain killers. 'They also had to give me some aesthetic so they could pull all the glass out my face.' Miss Councer has now launched an appeal for all of the potholes in the area to be filled in to prevent the same thing happening to other drivers. She said: 'The only thing that was there to warn about them was white paint around the outside, but the paint had been there so long it was starting to fade. 'There should have been something there to warn drivers. Miss Councer, who has since recovered from her injuries, recalled the accident. She said: 'I was really scared. I looked for my phone to call 999 but I couldn't find it and I started to panic' The teenager, who was forced to spend £500 on a new car, called for Gloucestershire County Council to repair the potholes. A spokesman for the council said the holes have been filled as part of routine inspections made across the county's road network . 'When it's such a dangerous and busy road there needs to be some kind of warning. 'At night it's impossible to see them, there needs to be a sign or something. 'After my accident my sister saw another Ford Ka lose control after hitting a pothole on a different road. 'It's going to keep happening until the council do something. 'It shouldn't take people getting hurt before the council are prepared to do anything.' The teenager braved the roads for the first time today, getting back behind the wheel of her car, adding the incident could have been a 'lot worse'. A spokesman for Gloucestershire County Council said: 'Our sympathies are with the driver involved in this accident. 'We inspect our busiest roads every month as a matter of course, fixing the worst potholes immediately and repairing others within 28 days – in line with national guidelines. 'Potholes on this stretch of road have now been fixed as part of these routine repairs and we will continue to monitor the road closely.' When Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that the council should foot the repair bill. But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame. They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace. Pothole: Frank Cattrall, 62, stands over the pothole in Colchester, which damaged the suspension on his car . But Mr Cattrall suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth. Using . a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker . had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months . earlier – but the council had ignored it. The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed. He thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance. But . even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County . Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the . disagreement went to the small claims court. At . a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr . Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115. ‘I . think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just . throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in . their way and just forget about it as people just don’t want the . hassle,’ he said. ‘I have . had phone calls and texts saying “well done” since I won the court case . and hopefully more people will now do the same.’","Christie Councer suffered facial and head injuries in the crash .

A mother left in a vegetative state by a meth-addled driver who smashed into her car when she was pregnant has been awarded a record $9.3 million in a settlement. The family of Cayla Wilson, 23, and her three-year-old daughter JaiKyla sued the city of Portland, Oregon and Clackamas County, claiming that the driver's probation officer and a police officer who saw him before the crash should have taken actions that could have prevented the crash. On Wednesday, the state's insurance carrier was ordered to pay $4.5 million, Clackamas County's will pay $3.3 million and Clackamas County itself will be pay out $1 million. Devastating: Cayla Wilson, now 23, suffered brain injuries when a driver under the influence of meth crashed into her in 2010. Cayla, pictured a month after the crash, has won a $9million payout . Family: She was five months pregnant at the time of the crash and her daughter, pictured, was delivered five weeks later by C-section. The little girl has cerebral palsy, which is linked to her premature birth . Attorneys involved in the settlement told The Oregonian that it is the largest payout by any government entity in the state's history. The money will go towards the care of Wilson, who was five months pregnant when Jack Whiteaker, high on meth, veered into an oncoming lane and smashed into her Buick on April 15, 2010. She suffered fractures to her skull and jaw and extensive brain damage that has left her bedridden, unable to talk or unable to care for herself. Her parents Bill and Denise now care for her around-the-clock at their home in Gresham, rotating her in her bed every two hours, bathing and feeding her. Her daughter, JaiKyla, was born by . Cesarian section five weeks after the crash and has cerebral palsy, . which is linked to her premature birth. Denise . Wilson said she sat beside her daughter on Wednesday evening after the . settlement and told her they would not have . to worry about money. 'She had tears,' Denise Wilson told The . Oregonian. 'I told her that she and her daughter are going to have a . very bright future.' Before the crash: Wilson, pictured before the accident, is now entirely reliant on her parents. They believe that the driver's parole officer and a police officer could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy . Life-changing: Wilson's father Bill holds after her daughter, JaiKyla, now three, outside court in 2012. Bill and his wife now care for their daughter and granddaughter around the clock . Attorneys on behalf of the family had filed a $42 million suit, naming Dawn Penberthy, a Clackamas County Community Corrections probation officer, and Portland police officer Devonna Dick. Locked up: Jack Whiteaker was found guilty and is serving 11 years in prison for the crash . They contended that Penberthy had not . supervised Wilson strictly enough. He gave false address and work . information, and failed to attend meetings with the probation office and . drug treatments. When she filled out papers to haul him back in front of authorities, they had no idea where he was. The suit said that Dick twice came across Whiteaker on the day before he crashed into Wilson, but failed to take him into custody. In the first instance, she responded to a 911 call after a store owner reported that he was harassing customers and acting strangely. She noticed that his license was suspended but because he was not in his vehicle at the time, she did not think she had probable cause to arrest him. She later responded to another report that he had been running through yards and looking in a window, and when Dick found him hiding in a bush, he seemed 'out of it'. But she let him go. Wilson's attorneys said that Dick should have arrested him for driving with a suspended license or for trespassing. But authorities have denied that the staff are to blame in the incident. Police chief Mike Reese said that it would have been inappropriate for the officer to arrest Whiteaker because she lacked probable cause. Crash scene: Whiteaker veered across the road and smashed into Wilson's Buick, leaving her brain damaged and unable to car for herself. Whiteaker was high on meth and had skipped probation . A spokesman for Mayor Charlie Hales . said Portland police have also been affected by findings by the U.S. Department of Justice that they have used excessive force against people . who suffer from or are perceived to suffer from mental illness. And Clackamas County counsel Stephen . Madkour added: 'It's important to point out that the wrongdoer, the . person who caused all this tragedy, was Jack Whiteaker.' Whiteaker, . who wasn't named in the lawsuit, is serving an 11-year prison sentence . after being found guilty of DUI, second-degree assault and reckless . driving in the crash. Prosecutors argued for the maximum sentence in 2012 and played a jail phone recording of Whiteaker saying he hoped Wilson remained in a coma for the rest of her life. Because of Wilson, he said, he would miss out on cigarettes and women while locked up. During his sentencing, Wilson's parents gave moving victim impact statements. Caretakers: The Wilsons, seen in 2012, said Cayla shed a tear when they told her about the payout . 'We have lost everything,' Denise Wilson said. 'You have left a family torn . and destroyed. We are trying to figure out how to move forward, but it's . like we're stuck on the day you took her from us.' But throughout the statements, Whiteaker interrupted the family, The Oregonian reported. 'I didn't do it!' yelled Whiteaker. 'Cayla is 21 years old and has been in a hospital bed for two years,' Bill Wilson said. 'I've been in jail for two years!' Whiteaker shouted.","Cayla Wilson was 5 months pregnant when her car was hit by Jack Whiteaker in 2010, leaving her brain damaged and unable to speak .

But why are we so repulsed by the sight of something millions of people do every day? And why particularly when viewed from the lesser-seen angle of inside someone else's mouth? Femail's resident sexpert Tracey Cox says it could be to do with the intimacy involved in kissing, but also the intrinsic dirtiness of mouths. She said: 'There's a reason why lots of sex workers won't kiss - it seems more intimate than sex for many reasons not least of which because mouths harbour a lot of bacteria!

A quarter believe women should stop trying to bring babies into the world past the age of 40 while 43 should be the cut-off for men. The survey of more than 2,000 people across the UK found 31 per cent think the current age limit of 42 for IVF on the NHS is too old. Almost three-quarters of people do not think women should receive IVF to help them conceive beyond their natural childbearing years, a poll  has found. The poll was released to mark the TLC documentary Tina Malone: Pregnant At 50 . Some 26 per cent said they thought 40 should be the maximum age limit for either NHS or private treatment. Meanwhile, almost three-quarters (72 per cent) said science not should intervene to help women become pregnant beyond their natural childbearing years. The poll was released to mark the TLC documentary Tina Malone: Pregnant At 50, which will air on Tuesday. The Shameless actress travelled to Cyprus for IVF treatment and conceived her daughter, Flame, with donor eggs, giving birth aged 50. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they thought children born to women aged 50 to 55 were negatively affected by having an older mother. This figure rose to 73 per cent of over-50s surveyed. Some 52 per cent said women who are 50 cannot be a good parent for a child through to adulthood.When asked about men aged 50 and over having children, 43 per cent said the same. The Shameless actress travelled to Cyprus for IVF treatment and conceived her daughter, Flame, with donor eggs, giving birth aged 50 . Malone, now aged 51, had her first child aged 17. She said: 'People might consider me over the hill and too old to be a mum but physically, emotionally, mentally and financially I am much better off now, as a mum at 50, than I was as a mum at 17 when nobody criticised me for having a baby. 'I have more stamina and energy than most 27-year-olds, and all the time to give to my baby. Of course there has to be a cut-off, but if you are fit and healthy and financially secure, then you should be allowed to have a child at 50.' Today's survey also revealed people's main concerns when it comes to older mothers. Some 72 per cent said the main worry for mothers over 40 was their health during pregnancy and birth, while 68 per cent said the impact on young children when their parent dies is also a concern. Meanwhile, 62 per cent said the health of the child owing to having an older mother was an issue. When asked what was the ideal age for women to have their first baby, 27 was the most popular age.Susanna Dinnage, managing director of Discovery Networks UK, said: 'The findings reveal that most people believe 40 should be the cut-off for parenthood. 'However, juxtaposed against this public view, Tina gives a very moving and compelling account of one woman's personal decision to have a child at 50, three decades after she had her first child.'

Another source told the newspaper that Agu later died at a local hospital. It is not yet known why he passed out. The school said it would release further information about the incident at a later date. Agu, a public health major from Bakersfield, California, had played in seven out of the 12 games during his junior season, recording six tackles.

Hope Rollings, now ten months old, was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival after her mother’s 20 week pregnancy scan revealed she had a rare abnormality in her chest. Hope had no diaphragm which meant her major organs were pushing up into her chest and squashing her lungs, preventing them from developing properly. Hope Rollings (pictured with her mother, Sarah) was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia which meant she had no diaphragm and her organs were pushing up into her chest and squashing her lungs . Hope's parents were told that without pioneering surgery while still in the womb she would struggle to breathe when she was born and would probably not survive. As a result, she had to have a risky operation before her birth. Image shows a scan of her five weeks after the operation . Diagnosed with diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, her parents, Sarah and Luke, were offered a termination. But the couple were then told about a pioneering operation which was still in its experimental stage. Doctors explained they could operate on the unborn baby –  at this point just 10 inches long – while she was still in the womb. The procedure involved inserting a tiny balloon into her windpipe to stop the amniotic fluid that babies inhale and exhale from leaving her lungs. Trapping the fluid in her lungs forced them to remain expanded allowing them to develop. But the operation was so delicate there was a high risk of miscarriage. Mrs Rollings, 26, of Monmouth, South Wales, said: ‘I went for my scan thinking everything was going to be fine and then the doctors started whispering. Hope's first operation saw doctors insert a balloon into her windpipe to stimulate lung growth . Hope (pictured with her parents, Sarah and Luke Rollings) was only given a 10 to 20 per cent chance of surviving the operation that she had while still in the womb but her parents wanted to give her a chance . ‘They told me and Luke that our baby was unlikely to survive. We were offered a termination. It was absolutely horrendous. ‘But I was determined to give the baby every chance to live and they told us about this new operation. ‘The decision to have the surgery was one of the most difficult decisions we have ever had to make. CDH - congenital diaphragmatic hernia - is a hole in the diaphragm that allows organs from the abdomen to move into the chest. In severe cases, such as Hope's, there is no diaphragm at all. This prevents the normal development of the lungs meaning the baby will struggle to breathe when it is born. The procedure involved inserting a . tiny balloon into her windpipe to stop the amniotic fluid that babies . inhale and exhale from leaving her lungs. Trapping the fluid in her lungs forced them to remain expanded allowing them to develop. First, doctors place a needle through . the mother's stomach and into a baby to inject a sedative. This is to ensure the baby doesn't move. Then a small incision is made and a camera is guided down through the baby's mouth and throat and into the chest. A tiny balloon about the size of a penny is then inserted and filled with saline. Then lungs then inflate. The whole operation takes around 30 minutes. ‘Our baby was given a 10 to 20 per cent chance of survival but what choice did we have? ‘If we didn't have the operation our baby would probably die anyway. ‘I had to give our baby the chance of life however small that was.’ The surgery was carried out at King’s College Hospital in London when Mrs Rollings was 26 weeks pregnant. She was wide awake as surgeon Professor Kypros Nicolaides operated - in fact she and Mr Rollings watched the whole procedure on a TV monitor. Mrs Rollings said: ‘It was fascinating and terrifying at the same time. Knowing your baby is so tiny and fragile and is in a life and death situation was very scary. ‘I knew that it meant I could go into premature labour and I could lose my baby that way. But it was a risk I had to take. ‘The doctors placed a needle through my stomach and into the baby then injected a sedative to send her to sleep so she wouldn't move. ‘A small incision was made and a camera was guided through her mouth and down into her throat and into her chest. ‘A tiny balloon about the size of a penny was inserted and filled with saline. Her lungs then inflated. The whole operation took around 30 minutes.’ Mrs Rollings was told the balloon would have to be removed before her baby was born but she went into labour at 35 weeks, catching everyone by surprise. The baby was born last March weighing 5lb 15oz and the couple named her Hope because they never gave up hope that she would survive. Mrs Rollings said: ‘She had to be paralysed with an injection when she was born so she didn't breathe on her own at first. The operation Hope had in the womb allowed her lungs to develop because it enabled them to expand. When she was born, she had to have another operation, this time to move her organs back to her abdomen and to insert an artificial diaphragm . When Hope was diagnosed her parents were offered a termination as her prognosis was so poor . Hope (pictured with her father in hospital) was given her name because her parents never gave up hope she would survive . ‘Then she was taken into intensive care and underwent a three-hour operation to move her organs around. ‘Doctors then used a synthetic patch inserted into her chest as she did not have a diaphragm muscle.’ This patch fills the role of a diaphragm and allows her lungs to expand without being hindered by her other organs. Full-time mother Mrs Rollings and support worker Mr Rollings are now looking forward to Hope's first birthday just a month from now - and she is a normal healthy baby about to take her first steps. Hope (pictured in hospital after her second operation) is now learning to walk and will soon be celebrating her first birthday . Mr and Mrs Rollings (pictured on Hope's first day at home) say they will forever be grateful to all of the doctors and nurses who saved their daughter . Mrs Rollings said: ‘She is an absolute joy and has made us so happy. When we see her smile it's hard to take in the journey she has been through before she got here. ‘She is a miracle in every sense of the word when I think she was only given a 10 per cent chance of survival.’ Hope will need another operation when she is older but for now her parents are just enjoying their precious new addition. Mrs Rollings said: ‘We are so proud of her - she is a very precious little girl. ‘It's amazing to think a tiny balloon saved her life while she was still in my womb. We will be forever grateful to the doctors. ‘We are very lucky to have our gorgeous daughter - we savour every moment.’","A 20-week scan showed that Hope Rollings had no diaphragm .

The father of a 12-year-old boy who was found malnourished has accepted a plea deal for child abuse charges. Michael Marshall and his girlfriend, Sharon Glass, were both arrested in March of 2012 after officials in Florida received a tip-off that the 12-year-old boy weighed only 40lbs and stood just 4'4. An average 12-year-old boy weighs 75lbs to 100lbs and is about 5'0. In court on Friday, 40-year-old Michael Marshall offered a mumbled and sometimes disturbing explanation for the starvation and caging of his son, who weighed only 40 pounds when he was discovered by police. Brutal: Sharon Glass (left) has been found guilty of eight counts of aggravated child abuse and now faces up to 120 years behind bars while her boyfriend Michael Marshall (right) has worked out a plea deal that will see him serve no less 19 years in jail on similar charges . The boy told jurors when he was punished, he was locked in a bathroom for days, if not weeks, at a time. 'We weren't trying to hurt him,' said Michael Marshall. 'We were trying to help him and went the wrong way about it. We were trying to get him to be a good boy, basically.' Marshall pleaded no contest Friday on multiple charges of aggravated abuse, false imprisonment and neglect. When Marshall is sentenced in April, he will face a maximum of 30 years in prison. Last month in a trial that ended in a guilty verdict for Marshall's girlfriend, Sharon Glass, 49, prosecutors said the boy was caged or tied up most of the time. On the stand in her trial, Glass said Marshall took steps to cover up his son's condition. Abuse: A 14 year old boy, who has not been identified, has described being starved nearly to death and locked in a closet for days on end by his father and his father's girlfriend . Glass, 49, from . Brevard, was . found guilty on eight counts of aggravated child abuse last Friday after . four days on trial. Pictures reveal the bathroom window was boarded up and the doorknob lock was reversed. Desperate for food, the boy told jurors he ate toothpaste to stay alive. In prior testimony, he said the parents gave him a stocking filled with coal for Christmas. Both Glass and Marshall from Titusville in Florida, were charged with eight felony counts of child abuse. Glass has already been convicted on all 8 counts of abuse and faces up to 140 years in prison. She told the court that she hadn't noticed the boy was emaciated because he was always wearing baggy jumpers. She also claimed she had nothing to do with disciplining the boy, who was regularly locked in a cupboard and tied to a bed post. She . said she wanted to leave the relationship with Marshall, but that . during the four years she dated him he threatened to kill her several . times. During . the trial the boy, now 14, described being starved nearly to death and . locked in both a closet and a bathroom for days on end by his father and . his father's girlfriend. Trial: The boy testified at the child abuse trial of Sharon Glass, pictured, last month . The boy, without shedding a tear or changing his tone . of voice, told the court they put him in a closet and secured the door . with a bungee cord and a desk. He even bravely illustrated with a laser pointer how they wrapped a cord around the knobs of the sliding closet doors to keep him inside. When asked if Glass and Marshall would talk to him, he replied: 'Not unless they were telling me to be quiet, basically.' They gave him diapers so they wouldn't have to let him out to use the bathroom and he was fed macaroni noodles, ramen noodles and sometimes canned vegetables. When he was out of the closet he would take any food he could find and hide it, he said. Evidence: The court was shown pictures of the closet the boy was locked in, pictured . Bathroom: He was also locked in this bathroom . Numerous holidays passed when he was locked away, including Valentines Day, St. Patrick's Day and Easter. Later, he was locked in a bathroom after his father zip-tied him to the post of a bunk bed for three days and he chewed through the ropes to escape. But he said on Christmas day in 2011 he was let out of the bathroom to watch other children who lived in the house open gifts. He was then put back inside with a stocking full of coal. 'I just cried,' he recounted. He noticed himself getting smaller he said, and his clothes getting baggier. The court was shown a tiny pair of Spiderman pajamas, boys size 8, that he was found in and pictures showing a malnourished child with gaunt cheeks and skeletal ribs. It wasn't until March 2012 that he was rescued from his hell, when a family friend raised the alarm. At the time, investigators said another month of the alleged horrific abuse would have killed him. Thankfully, there were no obvious signs of the trauma he endured when he appeared in court, now a teen, not yet 5-feet tall. He smiled at times and even laughed. Arrest: The couple were finally arrested in March 2012 when the boy was freed . Rescued: The boy, with his face obscured, is seen in March 2012 when police rescued him from the home . Making the case all the more horrific is the fact that teachers at the child's school first reported his injuries to authorities some 17 months before he was eventually rescued. Distraught teachers at South Lake Elementary School said they repeatedly called the Department for Children and Families to try to get help for the boy, then aged 12. The abuse started while he was a pupil at the school. The boy moved to Apollo Elementary School where he spent just 10 days in class before being withdrawn to be home-schooled. Marshall and Glass were angered because he was getting extra food at school, police said. About . two months after taking him out, they told the district he would attend . a private school - essentially stopping the district's efforts to keep . track of him and his education. Home: Distraught teachers at South Lake Elementary School said they repeatedly called the Department for Children and Families to try to get help for the boy, then aged 12, but were ignored . 'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade. 'I honestly thought the next call that I got about him was that he would be dead.' Glass's ex-husband, Tony Glass, said he called DCF 12 times, concerned that his three children who lived with their mother were often dirty and had head lice. 'I called them so many times because of my concerns with the kids, they told me to stop calling,' he said. 'If youâ€™re told by DCF to stop calling, what else can you do? Who else can you call?' The last time the department looked into the complaints was 2010 when they decided there was not enough evidence to justify removing the boy from his father. 'There is a difference between reporting child abuse and reporting concern and being able to remove a child from their home,' DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner told MailOnline. Speaking to Florida Today at the time she added: 'You can't remove a child on a hunch. Of all the resources we have, the one tool we don't have is a crystal ball.' Begging for help: 'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade, of DCF . Action was eventually taken on March 15 when a woman walked into Titusville Police Department told officers her boyfriend had gone to a friend's home and had seen an emaciated boy locked in the bathroom. Detectives went to the house and found the boy curled up on the floor. Police said the boy would be zip-tied to a bed in a standing position and forced to sleep that way. To stop him from crying, a dirty sock was duct-taped in his mouth. The couple arrived home while police were still at the property and reportedly confessed to caging and punishing the boy, including denying him food, according to Local 6 News. They said they punished the boy because he began stealing food after it was being withheld from him, Titusville police said in the report. Hospital staff said the condition of the child when he was found resembled images of  'concentration camp survivors.' He was severely malnourished and treated for dehydration. The boy and two of his siblings have been in DCF custody since the ordeal.","Michael Marshall, 44, took a plea deal in court and told a judge he did it to help his son .

If diagnosed with an STD, many people would be quick to point an accusatory finger at their partner. But new research suggests they should perhaps think twice before making any assumptions about the source of their infection. Scientists found some patients who have previously had chlamydia can be re-infected with the infection by their own guts. This is because the antibiotics that are used to treat chlamydia sometimes fail to completely eradicate the disease. The infection not only infects the reproductive organs, it also remains persistently – but benignly – in the gut. It can remain here even after it has been eradicated from the genitals, researchers at the Arkansas Children’s Research Institute found. And that reservoir is likely a source of the all-too-common reinfections that follow treatment, the researchers say. The source of these re-infections has long been a mystery. Some are blamed on continued intercourse with an infected partner. This is not surprising since chlamydia is usually asymptomatic in men. However, this has not been able to explain all re-infections. ‘While all agree that chlamydiae may persist in a patient for long periods of time, and that recurrent infections do develop, there has been no agreement on how and where and in what form chlamydiae persist,’ said lead author Dr Roger Rank. In the study, his co-author and Arkansas colleague Laxmi Yeruva showed in mice that antibiotics eradicated chlamydia from the genitals, but not from the gut. Dr Rank showed further - also in mice . - that chlamydial infection of the gut does not elicit an inflammatory . response, and never resolves, unlike in the genital tract. Antibiotics sometimes manage to eradicate chlamydia from the genitals but not from the gut where it remains benign but can cause reinfection . ‘However, . we found that [gut] infection does produce a strong immune response . that can actually be effective against a genital infection, but that is . unable to cure the [gut] infection,’ said Dr Rank. Chlamydia is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the world. Young people  are worst affected, and 6.8 per cent of sexually active females aged 14 to 19 become infected annually.","Antibiotics sometimes manage to eradicate chlamydia from the genitals, but not from the gut, where it lingers benignly and can cause re-infection .

She was jailed for five years for slashing the neck of Natalie Walsh - Ground Force star Tommy Walsh's daughter . A woman has been jailed for five years for slashing the neck of the daughter of Ground Force star Tommy Walsh. Leanne Bloomfield, 29, denied using a shard of glass to cut Natalie Walsh, 22, upwards from her neck to her chin at Cafe De Paris in London's West End in February last year. But a jury found the mother-of-two guilty of wounding with intent following a four-day trial last month. She was sentenced to five years at Southwark Crown Court in London today after Judge Peter Susman QC told her: 'Quite why your attack on her was so violent remains unclear to me.' Bloomfield, dressed in all-black and wearing dark-rimmed glasses, sobbed throughout the sentencing hearing as members of her family sat in court. The victim and her family, including Mr Walsh, did not attend the sentencing. The court heard the attack on February 3 last year left Ms Walsh with a 5cm cut on her neck and a severed tendon in her thumb. She required stitches and later underwent cosmetic surgery on her injuries. Bloomfield had texted a friend after the attack to say she had had a 'massive punch up with some girl', adding: 'ha ha, b****, she got me good in the nose through', the court heard. Bloomfield went on to say: 'Me and my sister did a number on her, she was in a heap. They didn't catch me, ha ha.' Judge Susman said Ms Walsh's feeling of safety had been 'much affected' following the attack. He told Bloomfield she remains 'in denial' as she continues to protest her innocence. While it was not clear if the attack was provoked, it did not 'justify such a violent attack', the judge said. 'You were very tearful in the witness box,' he said. Ms Walsh's horrific injuries. Judge Susman told Bloomfield today: 'Quite why your attack on her was so violent remains unclear to me' A red scar has been left on the 22-year-old's neck following the attack . 'I form the impression it wasn't because you were sorry but because you were caught.' Bloomfield, of Highwoods, in Colchester, Essex, has no previous convictions but was cautioned by police in August 2004 for common assault after fighting a woman in the street, the court heard. She will serve half of her sentence in prison before being released on licence, the judge ruled. Judge Susman said he had taken into account the ill health of the defendant, who suffers with heart murmurs and is diagnosed with depression. 'I believe you will find it difficult to cope in prison,' he said. Tommy Walsh's daughter Natalie, 22, was attacked while out at Cafe De Paris near Leicester Square in central London last February . The pair were at the Cafe De Paris (pictured) in central London when the attack took place. Bloomfield texted a friend after the attack to say she had had a 'massive punch up with some girl' The judge said the sentence had been reduced from six to five years to take into account the defendant's children who 'are the ones who are going to suffer'. 'Any sentence I impose on you is going to punish them as well as you and they are not deserving of any punishment all,' he said. In mitigation, Sasha Bailey, defending Bloomfield, said her client was the primary carer for a five-year-old daughter and son, aged two. Her daughter will stay with her maternal grandmother during the sentence while her son will live with his father, Ms Bailey said. Speaking after a verdict was delivered on January 13 (left) Tommy Walsh who became famous in the BBC's gardening show Ground Force with Charlie Dimmock (right), said he was 'satisfied' justice had been done . Despite not attending the sentencing hearing, Mr Walsh spoke after the verdict on January 13 to condemn the defendant's 'laddish' behaviour during the assault. The celebrity builder, who rose to fame on BBC show Ground Force with Alan Titchmarsh and Charlie Dimmock, said he was 'satisfied' with the jury's decision. Speaking after the verdict, he said: 'There are no winners in this. The only winner is justice has been seen to be done. It was really tough but we are a really close knit family. We can move on. We've no interest in what happens from here.' Mr Walsh said Bloomfield 'didn't appear remorseful or contrite' following the attack. 'She has two children. You should think about your behaviour before you go and behave drunkenly or laddishly,' he added. Mr Walsh said his daughter had achieved a first in her medicine degree at King's College in central London despite deferring her final exams after the attack.","Leanne Bloomfield, 29, jailed for five years at Southwark Crown Court .

Tony Newlands outside court: The unlicensed tattoo artist admitted failing to ensure his customers were not exposed to risk under health and safety law . An unlicensed tattooist has been jailed after his botched Alice In Wonderland etching across a young woman's back left her in agonising pain and scarred for life. Tony Newlands worked in unsanitary conditions in the kitchen of his home in Carlisle, Cumbria, where a lack of sterilising equipment created a serious risk of infection, a court heard. He improvised around a lack of suitable equipment by using a 'dirty' toothbrush to clean his tattooing tools and an Old Spice deodorant stick to apply stencil transfers to customers. Newlands' illegal enterprise hit the skids after an inept attempt at an Alice In Wonderland tattoo which spanned most the back of a young woman in her 20s. After two sessions on the detailed design, the  woman was unable to bear the pain and asked him to stop. She fell sick when the etching got infected and was left with ugly scars. At Carlisle Magistrates Court, Newlands admitted a single offence of failing to ensure his customers were not exposed to risk under health and safety law. Clare Liddle, prosecuting for Carlisle City Council, described how Newlands' victim contacted environmental health officials and told them that he had 'wrecked her back'. Neither the defendant, nor the property he was using in Ridley Road, Currock, were registered for tattoo work. The woman revealed how she had paid up to £100 for two days of tattoo work. 'The work was carried out in the kitchen of the property,' said Mrs Liddle. 'She described how during the tattoo, she sat on a kitchen stool and leant over the worktop. 'There was a cat in the kitchen and the defendant was drinking. He also had a few cigarette breaks during the tattoo. He used an Old Spice deodorant stick to stick the transfer onto her back. 'It's likely that this deodorant stick was used on other customers, creating a risk of infection.' The woman saw no cleaning equipment, though Newlands did use gloves and disposable needles, said Mrs Liddle. After the second painful tattooing session, she added, the woman's back became so badly infected the she could not sleep for a few days. Botched: The massive but ineptly drafted Alice . In Wonderland tattoo - criticised by a legitimate tattoo artist as the worst he'd seen - which . left this young woman scarred for life and in agony when it became . infected . Fairytale to nightmare: The design showing how the tattoo was supposed to look and, right, some of the £1,000-worth of tattooing equipment that environmental health officers confiscated from Newlands' home . Both Donna Hastie, the environmental health officer who investigated the case, and legitimate local tattoo artist Colin Fell said the Alice in Wonderland tattoo was the worst they had seen. Mr Fell said: 'The colour on the toadstool has been put in too deep and has caused scarring to the skin - these scars will always be raised and will be difficult to tattoo over. 'The linework is inconsistent, some being too heavy and some too light.' There were also dark spots where the needle caught the skin, said Mr Fell. He estimated that disguising the tattoo with another one, properly done, would cost at least £900. Mrs Liddle estimated, judging by the . equipment seized from Newlands' home, that he operated commercially, and . probably did up to 150 illegal tattoos. Newlands admitted working . as a tattoo artist for several years, with one customer being a 17-year-old . boy whose age was well known to him. Public . health expert Dr Nigel Calvert said in a statement that a lack of . sterilisation in Newlands' tattoo studio created a serious infection . risk, including from viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV. 'Dirty': The toothbrush that Newlands' used as an improvised cleaning tool for his tattoo artist's tools and implements . Sexy pins: Judging by the equipment seized it was estimated that Newlands operated as a tattoo artist on a commercial basis and probably did up to 150 illegal tattoos - including one on a 17-year-old boy . Margaret Payne, for Newlands, said her client insisted his tattoo work was not commercial and that there was no cat in the kitchen. 'He was not making a profit,' she said. Commenting on how the council wrote to the Ridley Road address in 2010 to remind the occupant that tattoo businesses had to be registered, she said the letter was not addressed to the defendant, whose partner lived at the address at the time. She added: 'It's right that he hasn't undertaken a formal apprenticeship but his father does work in the tattoo trade and was planning to set up his own shop. 'He works in Yorkshire and Mr Newlands has spent time watching what his father did, hoping to join him in the business.' The tattooing equipment seized from her client's house had been worth up to £1,000, added Mrs Payne. Infection control: Public health expert Dr Nigel . Calvert said a lack of sterilisation equipment in Newlands' tattoo studio created a serious infection risk, including from deadly viruses . such as hepatitis B and C and HIV .

Jailing Newlands, presiding magistrate Marcia Reid-Fotheringham said: 'It's worth noting, from our point of view, that your work as a tattooist was not a hobby.' She added that his work created 'extremely dangerous risks' to his customers. Carlisle City Council's Deputy Leader Elsie Martlew, responsible for health and safety at the authority, welcomed the 'strong action taken by the magistrates'. 'Unregistered tattooing will not be tolerated in Carlisle and where evidence is brought forward we will take action to stop these people,' she said.","Tony Newlands drank while working in unsanitary conditions in his kitchen .

British expats living abroad would get their own MP under Liberal Democrat plans to make the Commons ‘fairer’. Nick Clegg’s party has drawn up proposals for vast overseas constituencies covering Africa, Europe and North America represented by jet-setting MPs. The Deputy Prime Minister also wants to see the voting age lowered to 16-year-olds, a special seat for the Commons Speaker and allowing two people to be a joint MP as part of a job-share. The House of Commons would be bolstered by MPs from around the world under plans drawn up by the Liberal Democrats . There are more than 1million Brits living in Spain, who could get their own MP in the Commons . Many European countries already have seats in Parliament for nationals who have moved abroad. France has six seats spread across Europe, two in America, two in Africa and one for Asia and Oceania. There are 2.2million UK citizens living in EU countries alone, including 1million in Spain, 330,000 in France, 329,000 in Italy and 107,000 in Germany. Under plans expected to be approved at the Lib Dem spring conference next month, the party will examine ‘the viability of overseas constituencies such as those  used in some other European countries’. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘British citizens can already vote when they move abroad for up to 15 years, but their votes are counted in the constituency [in which] they used to reside. ‘This would create separate constituencies in Parliament for the representatives of these voters.’ Nick Clegg's party is expected to approve the policy at its spring conference next month . The package of measures, dubbed Power to the People, will also include introducing the Single Transferable Vote system for electing MPs and councillors, lowering the voting age to include 16 and 17-year-olds and creating a Speaker’s Seat ‘so that the electorate in the parliamentary constituency from which the Speaker is drawn are not disenfranchised’. The Lib Dems will also propose allowing two people to stand for election to the Commons ‘on a job-share basis’. The idea has previously been backed by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston who said last year: ‘It is time to start looking at how it can be made to work. Ultimately, voters would decide. ‘They may well take note of job sharers in other professions, who between them often deliver far more than a full-time equivalent.’","Nick Clegg's party to draw up plans for seats like other EU countries .

A judge questioned 'which genius' had decided to charge a man who was spotted holding a kitchen knife when guarding his home from a gang of yobs. David Beeley, 44, was woken up by 'rowdy' drunk youths who were shouting outside his Nottingham home in August and shouted down asking the group to be quiet with the gang shouted back. The yobs went away but returned later and started banging on his door brandishing metal objects. Nottingham Crown Court where a judge questioned the wisdom of David Beeley being on trial for taking a knife to protect his home from a gang . Mr Beeley came to the door with a kitchen knife, police were called and he was arrested for possessing a bladed article. None of the gang of yobs were detained by police. Judge Michael Stokes, QC, asked whether Beeley should be in court when . none of the people who came to his door had been arrested. He gave him a conditional discharge, meaning he will face no punishment for the charge. Describing Beeley as of 'good character', he added: 'Which genius . thought it was in the public interest to prosecute this defendant?' Andrew Tanser, prosecuting, said that Mr Beeley had been asleep at about 11.30pm when he was woken by the group's shouts outside his home in the Mapperley Park area of the city. He added that the gang were 'rowdy and clearly in drink' and said that they 'came back with metal implements and were banging on his door' when he came to the door with the knife. Michael Evans, defending, said his client admitted possession of a . bladed article to avoid the stress of a trial and simply wanted the . matter to end. After the hearing Mr Beeley said: 'I was a little bit rankled because of the aggression I received, but I shouldn't have done that, it was a bad decision.' Charged: Mr Beeley was arrested by Nottinghamshire Police following the incident . He said he did not believe any of the people who banged on his door had been prosecuted and added: 'I was a little bit disappointed by that because you wonder whether they will go on to do something else.' A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'When this case was charged, a prosecutor, as in all cases, considered the evidence in the case and the public interest. 'The evidence provided showed that the defendant had left his apartment building carrying a large kitchen knife with the intention of making a group of youths who were causing a disturbance leave the vicinity. 'The prosecutor took the view that going out in public with a knife can often inflame a situation, rather than resolve it. 'The defendant pleaded guilty to this offence, on the basis that he had the knife in his hand because he had been cooking and had gone outside out of fear for himself and other residents in the block.

For a millennium, it has stood as a monument to one of the bloodiest struggles in England’s history. Hordes of tourists troop to Battle Abbey to stand at the spot where King Harold fell at the Battle of Hastings. Now, if the theories of a local historian are to be believed, they may be going to the wrong place.John Grehan claims the spot where the Battle of Hastings is commemorated is not actually where the fighting happened. According to Mr Grehan, the supposed site of the struggle, marked by Battle Abbey, is a mile away from the real scene of combat in 1066. Members of historical re-enactment groups, assuming the role of Saxon and Norman soldiers, perform the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings at Battle Abbey . Mr Grehan points out that no human . remains or artefacts from the conflict have ever been found near Battle . Abbey, even though some 10,000 men are believed to have died there. His theory is that the real site of the fighting was the steep Caldbec . Hill, to the north-west of Hastings – and if he is proved right, history . books around the world may have to be rewritten. Thousands of tourists flock to Battle Abbey  every year to learn about . the conflict, which resulted in the death of King Harold and played a . pivotal role in the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror. Now Mr Grehan, 61, is calling for the site at Caldbec Hill to be . excavated to see whether the remains of battle victims are buried there. The Bayeux Tapestry, part of which is pictured, famously depicts the 1066 battle which saw King Harold supposedly shot through the eye with an arrow in what was a decisive victory for William the Conqueror . He said: ‘I assumed everything was known about the Battle of Hastings . but I found that almost nothing is known by way of fact. Excavations . have been carried out at Battle Abbey and remnants pre-dating the battle . were found, but nothing relating to the conquest. Some 10,000 men died . at the Battle of Hastings; there has to be a mass grave somewhere.’ It is documented that King Harold assembled his English army on Caldbec . Hill before advancing on Senlac Hill – or Battle Hill – a mile away to . meet the invading Normans. Another section of the Bayeux Tapestry which depicts the Battle of Hastings. Historian John Grehan has claimed that the conflict may have actually taken place on Caldbec Hill and not at Battle Hill as historically thought . But Mr Grehan believes Harold never left his defensive hilltop position . and the Normans took the battle to the English. He has studied . contemporaneous documents in the national archives and built up a . dossier of circumstantial evidence that he believes proves his theory. Witness accounts from 1066 state the  battle was fought on steep and . unploughed terrain, consistent with Caldbec Hill.  Senlac Hill, . meanwhile, was cultivated and had gentle slopes. The Great Gatehouse at Battle Abbey, Battle, East Sussex. The Abbey stands close to the site where it had been thought that the Battle of Hastings took place . In addition, the Normans erected a cairn of stones on the battle site to . commemorate their victory, known as a ‘Mount-joie’  in French. The . summit of Caldbec Hill is still known as Mountjoy. One English source . from the time, John of Worcester, also stated that the battle was fought . nine miles from Hastings, the same distance  as Caldbec Hill. Harold is supposed to have abandoned his high position to meet William . on lower ground, a tactic that makes no sense as he would have been . moving away from his reinforcements. Furthermore, Mr Grehan believes he . has identified the site of a mass grave where the fallen soldiers may be . buried. Mr Grehan, from Shoreham, West Sussex, has made his arguments in a book . called The Battle of Hastings – The Uncomfortable Truth, to be published . in January. He added: ‘Two days after the battle the Normans moved on towards . Winchester. They had two days to get rid of the thousands of bodies. You . can’t dig that many graves in such a short space of time. ‘At the bottom of Caldbec Hill is Malfosse ditch, I believe the bodies . were rolled down the hill and dumped in this ditch which was filled in. A . proper archaeological dig of that ditch needs to happen.’ Roy Porter, the regional curator for English Heritage which owns Battle . Abbey, said they were obliged to look into alternative theories for the . battle site. But he said the spot the abbey is built on is based on a number of historical sources and is documented before 1120. He added: ‘It would be premature to comment on Mr Grehan’s thesis until the book is published.’ It has historically been believed that the Battle of Hastings took place at a site now known as Battle on October 14 1066. Harold organised his troops in three wedges on Senlac Ridge, overlooking the battlefield. He had little more than 5,000 weary men who found themselves up against a Norman force of up to 15,000 infantry, archers and cavalry. Facing such odds, Harold had no choice but to fight a defensive battle. He was forced to rely on the much-vaunted English shield-wall. His men could stand and let the Norman attacks break themselves. The tactic was initially very successful. Relentlessly, the Norman knights hurled themselves against the English shields, but were unable to make any headway. Then the Bretons led by Count Alan on the Norman left began to give way. The whole incident is portrayed on the famous Bayeux tapestry. The battle had turned. Now the English wall had broken, and the Normans were able to lever open the cracks. Exhaustion and the shear numbers of Normans took their toll. Gyrth and Leofwine, the two remaining brothers of Harold were killed according to the Tapestry, and Harold was soon to follow. We see him  taking an arrow in the eye and then being ridden down by a Norman cavalryman, one of four who managed to break through the English line and trample Harold into the ground. Though the English still fought on bravely after their king had fallen, their cause was lost, and eventually they fled into the night.

Irene Myangoh, a personal assistant at a law firm in Nairobi, Kenya, paid a salon for the hair piece which doctors believe may have come from a corpse. After two weeks, she started suffering from severe headaches which painkillers did little to ease. When blood tests and a brain scan also . came back negative, she went back to her doctor who examined her scalp . and reportedly found maggots eating into her skull.

No further details were given about the maggots and the doctor could not be reached for comment by the station.

A prosecutor said there no evidence that Brock, a photographer by trade, had sexually assaulted children.

Even some of the tracks for the Sochi Winter Olympics aren't complete, and those that are, come up short. Course workers added 40 meters (130 feet) to the biathlon track for the Sochi Olympics on Friday because it was too short. The loop should measure 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles). Even though a 5 percent deviation is allowed by the rules, the track at the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center came up short. Coming up short: Workers prepare the track at Laura Cross-country Ski & Biathlon Center inear Sochi, Russia. Officials found the Biathlon track to be 130 feet too short and had to make some last minute adjustments . 'We had an issue with the length but we made a change, which takes care of it,' biathlon's technical delegate at the Olympics, Max Cobb, said. First doubts about the track length came from the Norwegian team, and they proved right after IBU officials measured the course on Thursday. On the World Cup circuit, most courses are inspected four days before the actual competition though IOC rules are different, leaving organizers less time for adaptions if needed. 'It's much too late and it creates issues,' Cobb said. 'All of us feel it's the right thing to do and we still have (one) day before racing.' The venue hosted a World Cup biathlon event last year but the shape of the course has been modified since.

The new part of the track will be used in the women's 7.5K sprint on Sunday, and after that in the women's 12.5K mass start, the men's 12.5K pursuit and the three relays. U.S. head coach Per Nilsson told The Associated Press he was 'a little surprised it was a little on the short side.' 'It's still the Olympics, so they should have measured that before,' Nilsson said. 'Five percent (deviation) is allowed but this felt like a 7K (for the women's 7.5K). It was the right decision they corrected it. Everybody is happy with that.' Another change to the track moved the starting line back by more than 30 meters. In the initial course set, athletes were not given enough time to speed up from the start before approaching a steep hill. Nilsson called the course 'super tough. It will be a big fight.' 'In some courses on the World Cup you have big climbs and then you have quite some recovery,' Nilsson said. 'Here you're down to the bottom in a tough downhill, so you don't recover the legs and then you have a long, long climb.' Expense: The most expensive Olympic games are now underway.

Mexican authorities say four human heads have been found in a town in Michoacan, a western state where rural vigilantes sprang up a year ago to try to drive out a cult-like drug cartel called the Knights Templar, which is run by a crystal meth-selling former school teacher similar to the Walter White character in the hit television series Breaking Bad. A federal official says police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains in Zacan but wouldn't reveal its content. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to talk to the press. He said the remains found Thursday belong to four men between 22 and 55 years of age. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT, SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brutal: Four severed heads were found in the Mexican state of Michoacan last week . 'La Tuta': Servando Gomez-Martinez is a former school teacher turned ruthless, meth-dealing drug kingpin and head of the Knights Templar . The official said federal agents also found a pit in the nearby town of Tinguindin that may contain bodies. Mexico has sent thousands of federal forces to Michoacan following shootouts between vigilantes and the Knights Templar cartel. The Knights Templar is one of the most powerful - and ruthless - drug cartels in Mexico and currently engaged in a bloody war with several vigilante groups that are trying to rid Michoacan of blood-thirsty cartel. The cartel was started by Servando Gomez-Martinez in 2011. Gomez-Martinez, a former teacher, is better know throughout the state as 'La Tutu,' or 'the teacher.' In recent interviews given from his hideout somewhere in Michocan, Gomez-Martinez has described the cartel as a sort of necessary evil, claiming that if the Knights Temple weren't around to protect citizens, another cartel would soon take over and things could potentially be worse. 'El Tio': Loya Plancarte, second-in-command of the Knights Templar, was arrested by Mexican authorities in January . In February of 2013, vigilante groups started rising up against the Knights Templar's . reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the . abuses. Last month, the Mexican government essentially legalized the vigilante movement in Michoacan by reaching an agreement with vigilante leaders to incorporate the armed . civilian groups into old and largely forgotten quasi-military units . called the Rural Defense Corps. Vigilante groups estimate their numbers . at 20,000 men under arms. 'The self-defense forces will become institutionalized, . when they are integrated into the Rural Defense Corps,' the Interior . Department said in a statement. Police and soldiers already largely . tolerate, and in some cases even work with, the vigilantes, many of whom . are armed with assault rifles that civilians are not allowed to carry. Vigilante . leaders will have to submit a list of their members to the Defense . Department, and the army will apparently oversee the groups, which the . government said 'will be temporary.' They will be allowed to keep their . weapons as long as they register them with the army. The military . will give the groups 'all the means necessary for communications, . operations and movement,' according to the agreement. Vigilantes: Vigilante groups are fighting the Knights Templar at every turn, hoping to run the cartel out of Michoacan . Misael Gonzalez, a leader of the self-defense force in . the town of Coalcoman, said leaders had accepted the government . proposal. But the nuts-and-bolts 'are still not well defined,' he added. 'We won't start working on the mechanisms until tomorrow.' Vigilante . leader Hipolito Mora said the agreement also allows those who qualify . to join local police forces. 'The majority of us want to get into the . police ... I never imagined myself dressed as a policeman, but the . situation is driving me to put on a uniform.' Latin America has . been bruised by experiences with quasi-military forces, with such . tolerated or legally recognized groups being blamed for rights abuses in . Guatemala and Colombia in the past. While the cartel may be on . its way out, 'there shouldn't be abuses by those who come after, there . shouldn't be what we would call a witch hunt; there should be . reconciliation,' said the Rev. Javier Cortes, part of a team of priests . in the Roman Catholic diocese of Apatzingan who have publicly denounced . abuses by the Knights Templar. Before dawn on Monday, soldiers . and police arrested one of the cartel's top leaders, Dionicio Loya . Plancarte, alias 'El Tio,' or The Uncle. National Public Safety System . secretary Monte Rubido said the feared drug lord was arrested without a . shot being fired. He said federal forces found Loya Plancarte in . Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, 'hiding in a closet' and accompanied . only by 16-year-old boy. The vigilante groups were recently given the blessing of the Mexican government. Here, they detain several alleged cartel members . The 58-year-old Loya Plancarte had a . 30-million peso ($2.25 million) reward on his head from the Mexican . government for drug, organized crime and money-laundering charges. He . was considered one of the country's three dozen most-wanted drug lords . in the late 2000s. The Knights Templar ruled many parts of . Michoacan with an iron fist, demanding extortion payments from . businesses, farmers and workers, but the self-defense groups have gained . ground against the cartel in recent months. Federal police and army . troops were dispatched to bring peace to the troubled region, but the . vigilantes have demanded the arrest of the cartel's major leaders before . they lay down their guns. Ramon Contreras, an activist in the . vigilante movement from the town of La Ruana, which was the first to . rise up against the Knights Templar, said the arrest 'means a lot' to . the vigilantes, but added that they won't rest until they see all the . top bosses arrested. Contreras voiced a common belief that the . man who founded the cartel under the name La Familia Michoacana, Nazario . Moreno, alias 'El Chayo,' is still alive, despite the government's . statement in 2010 that he had been killed in a shootout with federal . forces. 'He's still alive; there's proof he's still alive,' Contreras said. Loya . Plancarte got his nickname, 'The Uncle,' because he is believed to be . the uncle of another top Knights Templar leader, Enrique Plancarte . Solis. Loya Plancarte joined Plancarte Solis and Servando Gomez . in forming the Knights Templar after the purported death of Nazario . Moreno.","The Knights Templar currently is doing battle with vigilante groups in the western state of Michoacan .

A 16-year-old Virginia girl is facing a charge of distributing child pornography after tweeting nude pictures of herself. The James City County girl posted the pictures on or around January 30, and they were shared by various friends before a school resource officer was informed about them. The school staff member spoke to the girl and her mother before turning the case over to James City County police. Lewd tweet: The Virginia teenager tweeted nude pictures of herself and is now facing child pornography charges . Police charged the girl with one felony count of possession, reproduction, distribution, solicitation, and facilitation of child pornography. According to the WAVY, police decided to pursue the harsh charge due to the 'lewdness' of the photos. The teen may face jail time for the nude photographs, but it's more likely she and her parents will have to complete a court-ordered 'Sexting Education' program. Officer Stephanie Williams-Ortery said teenagers often don't understand the seriousness of sharing personal information and photographs online. 'It’s not just friends that see what they post but also strangers and everyone else out there,' Williams-Ortery told WAVY. 'You have no idea who’s out there watching. You never know who’s going to see what you post.' This isn't the first time the mix of sex and social media has had disastrous results for a teen. Serious issue: Teens often don't understand that they could face harsh child pornography penalties for distributing explicit pictures of themselves or their peers (stock picture) Last month, a Canadian teen was convicted of child pornography possession after posting a nude photo of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend on Facebook. The girl's lawyer slammed the decision after her guilty verdict. ‘These child pornography laws were intended to protect children, not to persecute them, and again it seems the criminal justice system, it's a heavy hammer to be using,’ said Christopher Mackie. Williams-Ortery says the Virginia girl isn't the only one who may be in trouble with the law over the pictures. 'I would hope that they would not then forward it on to their friends because then they become guilty also of distribution of child pornography, whether they know that or not,' she told WAVY.","A 16-year-old Virginia girl took nude pictures of herself and posted them on Twitter .

'What mother would not do this for their child,' Mrs Lawrence said, adding she agreed to do it 'so they can have a child of their own'. Mindy had been plagued with health problems from the age of 10, which resulted in her having a hysterectomy to end the pain she had been in. 'I knew when we got married that I could not have kids,' Mindy Lawrence told WMC-TV. The couple didn't have the $30,000 needed to use a surrogate, but had started to discuss adopting when Mrs Lawrence offered to help.

A father was 'wrongly' arrested during an anti-fracking protest by police who claimed he had been drink-driving - even though there was no car in sight. Dr Steven Peers, 46, refused to give a roadside breath test in Salford, Greater Manchester, because he said he wasn't driving. During the confrontation which was caught of camera, Dr Peers repeatedly insisted he had not been drinking and had only had a cup of tea. Scroll down for video . 'Drink drive claims': Dr Steven Peers was arrested after refusing to give a breath test when confronted by police officers . Protests: Dr Peers was filming these anti-fracking protesters clashing with police when he was confronted by the officer over his alleged drinking . The father-of-four, who has a doctorate in metaphysical sciences, accused Greater Manchester Police officers of lying before holding him on 'a ridiculous, trumped-up charge'. He was later charged with failing to provide a specimen and hauled before the courts. However, the case collapsed when prosecutors offered no evidence. Dr Peers is now planning to sue police for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and assault following the incident. He was filming anti-fracking protesters as a self-styled 'lawful observer' during an anti-fracking demonstration in Barton Moss, Salford when he was detained. Video footage shows a policeman telling Dr Peers 'away with that' (the camera) before shoving him to the floor as he attempts to film a protester being arrested. A second policeman, Sergeant David Kehoe, then tries to lead Dr Peers away before accusing him of driving to the protest site while drunk. Arrest: A man is detained by police officers and Dr Peer is subsequently ushered away from the scene . Confrontation: Sergeant David Kehoe repeatedly tells Dr Peers 'you have been drinking' after he allegedly smelt alcohol on his breath . Row: Sgt Kehoe calls over two other officers to take a breath test to establish whether the suspect had been drinking . The officer tells Dr Peers: 'I could arrest you, but I'm not going to. Are you drunk? Have you been drinking this morning? You've been drinking this morning.' Dr Peers, who lives in New Moston, denies it and says he has only 'had tea'. Sgt Kehoe adds: 'You arrived in your car this morning. You have had a drink this morning, haven't you? Where's your car? 'You just said to me that you've had two drinks.' On camera, the father is only heard saying that he had drunk a cup of tea. The policeman then can be heard saying that Dr Peers arrived at the site in a blue Mercedes. He asks two other police officers to breathalyse the suspect and he is then arrested when he refuses to provide a specimen. Backup: A group of other police officers who were on site at the time as the anti-fracking protest took place . Arresting officer: The police officer who demanded that Dr Peers provide a breath test. When he refused to do so, he was detained . Arresting officer: A second policeman who helped carry out the arrest when Dr Peers refused to provide a breath test . Although he was charged with failing to provide a breath test, the case was dropped when it went before Manchester and Salford magistrates' court. Dr Peers, who is an electrical engineer, has made a formal complaint to Greater Manchester Police and the force's professional standards branch is now investigating. He said: 'It was a ridiculous, trumped-up charge. He told blatant lies. I was shocked that he would do that on camera.' Dr Peers, who said he is not an anti-fracking protester but goes to the site to document the demonstration, said he had not drunk alcohol on the morning he was arrested - January 14 - and had not arrived in his car as he had stayed there the previous night. A GMP spokeswoman said: 'Greater Manchester Police have received a complaint about this video which officers from the Professional Standards Branch are investigating.'

When one geologist stumbled across a massive mound 65 years ago, he had no idea his discovery would spark one of the world’s strangest scientific mysteries. The site in Irkutsk, Siberia was discovered in 1949 and is a huge convex cone with a funnel-shaped recess and a rounded hill in the middle, which looks a little like an eagle’s nest with an egg nestled inside it. The origin of the Patomskiy crater has baffled scientists for decades and theories for its existence have ranged from a nuclear blast to a secret gulag mine and even a meteorite strike. The site in Irkutsk, Siberia was discovered in 1949 and is a huge convex cone with a funnel-shaped recess and a rounded hill in the middle, which looks a little like an eagle's nest with an egg nestled inside it . The mysterious crater - also known as the 'eagle's nest' - was discovered 65 years ago in Irkutsk, Siberia, by a Russian geologist. The cone is 80 metres tall from the lowest point of its base and measures 150 metres wide. It is thought to be just 250 years old, although estimates differ widely. Scientists previously suggested it was a slagheap, but now think there were not enough people living in the area to create it. Some people believe it was made by aliens. Scientists threw out the idea that the mound was made as the result of a uranium ore explosion as the site has low background radiation. They have floated the idea that it could have been made by a volcano, but none have been found nearby. An impact made by a meteorite is the favourite theory but no evidence of fragments has been found. It is thought there is something with a high iron content over 100metres below the crater, which could be a meteorite. The crater is 'alive' and changes shape - by rising and falling - constantly. Trees nearby the site are reported to grow abnormally fast. The current thinking is that the site was indeed created by a meteorite strike, but no evidence has been found to support the theory. The cone is 80metres tall and has a diameter of 150metres at its widest. The depth of the inner circle ditch is around 10metres. It was named Patomskiy after a nearby river and was discovered by a geologist called Vadim Kolpakov who tried and failed to arrange a scientific trip to examine the site, but numerous expeditions have taken place since and one last year collected samples. Theories that the mound is a giant slagheap have been thrown out as there were not enough people living nearby when the crater is thought to have formed to create such a pile. And there were never labour camps or gulags in the region. Half a tonne of samples were taken from the site and removed by helicopter last year. The . samples led scientists to dismiss ideas of a uranium ore explosion as . the background radiation at the site is low and no uranium has been . found nearby either. This left them with two main theories – one of a volcano and another of a meteorite. However, the mysterious site has not given up any meteoritic material and the area is not thought to be volcanic. In fact there are no volcanoes within thousands of kilometres of the Patomskiy crater and it also seems to be relatively new. The origin of the Patomsky crater has baffled scientists for decades and theories for its existence have ranged from a nuclear bomb blast, a secret Gulag mine and meteorite strike . The cone is 80metres tall and has a diameter of 150metres at its widest. The depth of the inner circle ditch is around 10metres . Scientists thought the crater was only between 100 and 500 years old and could be the result of the Tunguska meteorite, which fell in the Krasnoyarsk region in 1908, but whose crater has never been discovered. It is thought the meteorite was sighted just 70km away from the ‘eagle’s nest’ and that distance is a mere 10 to 15 seconds of flight. As the Tunguska event occurred in 1908, the age coincides, but modern tests have shown that the crater is actually 250 years old – so it could have been formed by a previous meteorite that fell when the area was virtually unpopulated. The strange mound was found in Irkutsk, Siberia (pictured) was discovered in 1949 but it was only last year that scientists took samples from the site . The crater was named Patomsky after a nearby river and was discovered in Siberia (pictured) by a geologist called Vadim Kolpakov who tried and failed to arrange a scientific trip to examine the site. The first expedition only took place last year . Scientists now think that there is something with a high iron content and ferromagnetic materials buried between 100 and 150 metres underneath the crater. They believe it could be a meteorite or another incredibly dense object, but they are not certain. The fact that the crater is ‘alive’ as its shape changes constantly - by rising and falling - and that the trees nearby the site are reported to grow abnormally fast, adds to the mystery.

His grandmother Toni Dugmore, 49, from Birmingham, has even put a poster condemning bullying on her own Facebook page. She wrote: ""I AM AGAINST BULLYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Her neighbour told how the Ms Dugmore has been left heartbroken by the death of her grandson. Aaron Dugmore, nine, was rushed to hospital but died the following day from suspected cardiac arrest . She said: 'Toni is in absolute bits. She's crushed by Aaron's death. 'Apparently he had been targeted by a gang of older bullies at the school. 'They made fun of him because he was the new kid but no one really thought it was any more than playground stuff.' The school, which caters for 450 pupils aged 3-11, received an 'inadequate' rating by Ofsted inspectors last year. Aaron had started in Year 5 recently but, according to staff, had already 'settled in quickly' with his classmates. Family and friends have paid emotional tributes to the popular lad on Facebook. Cousin Jack Jones wrote: 'RIP Aaron gone but not forgotten. We will always miss you.' Many also expressed their horror at the bullying allegations. Friend Claire Louise wrote: 'Thinking of u at this very very sad time think these schools need to fix up on friking [sic] bullies now this is getting unbelievable and out of hand now.'

Tracy Wood wrote: “rip to arron 9 year old boy who sadly taken his life cause of nasty bullys this needs to stop its disgusting that kids can be so cruel to others in this world bring your kids up right or dont have them rip Aaron god bless you little man.” Erdington Hall head teacher Martyn Collin sent a letter home to parents on Thursday informing them of Aaron's death. He wrote: 'We have spoken to all of our junior children and shared this tragic news with them. Pupil: The family of Aaron Dugmore claim he was being bullied at Erdington Hall Primary School . 'We have explained to the children that there are some things that they can do at this time if they feel upset. 'The school will remain open but we will fully understand that you may choose for your child to be at home if they are upset.' A spokesman for the school today added: 'The teachers, support staff and Governors of Erdington Hall are . deeply saddened by the news that Aaron Dugmore died on Tuesday this . week.

One of America's richest businessmen has sparked anger after he claimed the wealthiest 'one per cent' earn more money because they work harder than everybody else. Sam Zell, who is estimated to be worth $4billion, made the incendiary claim during a live television rant on Wednesday night, insisting that the nation's affluent should be emulated, not criticized. The Equity Group Investments founder's comments come at a sensitive time since billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins claimed the criticism of America's rich was akin to the persecution . of Jews in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Scroll down for video . 'We work hardest': Sam Zell, who is estimated to be worth $4billion, made the incendiary claim during a live television rant on Wednesday night, insisting that the nation's affluent should be emulated, not criticized . 'The quote '1 per cent' are being pummelled because it's politically convenient to do so,' Mr Zell said in an interview on Bloomberg Televisionâ€™s ""In the Loop"" with Betty Liu. 'The problem is that the world and this country should not talk about envy of the 1 per cent it should talk about emulating the 1 per cent. 'The 1 per cent work harder. The 1 per cent are much bigger factors in all forms of our society.' Controversial: Zell's comments come at a sensitive time since billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins claimed last month that America's war on the rich is akin to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany in the 1930s . Asked how he thought the average worker on the minimum wage could emulate his success, he said: 'The stories are rampant of people who started with a candy store and took it from there. 'There are lots of people who have the ambition and have the motivation and have succeeded.' It comes weeks after Perkins, a founder of Kleiner Perkins . Caufield & Byers, wrote a letter to the Wall Street . Journal in which he said the public's turn against the rich represents a 'dangerous rift' in America and compares such progressive radicalism to . the German Kristallnacht. Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938 . Anger: Resentment towards the super-rich has been building since the Occupy Movement began in September 2011 where protesters claim the global economy is engineered by an elite oligarchy of wealthy individuals to make the rich richer and the poor poorer . 'I would call attention to the . parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ""1 percent,"" namely . its Jews, to the progressive war on the American 1 percent, namely the ""rich,""' he wrote. But Zell held back when asked for his views on Perkins' outburst. 'The word persecution is not the right word,' he said. 'I think that the politics of envy, the politics of class warfare are what has separated America from many parts of the rest of the world. And we have benefited dramatically from not having class warfare, from not having envy.' Barack Obama has come under fire from the nation's financial elite for repeatedly insisting he wants to redress America's rich-poor balance since he came to power. In his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama said: 'The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.'

"Miranda's father John reveals that it was Orlando Bloom who confirmed the couple's split to him over the telephone . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 7 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:00 EST, 7 February 2014 . Miranda Kerr's mother, father, brother and grandmother have begged the supermodel to get in touch, revealing that they have not seen her or her son Flynn for 'over a year'. Making an extraordinary public plea for the two to return home to Australia, they revealed that a rift had seen the supermodel cut off contact. In a docudrama titled . Family Confidential, which will air on Australian Television network ABC . next Tuesday, Miranda's . father John even tells how his daughter's husband . Orlando was the one to  confirm the couple's separation. In happier times: Miranda Kerr is seen with her mother Therese and her grandmother Ann at Sydney airport in May 2012 . Reflecting? Miranda posted this old shot of herself and her mother and grandmother on her Instagram page in December . 'I remember him saying ""we're always going to be family"" and that's how we'll treat Orlando, Miranda and Flynn. We're all family,' he says of the phone call, in which the actor broke the news of the end of the three-year union. Miranda's mother Therese stepped down as general manager and chief executive . officer of her skincare line Kora Organics last February, sparking . rumours of a rift between the pair. John says that he now wished his daughter had married a 'nobody', someone who was completely out of the limelight. So close: Miranda and her mother Therese used to be like 'best friends' and speak every single day, but it appears that things have changed . Separated: The Kerr family say they haven't seen Miranda or her son Flynn for over a year . 'After what I know now I would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really can't get that family time by yourself,' he says. 'I just hope Flynn grows up and he wants to be with his nan and pop.' Miranda's grandmother Ann, who also appears in the documentary, has been left particularly devastated that she has not seen her precious great-grandson, saying: 'I miss the baby and I think he's missing out on family, that closeness that we have always had. 'It's very nice where they are but nothing like Australia, nothing, and I think hopefully Flynn might end up here. We just keep our fingers crossed.' Miranda and her grandmother previously shared a special bond, with Ann often appearing in interviews and on modelling shoots alongside the model in the past. Breaking the news: Miranda's father John, pictured here with his daughter and Orlando in August 2012, says it was the actor who confirmed to him the news of the couple's separation last year, over the telephone . Meanwhile, Miranda's mother Therese, who says she used to speak to her daughter every single day, is teary as she explains of how she had to eventually 'let go' of her daughter. 'What I have had to do is let go,' she explains, 'and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and I guess for any mum that's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that.' Therese says she now sends texts to Miranda to remind her that she's always there for her, but as she is filmed doing so during the documentary, they are not always immediately reciprocated. Missing his grandson: John says he hopes that Flynn grows up and wants to be with his 'nan and pop' 'We have been best friends for most of our life. We used to talk just about every day. 'I send her messages, just little texts to say ""I love you honey, let your little light shine, my arms are wrapped around you.""' Before Miranda moved to New York at the age of 25, her parents say they told the then budding supermodel 'the day you think you're better than anyone else is the day you don't model under our guidance'. Therese says these days her daughter's life is completely different, but it is important as her mother says to stand 'true'. Sexy selfie: Miranda posted this racy selfie on Thursday during what appeared to be a modelling shot . 'Miranda's life is so different now (and) she's surrounded by yes people all the time. It's so important for me to be real, to be true, to be who she needs me to be,' she says. Since parting ways with Miranda's Kora Organics skincare line, Therese has created her own called Divine by Therese Kerr, and says that while she realises her daughter's fame has helped get the 'message out', it has perhaps come at a cost to her family.

Victoria Beckham is giving up her high-heel addiction in the run up to New York fashion week. The designer with a famous penchant for sky-high Louboutins shared a picture of the flat shoes she's 'living in' with her Twitter and Instagram followers yesterday. She accompanied the snap with the message: 'Obsessed with my @Stubbs_Wootton slippers! #livinginthesetillshowday ! X vb #NYFW #VBAW14'. Victoria Beckham has tweeted about her love of a £245 pair of velvet slipper shoes . The velvet slippers from American brand . Stubbs & Wootton cost £245 ($400) and can be . purchased from their Palm Beach or New York City store, or online. Mother-of-four Victoria, 39 - who once said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes - will spend this week, one of the busiest in the fashion calendar, in flats after she was first told to ditch the heels back in August 2011. She suffered a slipped disc following the birth of daughter Harper Seven that July and was under doctor's orders to wear comfortable shoes. But wearing flat shoes doesn't come easy to the former Spice Girl. At one of her first LA appearances in 2007, high-heel addict Victoria, who has spoken of her bunion problems, couldn't face flat shoes and wore 6in platform trainers to throw out the opening pitch at Dodger Stadium. And during her four pregnancies, a time when most women embrace a more casual shoe, Victoria continued to wear her favourite towering stiletto heels. But maybe her new-found love of a smoking shoe means that she has turned over a new leaf? VB's love of heels is legendary, she even chose to wear platform trainers when throwing out the opening pitch at Dodger Stadium in 2007 (right) Victoria Instagrammed this picture of her decorating a Christmas tree in heels last year with the message 'Christmas can be dangerous fashion bunnies! #VBXMAS x vb.'

And . now Victoria Beckham says she found a way to make her compulsory school . outfit look less 'horrific', with the idea quickly catching on amongst . her classmates. 'I created a . fashion where you'd wear two pairs of socks - one pair on top of the . other because it kind of bagged around the ankle,' she said. 'In my eyes, it changed how you looked in this horrific school uniform. It spread like wildfire.' The baggy, double sock look was popular with school girls around the time Victoria was at school . And the designer - . who has children Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, . with husband David - was such a fan of labels, she used a Gucci carrier . bag to tote her books and belongings to school.

Two diaries written by a soldier during the First World War have been unearthed by a museum with curators puzzling about what they could contain because they are written in shorthand. York Castle Museum came across the books in boxes of World War One archive material before Christmas, after they were donated by the East Riding Yeomanry Old Comrades Association. Curators at the museum are excited about finding the 100 year-old diaries, but are equally frustrated that they cannot understand what they say, as it seems closer to Pitman shorthand than written English.

Experts will be consulted in order to try and decode the diaries which seem to be written in a from of written code that closely resembles shorthand that is used by journalists and secretaries. Using a card that was found with the diaries the museum have deduced that the diaries might contain details of the Palestine campaign fought between the British Empire, Ottoman and German empires between 1915 and 1918.

'We found a card with the diaries that say they are the shorthand diaries of the Palestine Campaign in 1917-1918, written by Wass Reader of the 1st East Riding Yeomanry C Squadron.' The museum is looking for people that might be able to decipher some of the text, which might show a bit about the soldiers life in the campaign he fought in.

'It would be fantastic if volunteers from the pubic could give us any insight as to the content of the diaries and tell us more about the shorthand itself. 'The name Wass Reader is very unusual, so if anyone recognises that name we would like to hear from them as well.' 'It’s frustrating because we don’t even really know when we acquired the diaries. We want to know whether this is a record of someone’s personal opinions on the war, or the mundane details of his day-to-day life. 'We also want to know more about York’s links in the war as well, and these come from a local regiment.

Camels were used as an alternative to horses and cars due to their resilience in the heat of the desert . The Sinai and Palestine conflict of WWI is often overlooked, but it was one of the major theaters of war at the time. It began as an offensive by the Ottoman Empire on the Suez Canal in 1915, and ended in 1918 with an armistice. After an unsuccessful attack by the Ottoman Empire in 1916, Britain went on the offensive, attacking into Palestine. Late in 1917, the British captured Gaza and Jerusalem. Hostilities officially ended on October 30, 1918 with the signing of the Armistice of Mudros. During the campaign, the British also worked to start an Arab revolt in present-day Saudi Arabia. The revolt against the Ottoman forces began in 1916 and was planned and directed by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence of the British army, also known as Lawrence of Arabia. The British death toll reached 550,000, but more than 90% of these were not battle losses but instead because of disease, heat and other causes. Total Ottoman losses are unknown but were probably larger. A whole army was lost in the fighting and huge numbers of troops were led into combat. The British conquest of Palestine led to the creation of the states of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.","Diaries could contain details of the Palestine conflict fought in 1917 - 1918 .

Saudi Arabia is considering dropping public beheadings as a method of execution because of a shortage of government swordsmen in the oil-rich kingdom. A joint Saudi committee composed of representatives of the ministries of interior,  justice and health has instead proposed firing squads for capital sentences. The committee argued that the measure, if adopted, would not violate Islamic law, allowing heads - or emirs - of the country's 13 local administrative regions to begin using the new method when needed. New measure: A committee based in the Saudi capital Riyadh (pictured) is considering dropping public beheadings because of a lack of swordsmen . The Daily Mirror in Sri Lanka reported that the committee said in a statement: ‘This solution seems practical, . especially in light of shortages in official swordsmen or their belated . arrival to execution yards in some incidents; the aim is to avoid . interruption of the regularly-taken security arrangements.' The ultra-conservative Gulf kingdom beheaded 76 people in 2012, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Human Rights Watch (HRW) put the number at 69. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's strict version of Sharia, or Islamic Law. So far this year, three people have been executed. Death by beheading has always been a source of tension between Saudi Arabia and the international community. There was international outcry, including from human rights groups, after a Sri Lankan maid, Rizana Nafeek, was beheaded in public by sword last month.

The UN's main human rights body on Friday expressed ‘deep dismay’ at the beheading, while the European Union said it had asked Saudi authorities to commute the death penalty. Riyadh, however, rejected the statements as ‘external interference’ in its domestic affairs.

Most cases occur spontaneously and in young men - some cases develop as a result of a chest injury or lung disease and sometimes a tiny tear in the lung is responsible. The most common symptom is a sudden, sharp chest pain followed by pains during inhalation. In most cases, it clears without needing treatment but the air needs clearing if it causes problems with breathing. It is believed that Mr Ou tore a hole in his lung while yawning and stretching as he suffered a sudden pain immediately after yawning. File picture .

The . cars, which look virtually indistinguishable to other vehicles, can . take two to three months to complete, at a cost of up to $100,000. Security conscious: Rapper Kanye West recently splashed out on two Prombron Iron Diamond armoured cars costing around $1.2million each . Mr Forston told The Hollywood Reporter that a 'large part' of his customers are 'celebrities, pro athletes and rock stars', but they also have many buyers who are 'people not in the spotlight'. Many stars, particularly those involved in the gangster-fetishising mainstream rap music industry, may be mindful of the fate of Christopher Wallace. Wallace, better known by his artist name Biggie Smalls, was leaving a Vibe magazine party Los Angeles party in 1997 when a car pulled up beside his his. Its driver opened fire, spraying the door of Wallace's Suburban with 9mm bullets. The star was hit four times and killed. He was just 24 years old. Memories of Wallace's fate, and the . explosion in carjacking after the LA riots five years earlier, have been . among the best advertising for armoured vehicles. But there is no . denying they are also an ostentatious status symbol. One . of the most extreme examples is the Prombron Iron Diamond made by .

As . well as being able to withstand high-velocity, armour-piercing rounds, . the car is equipped with run-flat tyres and sealed ventilation to keep . the air inside fresh while all around are dying from chemical gas. Meanwhile, San Antonio-based Texas Armoring has custom built bulletproof vehicles for the likes of Steven Seagal and T.I.

But Robert Siciliano, a New York-based security consultant, disagrees. He pointed out that a 25 cent bullet will penetrate a non-armoured vehicle 'pretty efficiently'. For stars earning many millions of dollars a year like Kanye West, then, spending a fraction of that on an armoured car doesn't seem like that silly.

When I let you put up the New Year decorations I thought you'd be more festive . It’s usually the biggest night out of the year – but three-quarters of us will stay at home this New Year’s Eve, says a survey. The high price of taxis, venue entry and drinks means the average New Year’s night out costs £73, leaving 37 per cent of us worrying about the budget. A survey of 1,000 people by Morrisons found that 31 per cent of those entertaining at home will ask friends to bring a dish or bottle each to save cash. Some 74 per cent of hosts want a stress-free night away from the oven, with 40 per cent serving a spread of party foods and only 11 per cent cooking a formal dinner. Morrisons predicts it will sell 15 million olives, 5.3 million sausage rolls and two million bottles of sparkling wine and champagne across the country. A separate survey by Post Office Home Insurance also found that one in 10 people were planning on not spending any money at all on New Year's Eve. The Post Office study of more than 2,000 people revealed revellers were planning to spend £50 typically on seeing in 2014, £9 less than they had budgetted for last year. Londoners are planning to spend the most celebrating the start of 2014 typically at £78, which is more than double the amount those living in Wales have set aside, at £37 on average. Paul Havenhand, head of insurance at Post Office, said: 'It seems most people are looking forward to a celebratory night in, rather than a 'big night out' this New Year, and many are also looking to spend less this year too.' Party time: A survey has found that three-quarters of people will stay at home this New Year's Eve . As well as saving money, those preferring to spend the evening at home will also avoid the wet and windy weather set to blight New Year's Eve for many parts of the UK.

An Arizona woman went on trial Thursday on charges that she bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer in what prosecutors said was an attempt to obtain an insurance settlement to pay a nearly $300,000 loan from her boyfriend. Prosecutor Michelle Arino said 36-year-old Marissa Suzanne Devault needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole. 'The defendant likes money, and she likes easy money,' Arino said during opening statements. But one of Devault's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of his client's boyfriend, who was given an immunity agreement on child pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. Scroll down for video . Hammer murder: Marissa Devault listens to the prosecutors' opening statement during her trial at the Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona on Thursday February 6 . Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past . Dale Harrell, 34: He suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries . Authorities say Devault fatally wounded Dale Harrell by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban Phoenix home in January 2009. Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Devault. Devault claims she killed her husband in self-defense and told investigators that he had physically and sexually abused her in the past. But prosecutors contend that the attack on Harrell was premeditated and say Devault has given conflicting accounts of her husband's death. They also say the people Devault alleged were witnesses to the abuse didn't back up her claims. Alan Tavassoli, one of Devault's attorneys, said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client's boyfriend, businessman Allen Flores, even after he failed to report to police that Devault had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire-iron beating. 'He (Flores) is free and clear for this trial,' Tavassoli said. At first, Devault told investigators that Harrell had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their Gilbert home beating Harrell with a hammer. But authorities say bloodstain patterns showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head. Confession: Devault initially told investigators that her husband had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She also told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their home beating Harrell with a hammer . Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her. Police say they discovered Devault had been dating another man, Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given Devault about $7,000 which she used to hire a hit man, according to court records. The prosecution says Devault needed to repay a $294,000 loan from her boyfriend. Authorities say child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case. Without such an agreement, Flores was expected to invoke his right against self-incrimination. Prosecutors say the immunity agreement doesn't prevent authorities from filing pornography charges against Flores. Instead, they say the agreement bars authorities from using any statement that Flores makes during the murder trial in a pornography case.","Marissa Suzanne Devault went on trial Thursday for the murder of her husband with a hammer .

And houses are equipped with special shelving for cans of beans, rice and wheat. Storing away enough food and water in case of disaster, job loss or something worse is not just part of the fundamental teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it's an idea that is increasingly catching on nationwide. Scroll down for video . Big business: Workers screw caps on to bottles of apple sauce at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welfare Square Cannery, in Salt Lake City. In Utah, storing away enough food and water in case of disaster, job loss or something worse is not just part of the fundamental teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it's an idea that is increasingly catching on nationwide . And it's also big business. ‘The wisdom behind preparing is taught heavily in this population,’ said Paul Fulton, president of Ready Store, based in Draper, Utah, about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City. ‘They've led the way.’ The Mormon emphasis on self-reliance dates back to the mid-1800s when food storage began as a pragmatic way to ensure survival as church members trekked across the country to Salt Lake City, said Matthew Bowman, assistant professor of religion at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Mormon tradition: An area in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welfare Square, where it sells large cans and bags of oats, wheat, sugar, potato flakes and beans, in Salt Lake City. Many Mormons buy items from this center as they compile traditional three-month supplies of food . Storehouses: Boxes of food stacked at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Utah Bishops' Central Storehouse in Salt Lake City one of its massive warehouses stacked tall with boxes of food . National trend? Houses in Utah are equipped with special shelving for cans of beans, rice and wheat and a large majority of food storage companies that do Internet sales are based in the state . Hoarding for survival? At Utah grocery stores, there's a whole section with large plastic tubs with labels that read, Deluxe survivor 700. Radio ads hawk long-term supplies of food with 25-year shelf lives . Church leaders gave everyone lists of what to bring, and then stockpiled food at storehouses as towns were settled. By the mid-1900s, church leaders worried about nuclear war were using more apocalyptic rhetoric in encouraging food storage. During the Cold War, church members were encouraged to have a two-year supply, Bowman said. In the last two decades, the focus on food storage has shifted back to practicality. ‘A lot of times we are thinking in terms of food storage that we are preparing for this major calamity or major disaster or for Armageddon,’ said Rick Foster, manager of North America Humanitarian Services with the LDS church. ‘It's not about that. ‘It's about helping all of us individually to get through these bumps that occur in our lives,’ he said. If members are prepared, they can help themselves and others in times of need, Foster said. When a water main broke in his neighborhood, Foster's family was able to provide drinking water from their supply to a neighbor who needed water to make formula for her baby. The church has a massive warehouse near the airport in Salt Lake City where shelves are stacked tall with boxes of food it uses to stock 143 grocery store-like storehouses it runs across the Americas to provide food to members in need. Not just for welfare: Workers select apples for apple sauce at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welfare Square Cannery, in Salt Lake City. not just for the poor, Mormons have a history ginning up hoarding in times of nationwide paranoia like the Cold War . Fear of end times? At this massive warehouse, shelves are stacked tall with boxes of food the church uses to stock 143 grocery store-like storehouses it runs across the Americas to provide food to members. Each member is likewise taught to always keep a store of food for their family in case of emergency . Foster said the church tries to keep a six-month supply of food for each of the storehouses, a practice that helped it weather the recession when donations dwindled and need spiked. The church sends food from here or one of their smaller regional warehouses to help domestic disaster victims. While food storage has long been a core Mormons belief, the church has had to modernize. The church operates 101 food storage centers where it sells large cans and bags of oats, wheat, sugar, potato flakes and beans, and it recently announced a series of changes at these locations in the U.S. and Canada to ensure that food preparation and packaging is safer. With more stringent guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration about how foods are handled and distributed, the church is now pre-packaging the foods at all but 12 of the centers. Before, church members could go into the centers and pour the flour into bags, or scoop beans into cans. Soup on the selves at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welfare Square. Much of the survival food produced by the church is homemade and grown by Mormons who are themselves taught preparedness as part of church doctrine . These towering silos are as much a symbol of the Mormon people's dedication to feeding the needy as they are a nod to the church's obsession with being prepared to survive disaster scenarios . Much of the food the church stores is homemade. The church owns farms, ranches and dairies and operates canneries. The peanut butter is made from a peanut farm the church owns in Texas. The apple sauce is made from apples at a church orchard in Idaho. Chris Rutter and his family of six found their food stash vital after he lost his job in 2009 when his company made major layoffs during the economic downturn. It took Rutter two years to find full-time work again. During that rough patch, they relied on savings and leaned heavily on the stored food. Rutter's wife, Jodi, made homemade bread, soups and spaghetti sauces from her canned tomatoes, and made gallons of milk last longer by mixing them with powdered milk. They still buy many of their supplies at their nearby storage center, including 50-pound bags of oats and large tins of chocolate milk powder, a family favorite. Jodi Rutter uses the oats, which have a shelf life of five years, to make her own granola, pancakes and cookies. She also buys food in bulk at Costco, keeps an eye out for grocery store coupons and has a garden with tomatoes and zucchini and a peach tree. ‘We honestly never felt like we were going without,’ she said about the period when her husband was unemployed. ‘We always felt so blessed to have enough to feed our kids.’","Mormons have long taught disaster preparedness and now the trend is catching on nationwide .

Far-right Hungarian Gabor Vona arrived in central London today amid protests by anti-fascist groups against a rally planned by his party. The leader of the Jobbik party, who is said to . have links with the far-right British National Party (BNP), was due to speak to expatriates at a venue in Camden today - a day before Holocaust . Memorial Day. But supporters . of the party -  which is accused of holding strong anti-semitic views . and fuelling hatred against Jewish and Roma communities - were blocked . from leaving Holborn station today by anti- fascist protesters. Far-right Hungarian MP Gabor Vona speaks to a crowd in central London today. His party are accused of feulling hatred against Roma and Jewish communities . Anti-Fascist protesters blocked Jobbik supporters trying to leave Holborn Tube Station today. A petition of 14,000 signatures has been delivered to the Home Secretary calling for Vona to be banned from the UK . Police officers lined the roads around the station and erected barriers to prevent clashes between the groups as anti-fascist campaigners waving placards chanted 'Nazi scum, off our streets'. But after more than a hour stood inside the station behind the police officers, the Jobbik supporters retreated. Scotland Yard later confirmed that the event in Camden had been cancelled. Instead, Vona spoke to around 100 supporters at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. London Assembly member and former Labour MP Andrew Dismore had written to Home Secretary Theresa May demanding that Mr Vona, founder of the now-outlawed Magyar Garda Mozgalom paramilitary guard, be banned from holding the event. Mr Dismore, who as a Labour MP founded Holocaust Memorial Day, has called Jobbik 'the most powerful outwardly fascist political party in Europe'. Protestors outside the station today could be heard shouting 'Nazi scum, off our streets' Vona at the rally at Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park. The event was held a day before Holocaust Memorial Day . Speaking outside Holborn station, Mr Dismore said: 'I think it's very important to send the message that we won't have hatred spread on our streets of London by the Hungarian Jobbik party. 'We have laws here against the incitement of race hatred. Jobbik party is a racist party which targets Roma, it wants to segregate them into ghettos, and it targets Jewish people. 'This is so reminiscent in Hungary of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and it should not be allowed to continue in the UK, particularly on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day.' Mr Dismore said the Home Secretary had made 'a grave mistake' by not acting on a petition with more 14,000 signatures which called for Mr Vona to be excluded from the UK. Mr Vona and his party are said to have close links with groups such as the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in Greece and the far-right BNP led by Nick Griffin. Unite Against Fascism (UAF) had urged all anti-fascists and anti-racists to join the protest and oppose any link-up of far-right parties across Europe. Mr Vona and his party are said to have close links with the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in Greece and the far-right BNP led by Nick Griffin . The organisation's joint national secretary, Sabby Dhalu, said: 'UAF has played a central role in driving back fascism in Britain. Jobbik's fascist hatred has no place in a modern society here, or in the rest of Europe. 'Wherever fascists have a presence, racist, anti-semitic and Islamophobic attacks increase.' Mr Vona has previously denied claims he planned to meet members of Greece's Golden Dawn party - who have openly expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler - and the BNP today. His spokeswoman said he planned to host a forum for Hungarian citizens ahead of a forthcoming election. She said that the claims were 'false', adding: 'He has no intention of meeting anyone from Golden Dawn or the British National Party. 'This is a forum for Hungarian citizens. This is not to do with anyone else. Religious Rabbis protesting pro Israeli attacks against Mr Gabor Vona leader of the Hungarian Jobbik party.  Their banner reads: 'Authentic Jewry is Against Zionist Aggression' 'There are lots of Hungarians living in London and the election is coming up in Hungary.' Earlier this month Mr Griffin told reporters that the BNP was likely to forge an alliance with Jobbik and Golden Dawn after the European Parliament elections in May. Mr Griffin travelled to Athens to support Golden Dawn - which has seen a surge in popularity during the country's financial crisis - following accusations it is a criminal organisation. Nick Lowles, chief executive of anti-fascist pressure group Hope Not Hate, said: 'Sadly the Home Secretary Theresa May has failed to ban the noted extremist leader, Gabor Vona, from the shores of the UK. 'That he should be arriving on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day, when his party and its politicians have open and disgusting antisemitic views, is all the more deplorable.' A Metropolitan police spokesman said: 'We were advised that the event at Camden has been cancelled.' He added that the event had not been cancelled the request of police.","Gabor Vona, leader of the Jobbik party, arrived for London rally today .

As well as love, trust and laughter, physical intimacy is a vital factor in any relationship. But one woman who suffers from a rare illness that left her with unbearable pain after sex was forced go without, and had to end her marriage as a result. And now she's sharing her painful tale to help others. Leonie Blackwell, 50, suffered from Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity, which caused burning, swelling, pain and irritation during sexual intercourse. Speaking about the first time she experienced the agony, the Australian told MailOnline: 'It began when I was 23 years old. I . had no idea what was causing such pain, swelling and burning.' Sharing her tale: Leonie Blackwell, 50, discovered that she was allergic to semen when she was 23 years old and has penned a novel to share her tale . She continued: 'I still . remember the first day it happened - and 27 years have passed. I really . needed a doctor to give me answers and when they couldn’t, it compounded . the experience. It was confusing but it was also terrifying. 'Back then very little was known about it and it took me five medical professionals, including three gynaecologists, and two and a half years before I found someone who could tell me what was wrong with me.' Initially it caused cervical dysplasia, and Leonie noticed cells shedding. While this was treated the pain and swelling continued, but no one could explain why. 'I went on in search of answers. Sadly when none were forthcoming I was told it was in my head. By this time the pain was getting worse as was the swelling and burning. I was living in constant pain. I knew it was real I just needed a medical doctor to confirm it. I decided to investigate it myself.' While scouring every gynecological book she could get my hands on, Leonie found a couple of sentences that talked about reactions to semen. 'It was like a light bulb went on, and it enabled me to break down in my mind the reaction I was having instead of being lost in the pain. I realised that was it. Now I had to find someone who would believe me and help me,' she said. Confused: It took Leonie, pictured before her illness, five medical professionals, including three gynaecologists, and two and a half years before she found someone who could tell her what was wrong . Eventually she found a gynaecologist who, without even testing her, listened to her symptoms and said it sounded like she had an allergy to her husband’s semen. 'In that moment I was elated. I had an answer. Now let’s test and confirm it then move on to fixing it was my dominating thought,' said Leonie, who lives in Victoria. The testing process back then was rudimentary, but the conclusion was undeniable. Eagerly she awaited the good news that he had a solution. 'Sadly he informed me that while he could tell me what was wrong with me he had no way of treating it. I was to “live like this for the rest of my life"".' Up to 12 per cent of women experience an allergy to the semen of men . By this time she was having an anaphylactic reaction. The intensity of her allergy was extreme. The doctor’s solution was to use condoms, but the latex created an allergic reaction of its own. Leonie's illness began to affect her marriage. 'The . most difficult part for my husband was that he had no symptoms and wasn’t ill . in any way. It was all happening to me. It was a mortifying experience . for him to find out that it was his semen that caused the reaction. 'You . can only imagine how a man would feel. An act of love caused torturous . pain - not something two young people know how to handle. 'Stuck with a lifelong diagnosis with no solution we were both devastated. Life dreams were wiped. We decided to separate,' said Leonie. But she couldn’t give up and turned to natural therapies to find out if there was something that could be done for her. Helping hand: Leonie has written a book which delves into the injustices of life and how to deal with them positively, to help others . She said: 'While it was important for me to . physically heal and stop my immune system from attacking normal human . proteins, I also had to heal the emotional heartache this experience . bought with it. I have called this experience my own personal Greek . Tragedy, in light of the Greek Mythology stories. 'I . lived with constant pain for seven years and four months, and it was eight . years after my diagnosis that a product came out on the market in . Australia that switched off my auto-immune systems response. 'That . product was Reiishi Mushroom Extract. It is thanks to this product that I . am well today with no signs of having Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity . anymore.' It was this experience that led her to follow a career as a Naturopath specialising in emotional well-being. Leonie has now been working as a Naturopath for . 20 years, and writing of her book - Making Sense of the Insensible: The Ten Injustices of Our Life Lessons, which explores ten injustices and how to deal with them positively - is the next step for her to help . more people.

Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) is a wild mushroom that favors decaying logs in coastal China. The mushroom's active ingredients, called ganoderic acids, appear to combat high blood pressure and reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They may also discourage blood platelets from clumping together, thus reducing the risk of dangerous clots. Preliminary research has shown immune modulating, anti-aging, cardiovascular, antiviral, antibacterial, hypoglycemic, and hepatoprotective effects. Reishi has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 4,000 years to treat asthma, cough, fatigue, insomnia, and weakness. Taken from webvitamins.com .

Overloaded and drifting, this is one of nine craft sharing a load of some 1,100 migrants off the coast of Sicily. The latest wave of asylum seekers had to be rescued after they  were spotted just over 100 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa – where 366 Eritreans drowned in a shipwreck in October. Among those on the flotilla of unpowered craft, including huge inflatables, were at least 50 children. Desperation: One of nine boats carrying the migrants off the coast of Sicily, near where hundreds drowned . The Italian navy dispatched four vessels to rescue the migrants, all of whom are from North Africa, after they were spotted by patrol helicopters. Italy has become a major gateway into Europe for migrants, and sea arrivals more than tripled in 2013 from the previous year, fuelled by Syria’s civil war and strife in the Horn of Africa. October’s tragedy was followed a week later by the deaths of another 200 migrants – mostly Syrians – in  a shipwreck. The rescue on Wednesday came a day before nine people died in a similar bid trying to reach Spanish territory in Morocco. The tragic swimmers were among 200 African migrants who tried to cross to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta from neighbouring Morocco on Thursday, the Spanish government said. Packed: Migrants often drown in failed attempts to reach Europe from North Africa, particularly near Spain . Spain has two enclaves in the north African country, Ceuta and Mellila, and migrants regularly try to reach them either by swimming along the coast or climbing the triple walls that separate them from Morocco. The bodies of eight men and one woman were recovered from Moroccan waters, the Spanish government representative in Ceuta said. The migrants had earlier tried to cross the razor-wire lined frontier, but gave up as Spanish police drove them back, the official added.","The group including at least 50 children were sharing just nine craft .

Pope John Paul II spent decades constantly questioning whether he was worthy of the role, according to private diaries published yesterday. John Paul, who led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005, will be made a saint in April and remains for many Catholics a towering model of faith and commitment. The diaries, which he requested were destroyed, give a glimpse into his private spiritual life, showing a man who never became complacent despite the grandeur of the papacy and his star status among many Catholics.6 . Instead he agonised about whether he was doing enough. His handwritten notes, published as 'John Paul II: I am very much in God's hands. Personal notes 1962-2003', are a series of his reflections rather than a daily diary. Although he played a very active public role in communist-era Poland and as pope, the man born Karol Wojtyla in southern Poland in 1920 rarely referred to public events in these pages. In one note in 1981, the then Cardinal Wojtyla reflected on a theological discussion with other clerics and asked: 'The word of the Lord. Do I love the word of God? Do I live by it? Do I serve it willingly. Help me, Lord, to live by your word,"" he asked. ""Do I serve the Holy Spirit that lives in the Church?' In the same passage, he wrote, alternating between Latin and his native Polish: 'A pure, holy and immaculate sacrifice. This is why He demands from his priests that they should be of undivided heart (celibate) and demands priestly purity. Jesus, help me!' Before his death, John Paul entrusted his diaries to Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, his personal secretary and now a cardinal in the southern city of Krakow, with instructions that they be burned. In the foreword to the book, Dziwisz said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope's private spiritual life. Pope John Paul II pictured with his secretary Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz . 'They reveal the other side of the person whom we knew as .. the pastor of the universal Church,' wrote the cardinal, who was both praised and criticised in Polish Catholic circles after announcing the publication of the book last month. Now available only in Polish, the 638-page book is dominated by deep theological reflections that reveal little of what the pope was otherwise thinking or doing when he wrote them. Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope's private spiritual life . The picture that emerges deepens but does not jar with his public image, in contrast to the posthumous diaries of Mother Teresa - who died in 1997 and was beatified by John Paul in 2003 - that revealed her long periods of doubt about God's existence. Despite the questioning of his own role, there is no sign in the diaries from 1962 to 2003 that the pope's belief in God wavered. The first signs of his questioning appear in comments from 1970 where he wrote: ""Can the misfortunes of people close to me, which have happened recently, be seen as a punishment? As a sign? What can it mean?"" He paid close attention to the skills required of a priest. ""What language do I use when I speak to people?"" he asked in 1974. ""Do I proclaim the Gospel with complete conviction?"" In his final years, debilitated by illness, the pope's entries become sparser and the handwriting less assured. The last entry in 2003 referred to the Biblical story of Jonah, who was ordered by God to preach his word but instead runs away. The pope, who before his final illness travelled tirelessly around the globe preaching the Gospel, wrote in a sloping script in Italian across the bottom of the page: 'Jonah, this is the fear of proclaiming the love of God.' Pope Francis looks at a Harley Davidson motorcycle in June 2013 . Pope Francis helped raised more than £200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed Harley Davidson. The head of the Catholic Church doesn't get much time to cruise around the streets of Rome on the Dyna Super Glide bike. So he decided to auction it off and donate the funds to Caritas Roma, a charity which supports those in need around the world. The 1,585cc Harley Davidson went under the hammer yesterday (Thurs) at Bonhams' Grand Palais auction with an estimate of just £10,000. But the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the Pope became too much for many, sending bidding through the roof. Potential buyers in the room, on the phone and online battled it out for the bike, with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro (£83,000) mark. Bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction, paying a staggering 210,000 euros (£175,000). Premiums took the final price to £200,976. Next up came the Pope's biker jacket, which sold for a staggering £47,851 - bringing his charity sales to almost £250,000. The staggering sale had similarities to when a US casino owner paid £127,000 for Pope Benedict XVI's Volkswagen Golf in 2005.","John Paul led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005 .

A couple whose Navy SEAL son was killed in Afghanistan have joined a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government over the National Security Agency's collection of Verizon phone records. Charles and Mary Anne Strange joined the suit, which seeks billions in damages, after it was filed in federal court in D.C. on Sunday, accusing Obama's administration of breaching the privacy of millions of Americans. The couple, from Philadelphia, lost their 25-year-old son Michael in a helicopter crash on August 6, 2011 while he served in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . In pursuit: Charles Strange and his wife Mary Anne, whose Navy SEAL son Michael was killed in Afghanistan, have joined a class action against the government as they believe their phone was tapped . Killed in action: Michael Strange, 25, died when his helicopter went down in Afghanistan in 2011 . Mr Strange told CBS: 'Somebody has to be held accountable for . my son’s death. Thirty brave Americans, the biggest loss in the Afghan . war. 'And that’s when I started asking questions, that’s when my phone . got tapped.' The grieving father, from Torresdale, said he heard strange tapping noises during calls and received text messages from unknown numbers in the months after his son died. Mr Strange believes that he was among the millions of Verizon customers being monitored by the NSA because he has been highly critical of the Obama administration. The couple believe that their son's helicopter could have been shot down by insurgents in retaliation for the killing of Osama Bin Laden three months earlier, ABC reported. Mr Strange claims that when he reported the odd tapping to Verizon and the messages, an employee told him that someone was listening in the U.S. and Afghanistan. The couple are outraged at being monitored by the government, having done nothing wrong. The Stranges were part of group of families who previously filed a lawsuit against the government over the helicopter crash where 38 died including members of their son's SEAL Team and other U.S. and Afghan troops. The families of the deceased servicemen have claimed there was a cover-up and questioned the official report, according to CNN. Evidence? Mr Strange points to the text and call on his phone from the unknown number . Watching: Mr Strange said that a Verizon employee told him his phone was being monitored . The suit, against President Obama, the NSA and Justice Department, was originally filed by attorney Larry Klayman who founded Freedom Watch, a political advocacy group. Mr Klayman, a former federeal prosecutor, also plans to file a lawsuit on Thursday against Facebook, Google, Microsoft and six other companies for their allegedly complicity. The NSA's practice of monitoring customers was revealed by former employee Edward Snowden who has since fled his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong. Last week, the Guardian newspaper in the UK . reported that the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 . issued an order granting the NSA permission to collect telephone records . of millions of Verizon customers. The order was good until July 19, the . newspaper said. The order requires Verizon, one of the . nation’s largest telecommunications companies, on an 'ongoing, daily . basis' to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its . systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, a former NSA employee, blew the cover on the government's monitoring of thousands of U.S. citizens . Big Brother is watching: The NSA program PRISM collects data on millions of internet users . The American Civil Liberties Union also sued the Obama administration on Tuesday, asking the government to halt its phone-tracking program that it says is unconstitutional. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York by the American Civil Liberties Union, along with the New York Civil Liberties Union. 'The practice is akin to snatching every American’s address book – with annotations detailing whom we spoke to, when we talked, for how long, and from where,' the lawsuit says. '“It gives the government a comprehensive record of our associations and public movements, revealing a wealth of detail about our familial, political, professional, religious, and intimate associations.' The lawsuit – which names as defendants the heads of national intelligence as well as the agencies they lead, including the National Security Agency, the FBI, the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice – also asks the court to purge phone records collected under the program, claiming the government action violates the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution. The Department of Justice did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Obama has defended the program and says privacy must be balanced with security. The ACLU claims standing as a former customer of Verizon, adding that the government likely has much of its metadata stored in its databases. The suit also alleges the government’s program exceeds the congressional authority provided by the Patriot Act and singles out a particular provision that has given the government more leeway in obtaining various records for intelligence investigations.","Charles and Mary Anne Strange, from Philadelphia, said they heard strange tapping on the line in the months after son Michael's death .

A winter storm dumped several inches of wet, heavy snow on parts of the eastern United States on Monday, snarling commutes and Super Bowl fans' trips home, closing schools and government offices, cutting power and delaying or canceling more than 7,000 flights across the country. Fat flakes fell in Philadelphia and New York, creating slushy sidewalks and streets and all but erasing all memory of Sunday's temperatures in the 50s. The storm began moving out of the region Monday afternoon, making way for another system expected to sweep in from the Plains with ice and snow late Tuesday and early Wednesday. The National Weather Service reported about 8 inches of snow near Frostburg, Md., while parts of southern Ohio and West Virginia got about 10 inches.

Speed limits were reduced on many major highways. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency with travel conditions hazardous. Nonessential government employees were dismissed early. By late afternoon, the flight-tracking website FlightAware reported more than 4,300 delayed flights and 1,900 canceled flights nationwide in cities including Philadelphia, Newark, N.J., and New York. Inbound flights to those airports were delayed one to three hours because of snow and ice. Russ Louderback, of Fishers, Ind., and his 11-year-old son Mason had gone to New Jersey to see the Super Bowl but suffered a triple whammy of bad luck: Their beloved Denver Broncos lost, they got stuck in an hours-long traffic jam leaving the stadium and their Monday afternoon flight home was canceled. 'It was so congested we couldn't get out of New Jersey, even though we left early because our team lost,' said Louderback, a hotel executive. Delayed: The flights that weren't cancelled due to snow were delayed, in some cases up to several hours . Super Storm: Many of those in New York to attend the Super Bowl on Sunday were stuck in the airport for hours waiting through flight delays . Arizona Gov.

Shiley, a Seattle season ticket holder, had won a lottery for Super Bowl tickets. He and his buddy stayed in Philadelphia, about 85 miles southwest of the East Rutherford, N.J., stadium. 'It's been a great trip. I joked that `It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' - and it was, until today,' said Shiley, referring to the FX sitcom. At least two deaths and one serious injury were blamed on the storm. In western Kentucky, where the snow began falling Sunday, a man died that night when his car skidded into a snowplow. On Monday, a New York City man was fatally struck by a backhoe that was moving snow.

I was gasping into the oxygen mask because the pain was so bad. I had lost feeling but experiencing something like pins and needles, but 100 times worse.’ She was taken to Southport Hospital where doctors first suspected she was suffering from a blood clot. Despite her dramatic recovery, Mrs Johnson still suffers weakness in her legs and has limited bladder control . When the abscess burst it filled Mrs Johnson's body with poison meaning she was in agonising pain and had to be given strong antibiotics . She was transferred to the Walton Centre in Liverpool for exploratory surgery that evening, when it was determined that the jolt in the car had burst an undiscovered abscess in her lower spine, spreading pus throughout her back and lower body. She said: ‘I was delirious and screaming at the doctors, begging them to chop my legs off because the pain was so bad. ‘Poison from the abscess was attacking my body and killing my nerves. I was put on intravenous antibiotics because there was a lot of poison in my blood. ‘I was scared, but Alan was terrified.’ Mrs Johnson says when she first fell ill she told her husband-to-be to leave her so he didn't have to care for her . After a month in hospital Mrs Johnson was able to return home in a wheelchair, having been warned that much of the damage was irreversible. While the pins and needles had subsided, numbness had spread across her buttocks and legs, and she experienced stabbing pains. Her legs felt too heavy to move. Devastated, she considered freeing Alan from his responsibility of care. She said: ‘We had big plans for our wedding. We had day-dreamed of an ice hotel or a cruise before settling on a nice local hotel which all our friends and family could get to. ‘But now I couldn’t use my legs at all, and I couldn’t control my bladder. All I saw when I looked in the mirror was a complete mess. I told Alan I didn’t expect him to have to cope. ‘I reassured him that my family would be able to look after me and asked him to walk away. ‘Alan wouldn’t hear a minute of it. He told me he would always be there to look after me and he wasn’t going anywhere. ‘There were tears and lots of hugging. It was such a relief to hear that Alan would stay by my side. He’s done so much to get me through.’ Mrs Johnson, supported by Alan, a farm manager, her daughter Heather, 22, son Mark, 26, and Alan’s daughter Georgia, 18, and son Connor, 16, began an intensive course of physiotherapy. She said: ‘I began by simply moving over to the side of the bed. Then, slowly, I tried standing. I was so wobbly because I couldn’t feel my legs. They were strangely heavy. It was a very weird feeling. ‘The physiotherapists give me a Zimmer frame, but after two steps I was exhausted. Every day they tried to push me a little bit more. Mrs Johnson said: 'My whole life has completely changed and I had to go through a grieving process before I came to terms with that. I had to face the fact I couldn't work anymore' ‘I knew I had the wedding coming up, and that gave me the determination to keep going.’ Finally, on November 11, 2011, Mrs Johnson was able to walk to Alan as he waited at the altar. She said: ‘Heather sang a song called The Promise which we’d first heard when Alan proposed at Disneyland. Considering what we’d been through, the song was perfect. ‘We chose Love of My Life by The Dooleys for our first dance. It’s quite a fast song. It wasn’t until the DJ announced that the song was coming on that I realised I should have chosen a slower ballad instead - something which would have been easier to sway to. ‘We still managed to dance for a few seconds before Heather brought everyone onto the floor to join us.’ Mrs Johnson said: 'Me and Alan are so happy together. He has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible. Now, I'm not bothered by it. I just get on with life' Mrs Johnson, who has been diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome, is no longer in physiotherapy and has come to terms with the fact that she will never gain full control over her lower body. Cauda equina syndrome is caused by compression of the nerves in the spine and results in bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, loss of sensation and weakness in the legs. She said: ‘I try and walk a little bit each day to prevent muscle wastage. The lack of bowel and bladder control isn’t brilliant but I have systems in place to help me manage. I have a little bit more control back. ‘My whole life has completely changed and I had to go through a grieving process before I came to terms with that. I had to face the fact I couldn’t work anymore. ‘Me and Alan are so happy together. He has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible. ‘Now, I’m not bothered by it. I just get on with life.’","Belinda Johnson, 54, lost the feeling in her legs when an undetected abscess in her spine suddenly burst spreading poison through her body .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . PUBLISHED: . 04:22 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 3 November 2013 . Appeal: Abdulla Ahmed Ali, mastermind of the 'liquid bomb plot', has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights for his life sentence to be overturned. The mastermind behind the 'liquid bomb plot', one of the most deadly terrorist plans ever to be unearthed in Britain, is making a bid to have his conviction overturned on human rights grounds. Abdulla Ahmed Ali developed a home-made hydrogen peroxide bomb that could be disguised as a soft drink and taken on board a plane. He and a group of associates planned to take the bombs aboard seven flights. The discovery of his suicide plan in 2006 led to urgent changes to international restrictions on carrying fluids on to planes. However, the al-Qaeda terrorist now claims his human rights were infringed by publicity before he was convicted for life for conspiracy to murder - and has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. He argues that the jury would have been prejudiced by coverage of a previous trial. Although the Strasbourg court does not hold the power to quash the conviction, it would be extremely problematic for the Government if they ruled in the terrorist's favour. If Ali wins his case it would allow him and fellow plotters to begin an attempt in British to have their convictions quashed, using the European ruling to convince judges that their convictions were not fair. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said the case highlighted why there was an urgent need for reform to human rights laws. 'Suicide video': Ali and his associates posted a video that boasted of his airline bomb plot, which would have seen the group attempt to smuggle the bombs on to seven flights . He also the case was evidence that the Strasbourg court was increasingly willing to interfere in Britain's justice system. 'This yet a further example of why things cannot go on as they are', he said. 'It is unacceptable to have a situation in which claims to the European Court of Human Rights are actually being used to undermine our justice system. 'Our justice system is one of the best in the world and the Strasbourg court has no business telling us how to run it.' Although British judges at the Court of Appeal have ruled the case deserve a hearing, . the European Court has examined Ali's application. It has . allowed it through the first stage of consideration for a full hearing, . according to the Sunday Telegraph. His case has been adjourned because more information was needed. Supplies: A picture of several empty bottles found at the group's East London base, that was shown to a jury at Woolwich Crown Court . Appeal: Co-conspirator Tanvir Hussain . Four of Ali's co-conspirators have attempted to take cases to Strasbourg. However, so far they have all been thrown out. In three of the cases . it was because their lawyers made a mistake and missed appeal deadlines. The fourth case was submitted several months . late. The . applications by Tanvir Hussain, jailed for at least 32 years; Umar . Islam, jailed for a minimum of 22 years and Ibrahim Savant, jailed for . at least 20 . years, were ruled inadmissible by the Strasbourg judges. Representing the men, and responsible for the last appeal papers, were Tuckers . Solicitors. Duncan Lewis Solicitors, the lawyers . for Waheed Zaman, serving a minimum of 20 years, also submitted the . papers late. Eight men were convicted for their involvement in the plot to blow up aircraft with liquid bombs after three trials. The government has now been asked . by judges in Europe to answer a series of questions about Ali's . prosecution. They said they wish to establish whether he had a 'fair trial by an impartial . tribunal' as required under Article 6 of the European Convention on . Human Rights. Ali, now 33, was convicted of . conspiracy to endanger the safety of an aircraft in his first trial in . 2008. However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of . conspiracy to murder. He was therefore re-trialled at Woolwich Crown Court, London, in . September 2009. There he was convicted of both charges and . jailed for life -  with a minimum term of 40 years. 'Adverse publicity' generated by . the media between his 2008 trial and his retrial a year later is the reason Ali claims his human rights were breached. During the trials, it was revealed how Ali and a group of associates recorded 'suicide videos' at a flat in Walthamstow, east London. The videos revealed his plot to bring down . airliners with bombs smuggled in soft drink containers. During the footage it was said the was intended to 'teach a lesson' that non-Muslims 'will never forget'. Ali singled out seven flights to San Francisco, Toronto, Montreal, Washington, New York and Chicago that departed within two-and-a-half hours of each other and said his group would taken the explosives on board. If successful, the explosions could have exceeded the carnage of the September 11 attacks. When Ali was arrested he had a computer . memory stick in his pocket that highlighted seven flights from London . to North American cities that were each carrying hundreds of passengers . and crew. Security sources believed the group were also planning a further attack involving 18 suicide . bombers which could have killed 5,000 people in the air and the same number on the ground. At the time it was revealed that the men had gathered enough chemicals to make 20 liquid bombs. Investigating and prosecuting the . conspiracy has already cost the taxpayer more than Â£100million and Ali's . legal challenge will push the bill higher.","Abdulla Ahmed Ali developed a home-made hydrogen peroxide bomb that could be disguised as a soft drink and taken aboard a plane .

A clerical error has been blamed for the demolition of a historic building in downtown St Louis made famous by an iconic mural of a hippie. The 1890 structure that at one time housed a saloon stood in a protected district, and the garage door's fresco of a hippie named Beardy McGreen flashing a peace sign, had been something of a local attraction since 2006. The building was razed in December without the required city review because a city employee incorrectly entered its address, putting the structure outside the historical district where all demolition applications are subject to review. Razed to the ground: This historic 19th century building in downtown St Louis featuring the beloved caricature of Beardy McGreen was demolished in December due to a clerical error . Doomed: The long-vacant structure that once housed a saloon and a butcher shop was destroyed without the required review because a city employee incorrectly entered its address into a database . As the edifice was being knocked down by a work crew, Beardy's image was torn from the building and cast off in a pile of bricks – but the mural was later salvaged and re-purposed, according to St Louis Dispatch. The massive peacenik caricature measuring 12 feet x 13.5 feet was created and named in November 2006 by local stencil artist Peat Wollaeger as developers sought to boost the rundown Chouteau's Landing district. The 19th century building at 818 South 4th Street originally was home to Max Risch Saloon and the John Gass Butcher Shop. It was part of the South Fourth Street Commercial District, which had been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The designation requires all demolition permits to be reviewed by the city Cultural Resources Office. On the inside: These images show the interior of the old building, which had been stripped down to the studs but still appeared relatively sound, save for some shaky floorboards . Toss in the trash: Stencil artist Peat Wollaeger's mural of the peacenik Beardy McGreen was torn from the building and cast off in a pile of bricks . Rescued: The dented garage door bearing the likeness of the beloved hippie was salvaged by local businessman Scott Rinaberger . ‘A manual data entry transfer between two databases was made incorrectly, causing the permit application to appear to be for a structure not entitled to review,’ said Don Roe, the city's director of Planning and Urban Design. Roe said he has since altered the process to ensure against errors in the future. ‘I just think it's crazy how each one of these buildings in St. Louis is going away,’ Wollaeger said. ""I thought the (mural) was going to spark something in that neighborhood.’ Property owner Terrence C. McDonald said the interior of the long-vacant building, which had been stripped down to the studs some years ago, was hollow, damp and beyond repair. However, the conservation blog Vanishing STL shared photos in December showing the inside of the historic structure looking relatively sound, save for a few spots where the floorboards were deteriorating. McDonald now plans to turn the property into a parking lot. Second chance: Beardy found a new home in Rinaberger's School of Rock music education site in Kirkwood . Plans for the future: The owner of the property site intends to turn the site into a parking lot . Scott Rinaberger heard about the demolition and wanted the mural for his new School of Rock music education site in Kirkwood. He drove to the site and saw the empty space where the iconic former saloon once stood. ‘You killed Beardy,’ Rinaberger remembered saying. But luck was on his side that day: he saw a pile of rubble, and in it was Beardy McGreen still flashing his peace sign. ‘We were able to salvage most of him,’ Rinaberger said. The hippie now takes up most of a wall in the school's main performance studio. On December 23, Rinaberger posted an update on the School of Rock's Facebook page: 'Beardy McGreen is resting comfortably. He is in for a lot of pounding and bending but should pull through.’","The 1890 structure on South 4th Street in historic part of downtown St Louis once housed a saloon and butcher shop .

Restrained: The Mayor of London said firearms officers had attended 10,000 incidents in the last four years . Boris Johnson praised Scotland Yard’s armed police units as ‘fantastically restrained’ yesterday. The Mayor of London said firearms officers were deployed to around 10,000 incidents over the last four years, and only fired their weapons on six occasions. Mr Johnson was among several senior political figures who rallied round the Metropolitan Police following the Duggan inquest verdict. David Cameron appealed for a calm response from family and supporters to the verdict that Duggan was lawfully killed by a police marksman. The Prime Minister said he hoped people would respect the ‘proper judicial process’ and welcomed the stance taken by Duggan’s aunt Carole, who said she wanted ‘no more violence’. Mr Cameron also backed a proposal to make armed officers wear cameras and microphones to record their actions. ‘We have to respect judicial processes in this country, we have to respect the outcome of trials and the work that juries do,’ the Prime Minister told BBC London. ‘I very much respect Mark Duggan’s aunt for saying they want to pursue their case through the courts rather than on the streets, I think that’s absolutely right.’ Mr Cameron acknowledged there was still some racial prejudice in the UK but said efforts were being made to ‘break down the barriers’. He said: ‘We are on a journey, we haven’t cracked all these problems. There is still racial prejudice, there is still discrimination. ‘But I think what you can see is governments of all colours, whether Labour or Conservative, have been trying to break down these barriers and try to make sure that people are valued for  the passion in their heart and  the thoughts in their head rather than the colour of their skin or their sexuality. Protection: David Cameron called for armed officers to wear cameras and microphones on duty . ‘We have made huge progress over the years but there is always more to do.’ Mr Johnson expressed his  sympathy for Duggan’s family, but emphasised the ‘incredible pressure’ under which armed police operate. ‘On any given day highly trained Met firearms officers can and do face life-threatening situations in which they have to make instant judgements under incredible pressure,’ the mayor said. Deputy Prime Minister: Nick Clegg said there were 'questions to be asked' about how investigations into police shootings are handled . ‘Our police were deployed to armed responses about 10,000 times in the last four years, and only on six occasions have they actually fired their weapons, discharged police weapons. ‘No police operation begins with the intention of ending with the loss of life of a member of the  public. And I just would stress that if you look at how our police operate they are fantastically restrained, and those split-second decisions are all the more difficult if someone is clearly carrying a lethal weapon.’ However, a leading Government crime adviser blamed the police reaction to the shooting for widespread riots in London in 2011. Shaun Bailey, a former aide to David Cameron, said their failure to speak directly with the Duggan family, coupled with the mixed messages coming out of Scotland Yard in the aftermath of the killing, made people take to the streets across the country. ‘They should have had one  very senior officer, who was speaking to the Press and the public alone, and not had all these different conflicting stories coming out,’ he said. ‘They should have gone straight to the family and dealt with the family directly – that’s the kind of thing that started the riot, and not the fact that Mark Duggan had been shot.’ Nick Clegg said there were ‘questions to be asked’ about how investigations into police shootings are handled. The Deputy Prime Minister said that while he ‘totally understood’ the angry reaction to the finding in some quarters, he wanted to stress that the case had been considered by a jury. He said: ‘This is a jury made up of people randomly selected just like anyone else who has been called up for jury service. ‘It is not the police acting as judge and jury.’","Mayor of London said firearms officers were sent out 10,000 times .

Women have been trying to figure out what men want for decades, devouring dating tomes such as Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus in the hope they might bring them closer to the answer. Today, new research promises to offer an insight into the mysterious workings of a man's heart. A study of 2,000 men has revealed that the 'perfect . girlfriend' is 5ft 5in tall, drinks white wine, has no tattoos and . supports Manchester United. When it comes to appearance men want their girlfriend to resemble Kelly Brook . The survey by dating app company LOVOO also found that men go for a woman with an Irish accent and who drive a Mini Cooper. And it's bad news for single vegetarians, with the majority of men agreeing that they like a girl who enjoys meat and loves a roast dinner. Ladies can breath a small sigh of relief when it comes to weight though, with men's expectations not being too unrealistic, preferring a woman who weighs a healthy 9st 2lbs, and has a bra size of 34C. Single men also had an opinion as to what their dates should be watching, possibly to avoid any scraps over the remote control? Their first choice was Game of Thrones, followed by Coronation Street, Friends and then Match of the Day. Guys prefer a girlfriend who lists 'Match of the Day' as one of their favourite programmes . When it comes to films, Dirty Dancing is their ideal girl's film of choice and rock is her favourite music genre. They don't want her sitting around watching too many Patrick Swayze classics though. The survey revealed that they would rather date a hard-working woman, with a nurse and teacher being the top professions of choice. When asked what celebrity would best resemble their perfect girlfriend, Kelly Brook took the lead followed by Cheryl Cole, Jessica Ennis and Denise Van Outen. A spokesman for LOVOO said that the men's choices may be slightly unrealistic and that they should keep their options open: 'It seems that British men have very specific tastes for a girl to live up to. 'We know that everyone has a favourite hair colour and sometimes even eye colour and height, with brown hair being the colour of choice in this instance. 'But we think that avoiding a woman because she might support an opposing football team or enjoy a different genre of films to you, might be being a bit too picky.' They went on to say that having too many specific ideas of the perfect partner is the reason why some men may be finding it difficult to find a partner. 'We encourage meeting up with people you share interests with, but suggest not being too strict as you might find that you get to learn something new. 'Avoiding a woman because she might . support an opposing football team or enjoy a different genre of films to . you, might be being a bit too picky.' Benjamin Bak, LOVOO . 'Dating is fun and shouldn't become a chore or make you feel as though you won't ever find ""the one"". Being more open to new things will certainly help you find that perfect girlfriend.' Thankfully there were some things that men were happy to keep their options open about. Their perfect partner enjoys a wide range of hobbies, including reading and travelling. They also want a woman with a full social life who loves to go to bars with their friends and enjoys going to concerts. When it comes to sex, men want their perfect girlfriend to . be adventurous in the bedroom, and be happy to embark in a bit of . role play as well as enjoy experimenting with different positions. Although men want a girl who can impress them, the study revealed it is . also important  for their girlfriend to get on with the other most . important woman in their life - their mum. Open minded: Men prefer a woman who will experiment in the bedroom . Despite their rather specific desires, such as preferring women to wear miniskirts or skinny jeans, three quarters of the single men said they don't think they will meet their perfect woman and will have to compromise instead. And it appears that a lot of men have already learned the art of compromise with two in five men in a relationship believing that their current wife or girlfriend isn't the perfect woman for them. The spokesman added: 'It is very surprising that so many men who are currently in a relationship, feel as though they aren't with the right woman for them. 'And it's sad to see that some single men don't believe the perfect woman exists. 'We want to show these men that we don't agree, there is someone out there for everyone. 'And if they're lucky they might even find their perfect woman in time for Valentine's Day.'","A dating company survey has revealed what a man's idea of a perfect girl is .

Heading to a kitchen near you: Coca-Cola is planning to allow customers to make their soda at home after buying a stake in a company which is developing a new carbonation machine . The deal comes as SodaStream makes a concerted effort to cement its place as the leading at-home carbonation machine in U.S. kitchens. Shares of Green Mountain soared 42 per . cent to $114.85 in extended trading earlier this week, while those of its likely new . rival, SodaStream International Ltd, retreated 3.9 per cent to $34.39. Green Mountain's Keurig machine popularised the use of pods - small packets containing everything from coffee, tea or hot chocolate powder - for easy, in-home, one-cup brewing of hot drinks. The company has sold more than 30 million Keurig machines around the world for use in homes, offices and other locations. The deal will make Green Mountain the global exclusive partner for the production and sale of Coke's branded single-serve, pod-based cold beverages, the companies said.

New territory: Coca-Cola has bought a 10 per cent stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc for $1.25 billion which would help launch Green Mountain's new cold drink machine planned for release as soon as October . Coca-Cola was first invented in 1886 by John Pemberton, a pharmacist working in Atlanta, who sold the drink in his shop. The recipe would remain a closely guarded secret, partly to deter imitators and partly to add to the mystique of the world's first superstar soda. The closest the company itself has come to divulging its recipe was the admission that it originally included cocaine, although the narcotic was removed in the early 1900s. Coke's popularity did not take off until the business was bought by Asa Griggs Candler, who decided to expand beyond Atlanta in the 1890s. He travelled around America distributing coupons for the drink to lure in new customers, and paid for pharmacies to redecorate themselves with Coca-Cola paraphernalia. The drink was first bottled, as opposed to being dispensed directly from soda fountains, in 1894, allowing it to be drunk at home - and giving the product a distinct brand identity with its trademark curved bottle. A spokesman for Pepsi declined comment. 'We'll do deals with brands consumers love,' said Kelley, who added that Green Mountain has coffee deals with most major chains, including Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts . 'We are really excited to start with Coca-Cola,' said Kelley, who came to Green Mountain from the world's largest soda maker, where he was viewed as a product-savvy executive with expertise in product and supply chain management. Green Mountain's cold drink machine is scheduled to debut in fiscal 2015, which begins in October this year. Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said on the call that the deal would give his company access to new business opportunities. He added that it would enhance Coca-Cola's bottling system and that its bottlers would have a complimentary role. 'This gives Green Mountain a beverage partner with some hugely powerful global brands. For Coke, it gives them access to some really cool, new cutting-edge pod cold-beverage technology,' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. Sicher said soda sales in the United States have been in decline since 2005, while growth in pod-based coffee brewing has boomed. Under the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire roughly 16.7 million newly issued shares of Green Mountain. Blow: The deal comes as SodaStream makes a concerted effort to cement its place in U.S. kitchens . The new shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted average price as of market close. Coca-Cola has the option to increase its minority stake up to 16 per cent through open market purchases of Green Mountain common stock during the first 36 months, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola said. The significant after-hours move in Green Mountain's stock appeared to be a classic short squeeze as traders who bet against the stock scrambled to cover their positions. David Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc., was among investors with short positions in Green Mountain as of October 15. Greenlight's spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on Wednesday. The most recent data from Nasdaq, which dates to January 15, had short interest in Green Mountain at about 25 per cent of shares outstanding - about 37.6 million shares. Green Mountain also plans to launch a new hot drink brewing system this fall. Called Keurig 2.0, it will use both single-serve K-Cups and larger-sized K-Carafe packs that brew 28 ounces of coffee.","Drinks giant has bought 10% stake in coffee company for $1.25billion .

Apology: Australian prime minister Julia Gillard has apologised for the forced adoptions scandal . The Australian government has finally apologised for the scandal of the forced adoptions that took place between the 1950s and the 1980s when hundreds of single mothers were made to give up their babies to married couples. Victims of the controversial programme, which saw newborns taken away before their mothers even had a chance to hold them in their arms, wept and hugged one another as newly re-elected Prime Minister Julia Gillard formally said sorry. More than 800 children and parents harmed through the programme gathered in Canberra to hear Miss Gillard tell them that the parliament took responsibility and apologised for the policies and practices that tore mothers from their babies. The policy, she said in a powerful, emontionally-charged speech, ‘created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering.’ It was, she told them, ‘a wound that would not heal.’ The crowd applauded as she told the tearful gathering: ‘We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children.’ They had not been legally or socially acknowledged as the mothers of children taken from them and as a result were deprived of care and support. ‘You were given false assurances, you were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal.’ Scroll down for video . Hurt: Hundreds of single mothers had their babies taken away from them to be given to married couples . Moving: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard, left, is embraced by a woman during the historic national apology in Parliament . Miss Gillard said: 'Friends, as the time for birth came, these babies would be snatched . away before they had even held them in their arms. ‘Sometimes, consent was achieved by . forgery or fraud. Sometimes women signed adoption papers whilst under . the influence of medication. ‘Most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best. ‘The hurt did not simply last for a few days or weeks. This was a wound that would not heal.’ Among the children who were taken were those who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their adoptive parents or institutions. Touching: Australia apologised for the brutal and often illegal forced adoption of tens of thousands of babies born mostly to unmarried mothers between the 1950s and 1970s . New chapter: The Labour Party leader's victory follows months of slipping polls and internal tensions . Many mothers had been drugged and . shackled to their beds in a practice carried out by government . officials, hospitals, churches and charities. Angela Barra, 45, who had been involved in the campaign to get the Australian government to apologise, was herself adopted as a newborn. She was reunited with her natural mother 20 years ago after responding to a newspaper phone in. In an interview with ABC she said: 'I've personally never liked being adopted. I didn't like being special and I was told I was a special child. 'I remember as a teenager having conversations with mum and she always spoke lovingly about my natural mother she always said she must have loved you very much to give you up. 'As a young person you don't really understand how that makes sense because at a subconscious level and as an adult I can articulate that conflict in me but I didn't have the words for it when I was young it came out more in my behaviour.' 'But if she loved me so much then why did she give me up?' Speaking outside the hall following the apology, she said: 'A lot of upset mothers in there lost their children because of demand for babies. 'People were forced to give their babies up; they were drugged, they were shackled to their beds ... they didn't relinquish their babies; their babies were taken.' As part of her apology, Miss Gillard . announced that $5 million (£3.4 million) would be provided to improve . access to specialist support and to help records-tracing and mental . health care for those affected by forced adoption. In a report released last year, the . Senate said there had been as many as 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and . 1975, but it was impossible to know how many were forced. The seven-member Senate committee . began investigating the federal government's role in forced adoption in . 2010 after the Western Australian state parliament apologised to mothers . and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s . until the 1980s. Western Australia was the first of . five state and territory governments to apologise for forced adoption. Australia has eight such governments. Miss Christine Cole, head of the . Apology Alliance, set up to help forced-adoption victims, said after the . Prime Minister’s speech that the apology had been a long time coming. ‘I had my baby taken from me in 1969 . and I think the use of the term “forced adoption” polarises the actual . phenomena of what was going on,’ she said. ‘What was going on was kidnapping . children, kidnapping newborn babies from their mothers at the birth, . using pillows and sheets to cover their face, drugging them as I was . drugged, with drugs like sodium pentothal, chloral hydrate and other . mind-altering barbiturates. ‘It was cruel, it was punitive and . then often the mother was transported, like I was, away from the . hospital so you had no access to your baby.' Despite the Prime Minister’s apology . being mostly welcomed, one woman who identified herself only as ‘Sydney’ said her husband’s adopted parents were told by a social worker in 1972 . that his mother was a 15-year-old girl who had a boyfriend at school . and who was unable to keep her baby. But her husband had found out just . this week that the mother was in fact 19-years-old from a farming . community and was the victim of a rape. When her husband, who had been raised . to believe that his parents brought him into the world with love, found . out the truth about his background, Sydney said ‘he burst out crying’. She added: ‘His birth mother didn’t know who the birth father was. He was a predator. Social workers all along had been lying.’ Breaking with the past: An Aboriginal elder performed a traditional welcome before the politician apologised . National shame: Unwed mothers were pressured, deceived and threatened into giving up their babies . Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbot . said: ‘I cannot imagine a grief greater than that of a parent and a . child parted from one another.’ The announcement comes just a few . weeks after the Irish government apologised for Magdalene homes scandal . in which thousands of young women were forcibly placed in catholic-run . asylums which were little more than workhouses.

Vice President Joe Biden has now said that there is no reason for him not to run for president except for the fact that he likes driving his own car. 'There may be reasons why I don't run, but there's no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run,' Biden told CNN. Biden has been plagued by questions about whether or not he will be running for President a third time in 2016, and he has stuck to his standing line about how has not yet decided. No reason not to: Vice President Biden said that he needs to see the field and see if he is the only person that would fight for middle class values and a sound foreign policy . 'For me the decision to run or not run is going to be determined by me as to whether I am the best qualified person to focus on the two things I've spent my whole life on: giving ordinary people a fighting chance to make it and a sound foreign policy that's based on rational interests of the United States where we not only are known for the power of our military but the power of our example,' he said. Biden, who is 71 and will be 73 at the time of the next election, previously said that he and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, had not had a formal conversation about 2016 and this time he took a different tact in answering the same question. 'After I ran the first time, she didn't want me to run again. The second time, she came to me and said you've gotta run. The reason she wanted me to run was because she was convinced if I ran we'd end the war in Iraq and have a sounder foreign policy and she was convinced if I ran I would work like hell to make sure the middle class got a fighting chance,' Biden told CNN on Thursday. 'I think the future for this country- I . know people think I'm too optimistic, but it is incredible and there is . so much just within our grasp.' Addressing the issue: Biden gave himself the deadline of 'a year this summer' to figure out if he will run . He said that his best bet on a deadline for the decision would be that he will have a verdict by 'realistically, a year this summer' which would give him just over a year to launch a formal campaign. 'Doesn't mean I'm the only guy who can do it, but no one else I think can, and I think I can then I'll run. If I don't I won't.' The obvious other competitor that he will- or won't- be facing is Hillary Clinton. The former Secretary of State is also mulling her decision about 2016, but her polling numbers and formal fundraising operation are significantly more suggestive of a run. The bevy of recent polls matching the various Republican candidates up with one likely Democrat all use Clinton as that figure, and the most recent take on the possible Democratic primary line up- done by Quinnipiac on January 31- has Biden with 9 per cent of the vote as compared to Clinton's 64 per cent.","Vice president has not ruled out running for the top spot in 2016, which would be his third try for the presidency .

A high school math teacher from Pennsylvania has been charged with having sex with a student and sending the 17-year-old inappropriate text messages and videos. Erica Ann Ginnetti, a 33-year-old married mother of three, was arraigned Friday on more than a dozen charges of institutional sexual assault, corruption of minor and disseminating obscene materials to a minor. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland High School first approached the victim last May during the senior prom, inviting him to come work out at her gym. Erica Ann Ginnetti, 33, a high school math teacher and married mother of three, has been charged with more than a dozen counts of institutional sexual assault, corruption of minor and disseminating obscene materials to a minor . A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, the educator sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the male student met for coffee in a Philadelphia Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in in the teacher's car.

A video posted to YouTube takes pranking to a horrifying new level as a young man who accepts a lift from a Los Angeles bus stop witnesses what he believes to be a mafia hit. The prankster, Josh Paler Lin, has a YouTube channel dedicated to his passions - 'house music, comedy and pranks' - and the video has been viewed more that half a million times in two days. For his latest prank, Lin took one very unlucky passenger on a terrifying ride in which he pretends to be a mafia hitman. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bus stop buddies: Cody (right) starts a conversation with the unsuspecting Josh (left) Free ride: Lin pulls up and offers a lift to Cody and Josh, who at first declines but is finally convinced . So far, so normal: Josh introduces himself to Josh Lin, the prankster . While waiting at a bus stop, a young man known only as Josh is approached by another commuter who introduces himself as Cody and makes small talk. The two discover they're waiting for the same bus when a driver, Lin, recognizes Cody pulls up and offers him a lift. Cody asks if his new friend can come with them, and though Josh demurs at first, he finally accepts the ride from Lin. Early into the drive screaming and banging can be heard coming from the trunk. Lin tells Cody it's a man who owes his boss $60,000 and that, 'he's not supposed to wake up,' Pure, authentic fear and panic begins to appear on Josh's face. Lin pulls over to quieten down the man in the trunk, baseball bat in hand, and returns to the car satisfied there won't be any more noise. 'Y-you can... I can just like... I can like call... Call somebody and...' Josh stammers. 'Don't call anybody,' orders Lin as he cleans 'blood' off the baseball bat. As the trio continue, Josh looks around wildly as he is driven to what can only seem to Josh at this point as his demise. 'Um, excuse me,' he says in a barely audible voice. Strange noises: Josh hears screaming and banging coming from the trunk of the car . Silent treatment: Lin emerges from the car and appears to violently beat the person in the trunk . Strike: A horrified Josh catches sight of the bloodied baseball bat as Lin returns to the car . 'Where are we going?' Lin tells him they're dumping the body and that he will drop him off at his destination after. Josh's eyes are huge with fear and disbelief. 'I'll dump the body, and then I'll drop you and Cody off. Relax! We're almost there,' Lin says. They eventually pull over in remote looking scrub to 'dump the body.' As Cody and Lin carry the body, wearing a very bright red bloodied t-shirt, the boy puts a shocked hand over his mouth. It becomes too much for him and he tries to get out of the car but discovered the doors have been child-locked. Cody and Lin get back in the car after dumping the 'victim' on the side of the road. Lin grabs a gun from the glove box, to Josh's horror, and heads back out to the victim. Horror: Josh looks on as Cody and Lin dump the 'body' by the side of the road . Getaway: He tries to make his escape but the car's child safety locks are on . Money shot: Poor Josh looks on as Lin appears to shoot his victim . Josh breathes raggedly and looks around in desperation for a way to escape. Lin stands over the body as the boy begins to murmer, 'Oh no, oh no, no, no,' before the sound of a shot fired echoes. The boy sits upright, staring out the window and not looking at Lin or speaking a word. Lin makes a call to his 'boss' then begins questioning the boy as to whether he was in Colombia last week and if he is working for the Anti-Mafia Organization. The boy, flinching, says he doesn't know what that is and he was not in Colombia last week. Terror: When Lin gets back in the car, Josh can't even look at him . Jig's up: Lin and Cody finally give up the pretense and tell Josh he's the victim not of the mafia but of a prank . As Lin threatens Josh with the gun, he starts laughing. Cody in the back seat also starts laughing and the boy looks at them in surprise before Lin informs him that he's being pranked and that there's a camera on the dashboard. The boy looks unconvinced, looking towards the bloodied body on the roadside. 'He's an actor, he's an actor,' Lin says, calling, 'Hey!' to the corpse, which rolls over and gets up. 'He's an actor bro, this is a fake gun, dude,' Lin says putting it in his mouth. Rising from the dead: The corpse miraculously returns to life after appearing to have been viciously beaten and then apparently shot . Hilarious? There aren't many people who would be amused by such a malicious prank being pulled on them, but Josh looks extremely relieved . With the dawning realization that the horror he had just witnessed wasn't real, the boy's face floods with relief. The next shot is the bewildered boy being asked to sign a release form so that Lin can use the video and the boy can 'be on YouTube.' The video ends as Lin promises to take the boy out to eat at a buffet - small payment for the ordeal he's just been put through in the name of fun. Lin posted the video Tuesday, writing that it was 'one of the hardest and craziest pranks' he's ever pulled. He said it took two weeks to find someone who would actually agree to get in the car with Cody and that they took poor Josh to a restaurant after the prank. 'He said he will NEVER jump in to a stranger's car EVER again,' wrote Lin. 'Lol.'","A YouTube prankster pulled an elaborate hoax on an unsuspecting commuter waiting for a bus .

It gives a whole new meaning to hard cash. Plastic banknotes could be introduced within a few years, the incoming Governor of the Bank of England has suggested. Mark Carney, who introduced so-called polymer notes to Canada, yesterday said Britain could now follow suit. Plastic notes are designed to be more durable, waterproof and harder to forge than paper money, which has been in use for 300 years. Other countries using polymer notes include New Zealand, Romania, Mexico and Vietnam. When asked if Britain could look forward to plastic money, Mr Carney said: ‘The Bank of England is exploring a variety of options for their next currency, yes.’ He also responded to complaints that plastic banknotes are inconvenient because they tend to stick together when new. Gesturing, the former Governor of the Bank of Canada said: ‘If you go like this with them yeah they come apart. 'They last longer, they’re cleaner and greener, good value for taxpayers and better for the environment.’ The Bank of England has put out a £1billion tender from 2015 for the printing of notes. Part of this process demands that bidders are able to cope with the change from paper to plastic. Mr Carney made the admission during . an interview on Canadian television in which he also revealed that, . despite not yet starting at the Bank of England, he already had an exit . strategy, and plans to return to Canada when his tenure is over.

A man's home is his castle –  especially when he’s spent £100,000 lovingly transforming it from a 1960s bungalow. Businessman Syed Raza Shah spent most of his life savings adding two extra storeys to the flat-roofed property, not to mention a turret and sweeping balconies. The result is a seven-bedroom home for him, his wife Farah and their four teenage children, worth £2million. A man could be forced to tear down £2 million dream seven bedroom home after he built an 'inappropriate' extension . Trouble is, the council says that . wasn’t quite what Mr Shah had permission to do – so it has served him . with an enforcement order to demolish the house. Mr . Shah was granted planning permission to increase the floor space of the . old house by around 45 per cent, and to build a new roof, but the . council says he has far exceeded that, effectively making it a ‘new . build’. He applied for . retrospective planning permission for what he calls the ‘minor . adjustments’ to the bungalow, but it was refused because the house is in . the green belt and an area of outstanding natural beauty. Syed Raza Shah was given permission to increase the floor space of a five-bedroom bungalow (pictured) in Barton-Le-Clay in Bedfordshire by 45 per cent . Mr Shah bought the 1960's bungalow for £750,000 in 2008 and soon started work on an extension, which he said was agreed by local planners . Yesterday . Mr Shah, 45, a director of a beauty salon, who is appealing against the . decision, admitted he ‘bent the rules slightly’. But he disputes the . council’s claim that he has increased the floor space by 200 per cent . and questions why it waited until the end of the 18-month construction . before ordering his new home to be razed to the ground. He said: ‘The council haven’t done their homework properly before issuing an enforcement notice. ‘Their . 200 per cent figure is ridiculous. They have lost the plot. I have . measured it myself and I’ve increased it by 12 to 15 per cent. Yes, I . have bent the rules slightly. But I only did it to make it aesthetically . more pleasing. The old building was dilapidated; it was just awful. It . was ugly and people have said it looked like a caravan site. But officers at Central Bedfordshire Council say the resulting three-storey building, complete with a turret and long balcony, amounts to a 200 per cent increase and they have refused retrospective planning permission . The council has said the amount of alterations mean the house is now a totally new building and has served Mr Shah with an enforcement order to demolish the home . ‘Yes, we have made some minor adjustments, but I don’t see the decision that has been made justifies demolishing the house. ‘I apologise for bending the rules, but the building has been going on for months.’ He . bought the five-bedroom bungalow in the village of Barton-Le-Clay in . Bedfordshire for £750,000 in 2008, and started work on extending it. Called .

There have been 11 . formal complaints from neighbours, who say the property ‘clashes with . other houses on the road’ and it ‘sticks out like a sore thumb’.

An Arizona engineer has finally finished his four-year pet project to build a guesthouse in his backyard. It's not just any guesthouse, and it's not just any backyard, either. Toshikazu Tsukii lives at La Cholla Airpark and his two bedroom guesthouse looks like it could take off along the private runway residents of the park enjoy. The two-storey guesthouse is made almost entirely of aircraft parts. Architect, engineer, pilot: Toshikazu Tsukii in front of the guesthouse he crafted from the parts of three different planes . Tsukii used three aircraft bodies to create the quirky dwelling: the nosecone of a 737, the fuselage of two 707s and the tail end of a 727, reports the Arizona Star. The pool is covered with the fuselage of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Tsukii, an engineer for Raytheon, accomplished several goals with the completion of his guesthouse. The ambitious Japanese-born airplane enthusiast had always wanted to be an engineer, an aviator and an architect. With the completion of his guesthouse, he's crossed that last one off the list. The 76-year-old designed and built the climate-controlled pad after seeing the nose cone of the 737 in a scrap metal yard which sparked his imagination. At La Cholla Airpark, each of the 91 homes are arranged around a landing strip for the exclusive use of residents. All the homes are on seven acre lots, leaving plenty of space for Tsukii to build his dream house. Room with a view: The inside of  a guesthouse built and designed by Toshikazu Tsukii out of a trio of aircraft bodies: the nosecone of a 737, the fuselage of two 707's and the tail section of a 727 . He made the floor wider by cutting one 707 fuselage in half and spreading it apart. He also used first-class airline seats and improvised other furniture with parts, such as glass-topped tables from the engine cowling of a DC-9 and the wheel of a B-57. Tsukii has always been inventive and a jack-of-all-trades. The Arizona Star reports that a 1962 article from the Fort Scott (Kansas) Tribune described how Tsukii, then 24 and a Wichita State student, was putting himself through college working as a TV repairman, electronics technician, sign painter, judo instructor, photographer, folk singer, guitar player and Samurai swordsman. He is still working full-time as Principal Engineering Fellow at Raytheon Missile Systems and flies his two Cessnas as one of only 3,000 monocular pilots in the U.S., having lost one eye to glaucoma. Tsukii's wife of 50 years, Doris, says she's 'very proud' of her husband.","Toshikazu Tsukii, 76, has completed a two-storey guesthouse made of airplane parts in his backyard .

Tragic: Pastor Linda Snyder, of Sacramento's United Methodist Church, died Tuesday from complications from necrotizing fasciitis . A long-serving and well-loved pastor has been killed by a flesh-eating bacteria infection that has already left five others seriously ill. Linda Snyder, from Sacramento, who is a preacher at city's United Methodist Church, died this morning following a six-month battle with the deadly germ called necrotizing-fasciitis. She was the sixth person to have developed a flesh-eating infection over the course of the last two months. At the beginning of June South Carolina . grandmother Louise Thompson underwent emergency surgery to remove . infected flesh from her leg and was in a coma for five days. And last month . student Aimee Copeland from Georgia College had to have her leg, her foot and both hands . amputated and is still in intensive care after bacteria got into a cut . she developed following a fall. Mrs Snyder contracted the deadly . disease on January 6 after bacteria got into a wound, possibly an . abscess, she had developed in December. Doctors tried to contain the spread of the bacteria, but her daughter Karen told Fox 40 that her mother had developed lots of complications and medical staff were unable to contain it. The horrible infection scarred her lungs and  caused her to develop pneumonia. Mrs Snyder, who has given the sermons at the United Methodist Church for the last decade, was a popular figure and her daughter described her as her 'best friend.' 'She was a woman of faith and that gave her strength and passion to live her life,' she said. Mrs Snyder had been married to her husband Chuck for 37 years and was said to adore her grandchildren. Well-loved: Mrs Snyder has given sermons at the United Methodist Church for the last decade and was a popular figure and her daughter described her as her 'best friend' The bacterial infection is called flesh-eating because of its particularly aggressive nature - skin rapidly disappears when the germ takes hold. Family and friends of Mrs Snyder will gather at Japanese United Methodist Church on June 30 to say their final goodbyes. While fellow victim Miss Copeland is still in intensive care, on Tuesday doctors downgraded the 24-year-old's condition from critical to serious, . indicating that she continues to improve after the horrible bacteria nearly . took her life. On the . same day, Lana Kuykendall, the new mother who was infected with the . bacteria days after she gave birth to twins at an Atlanta hospital, . improved her condition to fair after spending weeks in intensive care. Serious: At the beginning of June South Carolina grandmother Louise Thompson underwent emergency surgery to remove infected flesh from her leg and was in a coma for five days . Still in danger: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) remains in the hospital after . her leg, foot and both hands were amputated. Lana Kuykendall, 36, . (right) had just given birth to twins before she was afflicted by the . disease . Victims: Paul Bales (left) and Bobby Vaughn (right) have both been struck down by the infection . Miss Copeland's father, Andy, said physicians believe his daughter should be out of intensive care and ready to move into the hospital's rehabilitation clinic near the end of the month. 'She's going to have to learn to use prosthetic limbs,' he said. 'But the critical-care phase, I believe, has come to an end.' He said one doctor who had expected her to spend months in intensive care was 'blown away by her rate of progress.' Miss Copeland was infected with the insidious bacteria after she fell from a homemade zip-line into the Little Tallapoosa River near Carrollton and cut her thigh on rocks. Mrs Thompson had gone to a . Simpsonville doctor reporting a pain in her leg that she said felt ‘like . pins sticking in my skin’ but no visible signs of infection. She ended up in hospital undergoing surgery to remove ‘a place the size of a regular football’ it was reported. Deadly: Computer-generated image of the killer bacteria necrotizing-fasciitis . Mrs Thompson is still recovering at the Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Hospital in Greenville but on Friday she stood up for the first time in months. She said she hopes the next step will be getting home. She said: 'I won't ever ignore something that's sore anymore, I just really thought that I wasn't  going to live.' Bobby Vaughn, 33, was the third victim. He has been upgraded to good condition after doctors removed two pounds of flesh from his groin. He became infected after he cut his thigh while cutting weeds in Cartersville. Paul Bales of Lake Sinclair became victim number four after he cut his leg while installing a new dock at the lake on May 1. It was a very small cut that didn’t stop the grandfather playing golf the next day but within four days the cut had swelled and he was forced to have his leg amputated. Despite the bizarre outbreak of the disease, Dr Mike Green, of Macon, said people shouldn't over-react and become paranoid about becoming infected. It remains very rare, he said. Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Victim had been preacher at Sacramento church for last ten years .

Daniel Rodriquez jailed for a total of 12 years after an armed siege at his home in Kidlington, Oxon, in July last year . A man who took a cocktail of drugs before holding his two-year-old twin girls hostage in an armed siege was jailed for 12 years today. Daniel Rodriquez, 38, from Kidlington, Oxon, armed himself with an air rifle and an imitation handgun as his daughters slept in their beds following a domestic incident on July 9 last year. More than 50 officers in riot gear and . armed with guns surrounded the family flat in the early hours of the morning. The man twice fired at police as dozens of officers filled the streets for the pro-longed stand off. Rodriquez took a cocktail of . drugs including heroin, crack cocaine and valium while the police were . outside frantically trying to negotiate the children’s release, a court heard. Rodriquez was later restrained by officers with a Taser after the girls - wearing matching pyjamas - were carried from the property by police. The man pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. Rodriquez was sentenced to 12 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today. Prosecutor Rachel Drake described the terrifying siege to the court. Miss Drake said: 'There was cordoning off of the areas and a very long siege situation involving negotiations between the defendant and the police. 'He was in a very agitated and distressed state and said he was considering taking his own life. 'Police were extremely concerned about the safety of the twin girls asleep in the bedroom next to the defendant. 'As the incident developed, the police were negotiating with Mr Rodriquez. About 9.30am, having supplied him with some food he passed down one of the girls. 'At 11.30am, the second of the children was passed through the window. There was no suggestion they were harmed during this incident.' An officer holds one of the man's daughters in his arms and takes her to safety following the siege . Despite handing over his children, the gunman still refused to come out of the flat. Miss Drake continued: 'Mr Rodriquez was not prepared to give himself up to the police for many hours afterwards. His arrest eventually took place in the foyer of the flat at 3.50pm. 'Following the defendant’s arrest, a full search was made of the flat and the two firearms were recovered.' The guns were found to be a .177 calibre air rifle and an imitation Colt Python handgun. Rodriquez appeared in court via a video link in prison wearing a navy and white hooped jumper. He stared forward blankly during the sentencing hearing and only spoke to confirm his name. At the time of his arrest, the father ran his own car wash firm Ace Power Wash Services in Kidlington, Oxon. One of the twins is removed from the property by an officer. The girls were wearing matching pyjamas as they were taken to safety . The court heard he had served six months in prison in 2002 for racially aggravated common assault, and had a string of convictions for theft, burglary, drug possession and ABH. His most recent conviction was for burglary and theft in 2011. In mitigation, his defence counsel Lucy Tapper said her client suffered mental health problems - including bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorder. She told the judge that Rodriquez loved his children and never intended them any harm during the hostage crisis. She said: 'The devastating cocktail of drugs and alcohol Mr Rodriquez had consumed, coupled with his overwhelming sense of anxiety and paranoia caused him to react in the way he did that morning when great numbers of police arrived at his house. 'The children were never, ever put in any direct danger by him. He had got them up in the usual way, got them breakfast and had them watching television. One officer reports hearing them laughing and playing in the back room.' Armed officers surround the flat in Kidlington. Rodriguez twice fired at police during the siege . Judge Ian Pringle commented that it was an 'appalling' case and said Rodriquez’s possession of the firearms was an 'aggravating factor' in the case. Jailing Rodriquez for 12 years, the judge said: 'Police staked out the house you were in with your two very small daughters. You released them one by one. 'That siege lasted until just before 4pm that afternoon - a serious aggravating feature of this case, no doubt brought about by your taking of a lethal cocktail of drugs over a huge period of time.' Rodriquez had pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. For those counts, he received four years in jail. He was also jailed for eight years to run concurrently after he admitted three counts of rape and one sexual assault charge against a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Homes, the investigating officer from Thames Valley Police said he was 'satisfied' with the result of what was a 'very difficult' investigation. 'It was a very unusual case, not one that we’ve dealt with before,' he added. Rodriguez was sentenced to 12 years in jail today following the incident in July last year .","Daniel Rodriquez, 38, held twin daughters hostage at home in Kidlington .

Mystery: Sara Al Amoudi is being sued for . £14million by two London property developers who say she posed as a . princess to swindle them out of the cash . A supposed Saudi princess claimed yesterday that she is so wealthy she has splashed out almost £1million on perfume in the past two months. Her spree has created an Aladdin’s cave-style display of opulence which has to be seen to be believed, the High Court heard. Sara Al Amoudi is accused of being a one-time penniless Ethiopian prostitute who posed as a princess to swindle London property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton out of luxury flats worth £14million. But yesterday the mysterious ‘princess’ – whose age has been given as between 31 and 45 – wept in court as she assured the judge she had never been an impoverished prostitute, that her wealth was genuine and that she had been on the shopping sprees to prove it. Miss Al Amoudi, who arrived at the London court in a Rolls Royce with numberplates reading ‘HRH’, told judge Sarah Asplin her shopping addiction was so serious she had sought medical help. In heavily accented English, Miss Al Amoudi said: ‘I have a problem with shopping – I go to doctor. In the last two months my perfume, only the perfume – $1.4million (£912,000). I can show you the pictures.’ Miss Al Amoudi arrived at court in a full burka and five-inch platform heels. At the suggestion of the judge she removed her veil in the witness box, but still attempted to keep her face hidden from onlookers. She claims she had an affair with her alleged victim Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his lover and business partner Miss Clutterbuck, 56, and that he borrowed and stole some £5million of pocket money she received from Saudi Arabia. She also insists that when six exclusive flats in Knightsbridge and Chelsea were signed over to her name, it was simply repayment for his thefts and loans. But Mr Paton and Miss Clutterbuck say she swindled them by pretending she had millions to invest in a massive property project – allegedly claiming to be an estranged wife of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, 88 – and are demanding £14million from her. The Rolls-Royce car with numberplates reading HRH in which Miss Al Amoudi arrived at court in London yesterday . Yesterday, Miss Al Amoudi insisted ‘in the name of Allah’ that she was an honest woman given some £10million in cash by her family in the past decade. She claimed she kept money hidden under her bed and entrusted Mr Paton with half her cash for ‘safekeeping’, and insisted her only problems were wild spending. Miss Al Amoudi said: ‘I’m afraid I’m addicted to spending money, and get through enormous amounts of cash. I can easily spend £50,000 to £100,000 in one spree.’ At any one time she would have ‘a minimum of £100,000 and sometimes £400,000’ stashed under a piece of carpet beneath her bed, she said. She added that in Saudi Arabia she was considered ‘like a criminal’ because she had an adulterous relationship, so her family had to send her pocket money in cash stuffed into suitcases. Miss Al Amoudi claimed she married at 13 to a man she refused to name, saying that he was now a threat to her life and that of her 13-year-old daughter. But she claimed her ‘lover’ Mr Paton took advantage of her and that now he and Miss Clutterbuck were lying about her. Modest glamour: The alleged former prostitute leaves court wearing a full-face veil - and five-inch heels . Miss Al Amoudi said: ‘They say I’m a prostitute. It’s not true. I swear to Allah I’m not liar.’ She said Mr Paton was a drug user. He denies taking crack cocaine. Miss Al Amoudi was accused by a male model boyfriend in a previous criminal case of having regularly drunk herself into a stupor at nightclubs. But yesterday, when asked by Stuart Cakebread, barrister for the plaintiffs: ‘Do you drink?’, she said: ‘I will not answer this question because I’m a Muslim woman.’ The court had earlier heard witness Negat Ali, an Ethiopia-born south London furniture dealer, claim the defendant was a former prostitute originally from Ethiopia. She claims she came forward after seeing a picture of Miss Al Amoudi’s unveiled face in the Daily Mail. Miss Ali claimed she first met the ‘princess’ in 1985 when Miss Al Amoudi was operating under a different name and was helping her mother run a restaurant in the Yemen notorious for luring in rich men and conning them. She said they fell out later after Miss Al Amoudi failed to repay a £500 loan. Miss Ali denied being a disgruntled former maid of the ‘princess’. The case continues.","Sara Al Amoudi is accused of posing as a Saudi royal to con two developers .

A 60-year-old woman who police say escaped from a Michigan prison 37 years ago and has been a fugitive ever since had her first court appearance in San Diego Thursday, as she fights extradition. The woman claiming to be Jamie Lewis is being represented by defense attorney Lisa Damiana who told a judge her client will not 'admit identity' to escaped convict Judy Lynn Hayman. Hayman was arrested on Monday, after San Diego police received a mug shot from a Michigan officer who was going through old fingerprint cards of escapees while weathering a winter storm. Authorities had been searching for Hayman since she escaped from Ypsilanti prison in 1977, where she was serving an 18 month to two year sentence for attempting to steal clothes from a store near Detroit. Memorable: Judy Lynn Hayman was arrested by police who recognized her eyes from this 1976 mug shot (left). She appeared in court for the first time on Thursday (right) In court on Thursday, Hayman wore her long gray hair in a pony tail while her clean-cut 32-year-old son watched in the gallery. After the hearing, Damiana told reporters that her client would plead not guilty to being a fugitive at the arraignment scheduled for tomorrow. Ten days after that, an identify hearing will be held to determine if Hayman is indeed the attempted shoplifted from three decades ago. She will remain in custody until then and if determined to be Hayman, extradited back to Michigan where the parole board will determine her sentence. San Diego police say the woman identified herself as Jamie Lewis and produced government documents bearing that name, but admitted to being Hayman when taken into custody. Officers, however, remained suspicious because of inconsistencies in her story and her resemblance to an old Michigan mug shot, taken in 1976, that they were holding. 'Her eyes gave her away,' San Diego police lieutenant Kevin Mayer said. 'The eyes in the picture matched the eyes of this woman.' On the trail: A Michigan officer sent this mug shot and fingerprint cards to San Diego police . It wasn't immediately clear how long Hayman had been in San Diego. But neighbors at her well-kept, nondescript apartment complex blocks from Balboa Park said she lived in the building for almost seven years. Her 32-year-old son was visiting when police arrived, and officers said he appeared stunned by their questions. 'This seemed very much a surprise to him,' Lieutenant Mayer said. Her son, named only as Aaron, said he was worried for his mother but didn't tell NBC7 if Hayman's children knew about her double life. Aaron said his mother had ties to the San Diego community, where she attended church and PTA meetings. Neighbors had said the woman they knew as Jamie Lewis kept to herself, not speaking of her past. Hayman is being held in a San Diego County jail awaiting extradition to Michigan and is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. Michigan authorities want her returned to the state to complete her sentence for attempted larceny. She also could face a separate criminal charge for the escape. Lieutenant Charles Levens, of the Michigan Corrections Department, helped catch Hayman after sending fingerprint cards to the FBI. He explained that many police agencies had fingerprints that matched Hayman's but under different names. He gave the information to an investigator, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego. 'I said, ""Tim, you're going to get your girl here"",' Lieutenant Levens said. 'There are two ways to get off our list: a death certificate or a [live] body. It's what the state pays us to do. ... If you're a fugitive, you have an obligation to pay your debt to society.' Hide out: Hayman, 60, was arrested at this gated community in San Diego . Hayman, using aliases, apparently had . been arrested and fingerprinted in the past and the San Diego police . 'were familiar with her,' Michigan Corrections Department spokesman Russ . Marlan said. Lieutenant . Mayer declined to give further details about the case, including whether . Hayman had prior arrests or contact with police in California. Theresa . Padilla said she lived next to Hayman for more than six years and . described her as a 'quiet loner, but basically a nice person'. Ms Padilla said Hayman spent most of her time indoors, except when she walked her chihuahua, Monty, who was old and had to be put down less than a year ago. Hayman had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one of them visited often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Ms Padilla said, adding: 'Her three boys seemed like they were raised well.' Ms Padilla said Hayman didn't appear to be married or have a job. She said she and Hayman spoke infrequently but did share their experiences in battling cancer. Hayman also mentioned living in Detroit and being a fan of Michigan basketball teams. Ms Padilla was shocked to learn of her neighbor's past on Monday. 'It don't make sense, going after this lady for a petty little thing,' she said. 'They need to go after the molesters, the killers, those who hurt little babies, not someone who stole something when she was 23.' Corrections spokesman Mr Marlan said all fugitives must be pursued. 'We can't just write it off,' he said. 'We don't have the ability to say, ""It's been a long time. You're free to go"".'

As his girlfriend got out of the car to get food at a gas station, 47-year-old Michael Dunn turned to her and said 'I hate this music' - commenting on the loud bass coming from a parked SUV with four teens inside. Before she could get back to the Volkswagen with wine and chips, Dunn had shot up the SUV, eventually killing 17-year-old back passenger Jordan Davis. Opening statements in the white engineer's murder case began today in Jacksonville, Florida, with both sides revealing more details on how the fight about volume turned deadly in November 2012. Scroll down for video . Too loud: Michael Dunn (left) is facing a first-degree murder charge for fatally shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis (right) in an argument about speaker volume in November 2012 . Defense: Opening statements began in Dunn's trail today in Jacksonville, Florida. He is also facing three charges for attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car . Dunn has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car. Dunn's defense attorney Cory Strolla says he was only trying to defend himself, after seeing Davis grab what looked to be either a shotgun or a lead pipe. But prosecutors say the four men in the vehicle weren't armed, and while they did disrespect Dunn, they never threatened the man. Assistant State Attorney John Guy says the four men were out for a day of 'mall hopping and girl shopping' when they decided to stop at the gas station to get gum and cigarettes. Before coming over to tell the men to turn down their music, Dunn town his girlfriend 'I hate this music' as she walked over to the convenience store. Like this: Shawn Atkins, a witness for the prosecution, shows how he saw Dunn shoot that day. Atkins is currently in prison and tried to leverage for a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying . Dunn then went over and 'politely' asked the men to turn their music down - which was so loud it was rattling the windows. Davis responded rudely telling one of his friends 'f*** that n*****' and to turn the music back up. Guy says both Dunn and Davis exchanged the f-word in the ensuing argument, but that Davis never threatened the older man. However, defense attorneys say Dunn never cursed at Davis and that Davis got much more explicit in their fight. According to Dunn, Davis threatened: 'I'm going to f****** kill you. You're dead, b****. This is going down now.' Aftermath: Instead of turning himself in, Dunn and his girlfriend drove 40 miles south to a bed and breakfast and ordered pizza. Above, the couple's Volkswagen . They also say Davis reached for a weapon, which Dunn believed to be either a gun or a lead pipe, and seemed to be getting out of the car, prompting Dunn to take out his 9mm pistol and shoot three times at Davis' door. Dunn shot each of Jordan's legs and the third bullet tore through the teen's liver, lungs and aorta. Dunn claims to have owned the gun for years but never used it before that occasion. But prosecutors say Davis couldn't have gotten out of the car since the child locks were on. The defense pointed out that friend Leland Brunson, who was in the car at the time, initially told police that Davis was getting out of the car, but changed his story four days later. Despite the driver of the SUV backing up to drive away, prosecutors say Dunn continued to barrage the car with gunfire. Another point of contention is what happened immediately after the shooting and whether or not the four teens had time to hide the weapon Dunn claims to have seen. Prosecutors say the teens had no time to hide a weapon since they never left the parking lot. A police search of their vehicle only turned up a basketball, basketball shoes, some clothing and cups on the floor but 'no weapons'. Murder: Protesters gathered outside the court today to express their support for the prosecution . The defense on the other hand says the boys drove off to an adjacent parking lot first before returning to the gas station to call 911. Police didn't search the area around the gas station until several days later, giving the men 'ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe'. Strolla points out that two witnesses initially reported that the teens seemed to be stashing something, and that two of the passengers in the SUV were unaccounted for a period after the shooting. As for Dunn, when his girlfriend Rhonda Rouer heard the shots, she left her food and change at the counter and ran out to their car. Instead of turning himself in, the couple drove 40 miles south to St Augustine where they had a reservation at a bed and breakfast. The two ordered pizza, took the dog for a walk and Dunn 'poured a big, tall drink - rum and Coke. 'They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,' Guy said. 'That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep.' Hiding out? Dunn told interrogators the day after the shooting that he didn't turn himself in because he wanted to get things settled at home first . The next day they saw a news report on TV about a 17-year-old who had been fatally shot at a gas station in Jacksonville, and instead of calling police then, they drove 130 miles home to Satellite where police caught up with him . The defense attorney blames most of that strange behavior on Dunn's girlfriend, who ordered the pizza because she hadn't had much to eat all day and was hungry. They decided to go home the next day instead of turn Dunn in because Rouer was 'petrified' and 'didn't know the law of self-defense'. A day after the shooting, Dunn told interrogators he 'was waiting till we get around people we know' to turn himself in. He wanted to make sure his dog and 'everybody were where they needed to be. I did not want to being a s***storm down on them in Jacksonville'. The prosecution may have a problem in their case when it comes to witnesses. The witness who took down Dunn's license plate is currently in prison and tried to leverage a lighter sentence for agreeing to testify. And the teen driver of the SUV was on probation and violating curfew when the incident happened. In the end, the defense painted Dunn as a man who could have been a victim if he hadn't taken out his gun that day. 'God didn't make all men equal. Colt did. Colt is a firearm,' Strolla said. '(Dunn) had every right under the law to not be a victim, to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six.' Prosecutors say the teen was innocent, and did nothing to provoke a gun being fired. 'Jordan Davis was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands,' Guy told the jury. The trial is expected to conclude as early as February 14.","Michael Dunn, 47, has plead not-guilty to first-degree murder for shooting dead 17-year-old Jordan Davis in November 2012 .

The world's tallest woman might finally stop growing after doctors removed a tumour from her brain. Siddiqa Parveen, who is estimated to be 7ft 8in tall, travelled nearly 1,000 miles from her village in West Bengal for doctors in Delhi to save her life. Before the operation, the 28-year-old had a spine 'on the verge of breaking' and was losing her sight as a result of her continuous growth. Tall order: Gigantism sufferer Siddiqa Parveen, pictured with her parents, from south Dinajpur, West Bengal, is estimated to be 7ft 8in tall as a result of a tumour on the pituary gland . Siddiqa suffered from gigantism brought on by the tumour, which was located on the pituitary gland, causing it to produce excess growth hormone. She already had fractures in her spine and has been unable to stand up straight for years - and doctors in India believed if left untreated her increasing weight would cause her back to snap. They also feared the 'massive' tumour would cause her to go blind, forcing them to transport her from her remote village in West Bengal to Delhi. Neurosurgeon Dr Ashish Suri, of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Siddiqa was operated on, said the operation had been a success. ‘The tumour had to be taken out through the nose by inserting an endoscope through the nostrils,’ he said. Daddy's big girl: Siddiqa is pictured with her father who still cares for his adult daughter . Siddiqa, 28, already had fractures on her spine as a result of her heavy body and is hoped she will be able to stand up straight again after the tumour has been removed . Saved: Siddiqa travelled nearly 1,000 miles to undergo the life-saving operation in Delhi where the tumour was removed . ‘She suffered significant blood-loss during the operation as the tumour was a vascular one. But she coped well.’ Siddiqa's size saw her recently crowned the world's tallest woman by Guinness Book of Records - but it caused significant medical challenges. Dr Suri said: ‘As her body frame was huge, it required a large operation table for which we had to join additional trolleys.’ Dr PK Bithal, head of neuroanesthesiology told The Indian Express: ‘Our maximum bed size is six feet, both in the operation theatre and ICU, so positioning her appropriately for surgery was a big problem. Condition improving: Staff at the Delhi hospital where Siddiqa is recovering have had to lengthen her bed with trolley . Going the distance: Siddiqa is in a stable condition following the operation . Doctor Ashish Suri, who did the surgery to remove the brain tumour from the world's tallest girl, seen during a press conference at the AIIMS hospital today . Hard to fit: Siddiqa Parveen, seen recovering after the successful operation which removed her tumour . ‘Her head size was enlarged, which made access of the tumour with our instruments, like endoscopes, extremely difficult. ‘Anaesthetising her would be a problem with her head size, since we did not have endotracheal tubes of her head size, and she had difficulty lying down with the multiple fractures in her spine.’ Doctors have declared the surgery, . which took place on January 16, a success. But authorities at the . hospital say it is ‘the first of multiple steps in her road to complete . recovery’. Siddiqa, who . weighs 285lbs and has enlarged hands and feet, has now been released . from the intensive care unit but remains in hospital. However, . her problems are not just physical and doctors say she will need to be . treated for a 'psychosocial crisis' - having been isolated for much of . her life. Tall tale: The 28-year-old's condition has seen her hands and feet grow abnormally large, seen here compared to her father . Coming back: Doctor's say that Siddiqa also needs psychological rehab to learn to integrate with others in her village now that the tumour is gone . Dr Suri said: ‘She has been confined to her house for the major part of her life. An old teacher from her area is the only one she communicates with.’ It was also revealed that it took doctors weeks to communicate properly with Parveen, who hails from a poor family in south Dinajpur district of West Bengal and speaks only in Bengali. ‘She has been silent for so long, it will take us a long time to ensure her complete recovery,’ said Dr Tandon. Siddiqa was mentioned in the 2014 Guinness Book of World Records as the new record holder after after the 2012 death of Yao Defen from China who, at 233.3 cm (7 feet 7 inches) was the tallest woman on earth.","Siddiqa Parveen, from West Bengal, India, is estimated to be 7ft 8in .

Nasa today released a stunning video showing a 500,000 mile long 'solar whip' on the surface of the sun - and the beautiful aurora it created on earth. Captured by from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the video shows in unprecedented detail a . very long, whip-like solar filament extending over half a million miles . in a long arc above the sun’s surface. Click for video . The coronal mass ejection, or CME, traveled at over 900 miles per second. The CME did not travel directly toward Earth, but did connect with Earth's magnetic environment, or magnetosphere, with a glancing blow, causing aurora to appear on monday evening. A . 'solar whip' or filament is caused when a red glowing loop of plasma . erupts, releasing the plasma out in huge loops hundreds of thousands of . miles into space. The . filaments are anchored to the Sun's surface in the photosphere, and . extend outwards into the Sun's hot outer atmosphere, called the corona. The 'whip' was a filament, cooler clouds of solar material that are tethered above the sun’s surface by unstable magnetic forces. The . images and video (below), which covers August 6 to 8, 2012 show the . filament as a darker strand that has been in view for several days. It the snaps, sending radiation hurtling towards earth. At the time, Nasa revealed a video of the activity. 'Towards . the end of the video part of the filament seems to break away, but its . basic length and shape seem to have remained mostly intact,' says Nasa. The video, which condenses three hours of activity, also reveals the action in dramatic detail in extreme ultraviolet . light. The . NOAA spaceweather prediction center warned that a cloud of radiation . from the eruption would reach Earth today. The radiation . cloud will create a minor to moderate geomagnetic storm, bringing the northern lights to parts of North America, it said. To prove the point, Nasa today revealed the image below, showing the aurora in breathtaking beauty. Swirls of green and red appear in an aurora over Whitehorse, Yukon on the night of September 3, 2012 following a massive eruption on the solar surface . Nasa says the image is a classic example of a solar prominence (also known as a filament when viewed against the . solar disk). This is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's . surface.

"By . Ruth Lythe . PUBLISHED: . 14:29 EST, 7 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:51 EST, 7 February 2014 . Homebuyers are being told to come clean about their spending on haircuts, bikini waxes, toiletries and the cost of feeding their pets - or risk being turned down for a mortgage. Prying banks have started asking increasingly invasive questions of potential borrowers, quizzing them about their bills in every aspect of their lives. Among the questions being asked are how much borrowers spend on personal grooming, dry cleaning, glasses, cleaning products and the size of their mobile phone bills. Quiz: Potential homebuyers are being asked increasingly invasive questions . Many of Britain’s biggest banks already demand applicants give details of their monthly spending. But experts say the questions are likely to become even more probing ahead of tough new rules to be introduced by consumer watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority in April. Any applicant deemed to be extravagant will be penalised and in extreme cases refused a loan. Last week, lender Kensington Mortgages unveiled the most detailed list spending questionnaire so far. It has 43 questions about borrowers’ spending. They face having to comb through their bank statements to tot up splurges on meals out, visits to the dentist or the amount they fork out on contact lenses. On top of food and clothing costs, potential borrowers also have to give details of the spending on their car’s annual MOT and reveal how much they typically pay to park their vehicle. They must also detail how much they set aside to cover personal grooming. Implications: Requests for as mortgage could be judged on how much you spend on pet food . This could include the cost of trips to a hairdresser or regular visits to a bikini waxing salon. Extras such as cinema or theatre trips are also weighed up by the lender. Banks will then check these spending habits against their monthly statements to check their spending habits. Risky behaviour? A trip to the cinema could determine whether or not you can buy your dream home . So if a bank sees you make regular visits to a beauty parlour, waxing salon or hairdresser, it could restrict the amount it lends you. Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the Homeowners Alliance, said: ‘This is outrageous. It is like treating people like children who have no control over their spending. ‘Banks and building societies already have access to our credit records in order to decide how much to lend to us. ‘I really don’t see what they have to gain by finding out how many chocolate bars someone eats a month or how much they spend on colouring their hair. It could also spark quite a few rows between couples who have tried to keep the full details of their spending private.’ Sarah Pennells, founder of moneysaving website Savvy Woman, said: ‘I can’t see any circumstances where a mortgage company would need to break down your spending in such detail. ‘Why on earth would they need to know you spend more on trips to the cinema than on highlights?’ Experts say big banks and building societies are racing to produce their own detailed questionnaires before the new lending rules kick in. Virgin Money is asking mortgage applicants to describe their spending in dozens of areas. These include the cost of their pooch but also phone and internet bills and spending on food and drink. Two years ago the Mail revealed how Santander sparked outrage after demanding customers tell it how much they spend on celebrations such as birthdays and religious festivals. Mortgage brokers say an increasing trend is for banks to grill borrowers about their spending on their pets, including vets bills. insurance premiums and trips to the grooming parlour. Gym contracts and holidays have also come under the spotlight. David Hollingworth, associate director of mortgage broker London and Country said: ‘The danger is that firms are asking for too much detail and people just won’t know what they spend. ‘For example, you may have a rough idea about what your car costs in petrol and insurance - but there are other costs too. Credit: Critics have said that banks already have access to enough information to judge whether people should be lent money . ‘There is no problem with the gist of the rules - but when you ask for too much detail it’s unwieldy for customers. ‘If you’re thinking about getting a mortgage you need to think about exactly where you spend your money.’ In April, the Financial Conduct Authority will bring in new rules based on its Mortgage Market Review. These will mean banks and building societies are fully responsible for checking a borrower can properly afford a mortgage before giving them the cash. If they are deemed to be lending irresponsibly they face big fines. And they will also have to give borrowers’ finances a stress test, to ensure they can cope with a rise in repayments caused by an increase in mortgage rates. Experts fear other banks will also soon by toughening their rules. Aaron Strutt, product manager at mortgage broker Trinity Financial, says: ‘It stands to reason that if one mortgage company does this, then others will be hot on their heels. ‘Lenders are likely to ask even more detailed questions over the next few months as the new rules kick in.’ Alex Hammond, a spokesman for Kensington Mortgages says: ‘We are one of the first lenders to communicate what we are looking for in borrowers under the mortgage market review. 'We will not ask these questions in every case but on occasion we will ask for extra detail in terms of an applicant’s income and expenditure.’","Banks demand ever more information before granting home loans .

The European Union has sparked fury after it approved a plan for a 'social police' to control benefits handouts, healthcare and homelessness across the continent. The plan is among a raft of measures laid out in a new report that calls for the creation of a 'social scoreboard' to allow for a 'better and earlier identification of major employment and social problems'. But the plan, approved by a majority of the Parliament sitting in Strasbourg last week, triggered anger among Conservative MEPs who claim the EU is attempting to impose itself as 'Europe's social . conscience.' Controversial: The plan was approved by a majority of the Parliament sitting in Strasbourg last week prompting anger among Conservative MEPs who attempted to have the measures thrown out . Anthea McIntyre MEP, Conservative . spokesman on employment and social affairs, said: 'Clearly this is the . Parliament manoeuvring to create a role for the EU as Europe's social . conscience. 'Worse than . that, they want to appropriate powers to supervise and intervene over . the way member states deal with social problems. They want to set . themselves up as the social police. 'Nobody . is saying poverty, ill health and homelessness are not real problems in . need of real solutions. What we are saying is that individual states . and governments must be allowed to address them as they see fit, not . according to a set of rules set down in Brussels. 'Sadly, . my Labour and Liberal colleagues appear to think British voters are not . responsible or compassionate enough to decide for themselves how to . respond.' Angry: MEP Anthea McIntyre branded the move as an attempt to create 'social police' Under the title 'Social Dimensions of the European Monetary Union', the report, by French Socialist MEP Pervenche Beres, seeks to treat 'social imbalances on the same footing as economic indicators such as gross domestic product or national debt,' she added. The report calls for a 'social scoreboard' to score member states on measures such as child-poverty levels, access to healthcare, homelessness on a 'decent-work index'. But Tory MEPs say that, although the report is presented in the context of the single currency, there is no clause exempting countries outside the Eurozone, such as the United Kingdom. The text also makes references to a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme, Ms McIntyre said, claiming it betrayed a 'clear ambition for Brussels to control benefits payments across Europe'. However, the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) called the plan 'a potential watershed moment in economic governance', adding: 'With one out of four people in the EU at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 11 per cent unemployment, it is clear that the current approach has not delivered on the Europe 2020 poverty and employment targets. 'This resolution will convey that a much stronger commitment is required from the EU and Member States to achieve the social objectives of the EU.' European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso added: 'The EU has taken giant . leaps forward in terms of economic governance in the last five years, . providing financial lifelines to many vulnerable Member States.

Property sales grew at their fastest annual rate in a decade in the six months to September 2013, according to a report. It showed that the housing market revival has spread across England and Wales – and is not just limited to London. Every town in the North, the West Midlands, Wales and the capital recorded a year-on-year increase in home sales, research by Lloyds Bank found. Boom: A new report shows the speed of property sales has increased faster than at any point in the last decade . Across England and Wales as a whole, 98 per cent of towns were found to have enjoyed an annual uplift in sales. A year earlier, just over a quarter of towns saw a year-on-year increase. The report, which used Land Registry figures, found there were 396,756 house sales in the six months to September, marking an increase of 21 per cent on the same period in 2012 – and the highest year-on-year increase in a decade. But property sales were still 41 per cent below a market peak of 673,699 sales in the half-year to September 2006 at the height of the boom. In further evidence that the market pick-up is spreading beyond London, Lloyds found that the North West and the East Midlands saw a 23 per cent rise in activity between March to September 2012 and the same period a year later. Revival: The increase is backed by a steady increase in house prices . On a more local level, the East London borough of Newham saw the largest year-on-year increase in home sales, with a 62 per cent rise in the six months to September compared with the same period a year earlier. Crowborough in East Sussex saw the biggest drop in home sales over the same period, with a 10 per cent fall in transactions. Marc Page, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'Low interest rates, improvements in consumer confidence and Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, all appear to have contributed to the rise in home sales.'","Report from Lloyds Bank found increases have spread across the country .

With a perfect copy of the New Moon film poster emblazoned across her back, portraits of Edward Cullen on both ribs and the Cullen crest splashed across her breastbone, describing Cathy Ward, 52, as a Twilight fan is a bit of an understatement. But there's more to the Twihard's tattoos than a penchant for Robert Pattison, although the self-confessed member of Team Edward admits that it does play a part. For Cathy, her etchings are also an important reminder of how far she's come since Christmas 2009, when she weighed six stone more and was an unhappy size 24 - and a reward. Twihard: 52-year-old Cathy Ward has spent just under £8,500 on inkings that depict characters from Twilight . Number one: Cathy's first tattoo was a copy of the New Moon poster and features the main characters . Yet trading comfort eating for Twilight tattoos hasn't come cheap, as she happily admits. So far, she has spent just under £8,500 on getting inked but expects to have spent £25,000 by the time her 'body suit' is complete. 'I've had about 91 hours of tattooing now . and it's costing a small fortune,' explains Cathy, who works as a baker for the Morrisons supermarket chain in her hometown of Reading. 'I've forked out just under £8,500 and . by the time I'm finished, when [my] body's completely covered, we're . looking at between £17,000 and £25,000.' Cathy's passion for ink began after a friend handed her a copy of the first Twilight book at the end of 2009. Hooked, she quickly devoured the first novel and sped through the remaining three before buying the DVDs and soundtracks of the accompanying films. Her first tattoo, an elaborate recreation of the film poster for New Moon, followed with more etchings added two weeks later. 'We've got the book covers, we've got the . ribbon, we've got the family crest, we've got the hairpiece, we've got . the chessboard from Breaking Dawn, we've got the wolf tribal symbol,' she reveals. 'I've . had five wolves done and one of the last things Jacob says to [Bella] when he . realises he's lost her. He said: ""It would be as easy as . breathing with me"".' But despite her love for the Wolf Pack - the subject of an inking currently underway on her left leg - it's Edward, played in the films by Robert Pattinson, who interests her the most. 'Obviously, I'm Team Edward so most of my tattoos are of Edward,' she explains. 'I'm definitely a Robert Pattinson fan. Perfect portrait: Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and, of course, Robert Pattinson have pride of place . Tolerant: Cathy's husband Colin says he is happy for her to have tattoos provided they don't go on her face . 'It's because he's not . classically good looking - he's different,' she adds. 'I'm not what I'd call good . looking, I'm average and he's similar. Plenty of other guys in the film . are better looking but he's striking in different way.' Since discovering Twilight, Cathy has lost an incredible six stone and says that having the tattoos is a permanent reminder of just how far she's come since 1999 when the shock of losing her mother resulted in an unhealthy obsession with food. 'That's when I started going really hell for . leather doing what I wanted and abusing my body,' remembers Cathy. 'I was sitting down, . overeating, just vegetating all the time. I . was ashamed of myself and what I looked like. 'When my friend gave me the . first book and I got well and truly hooked on it, it kind of focused me. Of course, then I got the music, the soundtracks to all of the movies, . so I got them out, I'd exercise to them and I'd be watching a DVD and . I'd just be exercising in front of them. 'And then I'd get another tattoo . and it'd just give me something to focus on. I've . lost six stone and that's what did it. 'It's a permanent reminder and a . reward to me for getting my life back on track to what it should be.' Quote: Her right arm shows a line uttered by Jacob that reads: 'It would be as easy as breathing with me' Favourites: Cathy says she is Team Edward (Robert Pattinson) but Taylor Lautner has said he likes her tattoos . But not everyone is as supportive of Cathy's decision to get inked. Although her husband Colin, to whom she's been married for 21 years, tolerates her tattoos, not everyone in her family agrees. 'My father, at first he was very . resistant,' she says. 'He wouldn't be seen out with me. My brother, I . haven't spoken to in five years. He's quite embarrassed by me. 'My . sisters... they're just quite glad to see me come out of my shell and . be who I should be. I used to be very quiet, sort of hide in the . background, be a bit of a wallflower.' She certainly isn't anymore and revels in the stir she caused when she was invited onto the red carpet at the Breaking Dawn part one premiere in 2011. 'I got sent . tickets to the premiere, which was brilliant although security wouldn't let . me near the main characters,' remembers Cathy with a chuckle. Underway: Cathy and her tattooist are currently finishing off an etching of the Wolf Pack on her left leg . Popular: Cathy proved a hit with fellow Twihards at the 2011 Breaking Dawn premier in London . Encounter: Cathy met MyAnna Buring, who plays vampire Tanya, at a Twilight convention last year . 'But the fans reaction was brilliant - it was . an hour and a half of mayhem because they all wanted pictures with me.' Her . tattoos also got her the attention of Taylor Lautner, the 21-year-old . American who plays Jacob, who, to her delight, even mentioned her in an . interview. 'Taylor Lautner and Rob [Pattinson] were on This Morning when . Breaking Dawn came out and he [Lautner] commented on my tattoos,' adds Cathy. And Lautner isn't alone in his appreciation of Cathy's tattoo tribute. At a convention last year, she met MyAnna Buring who plays Tanya, a member of the Denali coven who come to the Cullen's aid during a confrontation with the Volturi. 'I've not met any of the main . characters,' explains Cathy, 'but I have met Tanya (Buring), Seth (Booboo Stewart) and the guy who plays Jared (Bronson Pelletier). 'It was at a convention last year and they all said it was brilliant artwork but to meet one of the main [characters] would have been . great.' For now, Cathy is focusing on finishing a tattoo of the Wolf Pack on her left leg and, once it's done, plans to have another of the Volturi inked on her right. Does she have any plans to stop? Unsurprisingly, the answer is no. 'The way I look at it, I've still got two to three years work to go and you need to do maintenance,' she explains. 'There's always going to be . things that need touching up or recolouring. 'I stand out, I don't care that I . stand out,' she adds. 'This is me, this is what I like, this is what does it for me. It keeps me feeling young. 'It's keeping me permanently broke but no matter what the cost, I am not stopping!' Cathy stars in Channel 4 documentary, My Tattoo Addiction, Thursday at 10pm.

More than 300,000 people have been left without running water and four have been hospitalized after a potentially toxic foaming agent used in the coal preparation process spilled earlier this week into the Charleston public water system. Residents were told to not bathe, brush . their teeth or wash their clothes with tap water after 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol leaked from a storage tank into the Elk River and the water supply of the mostly rural state's largest city. A total of 32 people sought treatment at local hospitals after coming down with symptoms of having been poisoned, four of them were admitted for further treatment, a state spokesperson said.

'We're just not sure exactly how long it's going to take before it's acceptable to lift the do-not-drink ban, West Virgina Gov Earl Tombin told CNN Friday night. The chemical's concentration in the local water supply was lower Friday, but not to the point officials felt safe allowing people to drink the water again - and Charleston's mayor didn't mince words in voicing his displeasure. 'It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,' he told CNN. 'It's a prison from which we would like to be released.' The ban has forced schools, offices, restaurants, hotels and other businesses to shutter, but hospitals have remained busy.

Those symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, . headaches, skin irritation or rashes. Federal authorities began investigating how the foaming agent escaped a chemical plant and seeped into the Elk River. Just how much of the chemical leaked into the river was not yet known. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern has apologized for the toxic spill. 'We'd like to start by sincerely apologizing to the people in the affected counties of West Virginia,' he said. 'We are very, very sorry for the disruptions to everybody's daily life this incident has caused.' Officials are working with Freedom Industries to determine how much can be in the water without it posing harm to residents, said West Virginia American Water president Jeff McIntyre. 'We don't know that the water's not safe. But I can't say that it is safe,' Mr McIntyre said Friday. For now, there is no way to treat the tainted water aside from flushing the system until it's in low-enough concentrations to be safe, a process that could take days. 'Yeah, I understand that stuff can happen,' local Jeff Bonham - who also works in the chemical industry - said. 'I don't think it's going to get him out of legal liability. OSHA is the one they're going to have to answer to.' Officials and experts said the chemical, even in its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. 'We have mitigated the risk, we believe, in terms of further material leaving this facility,' Mr Southern added, acknowledging he had no idea how much of the chemical had leaked out of the storage tank.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 6 February 2014 . A Manhattan underwear heiress who filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against her deadbeat husband over charges that he raided her trust fund to shower his mistress with gifts, won a legal victory Wednesday when her former flame failed to show up for court. Candice Feinberg Lalicata, the daughter of Herbert Feinberg, one of the creators of seamless panties, sued her two-timing ex, tanning salon employee Steven Lalicata, for $10 million after he looted more than $700,000 from her inheritance to buy his mistress, Diana Fernandez, lavish gifts. When Lalicata failed to attend Wednesday's court hearing, the judge in the case issued a summary judgment in favor of Feinberg Lalicata. Claims: Candice Feinberg, pictured at her wedding to Steven Lalicata, alleges her husband tricked her out of tens of thousands of dollars . 'I’m assuming he’s slithered under some . rock in Queens,' Candice Feinberg Lalicata’s attorney told The New York . Post after the judge ruled in favor of his client. According to court papers, Feinberg Lalicata was led to believe her husband had gambling debts with an organized crime group. 'Through a series of coordinated . communications, they led her to believe physical well-being would be in . jeopardy if she did not make huge amounts of cash available to him on . short notice,' the  lawsuit claimed. The case alleges that rather than being in debt and danger, Lalicata 'was stealing the money to live a double life'. The couple had met in April 2010, when Lalicata was working at the Beach Bum Tanning Salon in Manhattan. Shortly after he started dating Ms Feinberg, a divorcee with a five-year-old son, Lalicata learned that she had just cashed in her trust fund. It was then that he allegedly started befriending her son before proposing just a few months into their relationship. Shortly after their wedding, Lalicata started to disappear overnight or for a few days at a time. When his new wife confronted him, she claims he told her 'he had been gambling and had run up large debts to 'individuals . connected with organized crime in Brooklyn who would hurt him if he did . not pay,' the suit claimed. When his cousin and a friend allegedly backed up his story, Ms Feinberg started to wire tens of thousands of dollars to him to clear the debt. When he allegedly pushed her for a further $150,000 - telling her when the debts were gone they could focus on starting a family - she mortgaged her Upstate New York home to raise the money. The suit claimed that Lalicata staged a handover with a friend posing a gangster, who met them in a car outside the bank so she could hand over the cash. That night, Lalicata allegedly told his wife he was having trouble sleeping and went downstairs - only to disappear. A few days later Ms Feinberg discovered that he had been on vacation with Fernandez in the Dominican Republic. Double life: The lawsuit claims that after they married Steven Lalicata would disappear from the couple's Manhattan apartment, above. When confronted he allegedly told his wife he had run up gambling debts . With the help of a private detective, Ms Feinberg allegedly found her husband had been having a relationship with Fernandez and instead of using her money to pay off gambling debts he had used it for luxury shopping trips to buy his mistress 'jewelry, luxury goods, home . furnishings and travel'. An employee at the couple's former Manhattan apartment told the New York Post Lalicata would return from shopping trips with goods from Louis Vuitton and Armani. The employee, who has not been named, claimed Lalicata would say: 'Hold these for me. Don't tell my wife.' Attempts to get her husband to admit to fraud on tape in July 2012 failed after he allegedly seduced her at a hotel to invalidate the tape. Ms Feinberg told the New York Post: 'I am concerned that these people may pray on other victims ... I believe that they brought me and my young son into their confidences solely from the get go, to steal as much as they could from me.' The suit, filed in the spring of 2013, seeks repayment of $744,105 and $10 million in damages from Lalicata, Fernandez and their friends for false arrest and fraud. A lawyer for Fernandez denied that his client had been involved in any wrongdoing or that she had been romantically involved with Lalicata. Justice Anil Singh on Wednesday ordered a future proceeding to determine the amount Steven will have to pay Candice for the con job. Lalicata could not be reached for comment.","Candice Feinberg Lalicata claims she was tricked out of her trust fund .

Women in the United Arab Emirates must breastfeed their children, or their husbands could sue them, according to a new law. The legislation passed this month, requires all able Emirati women to breastfeed their children for at least two years. The Federal National Council included a clause in the new Child Rights Law which states that it is a human right for a child to be breast fed, and that nursing is now mandatory. Mandatory breast: According to the new Child Rights Law, women in the United Arab Emirates must breast feed their children as nursing is a 'human right' written into the Koran . However, the UAE’s Minister of Social Affairs, Mariam Al Roumi, said the fact that breastfeeding is now forced upon women, could lead to husbands suing their wives if they do not follow the law. ‘This part of the law can be a burden,’ Ms Al Roumi told The National. ‘If the law forced women to breastfeed, this could lead to new court cases.’ The Child Rights Law was passed by the National Federal Council earlier this month, and the breastfeeding clause added once it was put up for review. The Council said that it was the right of all children to be breastfed up to the age of two, and that it is a duty and not an option for any woman able to do so. The decision was backed up by research which show that breast feeding is beneficial both for a child's future health, but also for the bond between mother and baby, while other members referred to parts of the Koran which states that a mother should nurse. Thinly veiled threat: The new law proposes that should an Emirati woman not breastfeed her child for two years, her husband would have legal backing to sue her . If a mother is unable to breastfeed for a biological reason, the state should support her by providing a wet nurse, but it has not been explained how this system is to be implemented. Several groups supporting new parents reacted strongly to the new breastfeeding law, including Out of the Blues, a Dubai organisation helping mothers suffering from postnatal issues. 'As a group we wholeheartedly agree that breastfeeding should be encouraged and that the sentiment is a good one that clearly follows international guidelines,' the group wrote in an open letter in The National. 'However, as many of the new mothers we encounter are already under significant pressure, we are concerned that enacting a law that leaves mothers facing potential punishment could be a step too far.' The group also pointed out that is has not been made clear who will be responsible for assessing who is and is not able to breastfeed, especially as lactation specialists can be hard to find in the UAE.","The UAE Federal National Council passes Child Rights Law .

They suspect the 39-year-old was one of three men who robbed a restaurant in Anderlecht last week, shooting the owner twice in the leg and stealing eight guns. The other two suspects have been arrested. French police had been tracking Benladghem for several years and had tipped off the Belgium authorities about his suspicious activities when he moved there in 2008. Suspect: Hakim Benladghem was shot dead in his car on a Belgium motorway . A search of his home in Anderlecht revealed the hoard of guns and other military-equipment, which French and Belgium intelligence believe he was planning to use for a series of terror strikes across Europe. One of his key objectives, it is believed was to kill 'un cagoulé', French for 'a hood', which is a term used to describe a member of the special police forces. Among the items were an MP5 submachine gun, used by special forces soldiers around the world, an M-16 type automatic rifle and a Kalashnikov AK47 with folding stock and a pump action shotgun. Alongside hundreds of rounds of ammunition Benladghem had kept a flak jacket with dozens of spare magazines, a helmet with attached night-vision goggles. There were also vicious barbed staples for use in a range of anti personnel devices as well as food rations and medical equipment. Police had feared the apartment had been booby trapped.

'I want him to be known as the greatest bull ever, and I don't want . to go two, three years down the road and let him tire,' owner Julio Moreno, 60, told the Los Angeles Times. 'To . retire him at the top of his game, like the great racehorse Secretariat . … that last vision of him should be of him at his best.' Bushwacker, who travels the country in a $50,000 trailer that he bought himself, was World Champion in 2010, 2011 and 2013 and was runner-up 2012. To 'win' at bull riding, cowboys have to stay on for a minimum of eight seconds with just a braided rope tied round the bull called the 'flank strap' to hold on to. King of the Bulls: The eight-year-old, 1,700-pound beast is so well-respected in his homeland of North Carolina that he is embarking on a ten-city testimonial retirement tour to give his fans a chance to say goodbye... and see him buck just one last time . The ride is then scored from 0–100 points. Both the rider and the bull are awarded points. But there is just one rider out of 57 who, in the past five years, has managed to stay on board Bushwacker for eight seconds. 'I was 10 feet tall and bulletproof when it was over,' pro cowboy J B Mauney told the LA Times. 'It's a bull everyone was scared of, said couldn't be rode. I rode him.' What separates Bushwacker from other bulls is not that he is strong but that he's smart, says Mauney. 'His signature is that his first jump out of the chute is long . [measured at eight yards],' says Mauney who was thrown by Bushwacker in their 11 previous showdowns. 'Most bulls, when they rear up in the air, . they come straight back down and kick over their head. Him, he goes . forward and up at the same time and then he breaks and kicks.' While Mauney says the two are now friends of sorts, he knows never to get too near to the beast when posing for pictures - even after they've won a prize. Fearsome: Bull riding is known as the most dangerous eight seconds in sport . Moreno says anyone other than one handler will get 'smashed' or 'thrown . over the fence' for trying to pet the grumpy animal. But when it's time for business, Bushwacker is well known as a true professional. 'He doesn't try to lean against the gate or cheat in any way like . other bulls do,' veteran PBR cowboy Frank Newsome told the paper. 'Stands square, right in the middle of . the chute, lets you get your rope pulled as tight as you want it. To be . that cool and that rank is unique.' And when he's thrown whichever rider is foolish enough to try him out to the ground, he doesn't trample them or gore them with his horns... he just runs back into his pen, ready for another round. He doesn't like people much either, says Moreno. Instead he like nothing more than to dig up dirt with his hoof in his pen and snort to his heart's content.","Bushwacker, 8, weighs 1,700lbs and travels America in his own $50k trailer .

The apartment where Jay Z used to store drugs during his dealing days has been put on the market. The rapper revealed the location of his former 'stashspot' in the lyrics of his hit song 'Empire State Of Mind' and now the apartment at 560 State Street is for sale. Though he only mentions the building address in the song and not the apartment number, it has been previously reported to be apartment 10C, which is now on the market for $870,000. Open plan: The kitchen and living room of the duplex apartment are on the first floor . Spacious: The two-floor, two bedroom apartment feels much bigger than it's actual 1,045 square feet . Modern: The amenities have clearly been updated since Jay Z lived in this apartment in 1997 . Outdoor section: The building has a large courtyard area that Jay Z visited recently during the filming of a documentary about his life and upbringing . Jay Z reportedly moved into the building in late 1996 or early 1997, according to Zillow. The interest in the building came after he included the address in the 2009 hit song: 'I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's / Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's / Took it to my stashspot, 560 State St.' From there, New York Magazine launched an investigation into the building's famous past, and initially reported that he lived in apartment 10B after speaking to long-term residents. Global Grind later revealed that the Grammy winning-billionaire actually lived in 10C- as told by Jay Z himself. New reason to visit: Jay Z and Beyonce are regular visitors to the Barclay's Center, which is just one block from his old digs on State Street . New views: The rapper's old apartment has views of the Williamsburg Savings Bank (right) but a recent picture of he and his daughter shows that they have upgraded (left) After one of his concerts that helped open the Barclay's Center- which is not far from his old home- Jay Z stopped by 560 State Street and looked at 10C for part of a documentary being filmed about his roots. 'He pointed out where he slept, how he had the place set up with music equipment and where he worked on some of his hip hop masterpieces in the late ’90s,' Amit Wehle, who lives in apartment 10B, told Global Grind. Now that same apartment that Jay Z called home is on sale, with a price that has clearly appreciated over time. The two-bedroom apartment in Boerum Hill has one and a half bathrooms and an open plan kitchen-living room. The Sotheby's listing notes how light pours in the six oversized windows. A duplex apartment with high ceilings, it comes as little surprise that it is described as being loft-like.","The rapper lived in the Boerum Hill apartment in 1997 and revealed the address in his hit song .

The White House has not commented on the photograph, but David Cameron this week brushed off the incident. During Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons he said: 'In my defense, I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in his life and in his death in bringing people together.

Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler tonight issued a writ against Closer magazine for picturing her in a bikini on a luxury beach holiday. It is just under a month since the glossy revealed that Ms Trierweiler’s ex-boyfriend, President Francois Hollande, was cheating on her with the actress Julie Gayet. Photographs published in Closer showed the portly Socialist visiting a Paris love nest on a moped and wearing a crash helmet as a disguise. Taking action: Valerie Trierweiler, former partner of French president Francois Hollande, has issued a writ against French Closer magazine for publishing pictures of her in her swimwear while on holiday in Mauritius . Ms Trierweiler was so shocked by the images that she checked into a public hospital for eight days complaining of stress, before Mr Hollande separated from her - effectively ‘firing’ her as first lady. Now Ms Trierweiler, who turns 49 this month, is on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, lapping up the sun with two girlfriends. She is pictured in the latest edition of closer in a two-piece bikini, swimming and walking around the sunbeds of her hotel, where presidential villas cost more than £1,500 pounds per night. Her fellow holidaymakers are Valerie de Senneville, the wife of French labour minister Michel Sapin, and Saida Jawad, girlfriend of the actor Gerard Jugnot. All of them spent New Year together at la Lanterne, the hugely luxurious presidential home in Versailles, west of Paris, where Ms Trierweiler also went to recuperate following her time in hospital. Ms Trierweiler confirmed tonight that her lawyers back in France had now issued a writ for an ‘attack on private life’.

Exclusif: Photographs published in Closer showed the portly Socialist meeting actress Miss Trierweiler a Paris love nest on a moped and wearing a crash helmet as a disguise . This is despite the fact that she is on the staff of Paris Match magazine, which is notorious for running photos of the rich and famous while off duty. Match is full of pictures of public figures on the beach every week, but in 2012 Ms Trierweiler successfully sued other magazines for picturing both her and Mr Hollande in their beach wear. Paris Match also ran the pictures, but Ms Trierweiler did not take action agains them, arguing that they did not use them on their cover. At the time many believed that Mr Hollande had staged the ‘shorts and bikini’ photo-shoot to prove that was still ‘very much in love’ with his controversial girlfriend. The couple had been trying to play down speculation that Mr Hollande had threatened to dump his live-in lover. Ms Trierweiler has now been kicked out of the Elysee Palace and is now living in a flat in Paris’s 15th arrondissement. She is said to be planning a book about her 19 months as first lady - something which Mr Hollande is said to be extremely worried about.","Valerie Trierweiler was pictured in a bikini on girls' holiday to Mauritius .

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 08:03 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:16 EST, 24 July 2013 . The remains of the oldest European fort in North America have been unearthed by a team of archaeologists from the University of Michigan. The remnants of the building, which was constructed by Spanish would-be colonists, were discovered in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains - a sub range of the Appalachians. Named Fort San Juan, it was destroyed less than 18 months after it was built, but is historically significant because it marks the end of Spanish attempts to colonise North America - clearing the way for the British. Buried: Although the settlement of Cuenca was discovered in 2004, the fort has proved elusive until now . Protection: The V-shaped Spanish moat was a key part of the fort's defences but couldn't save it in the end . Built by Spanish Captain Juan Pardo in 1567, the fort pre-dates Sir Walter Raleigh's doomed colony at Roanoke by almost 20 years, while the Jamestown settlement, which marked the start of the British domination of North America, wasn't built for another four decades. Almost 300 miles from the Atlantic . coast, the fort was occupied for just 18 months before it was destroyed . by Native American Cherokee tribesmen and all but one of the 120 . soldiers in the garrison killed. The settlement protected by the . forts, Cuenca, was also destroyed by the Cherokee - ending Spanish . colonial ambitions in North America in the process. Although remains of some of the Cuenca homes had previously been discovered, the fort itself had proved elusive until now. 'We have known for more than a decade . where the Spanish soldiers were living,' revealed Christopher Rodning, an archaeologist from Tulane University. Reimagining: William Henry Powell's 1853 Discovery of the Mississippi depicts the early Spanish colonists . Remains: Artifacts left behind by Spanish settlers include this clothing hook, used to fasten doublets . Settlements: This map shows where the seven doomed forts once stood, including Fort San Juan (Joara) 'This summer we were trying to . learn more about the Mississippian mound at Berry, one that was built by . the people of Joara [a Native American settlement], and instead we discovered part of the fort. For . all of us, it was an incredible moment.' Using a combination of large-scale excavations and magnetrometry, which produces X-ray like images of the site, scientists were able to pinpoint sections of the fort, including the moat and a gravelled surface that is likely to have been the entrance to the fort. The searchers also discovered Spanish majolica pottery and other artifacts including iron nails and a hook thought to have been used to button doublets. The Spanish garrison are thought to have been searching for gold in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains with - they thought - the blessing of local tribespeople. 'The soldiers believed that when their gifts were accepted, it meant that the native people were their subjects,' said Robin Beck of the University of Michigan. Intact: The corner bastion, moat and entryway are visible in this shot, taken from the south side of the fort . Success: Robin Beck (right), Dave Moore (centre) and Chris Rodning (right) led the team of archaeologists . 'But to the natives, it was simply an exchange. When the soldiers ran out of gifts, they expected the natives to keep on feeding them. 'The same thing nearly happened to [British] colonists at Jamestown,' he revealed. 'The colonists nearly starved to death during the winter of 1609 but Jamestown was in a very different situation to that of Fort San Juan and Cuenca. 'English settlers kept coming but when Fort San Juan fell, it was gone for good.' Archaeologist David Moore, of Warren Wilson College, added: 'The events at Fort San Juan represent a microcosm of the colonial experience across the continent. 'Spain's failure created an opening that England exploited at Jamestown, when America's familiar frontier narrative begins. 'For Native Americans, though, this was the beginning of a long-term and often tragic reshaping of their precolonial world.'","Fort San Juan was built in 1567, long before the British colony at Roanoke .

A school principal has apologised after Muslim pupils were inadvertently fed bacon when a box of sandwich spread was wrongly labelled as halal chicken and sweetcorn. Chris Quinn, the executive principal of Ninestiles School in Acocks Green, Birmingham, formally apologised for the mix up on the school's website, putting it down to 'human error'. A former teacher pointed out the mistake after eating one of the baguettes herself at the school where more than 50 per cent of pupils are from ethnic minorities. Muslim pupils at Ninestiles School in Birmingham unwittingly ate the bacon after picking up baguettes labelled as halal chicken and sweetcorn . The principal posted a statement of apology on the school's website, saying it is 'nationally and internationally acknowledged as a high achieving, innovative and exciting school which recognises and celebrates the diversity of its community.' The halal food error was discovered by a Muslim teacher who had bought one of the baguettes at lunch in July, during the last week of term before the summer break. The teacher, who has now left the school, said: 'All the halal food is meant to be labelled clearly as halal and I took what I believed was a halal chicken and sweetcorn baguette. 'But after eating it I became aware of a smoky smell and taste. As I looked inside I was horrified to find that there were pieces of what I thought were ham.' She approached catering staff who confirmed the mislabelled baguette contained bacon. The statement on the school's website highlights its culturally diverse student body, apologising for the 'unfortunate mistake' which Ms Quinn later put down to 'human error' 'I felt physically repulsed, terribly upset. I had never eaten pork before and couldn’t believe I was eating it by mistake at school,' the teacher said. 'I had taken the last baguette so all the others and the sandwiches with the same filler in would have been eaten by the pupils, many of whom are Muslim. 'This means pupils were therefore not only given non-halal chicken, but were also given bacon, a meat that is clearly forbidden in Islam and is not supposed to be anywhere near the lips of a Muslim.' The teacher complained to the school immediately and an investigation was launched, with the full apology issued this week. An above average number of students at the school are eligible for free school meals, according to its last Ofsted inspection report. Chris Quinn, Principal at Ninestiles School in Birmingham apologised for the mistake, but said no parents had complained . Just over half are white British; slightly more than ten per cent are from Asian Pakistani backgrounds and a similar proportion are of Asian Indian heritage, the report said. A special unit attached to the school has 45 students with speech and language or ‘community difficulties’. In her website apology Ms Quinn said: 'It has come to the school’s notice that a small number of sandwiches, sold on the 17th July 2013, which were labelled as halal, contained products which were not halal. 'The school apologises for this unfortunate mistake. It is an important part of Ninestiles’ ethos that we meet the dietary requirements of all our students and staff. 'The school is taking steps to ensure its suppliers meet their commitment to the school’s expectations with regards to food standards. The school is also reviewing its own procedures to ensure that this does not happen again. 'We apologise to anyone who inadvertently ate one of this small number of sandwiches.' Ms Quinn repeated the apology and told the Birmingham Mail that a supplier had provided the school with a wrongly labelled sandwich spread. 'This was down to human error,' she told the newspaper. 'This matter was raised by a former member of staff at the time. We have had no complaints from parents.'","Muslim teacher bought ‘halal’ baguette for lunch in July .

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 03:00 EST, 6 September 2011 . Squatters should be encouraged because they bring empty homes back into use, a judge said yesterday. Fiona Henderson ruled they were not criminals and there was no evidence they carried out more anti-social behaviour than rent-paying tenants. Her judgment is a blow to the thousands every year who see their homes invaded – and struggle through the courts to win them back. Trashed: Julia High fell victim to squatters when she went on holiday, returning to find a family of gypsies in her home in Leytonstone, east London, who invited her in for a glass of her own wine . Yet the judge dismissed claims that . squatting victims faced high costs and that those occupying council or . housing association properties were queue jumpers. She ordered a list of empty homes in . North London to be made public to the Advisory Service for Squatters, an . East London-based organisation known as the ‘estate agency for . squatters’. The group, run by Yiannis Voyias, . publishes details of empty homes and a handbook showing how to take full . advantage of housing laws. It came as a surgeon and his wife begged . squatters to leave their new London home amid fears the stress could . complicate the birth of their first child, who is due tomorrow, . Blocked: Oliver and Kaltun Cockerell were due to move into a house in West Hampstead, London, when a group of 11 squatters took over. The legal move by the tribunal judge gives even more opportunities to squatters . Oliver and Kaltun Cockerell were due to move into the house in West Hampstead when the group of 11 squatters took over. The couple offered them £500 to move out but they demanded more. The couple will go to court today seeking an eviction order. It also followed the trashing of Julia High's home when she went on holiday, returning to find a family of gypsies in her home in Leytonstone, east London . Judge Henderson’s ruling that . squatting is a good thing and not a crime comes as Justice Secretary Ken . Clarke considers laws that would finally make squatting a criminal . offence. Proposals include prison sentences for . persistent squatters such as Mr Voyias and the repeal of ‘squatters’ rights’ rules that prevent owners using force to take back their . properties. A list of empty state-owned properties . and private homes owned by companies or trusts rather than individuals . in Camden must be provided to the Advisory Service under Judge . Henderson’s ruling at the Information Rights Tribunal. Blighted communities: Police believe there is a link between squatting and crimes such as vandalism, crack houses and threatening behaviour . Judge Henderson heard evidence from . Camden Council that almost all squatting involves criminal damage, that . squatters jump the queue for scarce public housing and that police link . squatting with vandalism, drugs and threatening behaviour. The council’s lawyers argued that . disclosing the addresses to Mr Voyias under Freedom of Information law . would compromise efforts to prevent and detect crime. But Judge Henderson said: ‘Squatting is not a crime.’ She said the release of the list could . have ‘a negative impact’ on crime prevention and might be of use to . organised criminals looking to burgle and gut empty homes. But the judge said: ‘The tribunal does . not consider that any perceived social disadvantage of living next door . to squatters, or the costs of eviction of squatters, are matters that . the tribunal is entitled to take into consideration since squatting is . not illegal.’ No social disadvantage: There is a lack of evidence proving that squatters were the source of more anti-social behaviour than rent-paying tenants . She added that, although the list . would be of use to professional squatters, its disclosure was unlikely . to increase the drink or drug-fuelled opportunistic crime associated . with empty properties. Judge Henderson said that if squatters . were able to jump the queue for housing, this would have no bearing on . the prevention of crime. She added: ‘There is evidence of some buildings remaining void for many years while planning and funding issues are resolved. ‘The Tribunal is satisfied that publication of this list would  bring a proportion of the void . properties back into use earlier than would otherwise be the case and . that, consequently, this is a strong public interest in favour  of . disclosure.’ Judge Henderson said she accepted that . disclosure of the list would ‘facilitate squatting and associated . crime’, that this would cost public money to  prevent and that ‘the . feeling of security of people living in  neighbouring houses’ would be . undermined. Meanwhile, more empty homes are to be taken over by councils to tackle a national housing shortage. The move will help the homeless and protect the green belt, according to Local Government Minister Bob Neill. Mr Neill, a Tory, said he would step up the ‘empty dwelling management orders’ brought in by Labour in 2006. ‘In the five years they’ve been in . force, there have been only 46 orders, and that contrasts with the . 300,000 empty homes,’ he said.","Camden Council told to hand addresses to squatter website that advises people on how to occupy homes .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 07:05 EST, 4 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:24 EST, 4 February 2014 . Loophole: The anonymous woman, a former foster child, had her procedure sanctioned by social services days before she turned 21 . A 21-year-old foster child had a sex change operation funded by New York Children's services, it has emerged. The patient used a loophole that covers procedures for people without health insurance to pay for surgery to become a woman last Wednesday. It is only the second case of publicly-funded gender reassignment since the rule came into effect in 2010. Social services approved the operation, which costs around $10,000, days before she turned 21, when most children leave the foster care system. Transgender rights activists have hailed the anonymous woman's move as 'inspirational'. Mariah Lopez, a member of Strategic Transgender Alliance for Radical Reform (STARR), told New York Daily News: 'What's happening now is a shift by ACS, in the largest city in the world, influencing health care nationally.' ACS would not comment on the surgery. A spokesman said the agency supports 'the health and well-being of all young people in its care'. A statement added: 'ACS reviews all requests for medical treatment on a case-by-case basis, conducting internal reviews as well as consulting medical professionals’ expertise, to ascertain the nature and severity of a medical condition and determine if a procedure will provide a significant benefit to a youth.' Supporters say the woman was entitled to the treatment as it is more than a cosmetic procedure. It is the latest controversy surrounding sex change operations in New York, after a man became the first person to use a crowd-funding website to raise money to pay for surgery in November. Shakina Nayfack, was born Jared Nayfack in Orange County, California, where she faced years of abuse from people for wearing nail polish and dressing in high heels. The woman travelled to Pennsylvania for the surgery on Wednesday, which costs around $10,000 . The performance artist, 32, who now lives in New York, vowed to raise $52,500 to pay for the sexual realignment surgery in a Thai clinic. She has already spent $10,000 on laser hair removal, electrolysis and hormone replacement theory during her transition from 6ft 2ins, tattooed man to a woman. Appealing through the website YouCaring.com, she said: 'I have been out as trans since 2001, but only decided to undergo a full gender transition toward the end of 2012. She added:'There is really no way I can complete this process without the help of friends and online supporters. 'I decided to launch this campaign to raise the the money I need to finish my transition. '""KickStartHer"" might be the world's first ever crowd-funded sex change!' A spokesman for YouCaring.com spoke out against the project, claiming it was not appropriate in conjunction with appeals for money to fund cancer treatments.","Surgery sanctioned by foster care system days before her 21st birthday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:01 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 7 January 2014 . A generous boss is selling the restaurant he has owned for 17 years to help a 19-year-old employee suffering from a brain tumor. Brittany Mathis, whose father died suddenly from a brain tumor when she was just a child, was diagnosed last month - but does not have health insurance to cover the costs of her treatment. Now Michael De Beyer, the German-born owner of Kaiserhof Restaurant and Wunderbar in Montgomery, Texas, has offered to sell his life's work to help the young server. 'I'm not able to just sit by and let it . happen,' he told the Montgomery Courier. 'I couldn't live . with myself; I would never be happy just earning money from my . restaurant knowing that she needs help.' Scroll down for video . Diagnosis: Brittany Mathis, 19, has a tumor the size of a ping pong ball in her brain - but no health insurance . Compassion: Her boss, Michael De Beyer is going to sell his restaurant so that he can pay for her care . Mathis, whose older sister and mother also work at the same restaurant, first noticed something was wrong when she saw a rash on her leg. 'I went to the hospital and found out it was my blood clotting,' Mathis told KHOU. 'So they wanted to keep me and do CAT scans and MRIs and the next day they came in and told me I had a tumor.' Mathis, who says she suffers from painful headaches, was told she had a brain tumor the size of a ping pong ball in the left side of her brain, the Courier reported. But despite the diagnosis, she has not gone ahead with treatment; she doesn't have heath insurance and has not yet signed up for Affordable Healthcare. Touched: Brittany's mother, Barbara, who also works for De Beyer, says he has always been there for the family . Family tragedy: Barbara's husband and Brittany's father, John (top left), died suddenly in 2000 at the age of 33 after an undetected brain tumor ruptured . On hearing of the family's plight, De Beyer, a married father-of-two, told them he was going to sell his family's 6,000-square-foot restaurant to donate money to them. 'Here's a family, they really work hard, they have a lot of stuff against them in the past and they are not holding their hand open. They didn't even ask anybody for help,' De Beyer told KHOU. He believes the restaurant is worth about $2 million and, before learning of Brittany's health issues, turned down an offer of $1.3 million. 'But now I want to auction it off at a . reserve price [or minimum bid - 50 percent of the actual value] and . anything above that will go to help Brittany,' he said. He told KHOU that after selling the restaurant, he will spend more time with his wife and children. Up for sale: He believes the restaurant is worth $2 million but wants to auction it off to help Brittany . Business: He has owned the German-themed restaurant in Montgomery, Texas for 17 years . The offer comes 14 years after Brittany's father, John, died suddenly at the age of 33 after an undetected brain tumor at the back of his skull ruptured suddenly. 'I guess sort of the same thing Brittany is going through,' said Brittany's mother Barbara Mathis, who is manager of the bar and restaurant. 'Michael has been a real . blessing to our family. And he's just always been there . whenever we've needed anything.' Brittany added: 'I really think it's an amazing blessing and can't thank him enough.'
