"By . Steve Hopkins . A tiny block of toilets in Barnsley have been sold for nearly £70,000. The toilets in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had a guide price of £20,000 but sold for £67,000 - £27,000 more than a two-bed terraced house on the market nearby. Barnsley Council sold the toilets at an auction in Sheffield on Tuesday, with six keen buyers quickly sending the price soaring. The council owned toilet block in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, sold for £67,000 - £47,000 more than the £20,000 guide price - after six bidders quickly sent the price soaring . It is understood that the winning bidder is an entrepreneur form Doncaster. Local businessman and bar owner Arthur O'Loughlin was interested in the toilets, but pulled out of the auction when the price got too high. The toilets were closed earlier this year after the council said it was unable to pay for the upkeep. Auctioneer for Mark Jenkinson and Son, Adrian Little, said: 'I've sold around 10 or 12 toilets in a career of more than 30 years, but these are the ones that have brought in the most.' The toilet block was bought by a local entrepreneur who is expected to turn it into a business . The toilet block sold for £27,000 more than what this two-bedroom house, some 900 yards away, is going for . Just 900 yards from the toilet block, for £40,000 a prospective buyer could pick up a two-bed terraced home. It only comes with one toilet, but it also has a kitchen, a bathroom, two double bedrooms, gas-fired heating, fitted kitchen units and a front and back garden. Mr Little said you couldn't compare the toilet block with a residential property, as it offered commercial opportunities. He said the toilet block was a 'fairly modern' building, was 'right on the shopping parade' and could easily be turned into a cafe or retail outlet. 'It's not a bog standard building,' he joked. Mr Little said it was too early to say what the new owner would do with the property. 'But they must have a plan that makes it work because it's a lot of money. It will be interesting to see how it works out.'","The Barnsley toilet block sold for £47,000 more than auctioneers expected .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Police are investigating claims that Viscount Tonypandy, seen here in his role as Commons Speaker, raped a 9-year-old boy . Police are investigating claims that the late peer Viscount Tonypandy raped a boy, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking into what took them so long to launch an inquiry. The alleged victim, now believed to be 55-years-old, claims he was abused in his Cardiff home in the late-1960s and early-1970s by the politician, then still known as George Thomas and was a Labour MP before his elevation to the peerage as a cross-bencher. The former Speaker, who died in 1997, was friends with the alleged victim's Labour Party supporting foster parents. The man, who now lives in Australia, alleged abuse was also carried out at another address in the city. He has twice complained to South Wales police about the alleged incidents. Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Holland said: 'We were made aware of these ­allegations in April 2013 and have attempted to get in touch with the victim. Unfortunately incorrect contact information was used. As a result we failed to make contact. 'We have since spoken to the victim, apologised for the delay and are investigating his claims. This delay was unacceptable and we have referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.' She added: 'It is important that victims have the confidence to come forward and speak to us. 'We take any allegations regarding sexual assault or rape extremely seriously and urge anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to make contact with us.' The investigation comes as the Government looks into claims the Establishment covered up an alleged paedophilia ring for decades. In the 1960s Viscount Tonypandy, seen here at his Cardiff home, was  a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases . When the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a Westminster child sex ring in the 1980s, Viscount Tonypandy, who was in the Speaker’s chair at the time, had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality. There have also been claims that he tried to proposition young men in the Speaker’s official grace and favour apartment in Parliament. In the 1960s, he was a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases, including Dickens’s dossier in the 1980s. Viscount Tonypandy was one of Britain’s best-loved and most influential public figures as Speaker from 1976 to 1983.","Alleged victim claims he was abused in his Cardiff home in the late 1960s .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A mum jailed after the brutal death of her son at the hands of her drug addict boyfriend may soon walk free from prison after having her sentence slashed. Kieron Barley died after Craig Lewis, 32, violently shook him and then threw his lifeless body against his cot railings in a fit of rage over a wet nappy. Lewis was sentenced to eight years jail in April after admitting causing grievous bodily harm and manslaughter. Kieron Barley with his mother Louise Barley who is now eligible for release after she had more than six months wiped off her 15 month jail term for failing to get her son medical attention . Kieron suffered a broken spine in an assault by his mother's boyfriend, Craig Lewis, in the weeks before the 32-year-old fatally killed him in a fit of rage over a wet nappy . Kieron's mother, Louise Barley, 26, was jailed for 15 months for failing to seek medical attention for her son in the chaotic weeks leading up to his death. Three Appeal Court judges yesterday reduced Barley's sentence by more than half to six months - making her eligible for immediate release. Kieron, who was 22 months old when he died, suffered catastrophic brain injuries in the attack at the couple's home in Kings Heath, Birmingham, in June 2011. Paramedics resuscitated Kieron on the floor of his home when he had a heart attack and stopped breathing but he suffered fatal brain damage and never regained consciousness. Lewis, left, was jailed for eight years over Kieron's death and Barley was sentenced to 15 months prison . The fatal assault happened just three weeks after the father of four had broken Kieron's spine in another attack. The following day Lewis left the family home to holiday at Center Parcs resort with his twin six-year-old girls from a previous relationship. Doctors had failed to notice the spinal injuries and Kieron spent the last few weeks of his life in agony as his parents began spinning a 'web of lies' to cover their tracks. Lawyers for Barley told the appeal judges that Lewis had always seemed calm and caring in her son's company. Police said Lewis and Barley 'spun a web of lies' after Kieron's death, repeatedly claiming their innocence . They agreed she had no idea that Lewis had inflicted such serious injuries on Kieron, ruling her 'culpability' lay in 'not ensuring that Kieron had medical attention'. The court heard that Barley had not taken Kieron to hospital in the first few weeks of June and had failed to give her health visitor a full account during a visit on June 9. Upholding Barley's challenge, the appeal judges said: 'To our mind her offending didn't cause Kieron's death or his serious injury before death. No harm was occasioned by her.' The sentence reduction means Barley is now eligible for release, something Keiron's aunty Lesley Edwards has 'mixed feelings' about. She lays most of the blame for her nephew's death on Lewis and said: 'If somebody told me that he had won some kind of appeal then I would certainly have something to say about it. But I do intend to try and speak to her when she comes out.' After the court case it emerged that Birmingham Children's Hospital had failed to detect Kieron's spinal and head injuries from the first attack. The role of the hospital, and other agencies, is at the centre of a serious case review which will report later this year.","Louise Barley is eligible for release after having her sentence cut .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A cat is up for a top moggy award after tapping on a next-door neighbour's window to get their attention after his owner collapsed at home. Tomcat Slinky Malinki came to Janet Rawlinson's rescue by rapping out an SOS with his paw which alerted Mel and Stephen Sharp. Former nurse and mother-of-one Janet, of Cornholme, Lancashire, was drifting in and out of consciousness for five days after suffering a reaction to morphine she was taking for back pain. Janet Rawlinson with her life saving cat Slinky Malinky, who is up for a hero award at the Cats Protection charity's National Cat Awards which take place in London next month . But the normally aloof two-year-old cat saved the day and has now been nominated for a hero award at the Cats Protection charity's National Cat Awards in London. Ms Rawlinson, 48, credits Slinky with 'saving my life'. She said: 'Slinky was on the fence outside, trying to get the neighbours' attention. 'He was tormenting their dog as well to get their attention. When Slinky's owner collapsed the moggy tapped on his neighbours window to raise the alarm . 'They realised they hadn't seen me for a few days so tried the front door with the spare key, but my key was in the door. 'They got in through the back and managed to wake me up. My neighbour said he thought I was dead.' Ms Rawlinson, a former nurse at Royal Blackburn Hospital who had to give up work due to ill-health, said Slinky now keeps a closer eye on her. Ms Rawlinson said Slinky has become even more attentive since the incident, checking on her regularly . She said: 'If he doesn't see me go in for a couple of hours he will come into the house and find me, and if I don't see him he will tap me on the leg or arm until I respond. 'He never did that until the incident with the morphine.' Ms Rawlinson said Slinky is also playing carer to two 12-week-old kittens she has rescued. Slinky is up against two other felines for the hero award which will be announced on August 7. If he wins he will also be in the running for the overall title of National Cat of the Year. Ms Rawlinson said: 'He is like a gentlemanly uncle. That is how he treats everybody.'","Former nurse Janet Rawlinson suffered a bad reaction to morphine .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Johnny Callie, who was jailed for seven years for drug dealing, has fought deportation on the grounds he relies on NHS care and has a depressed partner . An . American crack dealer has won the right to stay in Britain because he . relies on free NHS medical care and has a depressed girlfriend. Johnny . Callie was jailed for seven years in 2007 for conspiracy to supply . crack cocaine and heroin following a two-year covert operation by . Ipswich police. Callie . was part of a 10-strong gang that flooded the area with drugs from . their base in Colchester and was arrested following raids in August . 2005. In January, 2011 Home Secretary Theresa May refused to revoke an order for Callie's deportation after he appealed the automatic order made following his sentencing in November 2007. But the decorated Vietnam war veteran, who is suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and 'degenerative changes to his right knee' has now argued he would not be able to afford medical care in the US. He also cited the ill health of his long-term girlfriend. The 64-year-old has been fighting his deportation through the courts since his release from prison in August 2010. He earlier halted the order on the grounds it breached his right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention for Human Rights. Mrs May appealed that decision, but Judge Bernard Dawson ruled that Callie could stay. He heard that Callie had been living with his British citizen partner, referred to in documents as SN, since June 1995, and that she had 'no contact with other members of her family and has very few friends'. A decision . by Judge Dawson reads: 'Due to her depression and anxiety she is . usually dependent upon the claimant and cannot easily leave her home on her own or travel outside Ipswich unless he is with her. Judge Bernard Dawson said Callie's age and medical conditions would make it difficult for him to find work . 'She . would experience high level of anxiety were she to leave her home and . travel to America with the claimant. She has a history of attempted . suicide.' Judge Dawson's decision goes on to say the woman would be unable to stay in the US unless she married Callie, who has two sons who are both British citizens. He said . Callie's partner would not be entitled to Medicaid and it 'is unlikely . the couple could afford private health insurance'. The judge added: 'The claimant has not . lived in the United States since 1984, has no property there and in the . light of his age and his medical conditions it would be difficult for him to obtain employment.' A letter from Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust from February 2014 said Callie's compliance had been 'excellent' and that he didn't demonstrate any behaviour that would 'lead to further offending'. The letter said Callie had remained drug free since his release and had not relied on welfare benefits.","Johnny Callie has high blood pressure, diabetes and a bad knee .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Steve Hopkins . The parents of a five-year-old Calgary boy who went missing with his grandparents more than a week ago insisted during a Thursday night vigil that there will be a positive outcome. Nathan O’Brien and grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes were reported missing June 30 by Rod and Jennifer O'Brien - they have not been heard from since, but the parents will not give up hope. 'We’re very hopeful that they’re out there. There’s no doubt in our mind,' Jennifer O'Brien said between tears, according to the National Post. Keeping hope: Rod O'Brien, and Jennifer O'Brien attend a candlelight vigil for Nathan O'Brien, 5, and his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes in Calgary, Alberta, Canada,  Thursday, July 10 . 'We’ve just got to find them and the police are doing everything they can do,' she continued. 'I’m hopeful in every way and we all are. I hope this turns out to be a happy story and I think it’s going to.' About 500 people gathered for the vigil, according to the paper, They wore green ribbons, held candles and fought back tears during prayers and a moment of silence. 'I like to think of this whole thing as just a way to keep the flame going,' Jeff Liknes, Kathryn and Alvin’s son, told the assembled mass. 'I don’t want to think of this like a funeral because I know it’s not one. I’d love to see them again.' The gathering came only days after police raided the suburban Alberfa farm of 54-year-old Douglas Garland and took him into custody for questioning. He is believed to have been driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared - the one found by cops in his driveway when they arrived at his farm. Police are said to be looking into a . dispute over a business deal several years ago between Garland - who is . related to the missing trio through a sister's comnon-law marriage - and . Mr Alvin, according to the National Post. Officers focused their hunt for the missing family members at three Airdrie locations on Monday. One centered around a slough and a field near the home of Mr Garland's parents, Archie and Doreen Garland. Garland once operated a drugs lab at the property which police searched over the weekend, court records showed.

A 'person of interest': Douglas Garland (left) has been questioned over the disappearance of Nathan O'Brien (right) and his grandparents (below) while officers searched his family farm for clues . Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a struggle in the their Arkhill home . After being questioned by police Garland was released the following day. He . was then remanded in custody for two days for possessing the . identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car . crash in 1980. He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment. Garland . made a brief appearance in court on Monday, via closed circuit . television, and was remanded in custody for an additional 48 hours, in . which time police could continue to interview him. Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product. Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years. He . was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the . dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges. 'You're our superhero': During a press conference, Nathan's mother Jennifer O'Brien told her son to stay strong . The truck in question: Canadian authorities said this green late 1980s - early 1990s Ford F-150 pickup was circling the house where the missing trio was before they went missing . Mrs O'Brien described her son as a chatterbox who loved superheros. Pictured above, Rod O'Brien (left), Jennifer O'Brien (second left), Maximus O'Brien (center), Nathan O'Brien (second right), Luke O'Brien . Garland . had used the fake identity to gain employment as a chemical mixer, but . that ended in 1997 after a promotion led to him suffering a nervous . breakdown. He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed. Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won. His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009. Monday's search involved forensics investigators and fire personnel who scoured a waterway in a rapid deployment craft. Green . ribbons have now appeared around the close-knit Airdire community, a . symbol of hope that the trio will return home safe and sound. On . Friday Calgary police Staff Sgt. Doug Andrus spoke about the . significance of locating the truck seen near Liknes family home on the . night they disappeared. Police swarmed on the Garland family farm after neighbours reported seeing the Ford F-150 there . He . said: 'We just believe given the area the vehicle was in, and the fact . that it was the night of the incident and that it drove in the area . several times, that there's a good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have information.' At . the press conference police confirmed a 'violent crime happened in that . residence', but said they remained hopeful 'we will find them alive'. The . missing boy's grandparents are not considered suspects as investigators . found evidence that all three left the home against their will. Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke of his beloved son last week. He . said: 'To whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off . our little angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his . brothers and his family.' <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->I think this is going to turn into a happy story: Mother of 4 yo canadian boy abducted alongside his grandparents says she hopes.

"By . Steve Hopkins . A Florida nurse charged with murdering her male flatmate posted a video on Facebook in which she admits bashing his head against the floor, police said. Rosemarie Farid, 40, is being held without bond after Donald Galvagni's battered body was discovered in the bathtub of his Sunrise home on July 2. A friend of his had called police requesting he be checked on. In the video Farid, who according to her Facebook page is a nurse, assistant maid and cook, also admitted stealing the 64-year-old's phone so he couldn't call police and taking money from his wallet. Rosemarie Farid, seen here in a picture taken from her Facebook page, has been charged with murdering her roommate Donald Galvagni, 64, at the home they shared in Sunrise, Florida . Farid claims to have worked at Servantry, which appears to be The Heart of Servant Ministry church in Sunrise, since 1990, and to have last year studied at West Broward School For Nursing Assistants. She has posted close to 250 videos on her social media account, which lists her as being engaged. Most involve her talking directly to the camera about her difficult relationship with her parents, her dog, or her living arrangements. In one video her and a man she refers to, and who answers to, Donny, discuss the future of a dog that lives at the address. The fight between Farid and Mr Galvagni is believed to have been sparked by him letting her dog inside their flat. A video posted on Farid's Facebook page appears to show her speaking with Mr Galvagni, pictured, about the future of a dog living at the address . Farid, 40, in her Broward Sheriff's Office mug shot following her arrest on Saturday for murder . In a series of Facebook status updates on June 30, the day Mr Galvagni died, Farid wrote on her profile page of 'having violent fantasies about taking revenge on Donny'. 'I'm so pissed off about having to live with Donny loser that It will be hard to not kick Donnys a** today. I'm in a violent mood and Donny has one coming from me, big time!' She also wrote; 'Ofcourse (sic) I don't hit first, I let him go, then I'll finish it up.' That same day she posted a video in which she described herself as mentally disturbed and dangerous while 'having fantasies about stabbing him in the neck.' Status updates Farid posted on her Facebook page on June 30, the day in which Mr Galvagni died, in which she describes her 'violent fantasies about taking revenge on Donny' Farid said: 'I know that I can become pretty violent and I'm a pretty dangerous person when I'm driven to it. 'When I get to the point of the violent fantasies, then I have to get out, because I am mentally disabled.' She then talks about his death: 'I took all of the money out of his wallet and I stole his phone. And I bashed his head on the floor a couple of times and got the floor all bloody.' Farid was arrested for Mr Galvagni murder on Saturday. It has been reported that she was located at a Florida medical centre where she was being held following an unrelated incident. Police officers have described finding a pool of blood in Mr Galvagni's living room, bloody wash cloths in the sink and a trail of blood leading from the hallway to a bathroom. It is thought Mr Galvagni died from cardiac arrest after losing a substantial amount of blood. Farid is understood to have told police that she got into an argument with Mr Galvagni before pushing him, causing him to fall and hit his head on the cement entrance to the bathroom. She then got on top of him and smashed his head on the floor, it has been alleged.","Rosemarie Farid allegedly killed her flatmate after arguing over a dog .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A German intelligence 'double agent' who allegedly sold hundreds of top secret documents to the US was only caught after trying to broker an additional deal with Russia. Details of the deal, to the Russian secret service, emerged yesterday after Chancellor Angela Merkel's government summonsed the US ambassador to Berlin. It is the second case of suspected US intelligence spying against Germany within a year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has summonsed the US Ambassador to  discuss the 'double agent' Eight months ago German-US relations . became tense after it was revealed that Mrs Merkel's phone had . been bugged by the US National Security Agency. On Friday, Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) intelligence service admitted that one of its agents had been arrested for supplying American intelligence with at least 300 top secret documents over a period lasting several years, The Independent reported. Three of the documents are believed to have related to German investigations into US surveillance and phone bugging. The as yet unnamed 31-year-old was caught by his own country's counter espionage agents and is in German police custody. The spy was said to have supplied the US National Intelligence Service with at least 300 top secret documents . German intelligence sources revealed that the US spy may have operated undetected for years and that he passed on information at secret locations for about £8,000 a time. It also said he established contact with the US through a simply email to the Amercian embassy. The agent's arrest was raised at meeting of a German parliamentary committee tasked with investigating US surveillance scandal. There is speculation that Germany will get their own back on the US by inviting CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify against the NSA before a Berlin parliamentary committee . Reports suggest the double agent was only discovered after he tried to supply information to Russia, again by simply sending an email to their embassy. BND agents were said to be 'stunned' by the discovery, as were German MPs. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told Bild newspaper: 'I expect everyone now to . assist quickly in clearing up the accusations - and quick and clear . statements, from the USA too.'

"By . Steve Hopkins . These are the shocking injuries caused by a robber who has been jailed for life for attacking vulnerable pensioners in their own homes. Lee Roberts, 33, had already been jailed for 11 years in 2004 for the manslaughter of Neville Bassett, 90, during a burglary, but soon after being released he was at it again. Robert's worst attack was on an 87-year-old woman who needed 13-stitches to repair cuts across her face that was battered black and blue. These are the horrific injuries an 87-year-old woman suffered after being shoved against a radiator by Lee Roberts who went on to steal £500 from her during a raid on her Chelmsley Wood home . Roberts was released from jail in 2011 and a court heard that by the end of last year the drug addict was targeting pensioners aged between 71 and 92 in the Solihull and Yardley areas - stealing cash and other valuables. His most brutal raid came on December 20 when he shoved the 87-year-old woman against a radiator before dragging her from room to room demanding cash. He then tied a cushion over the pensioner's head before fleeing her home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, with £500. In another robbery, Roberts left a 73-year-old woman with a broken finger and medics had to cut a treasured ring from her hand. He also robbed a 92-year-old dementia sufferer. The judge told Roberts that one of the 'most serious aspects' of his offending was the fact he had returned to 'this sort of crime' after already being jailed over a death in 2004 . Roberts struck five times either side of New Year by knocking at the doors of pensioners and bundling them inside when they answered. He admitted four counts of robbery and one charge of burglary and was jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday. Judge Roderick Henderson told Roberts, of Olton, West Midlands, that he must serve at least six years and nine months before he is considered for release. He added: 'One of the most serious aspects is you chose to go back to this sort of crime, picking on vulnerable, elderly people. 'You used whatever violence was necessary to get whatever you could get from them. 'Your previous offending resulted in the death of one person, that should have given you a clear message.' The judge said the crimes had a 'devastating effect' on the victim's lives. The court heard after battering the 87-year-old woman, Roberts stole a TV and loose change from a 73-year-old woman in Solihull on January 2. He then snatched a 91-year-old woman's pension two days later, and three days after that grabbed a handbag from a pensioner when she answered her door in Birmingham. Robert's ransacked the dementia sufferer's Hobbs Moat flat sometime between January 4 and 7. In a victim impact statement, one of Roberts' elderly targets said she had never felt so vulnerable in her home which she had lived in for 45 years. 'I always check my window before I go to bed to make sure he's not waiting outside. I think it's horrible this man has made me feel this way.' Roberts' defence team said he had turned to crime to fund his drug habit after being sacked from a job when his criminal past came to light. After the hearing, Detective Constable Arran Cox from West Midlands Police, described the crimes as  'terrifying ordeals' for those involved.","Lee Roberts targeted pensioners aged 71 to 92 years old .

Margaret Jowsey, 70, doesn't have a balcony at her top-floor Norwich council flat and says she has never received any complaints about her using the space. But health and safety bosses have now ordered her to stop. Margaret Jowsey in the stairwell outside her Norwich flat where she has hung her washing for 25 years . Officers at Norwich City Council claim her damp clothes are a fire hazard and fear somebody could trip over her washing line in an emergency. In a letter to Ms Jowsey the council also said communal areas needed to be kept clear to enable repairs, and that as a landlord they had to 'work with our residents to minimise this risk'. Ms Jowsey said she had no option but to dry her washing on the stairwell: 'I’m on a low income so I can’t afford to go to the laundrette and I don’t have room for a tumble dryer. 'I just can’t believe they’re trying to stop me putting my washing out after all this time.'

Ms Jowsey works three nights a week as a carer and says she knows all about health and safety. 'A washing line ban is way beyond common sense. 'You could say there should be a sprinkler on the stairs instead. 'The postman has never hung himself up on our washing line and when workmen come they’ve never had a problem.

He said: 'You have to stand up for what you believe in. 'That’s a laundry line. 'This ban is going against our human rights.' Councillor Brenda Arthur, leader of Labour-ruled Norwich City Council, said the council was 'very happy' to talk to Ms Jowsey about her concerns. He said: 'We want to talk to residents and work with them to find alternative ways to accommodate their needs. 'Separately to this, I know Cllr Bert Bremner, as the cabinet member for housing, has asked officers to carry out an immediate review on the use of communal areas to ensure that a common sense approach prevails.' The ban comes after award-winning Norwich gardener, Kerry Annison, was warned last year that her pot plants were a health and safety danger and must be removed. Council officers ordered the 48-year-old to remove her plants from a balcony which leads up to her former council flat. They acted just months after she had been presented with a prize for them by the city’s Lord Mayor.","Margaret Jowsey has been using the area to dry her washing for 25 years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two Romanians caught attempting to smuggle Afghan migrants across the Channel to Britain in the boots of their cars have been jailed by a court in Boulogne on the French coast. Ionica Doru Cicea, 22, was arrested on Monday in Calais after two women were discovered in the boot of his Volkswagen Passat. A second man, Dumitru Vaduva, aged 60, was handed over to the French authorities by British Border Police after they found a three year old child accompanied by his parents - again in the boot of a car, a Citroen Picasso. Smuggling: The two men were jailed for smuggling Afghans in their boot. Pictured is the scene at Calais this week, where would-be migrants try their luck on lorries headed over the border . The court heard that investigators established links between the two cases. On both the phones of the two defendants the same number - of a man living in Britain known as ‘Christie’- was found. At first Christie was believed to be Indian but later turned out to be Romanian. He allegedly paid the smugglers to drive the migrants onto the ferry and across the Channel. The court heard that a third vehicle accompanied the two defendant’s cars and was intending to monitor the operation. The migrants were allowed to sit on the back seat of the vehicles but as they approached border control posts they were ordered to get into the boot where breathing was difficult in the confined space. One of the defendants was paid £800 for his part in the operation and the other was told he could keep the car he used for the operation. The judge was told that Vaduva has a previous conviction in 2002. Operation: The court heard that three cars were involved in the smuggling attempt. Pictured above are more hopefuls camped outside Calais . He jailed Cicea for 10 months and Vaduva for one year. A source in Boulogne confirmed last night that the migrants were all of Afghan nationality and had been released after questioning. The Boulogne prosecutor told the court: ‘The family of three persons (parents plus child) had been arrested and questioned by Police three times in ten days. ‘Needless to say,that the smugglers who took them belong doubtless to the same organisation. The two defendants knew exactlywhat they were doing. ‘Otherwise why didn’t they put them on board a Eurolines coach? Of course the bad people are the ones that are not present here in court today. They are the enforcers who belong to a criminal organisation. In the pursuit of gain, everything including standards of good behaviour, comes second.’","Ionica Doru Cicea, 22, and Dumitru Vaduva were arrested by British police .

"By . Steve Hopkins . An £8million artwork by Claude Monet all but destroyed when a man put his fist through it is back on display after a painstaking 18-month restoration. The impressionist painting was ripped apart in a devastating three branch tear in June 2012 while it hung in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. A man is awaiting trial over the vandalism. The tears to the painting from 1874, called Argenteuil Basin With A Single Sailboat, laid end to end would have been about a foot long in an artwork less than four feet square. The £8million Monet, called Argenteuil Basin With A Single Sailboat, after it was damaged while hanging in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, in 2012 . Jean-Jacques Goran, managing director of BNP Paribas Foundation, who helped fun the repairs, and Claude Monet Paintings Conservation Fellow, Pearl O'Sullivan, unveil the restored artwork . The varnish that covers the oil paint was also cleaned before the artwork was returned to the gallery giving it a brighter finish more reminiscent of how it originally looked 140 years ago . Monet's painting, the only one in Ireland's national collection, depicts the shifting clouds, rippled water, golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience . Sean Rainbird, director of the National Gallery of Ireland, likened the meticulous repair to microscopic needlework. 'It was huge damage, shocking damage,' he said. 'This project to restore and conserve one of the gallery's most popular impressionist works of art is testament to the outstanding expertise and dedication of our professional team of conservators.' The oil painting - the only Monet in . Ireland's national collection - is relatively small at 55cm by 65cm but . is regarded as a classic. Mr Goran and Ms O'Sullivan look over the restored artwork which is now housed behind protective glass . It was painted at a time when Monet was using a boat as a floating studio on the Seine to paint scenes of the river and its banks. It is now being housed behind protective glass - a low reflective, ultraviolet-filtered climate box with a humidity buffer. Monet painted the scene in his own . distinctive brushstroke style and contemporary colours in the same year . that the first impressionist exhibition was held in Paris. The director of the National Gallery of Ireland said the quality of the restoration was a testament to the 'outstanding expertise and dedication' of those involved in the lengthily project . It depicts the shifting clouds, rippled water, golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience. The painting was bequeathed to the Irish state by dramatist and politician Edward Martyn who bought it on the advice of his cousin, the writer George Moore. The repair work involved gathering hundreds of microscopic fragments of paint which broke off the canvas during the vandalism - most measured 0.3-1mm across. Sean Rainbbird, director of the National Gallery of Ireland, Mr Goran, and managing director of the Paribas Foundation Simone Mancini speak before the unveiling . Seven per cent of the pieces could not be saved, some splitting into powdery dust, too tiny to reattach in the jigsaw restoration. Conservationists removed the painting from its frame and delicately sewed together thousands of fine threads which made up the canvass. Under a microscope and using surgical tools and special heaters, they reattached fine materials with a specially formulated adhesive. The varnish which covers the oil paint was also been cleaned before the artwork returned to the gallery giving it a brighter and fresher feel, closer to what it the original work looked like 140 years ago. The canvass has been lined across the back to provide additional support. The restoration was supported by BNP Paribas, with Monet Paintings Conservation Fellow, Pearl O'Sullivan being hired to undertake the work.","The delicate restoration took 18 months to complete .

A thug broke his finger punching a man then tried to win compensation from his local council telling them he injured it falling down a pothole. Kyle Denton's story fell apart when it emerged he had posted a picture of his finger on Facebook and boasted that he damaged it 'cracking someone'. Officials from Wakefield Council, West Yorkshire, traced the victim of the assault who confirmed he had been hit by Denton. The 27-year-old even met with staff to show them the spot where he had allegedly fallen. Wakefield Magistrates Court heard how Denton’s account became suspicious following the meeting about the authenticity of the claim. Angus MacDonald, prosecuting, said: 'Rather than injuring it in a fall, he had sustained it assaulting a man. 'The defendant stated on the [conversation] thread that it had happened ""cracking someone"".' Denton, of Lupset, West Yorkshire, who had submitted a personal injury claim in November 2012, dropped the allegation and his solicitor stated he would no longer be taking action against the council. Mr MacDonald added: 'No payment was made. The claim was at such an early stage. It’s only through the vigilance of the council and their employees that the suspicious nature of this came to light.' Magistrate Julian Garthwaite told Denton, who admitted fraud: 'You falsely claimed and stuck with that line you had fallen down a pothole to get money from the council.

Despite its downgrading, Iselle is the first hurricane or tropical storm to hit the island chain in 22 years. Wind and rain from the system still had enough force to knock down trees, cause power outages and block roads on the Big Island, however. No deaths or major injuries have been reported. Iselle was classified as a tropical storm 11pm Thursday Hawaii Standard Time when its winds slowed to 70mph, putting it below the minimum of 74mph for a hurricane. The storm was weakening because of several factors, including wind shear chopping at the system and the Big Island's terrain above the water, said Chris Brenchley, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu. ‘As wind blows into the terrain, the terrain kind of redirects the wind,’ he said.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A friend of Peaches Geldof's late mother has claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, while friends who knew about her heroin addiction 'turned blind eyes'. Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she reached out to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother, who died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. But she said Peaches, a mother-of-two, suffered after those around her 'said nothing' - despite the 25-year-old relapsing. Scrool down for video . A family friend of Peaches Geldof and her late mother Paula Yates has told how she tried to confront the 25-year-old about her drug use as others turned 'blind eyes' to her heroin habit . This picture, which Peaches posted hours before her death, shows Paula Yates, who died of an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, with Peaches as a young girl. Gerry Agar said: 'I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches' She told Grazia magazine: 'I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it. 'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches.' The author said she had written Peaches a letter in 2008, encouraging her to wean off the drugs, but that she never heard from her again. Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she wrote Peaches a letter in 2008 but did not hear from her again . She said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her two sons - Astala, two, and Phaedra, one - but that she soon relapsed. She told the magazine that Peaches' death had been 'a horrible waste', just as it was with Miss Yates. Ms Agar previously told the Daily Mail how she had blown the whistle on Miss Yates' drug habit in 1996 after she found opium under her bed in a Smarties box. Detectives did not prosecute Miss Yates because of insufficient evidence. She told the paper: ‘When Paula took drugs she became another person, really a diabolical being. ‘I don’t think anyone truly understands what life was like in that family and Peaches got the worst of it. I can’t even begin to describe what that poor girl lived through.' Peaches was found dead at her £1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen. Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41. At an inquest into Peaches' death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family's country home. Ms Agar said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her . two sons Phaedra and Astala but that she soon relapsed . Peaches, pictured with her husband Thomas Cohen, had managed to wean herself off the drug but had a relapse in February . North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death. She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling. 'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing' Gerry Agar . In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit. But Mr Cohen, a 24-year-old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. When he confronted her about it, she . retrieved a stash she had hidden in the loft and flushed it down the toilet to show . she was serious about giving up. But she failed to break the habit. Mr Hatch said Peaches' death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates' death, because Miss Geldof had tried to . break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one . would ever know. She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died.","Gerry Agar accused others of turning 'blind eyes' to Peaches' heroin habit .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pet dog who was chased over a cliff by two deer survived the 60ft-fall after landing in thick brambles. Pebbles, a Yorkshire terrier, was in her cliff-top back garden in Weymouth, Dorset, on Monday night when the two wild animals came in and chased after her. The 16-year-old plunged down the cliff face and disappeared into the undergrowth and bushes below. Pebbles, a 16-year-old Yorkshire terrier from Weymouth, Dorset, had a lucky escape when she fell off a 60ft cliff into some undergrowth after being chased by two deer . This shows how far Pebbles fell during the incident. Pebbles's owner Rob Cox tried to rescue the dog when he heard her whimpers from the bushes below but could not navigate the steep cliff in the dark . But when her owners, Rob and Lynne Cox, peered over the edge, they were relieved to hear their pet’s barks. Mr Cox, 68, then used a torch to find his way down the cliff path in a bid to find the dog. But he was forced to give up after struggling to get through the bushes. He said: 'We do get deer in our garden quite often and the other . night while Pebbles was outside two of them chased her. 'She . has got failing eyesight and she just fell over the edge of the cliff. It is a sheer drop but it is a bit of a jungle at the bottom. Pebbles was said to be like a 'walking bush' after he was rescued by coastguard officers . 'It . was dark so I couldn’t see her but I could hear this whimpering bark. I . went down the path with a torch but the batteries ran out and I ended . up getting stuck in the bushes and badly scratched.' The couple phoned the coastguards who set up search lights at the bottom of the cliff and cut a 15ft path through the brambles. The team had attempted to reach Pebbles from the top of the cliff but decided to carry out the rescue from the bottom after finding it too risky. They discovered Pebbles, buried in a prickly bush. And, despite looking like a 'walking bush', the dog was relatively unscathed. Mr Cox said: 'After she was rescued pebbles was covered in brambles and twigs - she was like a walking bush. 'If it wasn’t for the coastguards I don’t think we would ever have found her.' Tony Goss, the station officer for Wyke Regis coastguard, said: 'We cut a path through the undergrowth towards the barking and found the dog buried in it. 'It was pretty much a sheer drop from the top and the brambles must have cushioned her fall.'","Pebbles was in her garden in Weymouth when the wild animals came in .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pet beagle has been taped together with a Velcro-style material after she was almost ripped in two during an vicious dog attack. Five-year-old Bonnie was torn open from her belly to the top of her back after an American bulldog gnawed its teeth into her skin in one fierce bite. Bonnie's gaping wound was stitched up immediately by a local vet near to her home in Bathgate, West Lothian. Bonnie, a five-year-old beagle, right, was almost torn in two after an American bulldog sunk its teeth into her body during a random one-bite attack in Bathgate, West Lothian earlier this month . But the wound reopened and could not be stitched back up because most of the skin had shed off. Now the dog has undergone revolutionary treatment at the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh - known as the Dick Vet - to have her wound stuck together with the Velcro-style type. Her owner, Valerie Millen, says the treatment she is receiving is the first of its kind in the UK. The tape is only used on animals, not on humans. The 46-year-old said: 'Bonnie is still in the care of the . Dick Vet in Edinburgh. She is getting the treatment and will be the . first in the UK to get it. 'They use it in America but it’s never been done here.' Bonnie sustained her horrific injury after Ms Millen took her for a walk five minutes from their home. As they were walking, an American bulldog ran up to Bonnie and took one giant chunk out of her skin, before running off. Police Scotland say a woman has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act following the incident. She has been released on bail. Ms Millen said: 'I’m just shocked, devastated. 'Since she has been at the Dick Vet we don’t get to see her but we get a call everyday about how she is. I just want her home. She is part of the family.' Ms Millen said the fabric fastener - which uses microscopic hooks and loops - has been glued to Bonnie’s skin on both sides of the wound. The stretching technique should allow vets eventually to stitch the wound up. Despite having insurance, the family face a £9,000 bill for the treatment at the school. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'A woman has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act after the dog she . was in charge of attacked another woman and a beagle on Alexandra . Drive, Boghall, on July 10. 'A . report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal. Police have been liaising . with West Lothian Council and restrictions have been placed on the . animal.' A spokesman for West Lothian Council said: 'We are assisting Police Scotland with its enquiries into this matter. 'In these circumstances it is not appropriate for us to comment. We would encourage anyone with information to contact Police Scotland on 101.'","The five-year-old was torn open around her middle by an American bulldog .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A British grandmother has been reunited with her American pen pal nearly 70 years after she first posted an advert in a New York newspaper looking for a long-distance friendship. Joyce Vosper was a 15-year-old schoolgirl when she placed an advert in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1947, looking for new friends around the world. Eileen Schreiber, 14, from New York, saw the . notice and responded to the British teenager - with the first of hundreds of letters the pair . would exchange over the years. Eileen Shreider, 82, from New York and Joyce Vosper, 83, pictured right, . from Plymouth, Devon, have been reunited 70 years after they . began writing to one another as pen pals . Mrs Vosper, now 83, sent the advert after the death of her father William, a fisherman, died in 1945, aged 45. As their special relationship blossomed, Mrs Shreider, now 82, sent sweets and clothes to her English pen pal as she coped with post-war Britain. Their correspondence then continued for decades, as both women married, had children and went through the deaths of their husbands . Mrs Shreider said: 'We would talk about our everyday life - what we felt about the war. We weren’t as close to the war whereas Joyce was right next to it. 'We explained to our neighbours that there was this family that had nothing, not even a father, and my mother would send out these great big boxes with dresses, candy bars and things hidden in the coats.' The pair began writing after Mrs Vosper sent an advert into the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper in the US, pictured above, when she was aged 15, asking if the paper could help her find an American pen friend . Mrs Vosper - who is known as Joycey to her friends - originally decided to write to the US after losing her father in 1945. She said: 'I thought one day I would like to travel and the way to do that was to . make some friends around the world and to find out what the world was . like. 'I just wanted to write to . someone after everything so I wrote to the paper in the hope of finding . an American pen pal.' Her letter, addressed to one of the Daily Eagle’s reporters Helen Worth, was printed in full on page 10 of the Monday, March 31 1947 edition. It read: 'On reading your article in the paper I thought you’d be able to help me to get a pen friend in America. 'My age is 15 and a half years and my hobby is collecting film stars’ pictures. I’m very interested in writing to a friend in the USA. Hoping you will oblige and to hear from you or pen pal soon.' When Mrs Shreider discovered her pen pal was being raised by a single mother after the death of her father, she asked her family to send things though the post. Her parents gathered clothing, food and other essentials and posted them to . England - an act of kindness that Mrs Vosper says she has never forgotten. From then on, the duo wrote to each other constantly before losing touch for about ten years. But after the internet was created, Mrs Shreider tracked down Mrs Vosper's brother's email address - with whom she was living at the time. Mrs Shreider, a former data analyst for IBM, said: 'The computer came in and I started looking for Joyce but I couldn’t remember her married name. 'I started looking on the internet and I sent an email to a man named Colin Launder. It turned out to be Joyce’s brother who she was living with at the time so he put us back in touch. 'That’s the thing that surprised me - I thought she might have decided that she didn’t want to write to me anymore but she did.' Mrs Vosper, pictured here in 1949 when she was crowned Miss Barbican in Plymouth, wrote to the newspaper when she was grieving over the death of her father, who died in 1945 . The pair later met up in America when Mrs Vosper and her daughter Beverley travelled to the US to visit Mrs Shreider. But this is the first time that Mrs Shreider has visited the home of which Mrs Vosper wrote so vividly during the post-war years. Mrs Vosper, nee Launder, married a widower, Walter Vosper, at the age of 21 and had two step-daughters and two girls of her own. Mrs Shreider married her husband Ray, to whom she was married for 33 years, and had two daughters and two sons. When Mr Shreider died in December, and after having open-heart surgery in May, Mrs Shreider finally decided to book a flight to Britain. The letters writers were in contact for decades but almost lost touch as . their lives went in different directions. They re-started their . correspondence when Mrs Shreider looked for Mrs Vosper on the internet - . and found her brother's email address . Mrs Vosper said: 'I was amazed that . she came because I was afraid that something would happen - but she’s a . tough old bird, she really is. 'Life went on and we lost touch for a few years but it was great when we managed to get back in contact in the 90s. 'Eileen was crying. We’ve shared a lot over the years and it’s been so lovely having her here. 'Eileen is just incredible, she had a heart operation before she came out in May and I thought she may not be able to come. 'We’ve had such an amazing time. I’m going to be really sad to see her leave but we’ve had some lovely trips out.' Mrs Shreider's daughter, Maureen, who has travelled to the UK with her mother, added: 'It’s like she’s come alive again since she got to Plymouth.'","Joyce Vosper from Plymouth advertised in a US paper asking for a pen pal .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A five-year-old boy was banned from his school canteen and allegedly given bread and water for lunch after the school refused to accept a 'late' dinner money payment from his mother. Callum Slater, a pupil at Longmoor Community Primary School in Walton, Liverpool, usually goes to the school canteen each day for a tuna and cheese wrap, as well as a pick and mix salad from the salad bar. But the young pupil was made to eat an alternative lunch outside his headteacher's office after his mother Lesley tried to pay his £9 dinner money five hours 'too late'. Callum Slater, five, was made to sit outisde his headteacher's office and was given bread and water for lunch after his mother Lesley handed . in the £9 payment for the forthcoming week's meals 'too late' The school asks parents to pay money for the forthcoming week's meals by the Friday before. But when Ms Slater tried to pay the amount at the end of the day, instead of in the morning, the school refused to accept it. Despite assurances from the school that his mother's 'missed' payment would not leave her boy without the usual school dinner, Callum was stopped from eating in the school canteen the following week. Callum’s . grandmother Sheila said the family was now considering moving Callum to another school after she claims he was given a bread roll and water for his lunch. In a statement, a spokesman for the . school denied the claims and said Callum had been given the same lunch . as everyone else that day - which included a tuna baguette, juice and . ice cream and fruit for dessert. But the 68-year-old from Aintree, Liverpool, said: 'They gave him a brown barmcake and a glass of water. Callum was so upset and he was saying ‘what have I done?’ Longmoor Community Primary School in Walton, Liverpool, said the move was to stop children being embarrassed at not having their usual lunch and have now apologised for the incident . 'When we took him to school the next day he kept saying ‘have I got to sit outside the headteacher’s room?’ 'He’s . only five so he’s not old enough to understand. He didn’t understand . why he couldn’t sit with his best friend like he normally does.' Mrs Slater said parents had not been told there was a time deadline for the payment and the only specification was that it was paid on Friday. The school confirmed there had been a 'misunderstanding' in regards to the payment. Mrs Slater said her daughter was also reassured that Callum would still be given his lunch and would not be left on his own. On the Monday, because his account was 'in credit' from a previously missed lunch, Callum was allowed to chose his lunch from the canteen. 'He’s . only five so he’s not old enough to understand. He didn’t understand . why he couldn’t sit with his best friend like he normally does' Sheila Slater, Callum's grandmother . But the following day, Mrs Slater said she discovered Callum had spent lunchtime on his own outside headteacher Alison Johnson’s room. Callum was then given packed lunches all week until his mother could pay the next lunch money instalment the following Friday. Mrs Slater said: 'It says in the school newsletter that the children’s dinner money has to be paid on a Friday but it doesn’t say what time. 'My daughter hadn’t forgotten all year but last Friday she forgot to take it in with her in the morning. 'When . she went to pick him up at 3.30pm she went to the office but the . headteacher said ‘you’re too late’. She said ‘it’s still Friday’ but she . said it had to be in by lunchtime. 'They just wouldn’t take the money off us. He was being punished for something he hasn’t done and we want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.' The school said the move was to prevent . children from being embarrassed in front of other pupils if they did not have . their usual lunch. The statement said: 'Pupils whose parents have forgotten to pay for school dinner are given a more basic packed lunch made up of a sandwich, a drink and a piece of fruit. 'To avoid embarrassment, pupils in this situation have their lunch away from other children. However, in this specific instance, due to a misunderstanding by a supply teacher, the child had the same lunch as every other pupil that day - a baguette, drink and a dessert. 'We have apologised to the parent and the child for any upset and confusion caused and taken steps to make sure the system for payment is communicated consistently in future.'","Lesley Slater tried to pay for Callum's school lunches for forthcoming week .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Tremayne Gaskell, 46, from Leeds, has been jailed for life for raping the pensioner and robbing her jewellery after meeting at a pub in the city . A sexual predator who tied up and raped a pensioner in her own home while threatening her at knifepoint has been jailed for life. Tremayne Gaskell, from Leeds, already had an 'atrocious' criminal record for violence against women when he targeted the 68-year-old at a pub in Leeds in February this year. The 46-year-old, who was described in court as 'dangerous', then went back to the woman's home where he locked the door, tied her up with tape and stole her jewellery. He then subjected her to horrific sex attacks in an ordeal which did not end until the next morning. At the time of the brutal attack, Gaskell was out of jail on licence after being locked up in September 2012 for stabbing another woman in the face and neck. In a victim impact statement, the woman said she had been so disturbed by the incident that she had moved out of her home and left behind most of her belongings 'that this man had touched'. Gaskell has now been jailed for life after a jury at Leeds Crown Court found him guilty of two offences of rape and one of robbery. The jury of nine women and three men rejected his claims during the trial that his victim had consented to sex. Gaskell, who was arrested two days after . the attack, was told he must serve a minimum of nine years in prison . before he can apply to the parole board for release. Judge James Spencer told him: 'It was cruel. It was nasty, and it shows you for what you are. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. Dangerous in the sense that if you are at large you are ever likely to commit offences of this kind and commit serious physical harm to another human being.' The court heard Gaskell armed himself with the knife before targeting the 'trusting and vulnerable' victim when they met during a night out. Prosecutors also told the jury how the defendant had a long criminal history of serious . violent offences. One attack involved a woman suffering an eye injury . when she was struck in the face with a pistol, while the attack for which he was on licence had led to a three-and-a-half year prison sentence. The court also heard that Gaskell had spent almost every day of his life in prison since 2002. The victim said: 'Since this man did this to me I haven’t been right. Leeds Crown Court heard that Gaskell was out of jail on licence for stabbing another woman in the face and neck when the brutal attack took place . 'I get upset and I end up crying and I can’t sleep at night and I’ve had to stay at my sister’s because I just can’t settle on my own at home. 'I can’t even say what it is that makes me cry but the things this man did to me ran through my mind and I am really frightened. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. If you are at large... you are ever likely to commit serious physical harm to another human being' Judge James Spencer . 'After the incident I didn’t go back into my house, which had been my home for five years. I was too scared. I am frightened of him coming back because he said that if I told anyone he would come looking for me and would kill me. 'It is because of this I have given up my home and moved out of the area. 'I did not even take anything out of the house other than my clothes, microwave and stereo as I couldn’t face having the same things in my new home that this man had touched because this would remind me every day about the horrible and nasty things this man had done to me.' Det Chief Inspector Mark Griffin, who heads Leeds District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'These offences clearly show that Gaskell is a sexual predator who presents a serious danger to women. 'We believe he cynically preyed on the vulnerable victim from the outset and had sinister intentions towards her all along. She was put through a prolonged ordeal which has understandably had a lasting traumatic effect on her. 'Police enquiries quickly identified Gaskell as the suspect for these offences and he was traced to the city centre and arrested the next day after being recognised by officers patrolling the area. 'A full and thorough investigation by specialist safeguarding officers has seen him brought to justice and we hope the fact he has now had to answer for his crimes will provide some source of comfort to the victim.'","Tremayne Gaskell, 46, 'preyed on victim' when they met at a pub in Leeds .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Harry Smith, 18, from Tangmere, West Sussex, had held his licence for about seven weeks when he crashed into a car, killing a 16-year-old and paralysing another . A boy racer has been jailed for four years after causing a crash which killed a 16-year-old girl passenger and paralysed another. Harry Smith, 18, killed 16-year-old Jasmine Elkasmi, . from Bognor Regis, after losing control of his Vauxhall Corsa in September last year. Smith, from Tangmere, West Sussex, had passed his test just weeks earlier and had also received a warning from police about his driving hours before the crash. The court also heard that traces of alcohol and the main chemical found in cannabis were found in Smith's blood stream after the incident. The crash, which took place on the A285 at Halnaker, near Chichester, West Sussex, left a second 16-year-old passenger paralysed from the waist down. A third teenager needed surgery for facial and dental injuries. Smith, who had received two police warnings since passing his driving test seven weeks earlier, has now been jailed for four years. The maximum available sentence for causing death by dangerous driving, as set by Parliament, is 14 years. But offenders are entitled to a reduction of up to one third if they plead guilty. The guidelines for the sentence for the crime will also depend on the seriousness of the event. Smith pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Judge Christopher Parker QC also disqualified him from driving for four years and ordered him to take an extended re-test before ever holding a licence again. For determinate prison sentences, the law . states that the offender should normally serve half in prison and half . on licence in the community, meaning he could be released in two years. Judge Parker said: 'That death and those injuries are the unwarranted consequence . of your terrible foolishness in the face of not one, but two warnings.' The court heard that the incident unfolded when Smith overturned his Vauxhall Corsa at around 6.45am. Jasmine Elkasmi, 16, died from her injuries after Smith's Vauxhall Corsa crashed into her. Two other teenagers with whom she was travelling also sustained life-changing injuries . At the time, Smith had spent hours driving and was likely to be suffering from fatigue, the court heard. Traces of tetrahydrocannabinol, the main chemical in cannabis, was found in his blood, although the court heard it was not enough to conclude he was under the influence at the time of the crash. He also had a small amount of alcohol in his blood, but was still within the legal limit. Jasmine died of her injuries in hospital a short time after the crash. After the hearing, Sergeant Paul Wood, of the Arundel road policing unit, said: 'Smith was 17 at the time of the collision and he had only held his driving licence for about seven weeks. 'He had been stopped by police before the collision on a number of occasions due to the manner of his driving and he had been issued with a section 59 warning, which meant that if he had been stopped again, his vehicle would have been seized. 'A girl died as a result of his dangerous driving and two other girls were left with serious injuries, one of them life-changing.' None of the victims’ families wished to comment after the sentencing.","Harry Smith, 18, from Tangmere, had been warned twice about his driving .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This was the terrifying moment a boy racer lost control of his Ford Fiesta at an unauthorised 'car cruise' and ploughed into a crowd of spectators. Witnesses say the young driver was allegedly trying to impress spectators by pulling off a huge wheel spin at a B&Q car park in Plymouth, Devon, when he injured 17 people. Horrifying mobile phone footage shows the car suddenly shooting forward and veering off the makeshift drag strip. Scroll down for video . Spectators were injured after a Ford Fiesta which was taking . part in a 'car meet' in Plymouth, Devon, veered off the makeshift drag . and ploughed into a group of spectators, injuring 17 people . During the event, which was arranged through Facebook, drivers took turns to show off . their 'static techniques' where they rev their engines and spin their . wheels on the spot . Megan Whitlock, 16, was one of those injured and had to be rushed to hospital with cuts and bruises to her face. The teenager said she remembers crashing into the windscreen but cannot recall anything else about the accident. She said: 'We were watching all the cars and I remember feeling really dizzy, like I'd been hit by something and opening my eyes and loads of people crowding around me and leaning over me and taking pictures. 'I have got to go back and have my arm checked but it's just a case of waiting for it to heal - I think I'm pretty lucky really.' The incident took place on Saturday night when a huge crowd, including kids in prams, met up for an unauthorised cruise, or a 'car meet', which was organised via Facebook. Drivers took turns to show off their 'static techniques', where they rev their engines and spin their wheels on the spot to produce a huge cloud of smoke. Chief Inspector Ben Deer said the events were a legal gathering of car enthusiasts but the injuries had been a cause for concern . Organisers Plymouth Car Cruise said on Facebook: 'We wish all those involved last night a speedy recovery. 'The cruise is so people can see all the cars out there and not for people to try and act [like] idiots.' Chief Inspector Ben Deer, head of local policing in Plymouth, said: 'The events are a legal gathering of members of the public who are car enthusiasts. 'We have no concern with people viewing cars but clearly when injuries are caused that causes us concern. The damaged Ford Fiesta, which appears to have been customised, was stopped by police officers after the spectators were injured . Megan Whitlock, 16, was one of the spectators mowed to the ground after the car veered into the crowd during the event on Saturday . 'These have been going on for some time without an incident and so, as a result, policing has reduced on them because we haven't had an issue. 'Now, we will look at any future car cruises we have in the city and will police them appropriately to reduce this risk of injury.' B&Q said the gathering had taken place 'without the knowledge or consent' of the company or the landlord who owns the site and car park. Car cruising usually involves groups of people gathering in car parks to watch drivers speeding, driving in convoy, racing other vehicles and performing stunts. In many areas across the UK, injunctions have been imposed, making these gatherings illegal. A 19-year old man from east Cornwall man . was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving in connection with the incident and released on police . bail until September.","The unauthorised 'car meet' in Plymouth, Devon, was arranged via Facebook .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The Pakistani Foreign Affairs ministry has said that allegations of rape and child abduction made against two of its diplomats were made by their wives in a bid to help their asylum applications. Two unnamed foreign diplomats working at Pakistan's High Commission in Knightsbridge, west London, were respectively accused of rape and child abduction in an annual statement released this week by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The allegations - which the Pakistan . High Commission has labelled as 'sketchy' - were among 14 'serious . and significant' offences alleged to have been committed this year by diplomatic staff . based at embassies in Britain. Two diplomats based in Pakistan's embassy in London have respectively . been accused of rape and child abduction, but their home country claims the allegations were made by . their wives in a bid to stay in the UK . The FCO revealed it had asked Pakistan for the officials' diplomatic immunity - which stops embassy staff being prosecuted by their host nation - to be lifted. But the Pakistani Foreign Affairs . ministry has now said that allegations were only made against the diplomats by their spouses when matrimonial relations 'became tense'. Spokesman . Tasnim Aslam Khan said that, in the alleged rape case, the woman had made the allegation when she wanted to settle permanently in Britain but her husband refused. According to the Independent, in a weekly press briefing she said: 'Matrimonial . relations between the couple became tense as she wanted to settle in the . UK permanently while her husband was not inclined. On his refusal, she levelled these charges.' According to Ms Khan, that same woman also alleged her husband had abducted their children. But Ms Khan said those claims arose when the woman was . unable to look after her older children - due to giving birth to another child prematurely - and they were returned to . family members without her permission. Ms Khan claimed a similar set of circumstances for the alleged child abduction case. She added: 'So, in both cases [the] allegations seem to be motivated by desire to seek asylum.' In a statement, the High Commission said: 'The cases have their roots in the long standing family disputes where a member of the family had complained against the spouse. 'The High Commission for Pakistan is contesting the veracity of these allegations with the FCO while taking full cognizance of its obligations under the Vienna Convention.' The allegations emerged after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, pictured, released its annual list of diplomats who had been accused of 'serious and significant' criminal offences . Earlier this week, Foreign Officer minister Mark Simmonds revealed the UK had asked for immunity to be lifted in five of the 14 'serious' cases. The FCO defines serious . offences as those which would carry a sentence of more than 12 months if . a conviction was secured. Under the Vienna Convention, . diplomatic staff are expected to obey the laws of their host nation but . are also granted immunity from prosecution. This can only be waived by . their own country. But if a country refuses to lift that immunity, the host nation cannot stop the accused from leaving. The FCO did not say whether its requests for immunity to be lifted in the Pakistani cases had been successful. Other offences in the list include claims of actual . bodily harm against a Cameroon and a Zambian diplomat and a sexual . assault alleged against a Zambian diplomat. There . were six drink-driving claims made - two against Saudi diplomats and . one each against officials from Belarus, Macedonia, Kuwait and Zambia. In at least one of the 14 cases, investigations by Scotland Yard are still ongoing. In a written statement to MPs, Mark Simmonds said: 'Some 21,500 people are entitled to diplomatic immunity in the United Kingdom and the majority of diplomats abide by UK law. 'The number of alleged serious crimes committed by members of the diplomatic community in the UK is proportionately low. 'Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. The FCO does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law. 'We take all allegations of illegal activity seriously. When instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police, we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate. 'For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat.' Amongst the other allegations was one count of driving a vehicle reported as lost or stolen and without insurance, against a Sierra Leone official. There was also one allegation of driving while under the influence of alcohol and without insurance, against a diplomat from El Salvador as well as one public order offence claimed against a diplomat from Kuwait.","Two officials working at embassy in London accused of 'serious' crimes .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Patrico Kochman, 20, died from brain injuries in April this year - 13 days after tripping over a pothole while he was drunk and cracking his skull . A drunk university student died from 'unsurvivable injuries' after tripping in a pothole and cracking his skull as he made his way home from a friend’s birthday party. Patrico Kochman, 20, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, was walking home alone after enjoying a night out with friends when the accident occurred in April this year. CCTV footage showed the Bradford University undergraduate, who was more than twice over the legal drink-drive limit, walking 'unsteadily' away from the club. He was later found lying unconscious in an pothole-ridden alleyway. Mr Kochman, known as Pato, fractured his skull and developed bleeding on the brain. Despite emergency surgery, he died 13 days later. At an inquest into his death, Mr Kochman's family was told the fall was 'a simple act with catastrophic consequences'. Giving a verdict of accidental death, assistant coroner Mary Burke said: 'He has fallen and we can never be . absolutely sure how. We know he was unsteady on his feet as shown on . CCTV. 'I think the most likely explanation is that he has stumbled, . fallen or tripped and struck his head - a simple act that sadly has had . catastrophic consequences that resulted in an un-survivable injuries.' After the hearing, his mother Sue Thompson took to Facebook to pay tribute to her son, saying her 'loyal' son had 'turned into the man we hoped he’d be'. The inquest heard that the accident took place after the young man had been to several pubs in Huddersfield to celebrate his friend Jay Simms's birthday. CCTV showed Mr Kochman, who had been drinking Jack Daniel's and coke all night, leaving the club and walking ‘unsteadily’ along the nearby road at 2.10am. Bradford Coroner's Court heard the young man would have been two-and-a-half times over the legal drink-driving limit, something which would have had an 'adverse effect' on his balance and judgement. After being found by a passing taxi driver, Mr Kochman - who wanted to be an architect and was studying a design course - was taken to Huddersfield Royal . Infirmary in West Yorkshire. He was later transferred to the Intensive Care . Unit at Leeds General Infirmary where medics discovered he had fractured his skull. He also sustained bleeding and bruising on the brain. Although a craniotomy was carried out to relieve pressure in his brain, Mr Kochman did not recover. During the inquest, Detective Constable . Shaun Topham, the investigating officer, said the entrance to the scrap . yard, where Mr Kochman was found, was 'filled with potholes'. He told the court: 'He could have easily . tripped. It was the entrance to a skip yard was filled with pot holes - . it was uneven and it wasn’t tarmacked. The Bradford University undergraduate . had been drinking Jack Daniel's and coke with his friends before walking . home alone. He was found unconscious with 'unsurvivable injuries' by a . passing taxi driver . 'We . were contacted by Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. Initially we weren’t . aware of what had happened to Pato. 'We were not sure of any criminality . at that point. I went to the scene and identified the CCTV footage and . also spoke to the people he was with during the previous evening. 'Pato . had everything with him - his wallet and mobile phone. A taxi driver . found Pato as he was driving along Wakefield Road. He said Pato was . breathing but unconscious. 'There . had been nobody with Pato at the time and the paramedics had not . thought anything was suspicious about the scene - it is standard . procedure for them to call the police if they think there is. There was . nothing to suggest an attack or anything untoward had taken place.' 'Loyal': His mother Sue Thompson said her son, pictured left and right, who wanted to be an architect, had 'turned into the man she hoped he would be' and that she would now live her life to make him 'proud' A toxicology report carried out by Richard Sykes of the West Yorkshire Analytical Services showed Mr Kochman would have had 200microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80mg. DC Topham added: 'Jay said they had met at his house and had some drinks before getting a taxi into town. 'When . they were dropped off in the town centre they visited various drinking . establishments, mainly drinking Jack Daniels and coke. 'They ended up in a night club in Huddersfield where they all separated and Pato went off on his own. 'Jay . said he was standing outside having a cigarette. He saw Pato come . outside and him trying to get back in. He said Pato looked intoxicated. They shared a cigarette and Jay went back inside.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Ms Burke said: 'Pato was seen on CCTV footage alone and walking in an unsteady manner away from Huddersfield town centre. 'He was then found by a taxi driver at the entrance of an alley way just off Wakefield Road. 'I think the most likely explanation is that he has stumbled, . fallen or tripped and struck his head - a simple act that sadly has had . catastrophic consequences that resulted in an unsurvivable injuries' Assistant coroner Mary Burke . 'He had been out with his friends celebrating his friend’s birthday party on April 16. 'The night had begun with some drinking at a friend’s house and the party had gone into Huddersfield and ended up in a night club. 'There they separated. Sometime in the early hours he was seen by one of his friends outside the club and the friend goes back in. 'CCTV footage shows Pato walking in an unsteady manner along Wakefield Road. He was found in an alley off that road by a taxi driver. 'An ambulance is called and they do not think anything suspicious happened. After tests at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary it is revealed that he has a fractured skull, brain bleed and bruising to the brain also - a very significant injury. 'He is transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where he undergoes surgery. His condition doesn’t improve and he is taken off full medication. Doctors told the family that he suffered an un-survivable injury. An inquest into the young man's death at Bradford Coroner's Court recorded a verdict of accidental death . 'My belated condolences go out to you and all the rest of his family who couldn’t be here today.' In her tribute, Ms Thompson wrote: 'If he was your friend you could not have anyone more loyal. 'Pne of the last conversations I had with him was over his concerns for one of his friends... We were plotting together as to how we could help him get his life back on track. It is nice for us to know that the boy we loved had turned into the man we hoped he’d be. 'Pato’s death was a tragic accident but from the moment I heard the news God was right by my side and has given me the strength that has carried me through thus far. I am not angry with God and I wouldn’t like you to be either. 'Pato’s Dad Robby, and I, both promised Pato before he died that we would try to live our lives to make him proud. Let’s hope all of us can live our lives less angry, more forgiving and more loving than we would have done if this had not happened.'","Patrico Kochman, known as Pato, from Holmfirth, was walking 'unsteadily'

A teenager beat up and raped a female friend at gunpoint in her own home because she did not reply to one of his texts. Daniel Plater, 19, also attempted to strangle his victim and set fire to her pyjamas in an apparent revenge attack for ignoring the message. Plater, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, had sent the message while the 18-year old victim was out celebrating on New Year's Eve with friends. When she did not see the text, Plater turned up at her home in Greater Manchester where he carried out the violent attack. Plater was jailed for ten-and-a-half years after pleading guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to rape, assault and possessing an imitation firearm. The court heard how Plater arrived at her home holding an air pistol gun saying: ‘I have a surprise for you’. He then hit her over the head with the weapon before threatening: 'You don’t know the kind of thing I am capable of. I do not feel like letting you live.' During the terrifying ordeal, the woman was forced to perform a sex act on Plater while he pointed the gun at her head, the court heard. He then tried to strangle her and set fire to the bottom of her pyjamas, before she was able to escape and phone the police for help. When police arrived, they immediately arrested Plater who was said to still be loitering outside the woman's home.

"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . The world watched in horror as images of once pristine beaches became coated in oil and thousands of species of birds struggled to survive in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. But upsetting images of the ‘worst environmental disaster the U.S. has faced’ provided one physicist with the inspiration to devise a faster and more thorough way of mopping up spilled oil. It took Arden Warner just hours to come up with a method of magnetising oil so that the environmentally damaging fluid could be collected using a magnet. Arden Warner came up with the idea for magnetising oil after seeing the wide-reaching effects of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (pictured in this satellite image). In his garage, he worked out the best size magnetic particles to mix with oil, in order to be able to move it using a magnet . Dr Warner, of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, saw the benefits of placing magnetic material in an oily solution instead of adding extra man-made chemicals to water. ‘Apply a magnetic field, and the particles will line up in the direction of the field. Orthogonally to that direction, the fluid becomes more rigid, and you can move or manipulate, it,’ he told PopSci. Taking to his garage, the physicist shaved iron off a shovel and mixed the filings with engine oil before trying to move the solution with a magnet. It worked, which led to hours experimenting with different fuels and size of filings. ‘When I started on it, I couldn't sleep for days,’ he said. Dr Warner discovered that magnetic dust measuring between two and six microns across worked well in over 100 different types of oil. Crude oil is naturally thick so that it does not flow easily but could be magnetised and cleaned up with a magnet. Tiny magnetic particles measuring between two and six microns could be placed in oil in the water. Their size would be calculated depending on how deep the oil has mixed in the sea. Magnetic oil could be collected and pulled from below the water's surface by using an electromagnetic boon. Once the oil is collected, the tiny magnetic particles would be separated from it so they could be re-used. The technique is more environmentally friendly than using more chemicals to break-down the oil. He worked out that the size of magnetic particles can be chosen depending on how deep they need to travel into the oily water in order to bond with it. Using this technique, he said: ‘You can pull oil from the bottom.’ This could be done on a large scale by using an electromagnetic boon. The magnetic dust could later be extracted from the oil and re-used, he explained. Dr Warner has used his technique to clean and oily bird and believes that one day it could help clean huge areas of coastline, like those polluted by the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. While the accelerator physics lab helped Dr Warner patent his process, he has now received interest from other parties that may want to commercialise it.","A physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Illinois, came up with the idea of using tiny magnetic particles to collect spilled oil .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Student members of the Melbourne University Liberal Club have been revealed to be behind a series of sexist and racist social media comments that have been branded disturbing by a senior lecturer. A number of screenshots of the Facebook messages, which were obtained by Fairfax Media, are said to have been made by the group's treasurer and vice president. Fairfax alleges that in a comment made in January, the group's vice president described a venue as 'worth a visit' before saying the bar had 'lots of sluts', adding: 'get some sluts for me' in another post. Student members of the Melbourne University Liberal Club have been revealed to be behind a series of sexist and racist social media comments that were obtained by Fairfax Media . According to Fairfax, the treasurer of the Liberal Club also sent derogatory posts, in which he allegedly said 'Just be careful of those mussrats. A lot of them are [a] bunch of Third World degenerate c***s.' when referring to Muslim people. Further comments from the same person describe academic and high-profile feminist Germaine Greer as a 'lying f***ing c*m guzzling slut … and a union member' adding: ''She doesn't believe in God. No kids not married … what do you [e]xpect from a melb uni educated former socialist c***,'. Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia 'It's distressing that any students would make these comments. This is disturbing.' Politician often attend events organised by political university clubs, according to Dr Rosewarne, in order to boost membership as well as their own profiles. 'New talent comes from them, so it is a breeding ground for new candidates,' she said. When asked if she believed the crude comments were damaging to the Liberal Party, Dr Rosewarne said there was some distance between the two groups despite them being heavily involved. The comments, which also obscenely target academic and high-profile feminist Germaine Greer, are claimed to have been made by the Clubs vice-president and secretary . Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, called the comments 'disturbing' and said the clubs are 'breeding grounds' for new party candidates . 'Because it's not a liberal party candidate or a member of parliament, the Liberal Party head office gets to put a distance between itself and the university club,' Dr Rosewarne said. 'Although it does have affiliations with the university club, it's unrealistic to expect them to be able to control what their party members – rather than their candidates - say or do, or even when students go rogue on social media. 'But they can disendorse the club.' She added: 'Even candidates themselves can't be controlled on social media – that's why they have media teams and press releases.' The comments come only a few days after the resignation of two Liberal Party candidates, Jack Lyons and Aaron Lane. Mr Lyons was revealed to have made dozens of racist and sexist posts on social media while Mr Lane was found to have repeatedly used homophobic language on his own social media pages. Daily Mail approached the Melbourne University Liberal Club's president for a comment but are yet to receive a response.","Fairfax obtained screenshots of Melbourne University Liberal Club members making sexist and racist comments on Facebook .

"By . Steph Cockroft . An angler has broken the record for the biggest fish ever caught off British shores - and it weighs more than a gorilla. The common skate fish, which was caught off the Isle of Skye, was so big that fisherman Daniel Bennett spent two hours struggling to reel it in. When he finally got back to shore, the 26-year-old from Whitby, North Yorkshire, discovered his catch weighed 208lbs - more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped. What a catch! Daniel Bennett, 26, caught this 208lb skate fish while fishing off the Isle . of Skye - the biggest fish to be caught off British shores . The fish, a rare protected species similar to a stingray, was so large . that the angler spent two hours reeling it in to shore, before tossing . it back into the sea . Mr Bennett, who returned the fish back into the sea, said: 'The key to catching the fish was having a lot of . patience. My back is absolutely killing me now though. 'We’ve never caught anything on that scale before, and we guessed it weighed about 150lb. But it was 208lbs. I can’t believe it.' The fisherman caught the skate - a rare protected fish species that looks similar to a stingray - after it latched onto half a mackerel . fillet that Mr Bennett had used as bait. Skates have a flat body and wing-like pectoral fins attached to their head, like a stingray. There are dozens of species of skates but the common skate is the largest skate species. A common skate can reach up to more than 8 ft (96 inches) in length and 220lbs - though most males grow to around 60 inches. Skates, . which have a life span of around 50 years, can live in most parts of . the world - whether tropical seas or near-Arctic waters. They are usually found in deep waters but can also survive in shallow waters. The common skate is listed as a critically-endangered species. It is threatened both in the Atlantic . Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Their eggs, so-called mermaid’s purses, are often found on beaches and are oblong and protected by leathery cases. The catch, which was 88.25 inches long by . 66.75 inches wide, has now been confirmed by the British Record Fish Committee as the largest fish caught on its current list. Although the fish was not weighed at the scene, because the anglers did not have scales, the weight was worked out by The Shark Trust - a UK conservation charity - based on the measurements of the fish. Before that, the largest fish caught from British shores was a 159lb skate, which was reeled in on the Isle of Lewis in 1994. Those anglers have since become 'local celebrities' on Skye - but Mr Bennett says his girlfriend, Philippa, is not quite as impressed. Mr Bennett, who works in a fishing . supplies shop, said: 'My partner is not really that interested, but . she’s proud of me nonetheless. 'I think people outside the angling world . find it harder to see how much of a feat this is. 'West Scotland is known for skate fishing but not Skye. We were the first to catch one there for at least 30 or 40 years. 'There . was another chap in our group who caught one and it was about 120lb. We . thought we’d never find one any bigger - then we did an hour later.' The fish, which was 88.25inches long and 66.75inches wide, weighs more than a female gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped and is the largest fish on record at the British Record Fish Committee . Nick Simmonds, secretary of the British Record Fish Committee, said: 'There is not a larger fish recorded as being caught on our current record list. 'Once we receive pictures from Dan we will pass them on to our scientist who will check the images and hopefully confirm the unofficial record. 'It can’t be confirmed as a record as it was not weighed at the scene. 'It will be seriously considered for the Notable Fish List, which was created for situations like this where the fish cannot be weighed. This list is historically important, at least in the angling world.' The fish weighs more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla . Here are some other things which weigh around the same amount as the skate fish caught by Mr Bennett. That fish weighed 208lbs. Fully-stocked fridge: 215lbs . Sir Steve Redgrave in his prime: 220lbs . Female Eastern Lowland gorilla: 200lbs . Vespa moped: 197lbs . Heavyweight boxer: over 200lbs .","Daniel Bennett, 26, from Whitby, North Yorkshire, caught fish off Isle of Skye .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . and Miles Goslett . The wife of actor Andrew Sachs condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to  Radio 2 for the first time since he left the BBC following Sachsgate scandal. Melody Sachs said it was a ‘slap in the face’ to give the disgraced presenter a job on the same station on which he insulted her husband six years ago. Ross has been hired to provide holiday cover for Steve Wright’s afternoon music and chat show at the end of the month. 'It's highly inappropriate and disgusting': Melody Sachs, pictured with her husband Andrew Sachs, condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to Radio 2 . He will be paid an estimated £4,000 to host four three-hour programmes between August 26 and 29. Last night Mrs Sachs, 79, said: ‘It’s highly inappropriate and I think it’s disgusting.’ In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the 84-year-old actor’s granddaughter and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross was suspended for 12 weeks, later moving to ITV. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom. Incident: Jonathan Ross (right) and Russell Brand are pictured insulting Mr Sachs on the BBC's Radio 2 show . Although Ross, 53, has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. Mrs Sachs added: ‘I’m so surprised that the BBC has welcomed him back. I’m amazed that they could do such a thing. It’s like a slap in the face for us, especially after Andrew spent so much of his working life with the BBC writing, acting and directing. It’s very sad and thoughtless and disrespectful.’ It is the first time since he left the BBC that Ross has been allowed back on Radio 2, although he has appeared on one-off TV. On Monday he appeared as a guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute. Criticism: Tory MP Philip Davies (left) has also criticised the decision to allow Ross (right) back on the airwaves . Last night Tory MP Philip Davies also criticised the decision to allow Ross back on the airwaves. He said: ‘My view is that what he did was completely and utterly unacceptable. He doesn’t appear to have accepted that, and until he does I don’t think the BBC should employ him.’ Ross was never fired from the BBC. Instead he chose to leave in 2010 after the corporation decided not to renew his £18million contract. He later claimed the scandal had made him a ‘better person’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster … [who] is returning for this one-off stint of holiday cover for Steve Wright. There are no plans to bring him  back permanently.’","Jonathan Ross left obscene messages on Andrew Sachs's answerphone .

"By . Richard Spillett . Fifi Geldof has hit out at critics of her sister Peaches in an expletive-filled online rant. Web users attacked Peaches yesterday after an inquest found she died of a heroin overdose with her baby son in the house. But her older sister Fifi hit back at those criticising her sibling, insisting: 'You've no idea what you're talking about'. Scroll down for video . Fifi Geldof (left) defended the memory of her sister Peaches (right) online yesterday after her younger sibling was criticised when details of her drugs overdose emerged at her inquest . An inquest heard that, in April this year, Peaches died of a heroin overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother Paula Yates 14 years ago. Peaches had been looking after their 11-month-old son Phaedra, who had been left alone for up to 17 hours when her husband, Thomas Cohen, returned home. As details of Peaches' death emerged, many went online to give their views, with some branding her irresponsible for taking drugs near her child. But Fifi, 31, lashed out at the critics on her Instagram page, where she wrote: 'Don't keep calm and f*** this. F*** that. F*** you. F*** off', the Sun reported this morning. She added: 'Sums it up nicely about how I'm feeling about the viciousness today. Maybe now she'll be allowed to RIP.' When another website user claimed her sister was 'selfish and sad' for using drugs, Fifi replied: 'You've no idea what you're talking about quite frankly. Yet another who has bought into the bulls***', the paper reported. An inquest heard Peaches' husband Thomas Cohen found her at home surrounded by drugs paraphernalia . The inquest into Peaches death heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home. Her husband returned from a weekend away to find her slumped dead on a bed, covered in needle puncture marks. A used syringe was in a sweet box next to her body and a pair of knotted tights had apparently been used as a tourniquet, the hearing in Gravesend, Kent, heard earlier this week. Peaches was also attacked on Mumsnet yesterday where one website user called her a 'toxic hypocrite' for potentially exposing her child to drugs. Controversial wannabe model Josie Cunningham also came under fire online yesterday after she claimed Peaches' drug addiction was 'pathetic' and 'a choice' On a thread which was later taken down, another person wrote: 'Seems like the reality was the exact opposite of how she portrayed herself.' Mumsnet later removed the discussion, writing: 'Message from MNHQ: We don't think this kind of discussion is really in the spirit of the site so we're zapping the thread.' Controversial wannabe model Josie Cunningham, who became famous for having a £4,800 breast enlargement op on the NHS, also attacked Peaches on Twitter, claiming her drug addiction was 'pathetic' and 'a choice'. But Cunningham, who once claimed she would abort her unborn baby so she could take part in a TV programme, came under fire from others. One website user asked her: 'Who are you to talk about a child's safety, you wanted to f*****g abort your unborn child, you utter cretin.'","Peaches criticised  after inquest revealed she died of drugs overdose .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . It seems that fans of the Great British Bake Off don’t just care about the cake – they’re sticklers for hygiene too. As the hit show returned to our screens this week, viewers took to Twitter to complain about the unruly hair of some contestants. An average audience of 7.2million watched on Wednesday night – a record for an opening episode of the show, and an increase of 600,000 on the first programme in last year’s series. Scroll down for video . Hairy baker: Iain Watters sports a thick beard which worried some users of microblogging site Twitter . Ready to bake: Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry are back for Great British Bake Off's fifth series . Can they stand the heat? This year's GBBO contestants include the show's youngest and oldest ever bakers . But many were perturbed by two unshaven competitors who were branded ‘unhygienic’. Construction engineer Iain Watters, 31, was criticised for his thick beard, while IT manager Jordan Cox, 33, was singled out for his long, wavy hair and stubble. Viewer Holly Archer tweeted: ‘Can’t stand these beards and unwashed hair on Bake Off. No. You can’t cook if you ain’t got your hygiene sorted. Get out.’ Adam Flanagan added: ‘Surely that Bake Off beard is against hygiene rules?’ Another fan, writing under the name Bhu, said: ‘Wish the British Bake Off would enforce to the correct hygiene rules in relation to hair, jewellery and clothing, there’s hair everywhere.’ And Romford Stu said: ‘Wish that bloke would shave that beard. It’s disgusting. Not to mention unhygienic for a cooking show.’ Martha Collison, 17, left, is the show's youngest baker, while Claire Goodwin, 31, right, was the first to go . Chef and hygiene expert Samuel Turner, who runs food safety consultancy Catersafe, said beards were ‘frowned upon’ in the industry. ‘Not only is there a greater risk of physical contamination from hairs that drop down into what you are preparing, beards also give off the wrong impression to those who are about to eat the food,’ he said. ‘They look untidy, and if you can’t maintain a tidy appearance you are unlikely to produce nice-looking food. Most restaurants or supermarkets insist their chefs are either clean shaven or wear a covering over their beards. ‘The Bake Off is sending out the wrong message by allowing its contestants to cook in that state.’ Not all viewers objected to the facial hair, however. Some said Mr Watters’ beard was ‘lovely’ and ‘formidable’, and he quickly built up a following of female fans. Many have hailed this series, the fifth, as the most diverse yet with the youngest-ever contestant, 17-year-old schoolgirl Martha, and the oldest, Diana, 69. Meanwhile fashion designer Chetna Makan, 35, is from India, and moved to the UK in 2003 and Enwezor Nzegwu, 39, was raised in North London but is half-Nigerian and half-Japanese. Luis Troyano, 42, was raised in Cheshire by Spanish parents. A viewer writing under the name Alice, tweeted: ‘I love the diversity on the Great British Bake Off. Goes to show that anyone can bake.’ Happy tweet: GBBO judge Paul Hollywood was told about the 7.9million viewers today - and tweeted his thanks . As Bake Off contestants struggled to recreate Mary Berry’s cherry cake in the first technical challenge of the new series, viewers rushed to buy the same cake tin used on the show. In a remarkable sign of the impact of the popular TV cook, online retailer Amazon reported that sales of a similar tin, the Master Class non-stick round fluted cake pan, rose by 1,003 per cent as the show was being broadcast. Budding bakers also ordered 54 per cent more hand and stand mixers during the hour-long show compared to the same time last week. And sales of general bakeware, such as sieves and spatulas, rose by 43 per cent on the week before. 'Have we bitten off more than we can choux?'  Hilarious BBC Twitter exchange . The night before the show launched, GBBO fans who had one eye on Twitter enjoyed a jokey exchange between the Twitter accounts for BBC2, the show's former home, and BBC1. First the @BBCTwo account tweeted: 'Goodbye, Great British Bake Off.  Have a great time on @BBCOne.  Never forget where you came from.' Tweet that started it: First the @BBCTwo account tweeted this message the night before GBBO started . To which the @BBCOne account replied: 'Bless you, Two.  We hope we haven't bitten off more than we can choux.' BBC2 shot back with: 'It's OK, One.  You're bready for this.' And a steady stream of baking-related puns ensued.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Supports bill: 68-year-old actress Jane Asher . She has worked tirelessly to raise money for those with terminal illnesses. But when it comes to her own life, Jane Asher has revealed she would have no hesitation visiting euthanasia clinic Dignitas if she ever found herself suffering from an ‘unbearable’ and incurable condition. The actress, 68, has backed plans to legalise assisted suicide in the UK and said ‘anyone with a humane bone in their body’ should also support mercy killings. Her intervention comes as peers prepare to scrutinise the Assisted Dying Bill, promoted by for-mer labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, in a House of Lords committee. Miss Asher told the Daily Mail: ‘It is so difficult, but if I had to come down one side or another I’d say yes, that particular law should go through. I know all the problems of course. It doesn’t seem to have had the problems overseas that the worriers keep raising. ‘Personally, yes, my God, of course. It is hard to imagine anyone with a humane bone in their body wouldn’t want to stop terrible suffering.’ She added: ‘I think the general public are changing their mind. A lot of these high profile cases have confronted people with what suffering is. I would absolutely take myself off to Dignitas if I thought I was going to be in unbearable pain, definitely.’ It is the first time Miss Asher, who starred opposite Sir Michael Caine in the hit 1966 film Alfie and famously dated Sir Paul McCartney, has publicly stated her views on assisted suicide. She and the former Beatle once studied with Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of transcendental meditation, but she now says she is not religious ‘in any way whatsoever’. The actress, who has three children with her husband, illustrator Gerald Scarfe, 78, used to be a member of the British Humanist Society, which also supports euthanasia. But she says she left the organisation long ago, adding: ‘I think a rationalist is a better description of me. I believe in scientific values foremost. I’m not religious, not at all.’ Miss Asher is currently supporting Macmillan Cancer Support in collaboration with supermarket chain Poundland. She has endorsed a new bakeware range for Poundland and is supporting its efforts to raise funds for the charity, which provides nurses and support to cancer sufferers. She is also president of the National Autistic Society and of Parkinson’s UK, which she joined after learning that her brother-in-law Gordon suffers from the degenerative condition. The star – who as well as being an actress is an accomplished baker with more than a dozen cookery books to her name – insisted she does not deserve special credit for her charitable ef-forts, but said she is glad to help good causes where she can. 'No hesitation': Jane Asher said she would have no issue visiting euthanasia clinic Dignitas in Zurich, Switzerland (above), if she ever found herself suffering from an ‘unbearable’ and incurable condition . She said: ‘If you’ve got any sort of name obviously you get asked to do lots of stuff. And while you’re still able to it’s nice to do something good, if it helps raise money.’ Miss Asher admitted she was less sure about linking her name to Poundland at first, because of its reputation for cheap goods, but said she changed her mind. She said: ‘When they first approached me, my reaction was “Oh, I’m not sure about this at all.” I thought it would be cheap stuff which I didn’t like and I didn’t think they could ever make a range which I would genuinely buy and use. ‘But I was surprised by how good the products are. I use them in my own kitchen, especially the non-stick tins. I know that I’m deemed to be upmarket because of my accent and the roles I’ve played, which makes my connection to Poundland surprising and also very clever.’ She added: ‘My accent has changed over the years. Not consciously. I haven’t done a reverse Margaret Thatcher. But when I listen to recordings of myself as a child I sounded very smart in-deed. I sounded like a prim Victorian young girl. I have never felt typecast because of my accent though.’ In 2010, the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu spoke out against celebrity-backed cam-paigns to legalise euthanasia, saying: ‘I would rather listen to the voices of disabled people than to the voices of celebrities or the voices of 1,000 people in an opinion poll.’ But despite warnings that it could lead to widespread killing of the sick, the momentum to change the law has increased in recent years. Last month, West End composer Andrew Lloyd-Webber revealed he recently considered using Dignitas after suffering a deep bout of depression triggered by the pain from a series of opera-tions, but changed his mind and now feels it would have been a ‘stupid and ridiculous thing to do’. TV presenting couple Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan also recently revealed they had made a ‘pledge’ to help each other die if they were suffering from an incurable disease. Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in the UK, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison, although guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges.","Actress, 68, said she wouldn't think twice about visiting Switzerland clinic .

"By . Dan Bloom . Peaches Geldof's widower Thomas Cohen has not returned to the country home they shared because he was left so traumatised by her death, it has been reported. The inquest into her death this week heard how Mr Cohen, 24, found his wife slumped dead on a bed with puncture marks and almost 80 syringes were scattered in their home. She . had been looking after their baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for . up to 17 hours. Scroll down for video . Tragic death: Thomas Cohen (right), who married Peaches Geldof in 2012, has not returned to the country home they shared in Kent because he was left so traumatised by her death, it has been reported . Investigation: Police at the couple's £1million home in Wrotham, Kent, after she was found dead in April . An unnamed neighbour of the £1million home in Wrotham, Kent, told the Daily Mirror it had been mostly empty since her body was found on April 7 and Mr Cohen planned to sell it. 'Thomas hasn't been back to the house for a long time,' the neighbour said. 'Whenever he needs something, he gets his mum to pick it up. 'He is haunted by what has happened and is constantly reminded of Peaches and the happy times they shared, as well as the moment he found her.' Mr Cohen gave evidence on Wednesday at the inquest into 25-year-old Peaches' death. North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the television . presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off . drugs and was clean five months before she died. Inquest: Mr Cohen told the hearing this week in Gravesend, Kent, how he discovered his wife's body . The inquest heard Peaches had been clean five months before she died but then relapsed in February this year . Stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home when police investigated. Her husband had tried to contact her in vain the night before, and returned from a weekend away to find her body. A used syringe was in a sweet box next to her body and a pair of knotted tights had apparently been used as a tourniquet, the hearing in Gravesend, Kent, was told. Mr Cohen told the hearing she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft of their home. Supplies of heroin found in the house and tested by police were 61 per cent pure, the inquest heard, which meant they were of ‘importation quality’ and more than twice as pure as street-level product. Mr Cohen had been rehearsing on the . weekend of her death. He had dropped off their two sons – Astala, two, . and Phaedra, one – with his parents in south-east London, leaving his . wife of two years behind. Family tragedy: Peaches posted this photograph of her and her mother Paula Yates hours before her death . In love: The pair had married in September 2012 and had two children together . The following night, Miss Geldof had dinner in London, staying at a friend’s house in Hampstead. Phaedra was returned to her by Mr Cohen’s father Keith on the Saturday afternoon and she stayed in that evening watching TV. On the Sunday night, a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died of a heroin overdose at the age of 41 when her daughter was 11. Mr Cohen, who was the singer in the band S.C.U.M., paid tribute to his wife of 19 months after she died. He said: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts everyday. 'We shall love her forever.'","The 24-year-old found his wife after she died at home in Wrotham, Kent .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . He has presented Countryfile for 25 years. But to many, including Prime Minister David Cameron, John Craven will forever be remembered best for his children’s TV roles. Mr Craven first found fame in the early Seventies when he presented the BBC’s first children’s news programme John Craven’s Newsround. Icon: David Cameron told former Newsround presenter John Craven 'I grew up on you' when they met . He was with the show from its inception in 1972, even after it dropped his name until 1989. His subsequent ubiquity during the 70s and 80s on kids TV- also presenting items on other shows, such as Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and Saturday Superstore – appears to have left an indelible mark. The 73-year-old Yorkshireman was awarded the OBE in 2000 for services to rural and children’s broadcasting, and the Baird Medal in 2002. In 2011, he accepted a Children’s BAFTA award for Newsround. He revealed: ‘When I met David Cameron, he came straight up to me and said, ‘I grew up on you.’ I thought, Really? Am I that old?’ And it’s not just the PM, Mr Craven adds: ‘But I also remember being on a plane and a hostess approached me and said, ‘I’d just like to thank you for being part of my childhood.’ ” In 2009, Mr Craven’s former colleague Miriam O’Reilly, 57, was sacked from Countryfile when the show moved to Sunday evenings on BBC1. It re-launched with younger presenters Julia Bradbury, 43, and Matt Baker, 36. Miss O’Reilly later sued the BBC for age discrimination and was awarded a £150,000 payout. Veteran: Mr Craven (left) was an icon for children throughout the 1970s before he moved on to Countryfile . Asked whether she was right to sue the corporation, Mr Craven replied: ‘Yes, if she felt that she’d been badly treated then of course she was right to take them on.’ However, he insisted he was right not to get involved in the dispute himself, adding: ‘It got very unpleasant and for the team it was an unhappy time. ‘I didn’t get involved because I’m not management, I’m just a hired hand. When you’re in the front line as a presenter, the easiest thing for a new manager to do when they come in is get rid of you and bring in a new face and that’s always been the case. ‘I’m incredibly lucky because I’ve survived about 12 different series producers on Countryfile.’ Mr Craven, who lives in a small village in Oxfordshire, said he thinks of himself as a ‘country person’, but said: ‘I know I’ll never be fully accepted. But I like to think, as we try to prove on the show, that there’s room for everyone in the countryside.’ Praise: He praised the countryside show for its dedication to promoting rural affairs in a balanced way . Praising Countryfile for its balanced approach to reporting rural affairs, he added: ‘There was an idea that you weren’t a true country person unless you believed in hunting. I don’t believe that to be true. I think there are a lot of country people who don’t agree with hunting.’ In a wide-ranging interview with the Radio Times, Mr Craven also warns a  growing appetite for Western food in Asian countries could create a shortage in this country. The 73-year-old presenter said people in India and China increasingly like to eat the same foodstuffs as us, meaning we may find it hard to import what we need. And he urged the UK to produce more of its own food instead of buying it from abroad. He said: ‘Food security is incredibly important now. We produce about 60 per cent of our own food; we need to produce much more because the Asian countries, India and China especially, are wanting our kind of food now, particularly wheat and all the basics. ‘And whoever has the most money will get what they want.’","John Craven has been approached by Prime Minister praising his work .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . 'Shoo-in': Double Olympic gold medallist Lord Coe is the 'clear favourite' to become BBC Chairman, according to the corporation's economics editor . Olympics boss Sebastian Coe is a ‘virtual shoo-in’ to become the next chairman of the BBC, it was claimed yesterday. The former track star and head of the London 2012 Games is expected to replace Lord Patten, who stood down after heart surgery in May. Several candidates are currently being interviewed for the post, including the temporary chair Diane Coyle. But writing in his online blog, the BBC’s economics editor Robert Peston said he had learned from a ‘senior government source’ that Lord Coe was the clear favourite. He said: ‘Of course his appointment is not 100 per cent, because there is a formal and slightly cumbersome appointments process. ‘For the Government, which for this sort of thing really means the Prime Minister and Chancellor, Lord Coe is the outstanding candidate. So presumably they will find a way to get him over these many hurdles.’ Some speculated yesterday that Peston’s source was the Chancellor George Osborne. Peston is currently shadowing Osborne’s official trade mission to India, and the Chancellor is known to be a close friend of Lord Coe’s. Lord Coe’s appointment would be popular with Tory MPs. Unlike Lord Patten – who is now advising the Pope on media relations – he is seen as a ‘true Conservative’, and he served as a Tory MP for five years. The double Olympic gold medallist has also worked with BBC director general Tony Hall, who sat on the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. Lord Coe was first rumoured to be in line for the BBC chairman role in May. At the time, London Mayor Boris Johnson appeared to inadvertently confirm the story when he said that he would be a ‘first-rate choice’. Lord Coe has not confirmed or denied the reports, although he has said he would be ‘very flattered’ to be considered a contender. Yesterday, another contender for the £110,000 job – former Ofcom head Colette Bowe – ruled herself out of contention for the post, saying she felt the current BBC structure was ‘hopelessly confused.’ She said: ‘I think that hopeless confusion has served the BBC and the licence fee payers very ill, despite the enormous efforts of good people to try and make it work. There is no desire or inclination among the powers that be to change the system. I haven’t applied, I don’t intend to apply.’ Endorsement: In his blog, Robert Peston (left) said the former track star is the frontrunner to replace Lord Patten (right) who stepped down in May following heart surgery . Dame Colette also called for the BBC to scrap the licence fee and replace it with a subscription model. She said: I have to say it seems to be a no brainer moment to look at conditional access funding. Why not? Why wouldn’t they do it? I haven’t seen a single argument that persuaded me that some kind of conditional access wouldn’t be a good thing.’ Her comments were echoed by Channel 4 chairman Lord Burns, who also said he did not want the BBC chairman post. He said: ‘Can you really imagine in 30 years’ time there will be a licence fee? In the long term you have to get to a position where people who don’t pay can’t watch it. That is subscription. The BBC would be a not for profit company, it would still have a charter, it would still have various privileges, but it would have to persuade people to pay for it.’","Double Olympic gold medallist is expected to replace Lord Patten .

All smiles: The spa, which is preparing for its 90th birthday next year, was founded by South African Stanley Lief in 1925 and claims to be the top choice for those wanting to relax in jacuzzi bubbles . An ITV documentary crew was granted access to the flagship resort in Tring, Hertfordshire, where clients have included Barbra Streisand, Victoria Beckham and Tony and Cherie Blair. But instead of being met with a five star experience, the cameramen found unhappy guests, managerial chaos and a string of complaints about everything from filthy rooms to unappealing food, peeling plaster and bad service. In an effort to stem the flood of complaints, the Champneys management hired someone to book in as a mystery guest and give constructive feedback. But in a devastating report read out before the cameras, the shopper said the room had not been serviced since the last guests left and so was strewn with dirty towels and overflowing bins. Over four months, the ITV crew filmed Champneys’ struggle to renovate its rooms and improve its service. The spa, which is preparing for its 90th birthday next year, was founded by South African Stanley Lief in 1925. An ITV crew filmed at the flagship resort in Tring, Hertfordshire (above), where clients have included Barbra Streisand and Victoria Beckham, for four months and found several unhappy customers . Spa Manager Lucy Ayles and her team of beauty therapists feature in the ITV documentary, which is set to be aired next Thursday and gives an insight into life at the resort . The spa, which is preparing for its 90th birthday next year, was founded by South African Stanley Lief in 1925 . The renovation was almost derailed when the deputy housekeeper and the chief receptionist both quit. Asked to rate the hotel out of ten, operations manager Lee Jones said: ‘I think realistically we are at a six at the moment.’ Champneys’ millionaire owner Stephen Purdew admitted it had been a ‘risk’ to allow the cameras in, but insisted the documentary would ‘create a buzz about the place’. Mr Purdew told the Mail that he had a ‘reinvigorated approach’ and was still working hard to improve the spa, adding: ‘When you do a refurbishment you get complaints.’ Champneys will be screened next Thursday at 9pm on ITV.","ITV crew spent four months filming at flagship resort in Tring, Hertfordshire .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . With their laidback style and down-to-earth tastes, they are the epitome of the modern royal couple.And it seems Zara and Mike Tindall have a modern weakness for the latest gadgetry to match. The Queen’s granddaughter and her rugby-playing husband are addicted to buying hi-tech TVs, phones and sound systems, he has revealed. And in a further break from tradition, the former England rugby captain said he always carries £100 in his wallet ‘just in case’ – unlike the senior Royals, who famously never carry cash. Mr and Mrs M Tindall: He's a rugby player and she's the Queen's granddaughter and they have royal tastes in gadgetry . Tindall, 35, married 33-year-old Phillips – who is 15th in line for the throne – in 2011. Their daughter, Mia, was born six months ago. In a detailed interview about his finances, Tindall told The Sunday Times that his biggest money weakness was for buying gadgets. He said: ‘I like TVs, sound systems, and a nice cinema room where it’s all wired in properly. We always upgrade quickly with tablets and smartphones.’ Tindall said that he only recently got a credit card because he likes to spend money which is in his account. He added: ‘I am very conscious about money, spending only what I have. That was always the way when I started professional rugby. Inspector Gadget: Mike Tindall confesses that he is addicted to the latest smartphones and tablets . ‘Then again, if I know the money is there, I like to enjoy myself.’ Shortly after his wedding, Tindall was spotted kissing a blonde woman on a night out during the rugby world cup in New Zealand. He later claimed she was just an ‘old friend’ and Phillips stood by her husband. Last year, the pair sold their home in Cheltenham for £1.25million and moved in to a house on the Gatcombe Park estate, owned by her mother the Princess Royal. Tindall, who earns a ‘six-figure’ sum as a player and coach at Gloucester rugby club and from celebrity endorsements, said he also has flats in Bath and Dubai which he lets out. But he said his best investment was the racehorse Monbeg Dude, which came seventh in this year’s Grand National. After buying it for £12,000 in 2010 with two friends at a charity auction, he admitted he never meant to win the bid. But he revealed: ‘He’s won £120,000 in prize money since. If we sold him he’d probably be worth at least £200,000. Not bad. He was an accidental purchase, but he’s done all right for us.’ He revealed his worst investment was when he started a Poker gambling company in 2004, which lost £20,000. Asked to name his financial priority, Tindall said: ‘Family, making sure we’re all right for the future. We’ve just had Mia, so school fees come into it, college, a wedding. ‘If you can keep filling Isas each year with a high-risk investments returning 10 per cent or 15 per cent, you should receive a nice pot of cash.’","Tindall always carries £100 in cash with him 'just in case' - unlike his in-laws .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Question marks were raised over the future of the BBC licence fee yesterday as it emerged growing numbers of young people are using free catch-up services instead of watching live television. Figures revealed viewers aged between 16 and 24 now spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast. The rest of the time they use free catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer, as well as DVDs, recorded TV programmes or films and shows they have bought and downloaded via the internet. Scroll down for video . Fears are growing that 16 to 24-year-olds are watching TV mostly on iPlayer and dodging the annual licence fee . The trend has sparked fears that younger viewers are deliberately dodging the £145.50 annual charge, which only applies to those who watch or record live TV and does not cover iPlayer. The BBC is coming under intense pressure to close the loophole which allows catch-up shows to be watched free of charge, amid concerns older viewers are effectively being penalised for watching on traditional TV sets rather than tablets, smartphones and laptops. The vast majority of older viewers still watch their favourite shows as they are broadcast, meaning they are obliged to pay the licence fee. According to figures published yesterday by Ofcom, just three per cent of the viewing of those aged between 55 and 64 is on catch-up platforms such as iPlayer, while 80 per cent is live. On average, adults spent an average of two hours 58 minutes a day watching live television. Catch-up services are much more popular with the young, accounting for seven per cent of their viewing time. Just three per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds said they would miss watching live TV, compared to 31 per cent of those aged over 65. In recent years the BBC has encouraged growing numbers of viewers to watch its TV shows on iPlayer but has yet to close the loophole that makes catch-up viewing free of charge. BBC iPlayer attracted 234million hits in February this year, which was a 21 per cent increase in just 12 months . And earlier this year, the corporation’s director-general Tony Hall announced plans to close youth channel BBC3 and put all of its content on iPlayer. The catch-up platform attracted 234million hits in February this year, a 21 per cent increase in a year. Although Lord Hall has said he wants to close the iPlayer loophole and extend the licence fee to catch-up TV, insiders claim such a change would be hard to enforce. As the BBC currently has no way of checking who watches iPlayer, it would have to issue every genuine licence fee payer with a code before they can access the website. In June, the Daily Mail revealed two million households have told the BBC they do not need a TV licence because they do not have TV sets and do not watch live programmes. The number of people who have legally opted out of the charge has risen by almost 40,000 in the past two years, prompting claims the corporation is struggling to adapt to the internet age. A BBC spokesman said: ‘As the data shows young people still spend two thirds of their viewing time watching live or recorded TV which needs to be covered by a TV Licence. Well under two per cent of households watch only catch-up TV.’ UK adults spend more time in front of screens or on the phone than they do sleeping. We spend an average of eight hours and 41 minutes every day on our phones or computers, compared with eight hours and 21 minutes asleep. The figure rises to nine hours and eight minutes among those aged 16 to 24, Ofcom said. And when multi-tasking is taken into account – such as using Twitter while watching TV – we spend an average of 11 hours a day using new technology, an increase of two hours since 2010. However, the research also showed that the time spent watching TV has fallen. Last year we spent an average of three hours and 52 minutes a day in front of our television sets. In 2012 the average was four hours and one minute. It was the first time since 2009 that TV viewing has fallen below four hours a day.","Fears growing that younger viewers are dodging licence fee by going online .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC is too secretive and has stopped official investigators from probing its huge pay deals and IT fiascos, the head of the Government spending watchdog said yesterday. The National Audit Office (NAO) blamed BBC ‘gatekeepers’ for stopping it from viewing key documents about financial scandals, delaying one crucial report by eight months. The watchdog’s director, Sir Amyas Morse, called for statutory powers to force BBC bosses to hand over evidence about how it uses its annual £3.5billion licence fee revenue. The National Audit Office (NAO) blamed BBC 'gatekeepers' for stopping it from viewing key documents about financial scandals, delaying one crucial report by eight months. Pictured is BBC Media City . He said it can be so hard to extract information from the corporation that he has trouble keeping his staff’s morale up. Giving evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, he said: ‘It is possible, particularly in difficult areas, to find the BBC doesn’t provide evidence where in their judgment it is covered by commercial or confidentiality grounds, or indeed privacy grounds. ‘There are an excessive number of gatekeepers in the organisation who feel they can apply their judgment rather than relying on our professionalism with regards to what we might see.’ The chair of the culture, media and sport committee, Tory MP John Whittingdale, agreed with his criticism: ‘There is a perception that the BBC is an enormously bloated, bureaucratic organisation, with more people carrying out a function than would be the case in any of the equivalent commercial broadcasters.’ The watchdog's director, Sir Amyas Morse, called for statutory powers to force BBC bosses to hand over evidence about how it uses its annual £3.5billion licence fee revenue . Last year, the NAO published two damning reports exposing BBC waste. The first found it blew £100million on a failed IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative. The second, which revealed that the corporation handed out £369million in severance pay-offs to its staff over eight years prompted parliamentary enquiries. But Sir Amyas revealed the Digital Media Initiative report was delayed by eight months because the BBC blocked access to key documents. And he said there are further delays because the BBC controls when his findings are published. He added: It can be difficult to keep motivation of my people going … when they have to wait a long time for information and it holds the report up.’ The NAO can probe the financial efficiency of all Government departments and agencies, as well as police and the NHS, and has legal powers to force them to reveal documents. However, the BBC only provides access ‘by agreement’, meaning it is able to block investigators. A BBC spokesman said: 'We welcome Sir Amyas' positive comments about the management and governance of the BBC, our work on reducing costs and targets we've achieved. 'We are committed to openness and transparency as the content of previous National Audit Office reports has shown and we have a good working relationship with the NAO which already has full access to the BBC's operations, with the exception of editorial areas, as protecting the BBC’s editorial independence is paramount.'","National Audit Office (NAO) blamed BBC ‘gatekeepers’ for stopping it from viewing key documents about financial scandals .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . What a knock-out: Gia Milinovich, with husband Professor Brian Cox, punched an intruder so hard he ran away . Professor Brian Cox may be renowned for solving problems with his mind. His wife, it seems, prefers to use her fists. The spouse of the sky-gazing TV  physicist has revealed she fought off a burglar who broke into their house at night – and left him seeing stars. In a dramatic showdown, Gia Milinovich used skills she learned in boxing self-defence lessons to punch the intruder so hard in the face he ran away. The 44-year-old American gave him a right hook fearing she was in a ‘life or death’  situation with someone who may have been armed or might rape her. Police officers who rushed to the scene later congratulated her on her bravery. They caught the man using CCTV cameras and he was later jailed for eight weeks. Miss Milinovich, who married pop star turned TV scientist Cox in 2003 and has a five-year-old son with him, said her husband was away for the night on May 22 when she heard someone walking about the house. Describing the frightening encounter in her blog, she said she initially thought the noise was caused by Moki, her 17-year-old son from a previous relationship, coming home late. She said: ‘At just after five, I heard one of our cats jump down from my little son’s bed in his room right next to mine. 'My son happened to be in bed with me as Brian was away for the night. ‘Less than a minute later I heard footsteps in his room. Shoes on the wooden floor. My teenage son was either sneaking in or trying to sneak someone out that he’d snuck in the night before. ‘He’d never done anything like this before, but I was livid. ‘I got up and went to shout at him. I walked out of my room, turned right, looked into my little son’s room and there was a strange man standing there.’ Miss Milinovich said she has taken boxing lessons for the past three years, which had taught her to approach self-defence with a ‘kill or be killed attitude’. So rather than run away or wait to see if the intruder would attack her, she immediately rushed at him. 'After dishing out a right hook, she added: ‘He made a “well, that really wasn’t very nice at all” sound, pushed past me, ran down the stairs with me chasing after him continuing to shout and out the front door of the house.’ Seeing stars: Ms Milinovich's husband, TV scientist Brian Cox, also has regular boxing lessons to keep fit . Police tracked the burglar after studying CCTV footage  and later found his fingerprints at the house. He admitted the offence in court and Miss Milinovich  found out on Friday that he had been jailed. Miss Milinovich said she would ‘probably’ take the same action again but would not recommend other women punch intruders unless they have taken self-defence classes. She added: ‘Apparently, I was the talk of the police station for a few days after the burglary. The police officer who was dealing with my case said that he had never had another case where someone punched a burglar. ‘All of the officers I spoke to asked, “Are you the one who punched him? Well done!” ‘They said they wished more people were like me and had some kind of self-defence training in order to know how to handle themselves in these unusual situations.’ Earlier this year Cox, 46, was seen training with boxing gloves and pads in a park near the couple’s home in south London. He and Miss Milinovich, who presented Demolition Day on Channel 4, met while he was working on an internet TV channel. Cox first found fame as the keyboard player of pop group D:Ream, best known for their hit Things Can Only Get Better. After the band split in 1997, he completed a Phd in particle physics and went on to work at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva and present a series of hit BBC science shows.","Gia Milinovich punched a burglar who broke into their London house .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC licence fee is ‘too high’ and should be decriminalised, its former chairman has admitted. Michael Grade, who left the corporation in 2006 to lead ITV, said he feels ‘squeamish’ about the fact viewers can be sent to prison for not paying the £145.50 charge. And although he said he supports the principle of charging all households to watch live TV, he called for it to be reduced when it is comes up for renewal in 2016. Former BBC chairman Michael Grade believes non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised . Lord Grade told a Royal Television Society debate: ‘I support the licence fee, but I think it is too high. That is a whole other debate, but nevertheless I fully support the licence fee for the next charter period.’ He added: ‘I think the big debate is going to be about the issues of criminality, compulsion and so on. I think we all feel a bit squeamish about the fact you can go to prison if you don’t pay the fine for not paying the licence fee. ‘If there is a way to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, that would be a good thing.’ Lord Grade first joined the BBC as controller of BBC1 in 1984, and became its director of pro-gramming in 1986. During his time in charge of TV output, he courted controversy by cancelling production of Doctor Who, which he branded ‘awful’ and ‘outdated’. Lord Grade said the BBC must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay the licence fee, otherwise it would open the doors to pre-determined programming . After a stint at Channel 4, he became BBC Chairman for two years and now sits as a Conservative peer in the House of Lords. Although he called for licence fee evasion to be decriminalised, Lord Grade said the BBC must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay. He said: ‘You have to retain compulsion, otherwise you are opening the way for subscription. Subscription means pre-determined, well-known programming that will be guaranteed to drive subscription. You won’t get Happy Valley. You will be getting whatever they can pick up in the free-market in competition with Sky.’ The Government is currently conducting a year-long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee . Lord Grade added: ‘If you were inventing the United Kingdom today I think there are three institutions you wouldn’t create in a modern world. I don’t think you would create a hereditary monarchy, I don’t think you would create an unelected second chamber, and I don’t think you would create an organisation like the BBC and organise for it to have £4billion of public funding in an age of media plenty, expansion and so on. ‘But you have to believe that there is something in these three institutions that connects with the British public, and the BBC is one of those institutions that relies for its existence not on political whim, not on political dogma, but on the affection and support of the British public. ‘It faces an incredibly difficult few years coming up, not least with the whole argument about how it should be funded.’ The Government is currently conducting a year-long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee. It followed a campaign by backbench MPs to scrap the threat of prison sentences for fee evaders. In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates court cases. Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines.","The Government is reviewing whether to decriminalise the licence fee .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . From deadly flu viruses to a car crash, some of its lead characters have met grisly ends. So Downton Abbey’s cast must have been relieved to learn they will all survive the next series. After viewers complained about the ITV drama’s high body count, scriptwriter Julian Fellowes decided not to kill off any major characters in the fifth series, which begins this autumn. Downton Abbey scriptwriter Julian Fellowes has decided not to kill off any of the major characters, in the next series . Actress Lesley Nicol, 61, who stars as Mrs Patmore the cook, said there had been a particularly ‘big fuss’ about the death in a car crash of Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, in the 2012 Christmas special. She added: ‘There aren’t any plans for any big characters to die this year. ‘I think it would be very unwise to do any more deaths because the viewers don’t like them.’ In 2012, some viewers complained Downton had ruined their Christmas after Mr Crawley, played by Dan Stevens – was killed in a shock car crash. In the next series heiress Lady Sybil - played by Jessica Brown-Findlay – passed away in a fit of convulsions during childbirth as her family wept by her bedside. Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs Patmore the cook, left, said it would be 'unwise' to do any more deaths as viewers don't like them . Previous episodes have seen young fiancée Lavinia Swire succumb to a deadly flu virus, footman William Mason die in the Battle of the Somme, valet Mr Green die in mysterious circumstances on a London street and Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk suffer a fatal heart attack. Another shocking plotline, showing the rape of ladies maid Anna Bates last year, prompted more than 400 complaints and was criticised by rape campaigners. But Miss Nicol has reassured fans that even its oldest character, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by 79-year-old Maggie Smith, will survive the fifth series. She said: Dame Maggie is in it a lot this year. Don’t worry, she’s in it plenty.’ Filming on the next series is expected to finish in August before it screens in the autumn. However, Miss Nicol warned the series will not continue forever. Miss Nicol has reassured fans that even its oldest character, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by 79-year-old Maggie Smith, pictured, will survive the fifth series . She said: ‘I don’t know how long it will last. I know it won’t go on years and years. Julian wants to do other things and he will also want to go out on a high, as we all do.’ Series producer Liz Trubridge has said she is ‘very conscious’ of the effect the slew of deaths has had on viewers but insisted Mr Crawley’s untimely end was unavoidable as Mr Stevens wanted to leave the show. Lord Fellowes joked he even needed to be protected against furious fans after the traumatic episode. He said: ‘I was afraid to go out without bodyguards. 'I was very interested by that. People don’t understand that we’re not in control of that kind of stuff, if an actor wants to leave the show. We did get an absolute barrage of criticism for that. ‘It’s calmed down a bit now, actually, but I don’t know. What I’m always rather touched by is the way these people become real to the audience.’","Viewers had complained about the ITV drama's high body count .

Through ticket prices and a charity auction, the annual ball has raised more than £50million for Sir Elton's Aid Foundation . Thanks to tickets costing up to £10,000 and a competitive charity auction, the ball has raised more than £50million for his Aids Foundation. But some have claimed the event has begun to lose its appeal in recent years, attracting only minor celebrities such as Peter Andre and Kerry Katona. In 2010 -  when it had a Gaga in Wonderland theme in tribute to the American singer Lady Gaga -  there were reports that 450 guests had bought their invitations through ticketing agencies. A year later, Sir Elton was forced to sue one of his guests after he . allegedly failed to pay the £700,000 he bid at the charity auction in . return for a day out with the singer and his husband David Furnish. The dispute was later resolved. And in 2012, the ball reached new lows when Dame Shirley Bassey reportedly complained that the toilets were blocked, with guests comparing the ball to the muddy Glastonbury music festival. A source told the Daily Mail: ‘While Elton and the team put in a huge amount of work and enjoyed it, they realised there are other ways to raise funds and they wanted to stop before it became a joke.’ Hollywood glamour: Sir Elton and husband David Furnish with Naomi Watts at the 2012 White Tie and Tiara Ball.

A year after these quadruplets were born at odds of 70million-to-one, their exhausted mother has revealed exactly what goes into caring for four babies – including 18 hours of feeding, five loads of washing and countless nappy changes every single day. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Sharon and Julian Turner with their one-year-old quads (from left) James, Joshua, Lauren and Emily, who were born at odds of 70million-to-one . They've got their hands full: Sharon holds her boys and Julian holds his girls in their back garden in Hungerford, Berkshire . Happy family: It took Sharon and Julian four rounds of IVF, tens of thousands of pounds and years of anguish to bring their bundles of joy into the world . Sharon Turner, 38, told the Mail that becoming a mother of four in one fell swoop was a ‘wonderful, uplifting experience’, but conceded: ‘It has also been more exhausting than I could possibly have imagined.’ Mrs Turner spends up to 18 hours a day feeding her two identical boys, James and Joshua, and two identical girls, Emily and Lauren – one of only four sets of double boy-girl twins in the world. She and husband Julian, 44, also put on at least five full loads of washing a day to keep on top of the dirty bedding and clothes, and estimate they will have to complete 30,000 nappy changes before the babies are grown up.

'More exhausting than I could possibly have imagined': But Sharon said becoming a mother of four in one fell swoop was a 'wonderful, uplifting experience' Fatherhood: Julian says he feels guilty for returning to his career as a sales director while his wife has to do the 'real job' of looking after the children . The quads came into the world 11 weeks prematurely in March last year, weighing just 2lb each. But once they got home, they grew from strength to strength. Mrs Turner said: ‘For the first few months, we hardly got any sleep at all. They require constant attention, and just feeding them is a huge task. ‘It takes around three hours to feed all four babies, and they need to be fed every four hours. So once I have finished, I know I have an hour’s break before it all starts again.’ Relentless: Sharon says her babies get through 14 bananas and 24 yoghurts a week and need to be fed every for hours. It takes three hours to feed them... Big blue eyes: Sharon feeds Joshua a spoonful of baby mush. As the children get older, the shopping list is expanding at an alarming rate . At first, the family bought 80 washable nappies in an attempt to be environmentally friendly – but when the constant washing became too much, they were forced to bulk-buy disposable ones from Aldi instead. Then the family car had to be replaced with a nine-seater VW transporter large enough to fit their brood and all the necessary supplies, including two double buggies. And as the children get older, the shopping list is expanding at an alarming rate. Mrs Turner said: ‘They have just started eating solids and get through 14 bananas and 24 yoghurts a week. But when you think about what they will eat when they get older it is frightening.’ Imagine the noise: Sharon and Julian look on as the babies play .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Former BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams takes a dim view of swearing on the television . It's not something she is ever likely to do, but Sian Williams says she takes a dim view of her colleagues swearing on TV. The mother-of-four said she switches off her set when she hears bad language before the 9pm watershed. But rather than getting upset about some of the more obvious four letter words, she said the phrase that angers her the most is 'Oh my God'. Asked what made her switch off the TV, Miss Williams, 49, told the Radio Times: 'Swearing. I'm quite old-fashioned in that respect. I don't like people to use inappropriate language before the watershed. Particularly the phrase ""oh my God"" because it can offend.' Miss Williams has two sons, Joss, 22, and Alex, 20, with her first husband Neale Hunt and a son Seth, seven, and daughter Eve, five, with her second husband Paul Woolwich. The presenter said she regularly watches TV with her family, a habit that no doubt feeds her dislike of pre-watershed swearing.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Prince Philip in uniform: The Duke of Edinburgh has spoken publicly for the first time of how he saved a Navy ship from a German bomber in 1943 . His comrades saw it as a courageous act that saved dozens of lives. To Prince Philip, however, it was nothing more than a ‘frightfully good wheeze’. The Duke of Edinburgh has spoken publicly for the first time of how he saved a Navy ship from a German bomber in 1943. And the 93-year-old was typically phlegmatic about his exploits. He told how the destroyer he was serving on during the Allied invasion of Sicily was spotted by a Luftwaffe plane that looked certain to sink it. The Duke, who was second in command of HMS Wallace, foiled the attack by launching a burning life-raft from the ship. The German pilot attacked the raft, allowing the destroyer to escape. Prince Philip told BBC Radio 4: ‘We did some patrolling along the coast of Sicily and one night for some reason or another some German bomber decided they could see us, and so they thought they would have a go. ‘I thought it was a frightfully good wheeze. I got a Carley float, filled it with rubbish and set fire to it and launched it hoping that the aeroplane would think we were burning. It did. It went and had a go at it. We got away with it.’ In 2003, one of the Duke’s comrades – former yeoman Harry Hargreaves – remembered the same attack, and described the crew’s fear and certainty they would be killed. He said: ‘Prince Philip saved our lives that night. I suppose there might have been a few survivors, but certainly the ship would have been sunk. He was always very courageous and resourceful and thought very quickly. ‘You would say to yourself “What the hell are we going to do now?” and Philip would come up with something.’ In his interview this week, Prince Philip also spoke about his involvement in the Battle of Cape Matapan, where Royal Navy warships destroyed Italian cruisers off the Greek coast in 1941. Then aged 19, he was a humble midshipman in charge of picking out enemy ships in the darkness using the spotlight aboard HMS Valiant. Describing the moment they crept up on the Italian fleet, he said: ‘I could see them because Greyhound the destroyer switched on her searchlight before we did, and so I could actually see the outline of these ships before somebody said “Open shutters”. Fortunately it was pointing in the right direction at the time. ‘The interesting thing that struck me was that it was so close – you know those big searchlights, colossal great things – it only lit up half one of the Italian cruisers. They said “Train left”. ‘I found the other one and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15inch shells at point blank range.’ An informal shot of the Duke of Edinburgh whilst in the Navy: The Duke, who was second in command of HMS Wallace, foiled the attack by launching a burning life-raft from the which the German pilot attacked instead . HMS Wallace: 'I got a Carley float, filled it with rubbish and set fire to it and launched it hoping that the aeroplane would think we were burning. It did. It went and had a go at it. We got away with it,' he said . Prince Philip was mentioned in despatches after the battle by the fleet’s Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. He was later awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour. The Duke may now be accustomed to all the luxury of life in Buckingham Palace. But his account of his war years reveals he was once used to much more menial tasks. He recalled: ‘On the way to the invasion of Sicily, we were pulled off the east coast convoys and sent out and went into Malta, and I optimistically thought I could get some spuds for the ship, and I went ashore. ‘People said “Don’t you realise there’s been a siege?” I managed to get a couple of bags of spuds but it was the only fresh stuff we could get. Then we went off.’ After the war Prince Philip was promoted to lieutenant-commander and was given command of frigate HMS Magpie, where he was nicknamed ‘Dukey’ by his men. He married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and his Navy career came to an end a few years later when she became Queen.","Duke of Edinburgh recounted Second World War tale in Radio 4 interview .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . ITV is ruining its television dramas by saturating them with advert breaks, one of its own top screenwriters has claimed. Award-winning author Anthony Horowitz, who is the creator of detective thriller Foyle’s War, said chopping dramas up was ‘absolutely terrible.’ Following widespread frustration at the number of commercials in hit costume drama Downton Abbey, he said writer have had to put extra cliffhangers into their scripts. Award-winning author Anthony Horowitz, who is the creator of detective thriller Foyle's War, said chopping dramas up was 'absolutely terrible' Mr Horowitz, 59, said that while writing Midsomer Murders, he had to keep killing off characters to keep viewers engaged before each break, meaning the much-loved series became a ‘bloodbath’. He told the Hay Festival: ‘It is absolutely terrible the way television is chopped into so many little bits. The story has to be designed to work around that. So you have 18 minutes for your first part, 15 minutes for your second part and the last parts are only ten minutes each. ‘Your story is cut down into little wedges, so you have to be sure that each wedge, each section, satisfies the audience and they keep coming back from the commercial break. That requires really careful planning.’ Mr Horowitz began writing for TV in the 1980s and penned several Hercule Poirot stories and the first 14 episodes of detective series Midsomer Murders, which is known for dispatching its characters in grisly and inventive ways. But he said the body count became unnecessarily high because of the number of advert breaks. He said: ‘There was a stupid thing that whenever there was a commercial break I would kill somebody, and there were so many breaks it was a bit of a bloodbath. After 14 episodes I realised there was no one left in Midsomer Murders.’ Mr Horowitz, 59, said that while writing Midsomer Murders, he had to keep killing off characters to keep viewers engaged before each break, meaning the much-loved series became a 'bloodbath' Last week, viewers complained the semi-finals it ITV’s reality show Britain’s Got Talent were ruined by the constant adverts, screened between each act. Last year, Downton Abbey came under fire after a 90-minute programme contained six breaks, taking up almost 20 minutes of screen time. However, TV commentator Vivienne Pattison, who runs campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said yesterday she could see no alternative to having frequent advert breaks on commercial television. She said: ‘I do sympathise with the view that advert breaks are annoying. I don’t think anybody likes them. But unfortunately that is just the nature of the beast. Without adverts, ITV would not be able to fund its dramas in the first place, so they are sadly necessary.’ In 2011, broadcasting regulator Ofcom changed its rules to allow ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 to screen a maximum of 12 minutes of adverts per hour, an increase from the previous seven minutes. It comes after widespread frustration at the number of commercials in hit costume drama Downton Abbey, he said writer have had to put extra cliffhangers into their scripts . As well as writing for television, Mr Horowitz has penned a string of successful novels, including the popular Alex Rider spy series for teenagers. He told the hay festival he had to be careful not to make his children’s fiction too dark, in particular the4 penultimate Alex Rider book Scorpia Rising. He said: ‘There is a lot of death in my books and I do not know why. As I get older my books have got darker. Scorpia Rising becomes very close to being cruel, and I had to be very careful not to make it too dark.’ The author also revealed he based one of his characters on singer Sir Elton John after learning the star spent £50,000 a year on flowers. He said: ‘How can anyone in their right mind do that? He must be mad. So I created a character based on him, called Damian Cray. He was vaporised on a tea trolley.’","Author Anthony Horowitz is the creator of detective thriller Foyle’s War .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . We are used to seeing celebrity contestants being sent home from Strictly Come Dancing. But in a departure from the usual choreography, now the professionals are being given the boot. The BBC has announced that show veterans James Jordan and Artem Chigvintsev, along with recent recruit Anya Garnis, will not return in the autumn. The drastic cull will make way for some new faces, including 30-year-old Joanne Clifton – sister of Kevin from Grimsby. Ousted: James Jordan leaves - but his wife Ola stays . The five-times British Ballroom Champion and her brother were trained by their parents at the family dance academy and will now become the first siblings to take part in Strictly, where Kevin, 31, made it to the final of the 11th series in December. But after eight years, viewers will see no more of Mr Jordan. He was sacked after reports he clashed with judge Craig Revel Horwood, and it is understood the BBC felt he and his Polish-born wife Ola, 31, dominated the show too much. New arrival: Ballroom dancer Joanne Clifton in action (left). Right, Joanne, shown aged 12, is the sister of Kevin from Grimsby, pictured at 12 . While Mrs Jordan will stay, Mr Jordan turned down a reduced role that would allow him to appear only in the show’s specials. Meanwhile Russian-born Mr Chigvintsev blamed his exit on visa issues, writing on Twitter: ‘Let’s hope my visa situation will change in the future... I decided to stay in US to sort my citizenship.’ The other new arrivals will be Irish dancer Tristan MacManus, 31, who spent three years on Dancing With The Stars in the US, and Australian Natalie Lowe, 33, who withdrew last year due to injury. Executive producer Louise Rainbow said: ‘We’re delighted that Joanne and Tristan will be joining our fantastic cast. A huge thank you goes out to both Artem and James for being hardworking, dedicated dancers.’","Mr Jordan reportedly clashed with Craig Revel Horwood - but wife Ola stays .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . For Britain’s Got Talent contestants, it was their first chance to impress the nation on live TV. But for viewers at home, the excitement of this week’s semi-finals was somewhat dimmed – by the constant advert breaks. The ITV programme has been hit with complaints after almost a quarter of its first two live shows were taken up with commercials. End of the line: Dance troupe CountryVive were eliminated on Monday night's show . Some fans joked they only tuned in for the adverts and were upset when these were interrupted by the occasional contestant, while others resorted to recording the show and fast-forwarding though the breaks. The first semi-final on Monday night, which saw singing group Collabro and Canadian magician Darcy Oake put through to next week’s final, was watched by an average of 9.1million viewers – down almost 700,000 on the same episode last series. Many viewers reacted furiously on Twitter when they realised the 90-minute programme was saturated with six advert breaks, taking up almost 20 minutes of screen time. One fan, Chris Lee, said: ‘Britain’s Got Talent has more adverts than acts! Sort it out #ITV #BGT becoming a bloody joke!’ Winners: Singing group Collabro won the public vote . Another, Katie Purkiss, tweeted: ‘Britain’s Got Talent? Not sure about that, but it’s definitely got adverts.’ And Carlton Cole joked: ‘Don’t you hate it when you’re watching adverts, and suddenly #BGT comes on.’ Others said they decided not to watch the show live and record it instead. It meant that although they could not vote for their favourite acts, they were able to fast-forward the adverts and enjoy the show uninterrupted. The half-hour live results show – which aired after Coronation Street at 9.30pm – was watched by 7.8million viewers on Monday night, meaning 1.3million decided not to stay up to find out who won. It contained a further eight minutes of adverts. Like magic: Darcy Oake narrowly ousted impressionist Jon Clegg . Collabro won the public vote and Oake – who admitted this week he could understand why some fans are upset BGT contains a string of foreign acts – narrowly ousted impressionist Jon Clegg. Despite the best efforts of the nine contestants, the part of the show that generated the most comment online was Amanda Holden’s revealing dress. Over the course of the week, 45 acts will be whittled down to the final 10. The winner will be chosen on June 7. Tonight’s show will see burlesque dance troupe Crazy Rouge take on a group of French drag artists for a coveted final spot. Last night an ITV spokesman insisted the BGT semi-finals have the same number of adverts as other ITV programmes of the same length. He said: ‘The number of minutes of advertising shown in Britain’s Got Talent was no more than is usual in a programme of its length and was fully compliant with allowances stipulated in the Ofcom Code on the Scheduling of TV Advertising.’","ITV programme hit with complaints over ad-filled shows .

It is nearly 40 years since Ford starred in the first Star Wars film in 1977 . Speaking shortly before his accident, the American star described himself as a ‘battered old Ford’ and said he prefers to do his own action stunts. He said: ‘I keep on coming back for more. If it doesn’t look real on the screen then an audience does not believe what it sees.’ The actor, who has also pulled muscles and damaged a disc in his back during the Indiana Jones films, added: ‘Although I do my own running, jumping and falling, I always try to keep myself from being hurt.

It will be the first Star Wars title released by Disney, after creator George Lucas sold the rights to the franchise in 2012. When it was rumoured that Ford may take part in a fifth Indiana Jones film last year, he shrugged off suggestions he is too old to take on the action role. He said: ‘I don’t think there is any barrier to Indiana Jones being an old fart. I’m old enough that we don’t need [Sean] Connery anymore – I’m old enough to play my own father.’ Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release in December next year.","Ford, 71, had left foot in plaster as he was seen for first time since accident .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC waded into yet another race row yesterday after Harry Enfield blacked-up for his latest comedy sketch show and poked fun at a Muslim girl in a burka. The comedian and his comedy partner Paul Whitehouse were accused of being ‘crass and tasteless’ yesterday for apparently mocking ethnic minorities. Their new show – Harry & Paul: The Story Of The Twos - will be shown later this month as part of BBC2’s celebration of its 50th birthday. In one risqué sketch, Enfield makes fun of black American singer Harry Belafonte by covering his face in dark make-up. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Paul Whitehouse, left, and Enfield, centre, with the girl dressed in a burqa during one sketch . The character – who appears as a mock ‘talking head’ - is thinly disguised under the name Barry Helafonte. He is one of a series of real-life personalities, including Harry Hill, Harry Potter and Barry Cryer, Enfield lampoons as part of a running gag about famous people called Harry or Barry. In another bizarre scene likely to outrage some viewers, the comedians turn a young Muslim girl covered in a burqa into the butt of their humour. For no apparent reason, she is introduced into a spoof of Danish crime drama The Killing along-side a young boy dressed in a costume of animated penguin Pingu. The implication seems to be that her burqa makes the Muslim girl look like a penguin. The pair are seen waddling through a tower block before the boy shoots a woman in the head at point blank range. Coming just weeks after Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson was forced to apologise for apparently mumbling the N-word during an outtake, the sketches are likely to further inflame tensions over what the BBC puts on air. The Story Of The Twos, which will be shown at 9pm on Sunday May 25, is expected to be watched by millions of families. Comedy partners Whitehouse, left, and Enfield, right, have created their new show Harry & Paul: The Story Of The Twos as part of BBC2's 50th anniversary celebrations . Asked to justify his decision to . include a young girl in a burqa at a preview screening this month, . Enfield, 52, said he wanted to have a ‘little Muslim’ in the show. He . said: ‘I thought we had to have a Muslim person in it because they . always have Muslims. All the Swedish programmes, they always have a . Muslim. Why is there a Muslim in them?’ Enfield joked that his burqa-wearing character should have been called ‘red herring’ because that is the role that Muslim characters play in the foreign thrillers. Last night, media standards campaigner Pippa Smith, of the group Safermedia, said Enfield risked stoking ethnic tensions with his comedy. She said: ‘Is Harry Enfield just going out of his way to be controversial by using a young girl dressed in a burqa meeting a young boy dressed in a Pingu penguin costume for his sketch? ‘Poking fun at young Muslims, who look no more than children, is in very poor taste, especially when some young Muslim women are complaining of being harassed and even attacked for wearing the burqa. ‘To then shoot a woman in the head is completely inappropriate. Harry Enfield is no longer funny and the BBC has lost the plot.’ BBC presenter Jeremy Clarkson was recently embroiled in a race row after appearing to say the N-word during unaired footage . It is not the first time Enfield has been caught up in a race row because of his edgy comedy. In 2008, he provoked fury in the Philippines with a sketch in which he played a man who tries to get his ‘pet Northerner’ to mate with his Filipina housemaid. A senior Filipina congresswoman demanded the BBC apologise over the ‘revolting’ sketch, which she said depicted Filipinas as ’submissive sex objects’. The country’s ambassador to the UK said it was ‘gutter humour’. The same year, Enfield revealed he was forced to drop a planned character of a sex-crazed Muslim hoodie because producers were afraid of provoking a barrage of complaints. He was also warned not to play another new character, paedophile Catholic priest Father Paddy, for the same reason. Enfield said at the time: ‘I was told, “Don’t even go there”.’ The latest controversy comes after Clarkson was embroiled in a racism row for apparently mumbling the word n***** in unaired footage. And last week, the BBC sacked Radio Devon DJ David Lowe, 67, for broadcasting a song con-taining the words: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming to do the same to you’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse have a well-established brand of humour which is well known to BBC Two audiences.  In History of the Twos a wide range of people, history and trends across BBC 2’s 50 year history are parodied without any intention to offend. ‘In the ‘Pingu’ sketch no group of people are being satirised, but the genre of Nordic Noir is very much lampooned.’","Comedian mocks young Muslim girl in a burka in latest BBC show .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . He is something of a smooth operator in front of the camera. Now Gary Lineker’s wife has let slip his secret – a luxury moisturiser beloved of supermodels and actresses. The 53-year-old regularly applies Crème de la Mer to help him look as fresh-faced as his young wife. Fresh-faced: Gay Lineker's wife Danielle, pictured right with the football pundit, has revealed the secrets of his skincare regime . Danielle Lineker – who at 34 is nearly two decades his junior – said she encourages the former England striker to raid her bathroom cabinet because he is too embarrassed to buy his own moisturiser. But instead of using a cheaper brand such as Nivea – which costs just £1.15 for 30ml – he has developed a taste for the high-end anti-ageing cream, which sells at £105 for the same amount. Mrs Lineker said: ‘Gary looks very young for his age. He has good genes and he looks after himself. ‘He moisturises, which is down to my influence. I give him anything I’ve got knocking around the cupboards. ‘He actually likes Crème de la Mer, the really thick expensive one. He has expensive tastes. It is meant to be the really good one, but I actually think they all do the same thing.’ Mrs Lineker made the revelation as she told the Daily Mail of her fears that the couple may soon be too old to have a child of their own. They married in 2009, just three years after he was divorced by his wife of 20 years and mother to his sons, Michelle Cockayne. Mrs Lineker, a Welsh model, has an 11-year-old daughter, Ella, from a previous relationship, while she is also stepmother to Lineker’s sons George, 22, Harry, 19, Tobias, 17, and Angus, 15. But she says the couple have still not decided to have a child of their own. She said: ‘It is difficult enough with five kids, let alone with a new baby. I’m 35 this year and time is ticking. I’d better get a move on if I am going to do it.’ Having established herself as a lingerie model, Mrs Lineker is now making her way as an actress. Her screen debut is in teen film We Are The Freaks, which was in cinemas yesterday and is released on DVD on May 5. At £105 for a 30ml pot, Crème de la Mer, right, is beyond the reach of most. But a string of celebrities swear by its anti-ageing powers. Last month, actress Emma Watson shared a picture of her make-up bag, which contained a £42 stick of Crème de la Mer lipbalm. And Jennifer Lopez, 44, reportedly covers her entire body in the cream. Its secret is a ‘miracle broth’ of seaweed, vitamins and minerals that have been blasted by sound waves.","Football pundit, 53, raids his wife's bathroom cabinet for moisturiser .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC could have an 'unconscious bias' against ethnic minorities, women and disabled people, its news boss admitted yesterday. James Harding said there is a lack of diversity among its top news presenters because managers tend to recruit those who look like them. He said he plans to 'do something determined' to increase the number of ethnic minorities and women on screen, including stricter diversity targets and a 'sponsorship scheme' to help them progress to senior positions. BBC News boss James Harding says too many top presenters are white men . In a speech to BBC staff at New Broadcasting House, he said: 'On the issues of diversity, equality and disability at the BBC, my view remains that we - by which I mean me and every one of us who has the power to appoint and promote people within News and Current Affairs - have to do something determined about this. 'Across News, we worry that we have a tendency to recruit in our own image, so all members of the News Group Board have taken a course in unconscious bias.' Mr Harding - who was previously editor of The Times newspaper - said he would 'stick to the principle that the best candidate gets the job'. But he said news managers are now increasing their diversity targets so that bulletins have more black and ethnic minority presenters in future. He said BBC London had committed to raising the proportion of ethnic minority staff to 28 per cent, up from 21 per cent, in the next two or three years. Mr Harding said recent appointments - including Mishal Husain to Radio 4's Today programme and Kamal Ahmed to the post of Business Editor - were already 'changing the look and sound of the BBC.' Mr Harding said he plans to 'do something determined' to increase the number of ethnic minorities and women on screen . But he added: 'To those to say this is not enough, I agree. There is much more to be done on diversity across the BBC, on air and off it.' He said: 'The BBC should, surely, be the best news organisation in the country to get a job and prosper if you come from an ethnic minority background, if you are a women, if you are disabled. 'Our target should not be to be good enough, but to be to be much, much better than the rest. We have a long way to go.' Mr Harding also announced BBC would decrease its news budget by £20million in the next two years, adding to the £40million cuts it has made in the past three. The BBC has faced more than a decade of criticism over its failure to hire more ethnic minority staff. In 2001, then-BBC director general Greg Dyke described the corporation as 'hideously white' after figures showed more than 98 per cent of its workers were white.","James Harding says he plans to increase ethnic minorities on screen .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC has admitted its actors were partly to blame for the inaudible dialogue in Jamaica Inn. The corporation originally said technical faults were responsible after more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’ in the drama, shown at Easter. After an investigation the BBC has now blamed several factors, including the cast failing to deliver their lines clearly. Scroll down for video . The lavish BBC adaptation of Jamaica Inn starring Jessica Brown Findlay, pictured, lost one third of its viewers during the three nights following hundreds of complaints about the poor sound quality . Many viewers complained that the accents were too difficult to understand and the actors were 'mumbling' on the show featuring Matthew McNulty, left, and Jessica Brown Findlay, right . After an investigation the BBC has now blamed several factors, including the cast failing to deliver their lines clearly . The ratings fell by more than a million over the course of the three-part drama as viewers singled out stars Sean Harris and Jessica Brown Findlay for particular criticism. According to the Radio Times, the BBC identified five areas of concern that affected the sound quality, although a spokesman refused to say what they were. It is thought that on top of mumbling actors, there were problems with the sound levels caused when the audio track was dubbed on to the master tape. One of the most strident critics of the final result was the drama’s own adapter, Emma Frost, who compared the show to ‘listening through mud’. She said the sound had been fine in earlier versions seen before transmission, and the BBC said there had been ‘issues with sound levels’. The BBC confirmed that over the three nights a total of 1,384 viewers complained about the lavish production, pictured, although they did receive some commendations . Viewers particularly found the accent of Sean Harris, rear, who played Joss Merlyn very difficult, with co-star Jessica Brown Findlay, front . But many viewers claimed it was also the fault of the cast. Some said they were even glad when the Inn’s landlord, played by Harris, was killed in the drama because they had not understood a word he had said. Previously viewers have criticised actor Eddie Redmayne for mumbling in BBC1’s adaptation of the novel Birdsong. Others said they could not hear key scenes in historical drama Parade’s End, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.","BBC admits actors were partly to blame for inaudible dialogue in drama .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Britain's Got Talent lost more than two million viewers in its second week as fans complained the show seemed ‘scripted’ and ‘predictable’. Now in its eighth series, the ITV programme got off to a strong start this month when its first episode attracted a record audience of 10.5million viewers. The figure – which climbed to more than 11million when viewers of the ITV+1 service were counted – was the highest ever for an opening show and the biggest rating of any TV show this year. The show, fronted by Simon Cowell, saw the record breaking viewing figures of the series opener quickly trail off over scripting rows . But on Saturday, the number of viewers dropped dramatically to just 8.3million. While it was still the most watched show of the evening, with 45 per cent of all TV viewers, the figure was a drop of 2.3million in just a week. Some viewers said they were bored by the format despite producers’ efforts to make the show more exciting this year. For the first time, judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon are each allowed to send one act directly to the semi-finals by pressing a special ‘golden buzzer’. But it did not stop many fans from complaining the programme seemed less spontaneous than in past years. Writing on Twitter, one viewer, Alec Morgan, said: ‘I have decided that BGT is a load of scripted rubbish.’ Another, Jamie Ide, said: ‘BGT is so scripted, Simon has gone round YouTube seen some acts and paid them to come on.’ Judge David Walliams was branded 'cruel' for using his 'golden buzzer' to send one contestant - which was mocked for his act - through to the next round . A third, writing under the name Chris, said: ‘This show could really do without the pretentious production flourishes and scripted interactions between participants. #BGT’ It emerged that Paddy Jones, left, from the first show had already won a similar show in Spain . Other viewers said they felt the show has become too cruel towards its less talented contestants. On Saturday, the judges roundly mocked singer Christian Spridon after he delivered a tuneless rendition of Tom Jones’ hit Sex Bomb. But he was saved when Walliams pressed his golden buzzer, leading some to accuse him of being insincere and leading the contestant to believe he had a chance. One viewer said: ‘Sometimes it feels slightly cruel, like the golden buzzer bit, they were just taking the p** out that poor bloke.’ Another added: ‘That is such a cruel golden buzzer. That guy proper believes his talent @davidwalliams’. A third said: ‘BGT is cruel…humiliating people in front of millions.’ Britain’s Got Talent has been hit by a series of fakery rows in recent years as it has emerged many contestants are directly approached by producers and encouraged to enter. Far from being plucked from obscurity, some already have dedicated talent agents and successful careers. And it emerged salsa-dancing grandmother Paddy Jones – who was the revelation of the first episode – had already won a similar Spanish talent contest called Tu Si Que Vales in 2009 before she was approached and asked to enter the British show.","Talent show saw millions of viewers tune out after first episode .

"By . Associated Press . The highest-ranking U.S. military officer killed in combat since the Vietnam War was buried with full honors Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery in a ceremony attended by his family and platoons of fellow warriors. Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene was killed Aug. 5 when a gunman believed to be an Afghan soldier opened fire at a military academy near Kabul. During the ceremony, Greene's adult son tightly clasped the hands of his mother and sister as soldiers folded the flag that had draped his father's casket. While the U.S. Army Band played 'America the Beautiful,' Army First Lt. Matthew Greene handed a tissue to his mother, who dabbed at her eyes.

Greene, known as Harry, spent most of 34-year Army career developing, building and supplying soldiers with equipment and technology.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Brenda Carlin . and Peter Henn . In just four years, space tourists could be blasting into orbit from one of eight sites named today as possible locations for the UK’s first spaceport. Six of the sites are in Scotland, including Glasgow Prestwick Airport and RAF Lossiemouth. Newquay has been selected in England and Llanbedr in Wales. All sites have to meet strict criteria, including being a safe distance from densely populated areas and a runway that can be extended to more than 3,000m (9,842ft). Britain's . first commercial spaceport could be based in any one of these eight . locations, and would act as a hub for flights by Sir Richard Branson's . Virgin Galactic and XCOR Space Expeditions . The aim is to use the spaceport to launch tourists into space as well as commercial satellites. The move is designed to take advantage of the anticipated burgeoning space tourism industry. By 2030, the UK government hopes to capture 10 per cent of the world’s space market. If this target is met, opening up the UK tourism industry to specialist operators such as Virgin Galactic and XCor could be worth £40 billion and provide 100,000 jobs. Making the announcement at the Farnborough Air Show, Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill said: 'In order to lead the way on commercial space flight, we will need to establish a spaceport that enables us to operate regular flights. Richard Branson's dream to charter commercial space flights has taken a step closer to reality. His company, Virgin Galactic, yesterday signed a deal with U.S. aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space on SpaceShipTwo (pictured) Campbeltown Airport (Scotland) Glasgow Prestwick Airport (Scotland) Llanbedr Airport (Wales) Newquay Cornwall Airport (England) Kinloss Barracks (Scotland) RAF Leuchars (Scotland) RAF Lossiemouth (Scotland) Stornorway Airport (Scotland) 'The work published today has got the ball rolling - now we want to work with others to take forward this exciting project and have Britain’s first spaceport up and running by 2018.' There have been reports that the government is hoping Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson will build the port as part of his Virgin Galactic project. Virgin Galactic’s first flights are scheduled to take off from a purpose-built spaceport in New Mexico, USA, at the start of the year, with passengers paying £120,000 ($206,000) for a 150-minute flight that will climb to heights of around 62 miles (100km) to achieve zero gravity for approximately six minutes. The spaceport will have its own dedicated and separate air space in order to manage flights into orbit safely. After a period of consultation, the UK government said further work will be done to develop those locations remaining on the site shortlist. XCOR Aerospace is based at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Its Lynx spacecraft, illustration pictured, seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $95,000 (£57,000). This is almost two thirds the price of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo . Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Space is big business for the UK. It already contributes £11.3 billion to the economy each year, supporting nearly 35,000 jobs. New figures show that the space industry employs 34,000 people and contributes £11billion to economy . 'That’s why it’s important for us to prepare the UK for new launcher technology and take steps towards meeting our ambition of establishing the first British spaceport by 2018. 'Exploring the opportunities that commercial space flight presents, and potentially making strategic investments in this area, will support the growth of this thriving industry and underpin the economy of tomorrow, making the UK the place for space.' Sources told the Mail on Sunday that the need for the base to be ‘remote’ and secure meant there was more chance it would be on a Scottish site. Over the weekend, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, MP for Inverness, . talked up the chances of Scotland leading the UK drive to open up ‘the . final frontier of commercial space travel’. He . said: ‘Scotland has a proud association with space exploration. We . celebrated Neil Armstrong’s Scottish ancestry when he became the first . man on the moon and only last week an amazing Scottish company was . responsible for building the UK Space Agency’s first satellite.’ But . sources also privately made clear it was ‘highly unlikely’ the . spaceport would ever be built in Scotland if it voted for independence . in September’s referendum. One . said: ‘An independent Scotland would be free to bid for this sort of . thing but I doubt it would have the resources to do it.’ Virgin Galactic - Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS .

"By . Chris Hastings . and Peter Henn . All eyes may be on Martin Freeman when he brings Shakespeare’s Machiavellian Richard III to life on stage – but for traditional theatregoers, the very worst villains are in the audience. Fans of the Hobbit star have been accused of breaching ‘theatre etiquette’ by cheering the actor’s very first scene, during which he delivers the soliloquy starting ‘Now is the winter of our discontent’. Conventionally, audiences break into applause only at the beginning of the interval and  at the final curtain. Martin Freeman as King Richard III in Shakespeare's play . However, enthusiastic Hobbit fans, many of whom are first-time theatregoers, have been accused of ruining some of Shakespeare’s most spellbinding moments with their ‘annoying’ and ‘disruptive’ bursts of applause. One audience member, theatre  blogger Claire Dikecoglu, said last night: ‘After the opening monologue some fans tried to kick off clapping and cheering, which I found to be disruptive and unnecessary. ‘There are strong views on this,  but I was irritated when the audience interrupted the flow of the play to clap and cheer Martin’s first scene.’ Miss Dikecoglu, who was sitting in the front row for the show’s preview at London’s Trafalgar Studios, added: ‘While I am not a traditionalist in terms of dramaturgy, I do believe  in proper theatre etiquette. ‘It’s a first preview and there were mistakes. I understand that Martin Freeman is popular, but I have no  bigger pet peeve than everything  getting standing ovations these days.’ As Hobbit fans know him, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo Baggins in the films based on Tolkien's books . Celebrated actress Dame Eileen Atkins agreed that applauding someone during the middle of a production was ‘wrong’. She said: ‘It ultimately breaks the spell of the story. I think that what  is happening is because of the success of The Hobbit. Martin Freeman is attracting a different kind of audience who are not used to the theatre. Judi Dench is a big name, but I don’t think that her audience would behave in that fashion.’ Haydn Gwynne, who co-starred opposite Kevin Spacey in The Old Vic’s 2011 production of Richard III, said applauding a star during a play could be ‘undemocratic’. She added: ‘If people clap at the beginning, then there is a danger they are being taken out of  the story. It should not be about the famous person.  It should be about the play and the role.’ And Maureen Lipman, who is about to star in the West End production of Daytona, also blamed the over-zealous applause  on the fact that Freeman’s starring role in The Hobbit trilogy had attracted a much younger audience to the show. She said: ‘Martin Freeman’s face is on every bus  in London. The producers are going out to find the Hobbit audience.  They are spending a fortune to target them.’She added: ‘The director tweeted the other day about the fact that the first two rows could expect to find themselves spattered in fake blood. ‘They are aiming for people who spend most of their day with wire in their ears. It is not so much Richard III as Richard the rock concert.’ However, Oscar-winning dramatist Christopher Hampton, who is one  of Britain’s most successful playwrights, said he had no problem with people showing appreciation for actors in the middle of a play. Mr Hampton, whose hits include Les Liaisons Dangereuses and the musical Sunset Boulevard, said: ‘Attracting first-time theatregoers is the holy grail as far as we are all concerned. We want them to come as much as possible.’ He added: ‘I love it when people applaud in the middle  of the play. I am all for people having a good time in the theatre and if they want to express themselves like that, I don’t see any harm in it.’ Last night Freeman, who has also appeared in TV hit Sherlock, was unavailable for comment, but Richard III director Jamie Lloyd stepped in to defend the production’s enthusiastic reception. He said: ‘The show’s standing ovations have been instant, to reward the entire cast, not just Martin. They don’t wait for Martin to come on for his bow. I think that we are seeing an authentic, enthusiastic reaction from a generational muddle in the audience. ‘Younger, first-time theatregoers are more vocal and they are certainly screaming their appreciation at the end.’","Younger fans break into round of applause when Freeman appears much to annoyance of more seasoned theatregoers .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Australia has pressed the Thai government to allow a transition period before it bans commercial surrogacy in a bid to allow Australians to receive children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers. The request made by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop comes a day after a Thai surrogacy agency was shut down by authorities. Ms Bishop made the call to acting Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in Myanmar capital Naypitdaw, yesterday. Foreign minister Julie Bishop (left) has called on Thailand to allow a transition period before banning commercial surrogacy a day after All IVF Clinic in Bangkok was shut down.  Dr Pisit Tantiwattanakul (right) was the centre's director . Ms Bishop raised the issue of ongoing cases of surrogate mothers for Australian women and requested Thai authorities allow for a 'transition period' for the births 'for humanitarian reasons' before enforcing proposed laws. The Australian families have already paid thousands of dollars to agents and the surrogate mothers for the procedure. Mr Sihasak told reporters Ms Bishop said the Australian government had no policy to support commercial surrogacy and Thailand had full authority to deal with issue. Ms Bishop's request comes as Thailand prepares to fast track legislation through the National Legislative Assembly. An estimated 70 per cent of Australian couples seeking surrogacy attended the All IVF clinic . As many as 50 Australian couples may have lost the opportunity to be parents after the Bangkok IVF clinic was shut down with Thai authorities suspecting links to an international baby trafficking organisation. Following the closure of the All IVF Center on Friday, there are grave concerns that Thai surrogate mothers could abort their babies now they have no support from the clinic as the baby Gammy scandal has seen 40 clinics raided in a serious crackdown across Thailand. It is estimated that about 50 Australian couples, who have arrangements with the clinic, have no way of contacting their surrogates and the whereabouts of the embryos previously stored at clinic was also unknown, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Thai authorities has cracked down on the growing surrogacy business after the plight of Gammy, a six-month old baby with Down syndrome, whose Australian biological parents allegedly left him behind in Thailand but took his twin sister to Bunbury in Western Australia. Surrogacy Australia founder Sam Everingham has called on the Thai authorities to ensure all of the clinic’s surrogates are safe and the biological parents will be reunited with their babies when born. Thai officials are treating surrogacy as human trafficking until parliament passes legislation banning surrogacy since Gammy (pictured with his surrogate mother Pattharamon Janbua) was allegedly left in Thailand by his Australian biological parents after it was discovered he had Down syndrome . The Thailand Health Service Support department has connected the clinic to the alleged biological father of six boys and three girls aged between six and 12 months, who were found in a Bangkok apartment and were taken into the state’s care. Authorities allege 24-year-old Japanese businessman Mitsuoki Shigeta, who has visited Thailand 65 times since 2012, has taken at least three other babies out of Thailand, two of them to Cambodia. Mr Shigeta, who flew out of Thailand early on Friday morning, is wanted for questioning over human trafficking, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Health Service Support chief Boonruang Trairuangworawat said the clinic was shut down because services could cause harm or even deaths: ‘it’s registered as a medical facility but not as one offering fertility treatments’. Pisit Tantiwattanakul, the clinic’s executive director, infertility specialist and chief embryologist, was described on the clinic’s website before it was shut down on Sunday, as ‘charming and kind,’ who received ‘high marks for his patient demeanour and his direct approach to client care’ and performed more than 700 IVF procedures a year. Surrogacy Australia founder Sam Everingham has called on the Thai authorities to ensure all of the clinic's surrogates are safe and the biological parents will be reunited with their babies at birth . It is estimated that up to 70 per cent of Australian couples seeking surrogacy attended Dr Tantiwattanakul’s clinic. Australia has set up a multi-agency committee to pressure Thai authorities to allow Australians with existing agreements to be fulfilled so surrogacy babies can be taken back to Australia as planned. Thai medical officials are treating surrogacy as human trafficking cases until parliament passes legislation banning surrogacy, except where family members were concerned. David Farnell, who was jailed for child molestation, and his wife Wendy will break their silence on Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes program on Sunday on why they left Gammy in Thailand. But Pattharamon Janbua, the baby’s Thai surrogate, has said she will reject a Channel Nine donation to an appeal to pay Gammy’s medical costs and long-term care, saying she does not want the Farnells' money or sympathy.","Julie Bishop has called on Thai government to allow a transition period before banning commercial surrogacy .

"By . Chris Hastings . and Peter Henn . Attack: Maxine Peake on Silk, accused of backing 'fat cat lawyers' The BBC has been plunged into a row over political bias after one of its popular dramas was apparently used as a platform to criticise Government policy. Tory MPs are furious that BBC1 courtroom drama Silk – which has more than five million viewers – has taken a stance against proposals to cut the legal aid bill, which currently costs taxpayers £2 billion a year. The row was sparked by last Monday night’s episode, when one of the show’s characters delivered a strongly worded attack on plans by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to trim costs by £220 million a year. Barrister Caroline Warwick QC, played by Frances Barber, said: ‘I am sick and tired of being exhausted because there is no legal aid for juniors, which means I stay up all night every night working on complex trials only to be told I’m a fat cat by a government full of the fattest cats in the history of fatness.’ The cost of legal aid led to accusations that ‘fat cat’ lawyers are enriching themselves at the taxpayers’ expense. But some leading legal figures  say the cuts will see the less well-off lose access to justice. Both Maxine Peake, who stars as the show’s campaigning  barrister Martha Costello, and Peter Moffat, its writer and creator, have taken part in protest marches against the reforms. On Friday, Miss Peake and Moffat – a former barrister – launched a fresh assault on the policy when they appeared on BBC Breakfast to talk about  the decision to end Silk after three series. A 'save legal aid' protest logo, worn by those who have taken part in the marches . Peake wore a Save Legal Aid badge during the interview and Moffat described the proposed cuts as ‘deep and savage’. Bob Neill, the Conservative vice-chairman and MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, said he would be raising his concerns with the BBC Trust tomorrow. A BBC spokesman said: ‘While Maxine and Peter are both keen advocates of the legal profession any personal views that they have relating to this matter are separate from the drama, characters and the BBC.’","Tory MPs furious that courtroom drama took stance against legal aid cuts .

"By . Chris Hastings . and Peter Henn . A manhole cover designed by Antony Gormley, one of Britain’s most celebrated sculptors, has been stolen after being praised in a blog. Gormley, 63, who is best known for his Angel of the North statue, created the distinctive cover for a street in Peckham, South London, where it remained for a decade. But the iron plate, designed around the artist’s feet, was stolen after a blogger gave details of where it was. Ian Mansfield, 44, included a picture of the cover and went on to describe how he felt standing on it. One-in-a-million: The Antony Gormley manhole cover before it was stolen . After: The replacement that was placed in the hole after the theft . Writing on his IanVisits blog, Mr Mansfield, who lives in London’s Docklands, said: ‘On a small side street in deepest Peckham, without notice or warning, can be found a piece of Antony Gormley art work. Hundreds of cars drive over it every day.’ He added: ‘You can find the spot for deep contemplation on the junction between Maxted Road and Sandison Street.’ It is not clear whether the thief read the blog but several people have posted complaints questioning the wisdom of drawing attention to its location. One wrote: ‘Nice work telling everyone exactly where it was with such a detailed map. I hope you are pleased with yourself.’ Fame: Antony Gormley working on some his sculptures at his studio . Another described Mr Mansfield as a ‘dumbo’ and urged him to use some common sense in future. A spokesman for Thames Water, which commissioned Gormley  to create the piece, said: ‘We’re appalled Antony’s manhole cover has been stolen. We’ve since gone out and put a new bog-standard cover down, but his was one-in-a-million – in fact, more than one-in-a-million, as we have 1.2 million manhole covers across our region.’ He added: ‘We’re determined to track down whoever did this and get back what is ours.’ Mr Gormley declined to comment last night.

"By . Peter Henn . Two Britons appeared in court yesterday charged with travelling to Syria to engage in acts of terrorism. Yusuf Sawar and Mohammed Ahmed, from Handsworth, Birmingham, were arrested at Heathrow on Monday after arriving on a flight from Turkey. The men, both aged 21,  who are charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts contrary to section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006, were remanded in custody by Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London. Two British men aged 21 have been charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts after allegedly planning to travel to Syria (file photo) It is alleged the offence took place ‘on or before May 15, 2013, with the intention of committing acts of terrorism’ and that they ‘planned and travelled to Syria, via Turkey, in order to engage in acts of terrorism’. The pair, who spoke only to confirm their names and dates of birth, will next appear at the Old Bailey on January 31. In a separate development,  it was disclosed yesterday that two French schoolboys have travelled to Syria to become  Al Qaeda fighters. The youngsters, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not arrive at school on January 6, instead using a credit card to book flights to the Middle East. Yusuf Sawar and Mohammed Ahmed, from Birmingham, were remanded in custody by Westminster Magistrates' Court in London . The father of one of the boys appealed for their return, saying his son had been lured into extremism via the internet. He said: ‘My son was brainwashed online. There were exchanges on Facebook, and he watched videos about the war in Syria.’ The father, who spoke to his son on Tuesday, added: ‘He said we wouldn’t hear from him for a month, if he was still alive. He was with Al Qaeda fighters. During the call he talked about the fighters as his brothers.’ l The main Syrian political opposition group in exile,  the Syrian National Coalition, last night agreed to attend internationally sponsored  peace talks in Switzerland  on Wednesday.

But Monty Python have finally succumbed to the censor. They gave one of their songs a politically correct makeover for the troupe’s sold-out reunion shows at London’s O2. Eric Idle sings the new, albeit slightly censored version of 'I Like Chinese' at the O2 . The stars dropped potentially offensive lines from their 1980 song I Like Chinese. In the original version of the song, written by Eric Idle, he used to sing: ‘I like Chinese, I like Chinese, They only come up to your knees, Yet they’re always friendly, and they’re ready to please.’ But in the version performed at the O2, Idle now sings: ‘I like Chinese, I like Chinese. They copy everything they sees. But they’re up on the boom so they’ll do as they please.’ Fellow Python Terry Jones said: ‘Eric obviously knows why he changed the lyrics. I suppose it was dropped for reasons of political correctness. ‘Why keep singing “they only come up to your knees”?’ Terry Gilliam pictured on July 1 performing the classic Gumbys sketch for their new live show at the O2 . Jones said the changes had not been an issue for the rest of the team and added that they had been made ‘silently’. Idle wrote the song for the group’s 1980 Contractual Obligation album. He has also dropped the lines ‘They are cute and they are cuddly and they’re ready to please’ and ‘There’s 900 million of them in the world today. You better learn to like them; that’s what I say’. The song is one of the musical highlights of the show and is performed with elaborate sets and backing dancers in oriental costume. Idle is later joined on stage by his fellow Pythons who sing the chorus in Mandarin. New additions to the song include the line: ‘I Like Chinese, I Like Chinese. They’re still a little Communese [sic], But Americans don’t need to fret now China has bought all their debt.’ The five remaining members are, from left: Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese . The ten-night run of shows still contain explicit, bad language and jokes about the Catholic church, including the song Every Sperm Is Sacred. Some critics have dismissed the show’s scantily clad female dancers as sexist and some of the portrayals as homophobic. In the past the stars – who provoked uproar with their 1979 film The Life Of Brian – have strongly resisted attempts to censor their work. The controversial song has always been something of a guilty pleasure for fans, and one tweeted: ‘I’m surprised Monty Python sang I Like Chinese but thankfully the lyrics have been updated!’ But comedian John Sessions said he would have preferred the original version. ‘I think they should have left it exactly as it was. There is far too much PC piety around.’ Eric Idle was unavailable for comment last night.","Group renowned for cheerful social commentary succumbs to the censor .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Many parents hope to protect their offspring from future heartbreak by imparting a few hard-won pearls of their own wisdom. In Amanda Holden's case, her relationship advice to her daughters is simple - whatever you do, don't follow the example of your mother. The Britain's Got Talent judge has revealed her regrets over her first failed marriage, saying she hopes they settle down with the right man much earlier than she did. Motherly advice: Britain's Got Talent Judge Amanda Holden seen leaving Sushi Samba with a friend in London . Now aged 43, she fears it will be another 40 years before she becomes a grandmother if her children Lexi, eight, and Hollie, two, leave motherhood as late as she did. She told Woman & Home magazine [subs, must credit]: 'My big hope for them is that they find the person they want to be with first time. I think you can handle most things if you've got a happy family life. 'But I said to Chris the other day I might be 80 when I have my first grandchild if Lexi waits till she's 40. 'So the only advice I'll give them about men is “Don't get married before you are 24, but please have children before you're 25'.' Miss Holden - who was 34 when she had the first of her children - married their father, record producer Chris Hughes, in 2008. Before that, she was better known for her disastrous relationship with comedian Les Dennis. The couple wed in 1995 when she was just 24, but their marriage was rocked in 2000 when it was revealed she had an affair with actor Neil Morrissey. Mr Dennis stayed with her for two years, only for her to leave him when he also admitted having an affair with a mutual friend. After she divorced him in 2003, Miss Holden described his infidelity as her 'passport out' of the relationship. Amanda Holden on the cover of this month's Woman and Home magazine . Now, she says her only regret is they did not split much earlier. She said: 'We had a good six years but then one of us should have said, ""This isn't going to work anymore."" I regret how badly he came off. When I first married Les I think I was seen by some as a gold digger and I'd go out of my way to change opinion. 'But my view now is that you just have to give yourself a break and accept that not everyone will like you. I mean, I find myself irritating sometimes - so other people must too.' Amanda fears it will be another 40 years before she becomes a grandmother if her children Lexi, eight, and Hollie, two, leave motherhood as late as she did . Amanda revealed her regrets over her first failed marriage, saying she hopes they settle down with the right man much earlier than she did . She added: 'I had divorced a national treasure and very publicly had an affair, so I think a lot of people must have thought I was a bit of a minx - not least because if you're a woman you're somehow not allowed to do that kind of thing. 'But the reality is I am not that girl and have always been very much a relationship person. I could have let the country when I divorced from Les. But I didn't want to be dictated to. My Mum always said I'd rather walk into trouble than run away from it.' Miss Holden described Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell, 54, as her 'on screen husband', and said he had taught her never to admit weakness in her relationships. She said: 'Simon gave me some really good advice once. He said “Have you ever been dumped?' So I said, “Oh God yeah - where do I start?'. And he said, “Let me give you a tip: Never admit you've been dumped.' 'So about two years later he said, “Have you ever been dumped Amanda?' and I went “No, never' And he started laughing his head off and I said, “You trained me well, darling. He says my backbone is made of steel. I'd say it's more like titanium.'' * For the full interview see the June issue of Woman & Home, on sale now.","BGT judge reveals her regrets over her first failed marriage .

"By . Spencer Matthews . Hollywood movie star Sylvester Stallone was in town for the red carpet premiere of his latest installment of the explosive blockbuster franchise The Expendables III. The first half decent red-carpet event in the capital for a few weeks and my agent got me a couple of tickets and told me I should show my face. A gang of us met up at the W Hotel bar just around the corner from the Leicester Square Odeon – Hugo Taylor, Emma Miller, Fran Newman-Young and her sister Olivia. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Red carpet ready: Spencer is joined by (left to right) Olivia, Fran and Emma for the premier of the Expendables III . The dress code was 'Ready for action' and the ladies didn’t disappoint. Fran wore a gold Alice + Olivia dress, Olivia NY an acid yellow H&M gown and both were wearing beautiful jewellery by designer Vashi Dominguez. Fran rocked a diamond circle pendant and Olivia wore a diamond and ruby pendant in 18K white gold with matching earrings. When we were on the red-carpet I bumped into top chat show host Jonathan Ross. I felt I had to apologize for my slightly boorish attitude when on his show last – I had referred to him as Big JR, which was more than a tad presumptuous given our relative positions in the TV pecking order – but he said he had thought it was funny and that I was welcome to come on his show any time. We made our way up the red carpet passing Wesley Snipes and Jason Statham along the way and Stallone was on the balcony waving to the crowd. It was slightly surreal. Spencer caught up with chat show host Jonathan Ross and apologised for his behavior at his last interview . Dazzling dresses: Olivia (left) wore an acid yellow gown from H&M and Fran wore a sequin mini-dress from Alice + Olivia . The film itself is a high-octane 120 minutes of explosions and gunfire punctuated with some classic one-liners from the stellar cast. Its saving grace is that it never takes itself too seriously and Wesley Snipes even finds himself able to poke fun at his recent incarceration for tax evasion. Two highly enjoyable hours later and we made our way over to the after-party at DSTRK nightclub – and to the biggest collection of models you will see this side of London Fashion Week. A dozen stunning six foot plus Amazons in body-con dresses and killer heels were at the back of the club on the owner’s table. Getting friendly? Spencer hung out with model Lily Osborne at the premier's after party . I went over to say hello and here I am pictured with Lilly Osborne, who has just shot a big lingerie campaign – so you will soon be seeing her scantily-clad body on 20-foot high posters all over the UK. She was slightly taller than me with heels on but it didn’t bother me. We left at around midnight and there were still huge queues of fans outside the venue - clearly to see the film stars leave, not me. My birthday was this week and I celebrated it with family and friends – and a hair-cut called the Extreme Pompadour. I felt the need for a change and it’s pretty brutal short back and sides and long quiff on top. Mine was skillfully performed by hair-stylist Jennie Manzi at Paul Edmonds salon. Old pals: Spencer received a big birthday kiss from his ex co-star Hugo Taylor . New look: Spencer describes his new haircut as the Extreme Pompadour . I’m 26 now and I’m told that is the age when you truly become a man. Let’s see if this new-found wisdom takes effect now. I dined with my family at Il Trillo restaurant in Chelsea and then moved on to the Hollywood Arms across the road for drinks with friends. I received a birthday kiss from good friend Hugo Taylor and congratulations from the rather gorgeous Lauren Frazer-Hutton. I wish it had been the other way round. Made In Chelsea NYC starts this Sunday at 9pm on E4 and the whole cast watched the first episode at a screening. Worthy cause: (Left to right) Stevie, Spencer, Jamie and Proudlock promote the Invictus Games that will run from 10th-14th September . The MIC cast pose in Invictus Games t-shirt - an event that supports war veterans and the Armed Forces (back row from L-R) Fran, Binky, Lucy, Anna-Louise (Binky's sister) Cheska and Louise (Front row as before) Loads more new love interests, rows, intrigue and slightly awkward silences all set within the backdrop of one of the world’s most amazing cities. After the screening I got everyone to put on an Invictus Games T shirt – this incredible event at the Olympic Arena in Stratford, London from the 10th to 14th of Sept will have injured servicemen and women from 14 nations taking part in sporting competition. The event, is being championed by Prince Harry and is going to be an amazing spectacle showing our inspirational Armed Forces personnel and veterans who put their lives on the line for our country. You can buy tickets for the Invictus Games at invictusgames.org It’s only £12.85 per person so it’s a total bargain. Lots of love, Spencer.","Spencer has settled back into the high life attending a premier this week .

"By . Chris Hastings . and Peter Henn . It's the question fans have been asking since current Doctor Who Matt Smith announced he was quitting the Tardis: Is it time for a woman to take on the famous role? Certainly not, according to former Doctor Peter Davison, who insists the character should always be a man. Davison, who appeared in the BBC sci-fi drama between 1981 and 1984, said: ‘I’ll probably get into trouble for saying this but I think it sort of has to be a man. Man's job: Peter Davison appeared as the Doctor, right, in the BBC sci-fi drama between 1981 and 1984 . ‘To have a female would be like having a female James Bond. It would be a rather odd thing.’ Despite his comments, a number of actresses, including Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, are being linked with the iconic role. Since first appearing on our television screens in 1963, Doctor Who has been played by 11 men but never a woman. Davison, whose actress daughter Georgia played a female Time Lord on the programme in 2008, added: ‘If you suddenly make the Doctor a woman, you effectively say, “Well, let’s give him a sex change” and I don’t think that works. ‘I’m very happy for there to be a female Time Lord. I think my daughter is one and she is shooting around the universe now.’ Female contender: David Tennant with Davison's daughter Georgia, right, in a 2008 episode of Doctor Who . Some fans believed that Georgia, 28, . who is married to former Doctor David Tennant, could have been made a . future Doctor but her character has not been seen since. Davison’s . comments come as the show prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary . with a special edition starring both Smith, who announced in June that . he was quitting the role after Christmas, and Tennant. The actor, 62, also claimed that powerful BBC figures were opposed to bringing the show back in 2005 after an absence of 17 years. His remarks will be seen as a swipe against Michael Grade, who was BBC1 controller when Doctor Who was taken off air in 1988 and who was back as BBC chairman when it returned. Davison said: ‘It went off the air, not because the viewing figures dropped off, but because the powers that be at the time didn’t want it on air. They wanted to get rid of it, they didn’t like it. ‘I think nothing annoyed them more than when it came back as the most prestigious BBC programme  at that time – it still is, in fact.  Especially as one particular person was there when it came back.’ Surprise: Baker's trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show . Former Doctor Who Tom Baker has revealed how his trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show. Baker, the longest-serving Doctor, having played him from 1974 to 1981, said: ‘The producers looked at some kind of French artist and they decided that I should look like that. ‘We bought the wool and gave it to a woman called Begonia Pope and said, “Knit me a scarf with this sequence of colours.” ‘A few weeks later we went to her house and we couldn’t get in because of this bloody scarf. It was all over the place. 'I laughed, but the designer said, “Let’s keep it like that,” so we did.’","Ex-Doctor Peter Davison insists the character should always be a man .

"By . Spencer Matthews . I've got a brand new training method for my abs and pecs – firing 70mph baseballs at them. Sounds a bit painful and, frankly, it is. You simply stand in the nets in front of a baseball pitching machine and take it like a man when the ball hits you in the chest. If you don't believe me watch the video below. I don't think it's likely to catch on as a new fitness craze - and kids please don't try this at home. Although, thinking about it, it's unlikely that many people will own a baseball pitching machine – but you know what I mean. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Spencer says goodbye to the Big Apple in true New York style with a trip along the Hudson: Left to right, Spencer, Proudlock, Binky, Lucy, Stevie and Sam . Seriously though, Jamie and I have been hitting the gym, or rather working out on our roof. Interval training, press-ups, squats, burpees, sits, leg raises, crunches, swimmers – basic gymnast conditioning exercises, high intensity with only 10-20 second rests in between reps. I pop a couple of Forza T5 Super Strength in the morning then do 50 minutess of this physical torture on the roof. Only problem is that we've had to do this pretty early in the morning as there's been a crazy heat-wave over here up to 30C. One time we tried the work out at midday and nearly collapsed from dehydration. You can see me and Jamie post-work out with TV presenter Marissa Montgomery. Spencer and Jamie have been keeping up their fitness levels in NYC, here they are pictured post work-out with TV presenter Marissa Montgomery. So my advice is if you want to do the Forza high-intensity circuits – do it early in the morning or late afternoon. Then you will be ready for a bit of body baseball. So we've finished our job in the Big Apple making Made In Chelsea NYC. All is left to do is the wrap party – which is clearly going to be huge – I'll let you know all about that next week, if I remember any of it. Everyone from the cast is de-mob happy now and looking forward to the last few days in this amazing city. Enjoying the sun? Jamie takes a selfie in the New York heat . Spencer and Proudlock let their hair down during their final days in New York . We have made an amazing TV show and we've made some new best friends here. Morale couldn't be higher here and there's been a lot of fun and light-hearted japery - you can see me having a floppy hair length competition with Oliver Proudlock (he won clearly and he's very Proud of his locks, geddit?)

"By . Spencer Matthews . This week I've come back to reality with a bit of bump and realised it's time for a healthier outlook on life. I came back from Secret Garden Party music festival on Monday feeling a bit jaded and in need of a detox. So I've decided to try to cut back on the drinking and I am starting back with my gym instructor Shaun Stafford next week. Scroll down for video . On the wagon: Spencer says he is laying off alcohol and turning to shellfish for his protein-fueled health kick . Day one of my new health kick and on Tuesday I managed to catch up with my old pal Hugo Taylor at Harvey Nichols Fifth Floor restaurant. It was a beautiful summer's day and it was so tempting to join him for a glass or three of a fine rose, but I resisted and opted for a fresh mint tea. You can see me pictured wearing a pair of Hugo's very high-end Taylor Morris sunglasses - he has them on sale at Harvey Nics and they've been doing a roaring trade since actress and model Suki Waterhouse was spotted wearing a pair. Hugo was impressed by my abstinence but wasn't too confident that my new 'tea-total' regime would last to the end of the week. Spencer enjoyed a trip to The Secret Garden Party Festival this week, wearing a rather original pink hat . We parted company and I decided that a late lunch was in order at Colbert in Sloane Square - and opted for a dozen Jersey Rocks oysters, with a classic Mignonette sauce and Tabasco. They went down beautifully with a spicy Virgin Mary and after a dozen of these I was absolutely buzzing. These whopping great molluscs are basically just a protein delivery device and with a relatively low amount of fat. I was raring to go after 12 of them - no wonder, as they're thought to be a natural aphrodisiac. Spencer caught up with his old pal Hugo Taylor and decided to forgo his usual tipple of rose and opted for mint tea instead . Finally wrapped the week off with a trip to Ping in Earls Court, the west London venue that combines nightclubbing with Ping Pong. I may have had a couple of drinks but it's all in moderation. All the gang were there - Binky, Hugo, Louise Thompson and Josh Coombs - and they were playing a few games of Beer Pong. It has pretty simple rules: you line up a few glasses of beer at the end of each table and if the ball lands in the glass you drink the beer. Thankfully I'm pretty good at table tennis so I stayed fairly sober but I have a major problem next week as it's my birthday - Wednesday 6th if you'd like to wish me well - and I may have to take one day out of my new monk-like existence. Until then, it's all oysters and early nights. Well up to a point… . Lots of love, Spencer.","Spencer has come back to reality after living the high life in New York .

"By . Spencer Matthews . This week Jamie Laing and I have knuckled down to work quite a bit. The honeymoon period with New York City is over and we've had to get down to some hard graft. Don't get me wrong, I realise that hard graft for us is probably not as strenuous as someone doing a double shift in a factory, but it's all relative. There was still one social commitment that I had to make before Jamie and I decided to become monks – the birthday party of our good friend Emma Miller. The Made in Chelsea stars took a break from filming for Emma Miller's (second left) birthday. From left, Mark-Francis, Emma, Jessica Stam, Nina Dobrev, Jessica Szor . I need to be clear now that we are just good friends – not friends with benefits, or boyfriend/girlfriend – just good friends. Unlike Billy Crystal's character in classic late 80s film When Harry Met Sally, I do think that it's possible for men and women to be friends without sex getting in the way and confusing things. I realise most people may find this hard to believe. The party started at Tao restaurant, an amazing 200-seater gastrodome in the Meatpacking district of town. Tao is one of the hippest restaurants in NYC and everyone who is anyone goes there. We passed Charlize Theron on the way in – and she looks even more incredible in the flesh than on film. Sadly New Yorkers like to confuse us foreigners and often when a restaurant is a hit they will have an uptown and downtown version at either sides of Manhattan island. Sadly we went to the wrong one which meant we were quite late. Distinguished guests: Spencer says that Mark-Francis was looking impeccably dressed (left) and Emma made friends with Canadian model, Jessica Stam . Party time: From left to right - Mike Miller, Nina Dobrev, Jessica Szohr, Emma Miller, Kellan Lutz and Jessica Stam . By the time we arrived the food was already served - spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice, Thai crab cakes with mango chilli sauce, sashimi of Kobe beef with fresh wasabi sauce, it was superb and there was lots of it. We sheepishly filled the two empty seats at the table and introduced ourselves quietly. I've got to say La Miller is surprisingly well connected in NYC – at the table were actress Nina Dobrev from Vampire Diaries and Jessica Szohr from Gossip Girl, next to them was Twilight and Expendables star Kellen Lutz, supermodel Jessica Stam, professional racing driver James Rossiter, Emma's brother Michael, and of course the wonderful Mark Francis Vandelli looking impeccably dressed as always. I was a bit stumped as to what to get Emma as a present. I thought of getting some gorgeous Bluebella lingerie - Binky Felstead has just modelled for them and the collection looks amazing - but giving underwear might seem a bit presumptuous. Party on: As the night wore on, Spencer and Jamie ended up at a private house party, they weren't sure whose house it was but the owner had won an Emmy . You can never go wrong with jewellery however - like handbags and shoes, it's something a lady can never have enough of. At first I considered a pearl necklace but thought this may a bit over the top - we are only friends, after all. In the end I opted for some exquisite Vashi.com diamond and freshwater pearl earrings in 18K white Gold. They were well received. A couple of espresso martinis had us in the mood for dancing and we were whisked off to the Tao nightclub next door. The venue was amazing - high ceilings, amazing Japanese artwork and the feel of a 19th century Hong Kong opium den. It was around 1am when we arrived and the place was jumping. We were given one of the best tables in the house because we were with A-list actors and actresses. As the night wore on everyone started to get a bit loose and Jamie almost thought he was on a promise with Nina Dobrev but she jumped into a cab at 3am and broke his heart. The party started to thin out and so it was time to shoot to the after-party at a private house. I'm not entirely sure where it was, or whose party but whoever owns the place has won an Emmy – the American equivalent of a TV BAFTA (which by the way I've won). Hopefully if the the MIC NYC show transfers to US TV, I'll get to hold one of these for real as well. Lots of love, Spencer.","Spencer has FINALLY knuckled down to some hard work in NYC .

"By . Spencer Matthews . The Final MIC wrap party in New York  last week must have been a big one - neither me or Jamie have much of a recollection of what happened which must be a good sign. Anyone who was there please tweet any details to @spencergeorgem so that we can piece the night together. But you know you've had a good party when you check your phone the next day and there's a shot of you in a swimming pool with a guy playing a sousaphone. Felling jazzy: Spencer says that he found this photo in his phone the morning after his final party in New York . At least, I'm looking in good nick with my kit off (thanks to Forza T5 supplements). Anyway, back in the UK finally and ignoring the jet lag I went straight out clubbing. Tuesday night is the new Friday in London (well for summer at least) and Boujis club in South Kensington was packed. I loved NYC but it was great to be back. The club was full with beautiful people - and there were quite a few women coming up to welcome me back to London with a kiss. Which was nice. Welcome back: Spencer is settling right back into Chelsea life . Right at home: Some female admirers plant a kiss on Spenny's much obliging cheeks . I also hit the Secret Garden Party - it's a music festival near Cambridge, a boutique younger version of Glastonbury. I went with Jamie Laing and it was serious back to basics after the luxury of New York living. We were definitely not Glamping and opted for a basic canvas tent - no luxury yurt for us! However, we managed to slighly bale out of our accommodation and make some very good new friends in a neighbouring tent. In the meantime we've had some face painting done courtesy of some lovely people from London Zoo. By the way before some wag makes a wisecrack, I've been painted as tiger not a cheetah.

"By . Spencer Matthews . You should never embarrass your mates to get in with a girl. It's one of the golden rules of the brotherhood. The un-written rule, the sacrosanct tenet of the fraternity but  I sort-of broke the rule this week but I've got to say it was worth it when I got on over on Jamie Biscuits (my father's nickname for Laing, heir to the McVitie's biscuit empire). We were at a rather swanky pool party at the Dream hotel in Downtown, West 16th Street. So fancy: Spencer was joined by Jamie and Emma Miller at a swanky pool party at the Dream Hotel . Lots of New York socialites sitting round the pool looking uber cool. Everyone was subtly checking each other out and I was sat on a sun-lounger with the lovely Emma Miller and Jamie perched perilously close to the edge. I moved my hand over to Jamie's shoulder barely concealing the fact I was already cracking up with laughter. Applied a bit of pressure – but he still hadn't worked out my cunning plan. Spencer couldn't help but give Jamie a dunking as he perched temptingly close to the pool's edge . Cracking up: Spencer had uncontrollable belly laughs as Jamie landed head first in the pool . Drying off: Spencer said that Jamie saw the funny side of his prank (eventually) Then push came to shove and my blond chum flipped off his lounger and straight into the pool in the most dramatic fashion possible. I could see quite a few of the other guests stifling a laugh but I was in fits. Uncontrollable belly laughs. Ms Miller was also amused. Luckily Jamie is one of the easiest going blokes in the world and he saw the funny side – and it gave him the opportunity to show off his new buff physique as he took off his soaking wet clothes. (Clearly his new work out regime with the MyCloudTag fitness app and my Forza T5 Super Strength tablets is working.) Spencer described the rave as a 'friendly riot' Mates: Spencer made a few new friends at the party in Queens . Friends again: Jamie appeared to have forgiven Spencer for his pool prank . Later in the week we got a taste of what I imagine an Acid House rave was like. Clearly I'm far too young to have experienced this myself, I was born in 1989, the year after the second summer of love so all I know of that era of youth culture is from grey-haired former ravers who bang on about those halcyon days when everyone discovered love for others via the magic of house music and smiley T-shirts. But after experiencing a packed open-air dance event at the MoMA PS1 in Queens I kind of got what everyone was on about. I can only liken it to being in a friendly riot. A couple of thousand New Yorkers packed into a small space, with some serious eccentric types dotted around. No attitude or bad vibes just a lot of love in the room, man. All the best, Spencer.","Spencer attended a swanky pool party in NYC this week .

"By . Spencer Matthews . This week has been like, so hot. Literally. There's been a mini heat wave in New York City and so we were in dire need of some alfresco pool action in the city. Thankfully my friend Stacey Jackson (who is a native New Yorker) was on hand to gain Jamie Laing and I access to a private pool on the roof of an achingly hip members club. You had to be up early to get a sun-lounger (they were all gone by 8am) and they were like gold dust. During the day I watched a couple of women hovering by one pool chair for over an hour because they believed it was about to be vacated. Sun's out, guns out: Spencer and Jamie enjoyed a spot of sunbathing this week at an exclusive members rooftop pool in NYC . Luckily our friends had managed to hold us a couple of seats, and so we lay down in the sun and surveyed the surrounding company of stylish 20 and 30-something hard-body creatives from behind a pair of dark Wayfarers. Thankfully I'm in pretty good nick at the moment, thanks to the bumper supply of Forza T5 supplements that I brought out with me, so it was a case of, 'Sun's Out, Guns Out' round the pool. The drinks started flowing and it was a beautiful day with an ugly bar bill at the end of it. Spencer with singer Stacey Jackson, the handy name-drop that got him access to the private club . We were meant to have an early night but someone would have had to handcuffed us to the bed to make us miss the Governor's Ball after-show party. I was glad at that point that we hadn't brought the Lovehoney handcuffs with us to NYC. (We would never have got them through airport security anyway). The party was at the Electric Rooms club and I bumped into Kills guitarist Jamie Hince fresh from his main-stage performance at the event. He was on good form but sadly Mrs Hince (none other than Kate Moss) wasn't at the party. United nations: Spencer is keen to enhance the 'special relationship' between the UK and the USA . We managed to make a quite few new American friends at the bar further enhancing the 'special relationship' between our two great nations. It's now the end of the week and I'm concerned that I've not planned ahead for Father's Day. Unfortunately it's not likely that I'm going to be able to see him on the day, so online delivery from high-end toiletries retailer escentual.com looks the best option. First I thought of some LAB Series Age-Less Face Cream, I use it quite a bit,  but dad's generation might still not be ready for a daily moisturizer.

"By . Spencer Matthews . So now I'm over in New York City, the Big Apple, and as Sting would say: 'I'm a legal alien, I'm an Englishman in New York.' Certainly an English gentleman is viewed as a bit of breed apart over here - but it's very much in a good way. Being well spoken and using received pronunciation still gets you a long way in NYC. 'Oh I love your accent,' numerous attractive females have remarked since I've arrived. Right at home: Spencer Matthews is enjoying his time in the Big Apple . I thought all that stuff was just in films but clearly New York women really do respond to cut-glass vowels and think that means you are well-educated and cultured, a gentleman who can be trusted and well-heeled and a good catch. Far be it for me to say if any of those apply to me but even if they don't I'm certainly not going to shatter any illusions. I'm even happy to play up to the Hugh Grant style foppish character if that's what's expected of me. Spencer and Jamie Laing have been living the high life as they film a special series of MIC in New York . Ex-lovers Jamie and Lucy Watson seem to be getting on famously in New York . It's really not rocket science, any British guy with half a brain could come over here and clean up by pretending to be posh – and that got me thinking about what it actually means to be posh? I recently filmed for the Michael McIntyre chat show and he said I was definitely posh. I thought that was a bit 'kettle and pot' because he sounds just as plummy voiced as I do. He grew up in Hampstead, went to a private school in St Johns Wood and then Edinburgh University - so not exactly the school of hard knocks and the university of life. But then again, I went to Eton and have quite a few friends called Rupert. Plummy chums: Spencer recently appeared on Michael McIntyre's Chat Show . But I don't think posh means much in these days of social mobility – certainly you don't need to born into it anymore, my father was born and bred in Sheffield, was originally a mechanic by trade and then worked extremely hard to make his fortune. Clearly he gave me amazing opportunities and a great education but that just goes to show that nowadays being posh is a state of mind, not something you are born into. And so I've devised a quick quiz to see if you pass the posh test... Do you describe your evening meal as: . A: Dinner . B: Tea . C: Supper . Is your room for entertaining at home called: . A: The lounge . B: The telly room . C: The drawing room . From the age of 10, have you called your mother: . A: Mum . B: Ma . C: Mummy . Do you drive: . A: An SUV . B: A family saloon . C: A Landrover . When trying to communicate an affirmative answer would you say: . A: Yes . B: Yeah . C: Yah . Would you buy your jewellery from: . A: A catalogue . B: The high street . C: A bespoke fine jeweller like Vashi.com . Do you buy your after-shave . A: The supermarket . B: From the high street . C: From high-end retailer like Escentual.com . Clearly if you've answered C to all of the above then you are posh. There's nothing to be ashamed of, just come over to New York City you may find that you're quite popular with the ladies here. Lot of love, Spencer. Spencer enjoys the view from the roof of his NYC apartment .","Spencer is enjoying the high life in NYC as he films a new series of MIC .

"By . Spencer Matthews . We are coming to the end of our New York filming for Made In Chelsea and after nearly two months in the Big Apple we thought it might be an idea if we saw the famous sights of the city. So we trawled the usual tourist traps and where else to start but the Empire State Building. We popped up to the 86th floor viewing gallery with several of the other cast members - Binky Felstead, Louise Thompson, Rosie, Proudlock Jamie, Mark Francis. I thought about re-creating the famous scene from Sleepless in Seattle with me as Tom Hanks and Binky as Meg Ryan, but there were too many people around and we didn't have a rucksack with a teddy bear in it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . I heart NYC: Spencer and the Made In Chelsea cast have been visiting the tourist sights during their last few weeks in New York . The view of the city was amazing and it was great to see all the other cast, but I can tell that quite a few of the team are getting a bit homesick now. Don't get me wrong we have had an amazing time over here but we are looking forward to being back in the UK. Also there are times when living with Jamie Laing can be a bit testing – it's like trying to keep an energetic Labrador puppy in a small flat. He's cute and loveable but he bounces off the walls with his boundless energy. He's also a bit of prankster and thought it was hilarious recently to raid my bedroom when I was asleep and film it. I've got to say I had a bit of a sense of humour failure at the time. Missing London? The cast paid a visit to the Empire State Building . New Yorkers know how to do retail. When we open a shop in the UK, someone cuts a bit of ribbon and everyone claps, takes a picture and that's it. It's a bit different in the Big Apple, they turn the volume up to 11. We were invited to a new beauty store opening on Madison Avenue by hair care range Coco Amo and this certainly wasn't a dull affair. The room was packed with top models in bikinis, myself and Jamie fitted right in and made some new friends along the way. Party on: Spencer and Jamie went to the Coco Amo launch party and fitted right in with a sea of bikini-clad models . On the downside, the diet has gone right out of the window. We are currently living off oversized New York deli sandwiches and doughnuts. My flirtation with Dunkin Donuts Strawberry frosted donuts has now become a full-blown love affair – and they contain fifteen grams of fat, 280 calories and 14 grams of sugar – it would take a 20-minute fairly high intensity run to burn off just one of those babies. We have been doing some work-outs and using the Forza T5 Super Strength to help burn the fat but we are planning to up the ante when we get back and so we've booked ourselves in to No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza for the end of July. The strict former Army PT instructors there should whip us into shape for summer back in the UK. Lots of Love, Spenny. Sweet treat: Spencer says it's hard to stick to a diet with so many foodie temptations in New York .","Spencer and the gang are approaching the end of filming in NYC .

"By . Spencer Matthews . You've always got to support your friends in life and last night was no exception - Binky Felstead, who is on the Made In Chelsea E4 TV show with me, had her book launch at top London nightclub Whisky Mist just off Park Lane. She's hugely popular on the show - and after over three years on MIC together we still get on really well (probably because she's always been sensible enough not to get romantically involved with me.) There were several of the cast in attendance, as well as friends, family, and the publishing team from Simon & Schuster to help celebrate the launch of Being Binky - 165 pages of the life and times (so far) of Alexandra 'Binky' Felstead. Last night Spencer joined Binky for the launch of her book - Being Binky . It's been a lot of hard work and effort from Binks - and the finished autobiography looks totes amaze. A lilac-coloured tome all about her life and loves, some great pictures of her growing up, plus some handy older-sister type hints on how to get through girl's issues (boys, bullies, parents, make-up etc) - it will soon be on bookshelves (this Thursday 8th May). I'm told there's quite a bit about me in the book - all glowing reports, I'm sure. Poor old Binky had a bit of bad luck with the traffic coming from filming out all the way from Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire, and so was quite a bit more than fashionably late. But she looked utterly gorgeous in a rather expensive Joseph jacket when she arrived so she was immediately forgiven. Binky's first book will give 'big sister advice' on boys, bullies and beauty . Binky was joined by MIC cast members old and new, Emma Miller (left) and Rosie Fortescue (right) and ex MIC star Ollie Locke (far right) I rocked up with Chelsea bad-boy Hugo Empson who runs the Grand Tour luxury motor event and the party started in earnest. Ciroc vodka was flowing, but Binky was being good only had the one Skinny Bitch (single vodka, lime and fresh soda) because she is currently in full work-out mode and using Forza Raspberry K2 supplements to get in incredible shape. She has a big lingerie photo-shoot for Bluebella later this week and wants to look her best, but we more than made up for her abstinence on the drink front. Of course Mummy Felstead was there to witness her daughter's proud moment . Diamond jeweller Vashi Dominguez (left) offered to make Spencer an engagement ring - Spencer politely declined as he thought he wouldn't have much use for it. His Chelsea chum Hugo Empson joined him (right) Spencer and singer Stacey Jackson wore matching leopard print accessories to the launch . Top diamond jeweller Vashi Dominguez was invited because he's loaning jewellery from his company Vashi.com for Binky's photo shoot, and he offered to make me a three-carat engagement ring - but it's unlikely I'll need one of those for at least 10 years. I had a good chat with Binky's mum Jane before Binks arrived - we always get on famously, I think partly because she knows that her daughter has got far too much sense than to get involved with a reprobate like me. Also at the party was Ollie Locke and Rosie Fortescue, looking immaculate as always - but surprisingly Rosie was wearing high street - as opposed to Bond Street- H&M skirt, Topshop top, Kooples cape (admittedly those aren't cheap), and some gorgeous Steve Madden shoes. Binky seemed to be getting along famously with latest MIC cast member Emma Miller (left) and her friend Victoria Gucci (right) On the subject of shoes and accessories, leopard print is in. Well according to singer Stacey Jackson and yours truly. We were both rocking a pair of racy print footwear and we threw some shapes when the DJ played her latest single Dance the Night Away which Binky appears in the video for. It's always a pleasant surprise to see the gorgeous Emma Miller and she wore a revealing backless dress with a buckle choker, and she was accompanied by Victoria Gucci who was showing a tasteful glimpse of décolleté. All the book-worms left and were on their way home to bed by 10pm, and so we thought it was best to take Emma and her friend Victoria and find an after-party to go. All the best, Spencer.

"By . Spencer Matthews . A change of pace was needed in my life – and a bit of detox. I am due to shoot a Made In Chelsea six-episode mini-series in New York City throughout June and July and I want to look my best. So before I started filming in the Big Apple, I decided to go the beautiful island of  St Barts for a bit of R&R. Scroll down for video . Having fun? Ollie (L), Spencer (centre) and Stevie (R) pose with a female friend during their trip to St Barts, wehre they have been detoxing and getting fit before heading to New York . Beachside: The gorgeous island of St Barths, where Spencer has been staying . I am in a . rather fortunate position that my parents own the Eden Rock hotel on the . island and so it would be a great opportunity to catch up with them and . be pampered in six-star luxury at the same time. There . were also two added benefits to travelling to the island is in . low-season (April to August) firstly all the nightclubs would be shut so . there would be little or no temptation to go large, and secondly the . most amazing villas at the hotel were less likely to be booked up. And . I was in luck – the Rockstar villa was free – 16,000 sq foot of . high-end luxury – four ultra-luxe king bed suites, black tiled pool with . outdoor Jacuzzi, terrace, kitchen, butlers, pool table and it’s own bar . and even a recording studio. Too big in fact to enjoy on one’s own so I invited Stevie Johnson and Ollie Proudlock from MIC along with me. Playboys: Made in Chelsea stars Ollie Proudlock (L) and Spencer Matthews (R) pose in the Rockstar Villa, St Barths . Enjoying the view? Spencer Matthews has been relaxing and detoxing on the Caribbean island of St Barths . They are both bon viveurs but not total party animals, so they weren’t likely to lead me astray. In fact Prooders is a bit of a gym bunny so he was likely to be a good influence on me. So my life revolved around a healthy low-carb diet, work-out sessions in the fully equipped gym in the villa and 5km morning runs around the golden sand of Saint-Jean Bay. I’m still using the Forza T5 Super Strength supplements as well and they have got me down to around 10 to 12 per cent body fat. In the photo of Proudlock and I flexing on the terrace of the Rockstar villa you can see that we are close to the shape we were in when we took the Men’s Health challenge back in November last year. Excited much? Spencer's pals and MIC castmates Proudlock (L) and Stevie (R) on plane to St Barts . Best of friends: Stevie Johnson plants a kiss on Spencer Matthew's cheek at the Eden Rock bar, left, and, right, Spencer (L) and Ollie Proudlock (R) pose with a female friend overlooking the Manhattan skyline in New York . I also wanted to get a bit of a tan during my time in the Caribbean but I took on-board the advice of beautician Debbie Thomas, who gave me a Skinbreeze anti-aging facial last week. So to prevent too much sun damage I used lotion with at least an SPF of 20. That for me is a compromise – before my Skinbreeze conversion I would use oil on my face and lemon juice on my hair, with an SPF of zero. The 10 days in St Barts flew by and before we knew it, it was time to take the propeller plane to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to fly out to New York. BTW – this is pretty hairy for even seasoned flyers and I could see that Stevie in particular was gripping his seat on the plane pretty tightly. I write this from my apartment in New York’s Meatpacking district. We have a well-proportioned flat and it’s a trendy part of town – think Shoreditch in London - which I’m sharing with Proudlock and Stevie. You can see us posing on the roof, and at present it’s fairly tidy but I know that’s unlikely to stay the case but so far we haven’t spent much time there. We landed at about midnight and hit the ground running, dropped off our bags and went straight out clubbing. It was incredible, great energy, full of sassy and smart beautiful women. I love New York.","In his latest blog Spencer Matthews gets in shape ahead of a New York trip .

"By . Spencer Matthews . Wikipedia recently had me down as 45-years-old. Clearly someone on the site must have thought I had aged 20 years in the past few weeks due to my nocturnal lifestyle. I've also seen some rather disparaging remarks recently on the MailOnline comments page (always very amusing) about my increasingly wrinkled visage. A bit harsh but it was fair to say that the old boat race had taken a bit of hit from three to four weeks of non-stop party action, and so I've taken on board the kind advice, and decided to take some drastic anti-ageing measures. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spurred on by some rather sharp comments, Spencer went in search of some drastic anti-aging measures . Several female friends - Louise Thompson, Binky Felstead - regularly use an anti-ageing facial called Skinbreeze, so why not? I like to think I'm in touch with my feminine side and confident enough of my masculinity to try a facial. I'm a 21st century metrosexual man, and surely enough social taboos have been broken down nowadays that a man can have regular beauty treatments and not have to keep them a secret. So I went to see top London facialist Debbie Thomas at her spa on Brompton Road above Hari's hair salon. I lay down on the beauty couch in the private treatment room and wondered what's going to happen next. Will it hurt? Is it addictive? Will I look unrecognizable afterwards? Debbie Thomas puts me at ease right away but spotted immediately that late nights and too much sunbathing had damaged my skin. But help was at hand and the Skinbreeze treatment was surprisingly relaxing. Spencer counts himself as a metrosexual man and isn't afraid of a little pampering every now and then . 1. Microdermabrasion - takes off the dead skin, red light helps repair the skin.It feels very relaxing like a face massage. I feel myself dropping off to sleep. 2. Oxygen infusion of hydrating serums - too much drinking and not enough sleep have left my skin dry as a bone, and dark circles round my eyes. This is epic and smoothes out wrinkles from the skin. 3. The Hydro Mask - it feels cool and soothing and although it did make me look like Hannibal Lecter. The mask contains moisturizing hyralonic acid and there was an amazing massage during this section. Thank you Debbie. The mask came off and I looked amazing. The girls on the show aren't going to know what's hit them, I'm going to look about 10 years younger. So that's, what, 35 now? Spencer was looking a little tired before his treatment (left) but was thrilled with the results of his Skinbreeze face mask (right) and said that he looked about ten years younger. What do YOU think? Next up was a teeth-whitening session at LoveLite clinic in Harley Street. I was in dire need of this as red wine and coffee had left my teeth far from pearly white. The treatment is a perfectly safe non-peroxide treatment, and an hour later after wearing a strange UV device in my mouth my teeth were left gleaming, and got better still a day later. No sensitivity, just really white teeth. And now to make sure that I don't age prematurely in the future I've been advised by beauty editor Emma Leslie at high-end cosmetics website Escentual.com to include these male grooming products into my daily routine. Exfoliate once a week with Clarins Men 2 in 1 Exfoliating Cleanser and wash every day with Zirh Alpha Hydroxy Face Wash, then moisturize with Lab Series Instant Skin Booster and Lab Series Pro LS All in One Face Treatment. A little under-eye boost with Nuxe Men Multi-Purpose Eye Cream. Apparently getting eight hours sleep a night, drinking plenty of water and staying out of the sun will help a lot too, but perhaps that's going a bit too far in the pursuit of beauty. Lots of love, Spencer.","Spencer has received lots of comments about his increasingly aging face .

"By . Spencer Matthews . Tonight is the start of the new series of Made in Chelsea. It’s now been nearly three years since we started out (June 2011, to be precise) and this is the seventh series of the programme documenting the lives and loves of a set of young people who live in an around London SW3. I think it’s safe to say that none of the original cast thought it would last this long when we started. Spencer in series one of Made in Chelsea, the seventh series starts tonight on E4 . I’ve certainly gone through a major transition since the start of our TV journey. Now older (obviously) and wiser (possibly) - I've been through four girlfriends, countless rows, and one slap. Physically there's been some big changes from the fresh faced lad above - I’m about a stone and-a-half lighter than my series one self, thanks to work out sessions at City Athletic gym and Forza T5 Super Strength supplements. By series two I’d realised that TV adds a considerable amount of weight to you, and I went in for a style-re-vamp - chopping off the long-hair, and beard. Spencer has made a few life style changes since series one and is now a stone and a half lighter . It took me till series six to realise that me and relationships aren’t really working on-screen or off - so this time round I’m single (or at least trying to be). No commitments, no ties - and therefore no problems with infidelity and no unpleasant moments with soon-to-be ex-girlfriends down by the Embankment. Well, that's the plan anyway. I’ve already seen the first episode (on E4 tonight 10pm) at a screening last Friday with all the cast and I don't want to give the game away with any of the storyline but it is without a doubt the best series yet. Spencer with the panel of 8 out of 10 Cats - Jon Richardson, Jimmy Carr and Alex Jones . Made In Chelsea really is at the top of its game now. There’s some great bon mots, some relationship issues (thankfully not me this time) and the occasional row thrown in for good measure. So enjoy. On the same night - by the magic of television - is my appearance on 8 Out Of 10 Cats. For those not familiar with the show, it’s a humourous panel programme about the news stories of the week and consumer surveys hosted by Jimmy Carr, also featuring comedians Shaun Lock and Jon Richardson. Current affairs is not exactly my strong suit and these guys are more than capable of ripping you apart verbally if you trip up on any subject - so this looked like it could easily turn into a car crash for me. Spencer on set of 8 out of 10 Cats that will air tonight on Channel 4 . In the end, I think I held up quite well - or they were being gentle. Conversations were totally random and ranged from my style tips to Harry Styles (he wanted to know how to create the perfect pocket square), why I bought Quorn even though I’m not a vegetarian. Sean Locke later went off a total tangent and started talking about giving therapy to fruit and glory holes in public fences (you’ll have to watch it to make sense of it.) Then disaster struck. We were nearing the end of filming the show and I thought I was home and dry and, in a school boy error, I took my eye off the ball. The final question was 'What would you like to know more about?' and the female guest comedian Katherine Ryan said with heavy sarcasm that she would like to know more about Peter Andre and what he did in his everyday home life. Spencer had a toe-curlingly embarrassing experience on the panel . I lost concentration at that moment and said, 'Perhaps you should tune into Peter Andre My Life on ITV2.' Jimmy Carr noticeably winced and said to the audience: 'I think that might be what she was getting at.' It was toe-curlingly embarrassing and I hope that the camera failed to record my epic TV fail. Hopefully there won't be any epic fails for me in series seven of Made In Chelsea - but I wouldn't bet on it. All the best, . Spencer xxx .","Made in Chelsea returns to our screens tonight on E4 .

"By . Spencer Matthews . I've done the best job of my life this week. I had to stand around in an Aladdin's Cave-like warehouse in south east London whilst several beautiful women sprayed body oil all over me. Eight hours straight of female hands roaming all over my body - rubbing lotion, teasing hair, stroking and undressing me - all for the sake of art. Well, all for the sake of my 2015 calendar anyway. Yes, I know it seems strange to be talking about next year already when we are barely into Spring but they do things well in advance these calendar people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Spencer got dirtied up for his 2015 calender shoot . In the video below you can see me being petted (not heavy) by a number of beautiful stylists and make-up ladies - to get me all oiled up and dirty. I'm well aware that they were there to do a job, but nevertheless I enjoyed the attention. That said, four weeks ago when I was given the date for this shoot I was more than a bit concerned. I was not in great nick, I'd let myself go a little bit with some pretty full-on partying and was looking decidedly lumpy and I knew that Signature Calendars and photographer Ruth Rose would want me in little more than my boxer shorts for most of the day. So I hit the gym hard and had quite a bit of help from my will power in a bottle - Forza T5 Super Strengths diet supplements. Spencer had great fun being man-handled by the women on set during his shoot . Spencer went for a mean and moody look for his calender but was happy to lark around when the cameras weren't on him . If you are going to turn around weight-loss and toning quickly you have to be pretty committed. Gym at least every other day - hour-long high intensity sessions. I went to Shaun Stafford at City Athletic in London. Go hard or go home - there's no point just standing round the gym watching other people. Push yourself, get it done, and then feel good about yourself afterwards. Ok, I'll admit I felt pretty sick a few times when I first started, but one or two T5s in the morning helped with an energy boost, and then one in the afternoon to stop snacking. Eating clean is another big must - 3 or 4 low or no carb meals a day and nothing after 7pm, and cut down on the booze and late nights (OK, I wasn't great at that). In total I dropped 12lbs in four weeks and ta-da - now I don't look to bad in a tight vest, pretending to be docker working hard down the shipyards.

"By . Spencer Matthews . Agreeing to judge the Miss Monaco beauty pageant in London in the run up to the F1 Grand Prix was not the toughest decision of my life. Let me think about this: 21 stunning women, motor racing's most glamorous event, followed by the Grand Prix's most luxurious after-party. Yes, please. The winner of Miss Monaco 2014 will have the arduous task of sitting aboard the Infiniti Podium Lounge 120ft tri-deck super-yacht to watch the race from the best spot on the race-track, with Moet champagne on tap. Next, if she isn't too exhausted, it's off to the Infiniti Podium Lounge after-party on the penthouse terrace of Zelo's nightclub. It's a tough life: This week Spencer was a judge at the Miss Monaco beauty pageant, pictured here with two contestants . Normally, this kind of A-list hospitality package would set you back around £10,000 per person, so it's safe to say that the competition is intense. As I arrived, there were gorgeous women limbering up, hair being teased into shape, vertiginous high heels attached, last-minute make-up applied and Vaseline being put on teeth - it's an old beauty pageant tip to help contestants smile easily. I also noticed a couple of rather racy ladies who were wearing little more than some bodypaint. Race-y ladies: Spencer looks pleased with himself as he poses with half-naked models . Tricky decision: Spencer had some tough choices to make - though we're sure the margaritas helped . Celebration time: Spencer couldn't help but get a taste of the action (left) and poses with the winner, Hannah Matthews (right) A few of the models came over to me before the start to say hello and bat their eyelids, but I made it clear that I would be a totally impartial judge. One of them was well over six foot in her heels and towered over me, and was kind enough to slouch in our photo together. Another contestant's boyfriend came over; he was very keen to point out that she was not single. With that in mind, I took my seat on the judging panel next to the Infiniti Podium Lounge organisers John Clayman and Tim Johnson. Spencer was joined by new Made In Chelsea flame Emma Miller . Following the eveningwear round a couple of favourites were way out in front. It was a tough decision, but in the end we decided the winner was number 14, Hannah Matthews. I think it was her impassioned speech about world peace and loving animals that clinched it - that, and the fact she was absolutely stunning. But despite all that, the real winner on the night was the gorgeous model and Made In Chelsea newcomer, Emma Miller, who rocked up near the end of the night with her friend Victoria Gucci. I invited Emma to go to the Infiniti Podium Lounge in Monaco with me, so hopefully Emma will agree to be my Miss Monaco. Lots of love, .

"By . Spencer Matthews . The invite said 'come and ride our mechanical rodeo bull and meet our gorgeous dancers' - presumably not at the same time, although that might be interesting. The prize attraction at the latest City of London drinking hole Steam & Rye is 10 foot-long tawny brown bull complete with huge horns. Weighing in at over a tonne and costing £60,000 this mechanical beast dominates the room at the 19th century Americana themed late-night restaurant and party bar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spencer rode the bar's bronco to the tune of Salt N Pepa's Push It .

Pepa, was considerably longer than the one minute 38 seconds . that I lasted. Spencer Matthews made friends with dancers Bethany Rose Harrison (centre) and Mia-Jay (right) at London's Steam & Rye . Classic Spencer: The Chelsea boy was very taken with the bar's dancers, Sophie Jennings (left) and Bethany Rose Harrison (right) It's much harder than it looks, and was quite a work-out. Perhaps not as tough as the gruelling one-hour gym sessions I’ve been doing with my Forza T5 supplements fitness trainers recently but I could still feel the burn on the thighs as the brown beast bucked me around the bar. It feels a lot faster when you're on top of the thing and there was certainly no shame in my time - a personal best for me (not hard seeing as it was my first time) - I think I could have done better if my hair hadn’t kept falling my face. The last flick of my hair with my hand left me badly off-balance which I was unable to recover from and there was a loud cheer when I made my rather undignified dismount. After that I’d built up a bit of an appetite and I had dinner with London Live presenter Luke Blackall and the sirloin steak on the menu was excellent. Although he won no free drink, Spencer was rewarded for his efforts with a steak dinner, accompanied by London Live presenter, Luke Blackall . It was very busy and with a great party atmosphere, amazingly so for a Monday night, and I can only imagine this place must be packed on Thursday, which is the city boys' big night out. After the meal I was introduced to the venue’s stunning dancers, Bethany Rose Harrison (with the cowboy hat and Daisy Duke shorts), Sophie Jennings with the beautiful red Bluebella corset and frilly Can-Can skirt, and Mia-Jay with the rather fetching tartan trews. The option of riding the bull with Bethany and Mia didn’t arise sadly. Probably due to health and safety issues, or something, but we managed to stay for a dance or three till the early hours. All the best, Spencer xxx .","Spencer was invited to ride a bucking bronco at London's Steam & Rye bar .

"By . Spencer Matthews . This week I have been invited into the world of women’s fashion and accessories.

The reason for this is simple: women can never have enough clothes and accessories. Fact. Spencer with boutique owners Phoebe Pring (left) and Lucy Olivier (right) Binky Felstead, (far left)  Rosie Fortescue (left) and Phoebe Lettice (far right)  joined Spencer at the launch . So when I was invited out to a new women’s boutique opening in Kensal Rise called Lark London I ventured along with some trepidation. The shop owners Phoebe Pring and Lucy Olivier clearly understand the female inability to resist pretty scarves, stoles, shawls, lingerie, jewellery, accessories, tops or leggings. The racks were laden with eye-catching items and clothing from new and up-and-coming designers and there were whoops of joy coming from the women thumbing through the merchandise on show. (I’m going to pop back for something for Mother’s Day this Sunday). Rita Ora's stylist, Kyle De'Volle and a friend . The fashion crowd came to the Lark launch en mass from the four corners of London. The Notting Hill set were represented by Miquita Oliver and Kyle De’Volle (Rita Ora’s stylist) wearing an uber chic Louis Vuitton jacket, Primrose Hill delegates Sadie Frost and Meg Matthews were in attendance and even a few Made In Chelsea types - Binky Felstead, Rosie Fortescue and Phoebe-Lettice Thompson had made a rare journey away from SW3 all the way to NW10. They were a super-stylish bunch of women at Lark and I felt a little bit underdressed but I had a club PA in Leeds that night and I wasn’t going to turn up to Chilli White night-club dressed in a suit. Miquita Oliver (left) Sadie Frost (centre) and Meg Mathews (right) also made an appearance . Mary Charteris on the DJ decks at Lark Boutique . It’s not that they’re not a smart bunch up in Yorkshire who don’t appreciate a good bit of tailoring. It’s just that four hours in a car up the M1 doesn’t improve the cut and look of your threads. You tend to bowl out of your car looking like you’ve just come out of a tumble-dryer. I was intending to stay just a short while in Leeds but I was distracted by an extremely gorgeous female waitress. If I was a cynical kind of guy, I would suspect that the club did this deliberately as a cunning ploy. It worked. All the best, Spencer.","Spencer attended the launch of Lark Boutique with his female co-stars .

"By . Spencer Matthews . It’s probably not the way I would have wanted to be introduced to Rita Ora – in a packed, noisy club and wearing a bright blue latex gimp mask. I should quickly explain at this point that this wasn’t one of London’s specialist underground S&M parties - it was Rita’s Superheroes fancy dress bash that I’d been invited to and had decided to go as Captain America. Rita Ora turned up as Catwoman looking so hot (right now) wearing a skin tight black PVC cat-suit, with her blonde hair swept back tight under PVC cat ears. Spencer joined a host of celebrities at Rita Ora and Chloe Green's superhero party dressed as Captain America . The party was at hip new London club Chakana. The place was packed out and everyone in the room went crazy when she arrived. Rita turned up with a good friend of mine Chloe Green and joined us at the back of the VIP room with her entourage dancing on the chairs. I had been wearing the mask for so long I kind of forgot it was still on when we were introduced. I’m sure I must have made a really good first impression wearing a mask with a big letter A emblazoned on the front. Rita Ora dazzled Spencer in a PVC Cat Woman costume where as Chloe Green seemed to have forgotten the party's theme . Rita's stylist, Kyle De’Volle, also came as cat woman and club owner, Nick House, as Indiana Jones . I don’t quite have the physique of the Captain America actor Sebastian Stan at the moment so I chose not to have the full skin-tight body suit - but I’m getting back in great shape again with help of some intensive work outs and some Forza T5 Super Strength supplements, so it’s only a matter of time. It was about 2am when 10 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne were sent over by our generous host - legendary London club owner Nick House - and the party kicked up yet another gear. Spencer with Nick House's girlfriend, Kimberley Marren . Spencer said he couldn't recognise Kimberly's superhero outfit, but says she was certainly a supermodel . Nick came as Indiana Jones and he’s pictured next to Rita’s stylist Kyle De’Volle - who also came as Catwoman. You can see me in the pictures dancing on the seats with Nick House’s stunning blonde model/actress girlfriend Kimberly Marren. She had made her own costume - I can’t remember which super hero it was but she was certainly a supermodel. Spencer partied till the early hours and was left with a superhero sized hangover . The Chakana Superheros flyer from that night . Henry Conway was also at the party - dressed as Flash Gordon and presumably he could put the price of the costume down on his expenses. Rita left about 3am via the back entrance of the club but the party carried on very late and I had a superhero sized hangover the next day. Lots of love, Spencer .","Spencer attended Chloe Green and Rita Ora's superheroes bash .

"By . Spencer Matthews . I couldn’t believe my luck when I was recently asked to be on the cover of Square Mile magazine. For anyone who hasn’t worked in the city, the luxury monthly mag is the GQ for all the city boys (and girls) – it’s all about the movers and shakers of the financial world as well as all things fashion, styling, and dining. So it came as a bit of shock to be asked to appear on the cover, as well as a great privilege – the previous cover star was Leo DiCaprio for his Wolf of Wall Street launch, so clearly they must have had a quiet month in order to choose me for the March issue. Scroll down for video . Spencer Matthews appears on the cover of this Month's issue of Square Mile, which Spencer describes as 'GQ for city boys' Spencer says that he struggled to juggle his career in finance with filming Made in Chelsea . There was of course a tenuous link for me to their world of finance - I was a trader in the city for quite a few years before I started filming for Made In Chelsea. Many city firms have first day initiations for their new apprentices to go through and Square Mile editor Mark Hedley made me reveal mine. I was pretty much the only posh bloke in a room full of Essex wide-boys. There were four guys starting on the same day and we were made to undertake a gruelling lunch challenge. It was four Big Macs, four large chocolate muffins, four cans of lager, and one conference room. We were all sat down in from of this haul of food and drink and the whole office put money in a jar and bet on who could consume the lot in the fastest time. Before filming Made in Chelsea, Spencer used to turn up at his desk job at 5:45am every morning . Only one guy in a office of about a hundred people bet on me. My . plan for the City Boy vs Food challenge was to go slow and steady, I . figured that anyone who flew out of the traps too quickly would suffer . difficulty later down the line. And . that’s exactly what happened, one took the lead very quickly but then . went green and had to retire from the race. The other two raced ahead . but I caught them both up in the final lap and managed the lot in under . 25 minutes. Spencer chats to Square Mile Editor, Mark Hedley . Spencer on the set of his cover shoot for Square Mile Magazine . I realise that it was a totally juvenile and stupid game but you might as well win it if you can. So the prize pot was left to me and the only guy who backed me, Max Keble-White, who is still a good friend to this day. (BTW - I would not advise anyone to attempt to beat this record at home, it’s not big or clever.) For a time I was trying to juggle a job in the city and filming Made In Chelsea, I was at my desk at work for 5.45am (the hours are definitely the worst thing about working in the city) finished at 6pm then onto a taxi-bike across town to Chelsea to film for the show till about 11pm. Inevitably there would be a few drinks . afterwards and what with weekend shoots and quite a bit of partying, I . found myself burnt out and also quite overweight – watch series 1 and 2 . of MIC and it’s hard to miss. The . constant snacking at work was the worst thing but I’ve now got that . under control by using Forza T5 Super Strength in the mornings and . afternoons. Spencer Matthews says he plans to work on his fitness levels in order to be beach ready this summer . I also get deliveries from Fresh Fitness Food right to my door every day which gives me nutritious low carb meals, and I’m working out a lot at City Athletic gym with my trainer, WBFF Pro Fitness world champion Shaun Stafford. I totally admit I’ve let myself slip a bit since getting in Men’s Health cover shape at the end of last year so I’m making a big push to be beach ready for summer now and I’m planning a trip to No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza to take off any rough edges. One thing I certainly won’t be doing is having four Big Macs for lunch any time soon. The full article on Spencer Matthews is in March Issue of Square Mile out now.

Tight leather . was certainly the dress code for the night – Tessa wore a leather corset and . the gorgeous MailOnline Femail Editor Deborah Arthurs wore a rather fetching . pair of leather trews. It's possible I may have been caught admiring them for a . little longer than is deemed polite. I'm pretty sure Deborah was aware of it, seeing as she . tweeted me this message earlier today: . Downstairs the luxurious Sanctum room 404 had been . transformed into the BXG suite – the King size bed was strewn with bed . restraints, leather masks, manacles and peephole bras.

"By . Spencer Matthews . The National Television Award on Wednesday were a glittering spectacle of all the greatest TV talent in the UK and I was privileged to be a guest of OK! magazine at the 02 Arena to see Ant and Dec walk away with the best presenter award for the 13th year running. The red-carpet at London’s O2 was possibly the busiest I’ve ever seen – it was crammed full of TV celebrities and literally hundreds of journalists of every description, TV, radio, magazines, newspapers, online were crammed behind the barriers and also my Made In Chelsea colleague Jamie Laing, who was pulling in a shift for Yahoo OMG! Jamie  - who my father calls 'Jamie Biscuits' because he’s heir to the McVitie’s  Digestive’s fortune - interviewed me on the carpet and I have to say he was very good. At first he put me at ease with his usual bonhomie and friendly patter and then hit me with some really tough questions. Spencer says Jamie got him to reveal too much in interview (left) on the red carpet where he also bumped into another fellow MIC star Cheska Hull (right) Jamie cheekily awarded more than one star his 'Fittest Girl' award at the NTAs including I'm a Celebrity star Amy Willerton (left) and TOWIE cast member Jessica Wright (left) He probably got me to reveal far too much and from what I heard was also equally charming with the ladies. He totally disarmed I’m A Celebrity star Amy Willerton by presenting her with his 'Fittest Girl at the NTAs Award 2014' award on the night. The award did lose a little bit of its sparkle however when Amy bumped into TOWIE star Jess Wright in the OK! Magazine suite and found that Jess also had won the Fittest award, and then they both discovered that pretty much every other gorgeous girl in a frock who had walked past him had won the award. By my reckoning he had probably given out about ten 'fittest girl' awards on the night. Just a quick tip here Jamie - if you are going to hedge your bets at a party by telling a few women that they are the best looking then you’d better be sure they aren’t going to be able to compare notes during the evening . That can tend to back-fire a bit. Spencer admits his tux was feeling a bit tight at the awards last night . Here’s just a few quick tips on how to do the classic black tie. Don’t EVER do clip on bow ties, always do up your own tie. Do wear Prince Albert slippers – and if you do opt for slippers don’t wear socks. Also the tuxedo test is always a good indicator if you have put on weight – it’s a suit that you only wear about three or four times a year and if it’s feeling a bit tight around the tummy then you know it’s time to take trip to the gym. After my extended holiday in St Barths mine was feeling a little bit tighter than I’d hoped so I will be looking to book myself into No 1 Boot Camp fairly soon for a bit of a refresher course. My holiday in St Barths was quite eventful after the New Year’s Eve celebrations and I was chuffed to receive a Facebook message from a not-so-old friend of mine, the totally stunning model Emma Miller. She was staying on the nearby island of Anguilla and remembered that my family own a hotel on St Barths and so thought it was a safe bet that I might be there. I’ve known Emma for a few years, and we met when I was promoting nightclubs in London. It was great to hear from her and it would have been rude not to agree to show her round Barts for a few days. Just friends: Spencer and Emma first sparked romance rumours with this Instagram picture last week . Spencer says that both being on holiday with friends made for a fun break . She was on holiday with a friend, as was I, so we made a very entertaining foursome to go out to the beaches and for dinners. Now I realise that given my previous history some DM readers may find this hard to believe but we were only 'just good friends'. Emma is an utterly lovely girl and I hope that I see her again soon, but sadly our little holiday has now run out and she left to do a big modeling job in New York and I’m back filming for Made In Chelsea. All the best, Spencer xxx .","Spencer attended the National Television Awards on Wednesday night .

"By . Spencer Matthews . So I’m single again. I’ve split up with Stephanie Pratt, whom I had been dating for about four months. The reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too fast from the dating stage to the living-together stage. This was partly because Steph is from Los Angeles and I didn't want her to incur the huge costs of living out of hotels in London, but clearly there was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic. Over: Spencer Matthews explains why he and Stephanie Pratt broke up after dating for four months . Whenever any girlfriend comes into a tight group of friends it’s difficult but when they have practically no shared experiences or associations it’s almost impossible for the relationship to thrive – and that is what started to happen with me and Stephanie. Perhaps if it wasn’t for the cabin fever we suffered in my apartment in Chelsea the relationship might have endured, after all Stephanie is stunning, classy, witty, clever and has a great sense of style – even if it was utilised to veto several of the items of clothing in my wardrobe (see previous weeks’ blogs). Too much, too soon: 'There was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic,' explains Spennie . And although viewers of Made in Chelsea may not have seen this side of her towards me on yesterday’s E4 show she is also warm, caring and affectionate, and I do hope we can remain friends. The boys seemed to receive the news of my split with a stunned silence (or fear) and there was a trademark Made In Chelsea pause when I made the announcement at dinner. One plus point from the dinner was that even Andy was forced to admit of me, 'I don’t love the guy but you can’t fault him, he always wears a nice suit.' Striking: Ever the style chameleon, Spencer showcases his fashion credentials in a mustard jacket on Monday's show . Cleaning up: Stephanie finds offensive jacket in Spencer's wardrobe, which goes straight in charity shop pile . My mustard coloured suit was certainly a bit of a departure from the rather more sober slate grey numbers the other boys were wearing on the night and before we sat for dinner, we said a quick Latin grace: Benedictus, Benedicat per Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. All the Eton boys (Proudlock. Stevie and I) know this well as it is said at every meal at school. It roughly translates to, 'May he who is Blessed bless [this food] through Jesus Christ Our Lord.' And I know another wise religious passage as well, 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone.' So let’s not judge others (and by others I mean me) too harshly. All the best, Spencer xxx .","Spencer says he and Stephanie got cabin fever living together .

"By . Spencer Matthews . It seems there’s been a bit of a kerfuffle recently about my half a million pound bar bill, so perhaps I should set the record straight. Several newspapers and websites ran a story yesterday saying that I spent £488,706.08 on a night out clubbing. Not true, but it is fair to say that the rather stiff bar tab did come as a bit of a shock. I was out at Morton’s in Mayfair on Saturday night and was having a good time as always. The 2&8 Club downstairs was full with their usual well-heeled and beautiful clientele, and the drinks were reassuringly expensive and well made. Revealed: Spencer Matthews explains the true story behind THAT bar bill and reveals what each of his co-stars will be getting for Christmas . The female bartender was particularly attractive and we chatted as I ordered two Grey Goose sodas with fresh lime, and two shots of Patrone Silver Tequila. However on this occasion, trying to charm the barmaid was my downfall. She was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £48 ended up as £488,706.08. What a charmer: Trying to charm the barmaid was Spennie's downfall. She was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £48 ended up as £488,706.08, oops! My heart skipped a beat or two and I was concerned that prices had gone up a bit since I'd last been at the club only a few days before, but it didn’t take Sherlock Holmes to work out the mystery of the six-figure bill. It was resolved very quickly and we had a good laugh about it, but then I made a schoolboy error of judgement – I tweeted the bill. It was meant to be a joke. Surely no one could seriously think I would drop £500K on a round of drinks. Wrong. I woke up the next day to over 3,000 retweets, and several people berating me for such an outrageously extravagant waste of money and that I should have donated the money to the Philippines DEC campaign instead of a boozy night out. Well for once I wholeheartedly agree with my twitter critics. Typhoon Haiyan has left more than 4,000 dead and half a million people without homes. The DEC campaign is certainly a worthy cause and I am happy to match my night’s drinks bill pound for pound (the real one), and I would ask you to do the same and you can make your donations here. With what money I have left over from Saturday’s night out I’ve started to think about Christmas and I’m looking to buy gifts for all of my Made in Chelsea chums. I’m doing most of my shopping online this year, and hopefully this will help get back in their good books… . Binky Felstead is really into her beauty as readers of her DM online blog will know well, and this Guerlain Crazy Paris – ticks two of her favourite boxes, perfume and glitter. Crazy Paris It’s glittery shimmer powder for hair and skin and the black cherry and rose scent is divine. Perfect for party season (£45.90 @ Escentual.com). Is it inappropriate to buy lingerie for an ex-girlfriend? I hope not. I’m thinking of this rather beautiful Bluebella outfit for Louise Thompson. The Lavinia looks sexy and classy and a woman can never have enough lingerie. (£43 at Bluebella.com), and also this Gigi basque is gorgeous as well (£38 @ Bluebella.com). Lucky Lucy: Spencer is planning on buying Miss Watson these kinky handcuffs (R) Saucy: Is it inappropriate to buy lingerie for an ex-girlfriend? I hope not. I'm thinking of this rather beautiful Bluebella outfit for Louise Thompson . Jewellery is a big part of Rosie Fortescue’s life and she even has her own Dreamy range out, so I need to come up with something rather clever – and this Marc Jacobs Honey Solid Perfume Necklace is jewellery with fragrance all in one – is a double whammy. Its charm resembles a golden butterfly with black striped wings, which twists open to reveal the Honey solid perfume. It smells as delightful as it looks (£28.90 at Escentual.com). Yet again last night Jamie was channeling a Boris Johnson Junior coiffure, so perhaps he will benefit from this Tigi Bed Head Headrush. And it’s a snip at £7.95 at Escentual.com . Stevie Johnson is one the nicest guys I know but he needs a bit of a re-brand for the party season to get him to snare the right girl. So he’s getting the Clarins Men Grooming Essentials Gift Set (£38 at Escentual.com) Fashion faux pas: I need to Andy Jordan a a new shooting jacket - I would advise this classic waxed Barbour Steve McQueen Collection Baker Jacket, says on-trend Spencer . Andy Jordan made a slightly unusual choice of attire at our day out shooting clays on last night’s MIC show so I think I need to buy him a new shooting jacket – I would advise this classic waxed Barbour Steve McQueen Collection Baker Jacket (£299 at The Highland Store). Finally I’m giving Lucy Watson some 50 Shades of Grey handcuffs (£14.99 @ Lovehoney.co.uk). And if she behaves herself in 2014, I’ll send her the key as well.

"By . Spencer Matthews . Welcome back to the second installment of Male Online, my blog about the goings on in E4 TV show Made In Chelsea, mixed up with a few of my favourite things - adrenalin sports, fine-dining, travel, fashion, health, fitness, fast cars, love and romance. This week on Made In Chelsea I have been plagued by new girlfriend syndrome – the point when your new lady-friend decides it’s time to mould you into a better man. It starts on the little things like your wardrobe and before you know it your whole world has been turned upside down. Scroll down for video . Young love: Spencer Matthews introduced girlfriend Stephanie Pratt this week and says he has been struck by 'new girlfriend syndrome' And so it was the case for my new GF Stephanie Pratt, going through the Spencer Matthews Autumn/Winter 2013 collection with a hyper-critical eye. She did it under the sub-text of needing to free up some hangers for her own clothes (I believe IKEA do them for £1 each, and I don’t think they are in short supply) but as we don't have any Swedish flat-pack furniture stores nearby in Chelsea so it was a golden opportunity for Steph to veto a few more experimental clothing items in my repertoire. 'This can just go in the trash,' she charmingly pointed out after pulling out a leather jacket with some sparkly bits on it. 'Who do you think you are? Michael Jackson, so shocking honey.' She then placed it neatly in the charity shop pile. Top fashion: Other inspired fashion and style moves of the show included Proudlock's cutting edge new haircut the Top Knot (L) For those not familiar with the world of reality TV, Stephanie Pratt was also on the TV show The Hills in America. She is blonde, leggy, stunning and is the sister of Spencer Pratt, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year with his wife Heidi Montag. I met Spencer when studying at film school in Los Angeles years ago, and lived with Brody Jenner, who was also in The Hills. So when Stephanie planned a trip over to London, Spencer Pratt asked me to look after her for him. (The fact that I was given the task of looking after a stunning blonde was the source of some amusement for many of the cast of Made In Chelsea). In this week's MIC show there have been several outbreaks of flirtatious behaviour – Alex Mytton and Fran, Jamie and Phoebe - but it’s our love affair with fashion that I want to focus on. Phoebe was upset at Fran moving in on her ex-boyfriend Alex and vented her displeasure at Jamie, but as she opened up her heart about the painful situation, I increasingly found myself distracted by Jamie’s holographic rainbow-coloured leopard print sleeves. I found that if you stare at them for a long time they have a slightly hypnotic effect, which I’m sure Jamie used to its full advantage. Other inspired fashion and style moves of the show included Proudlock’s cutting edge new haircut the Top Knot, and Stevie’s bold orange jacket at Guard's polo. The polo was also a great opportunity to show off a wonderful collection of hats (for the girls) and sunglasses. Phoebe wore an amazing oversized hat which could have been seen from space and Fran opted for a more Boho style floppy option. As for the sunglasses, they were most often worn on top of the head as Louise did with a fabulous pair of oversized white frames, whilst Fran went for a slightly Jackie O 60's style and Cheska went for a slightly surreal pair sun protectors which appeared to have model leopards draped over the top of her frames. Hats off to her style: Phoebe wore an amazing oversized hat which could have been seen from space at the polo . I have been continuing with my psychotherapy sessions – both on-and-off air – which I’ve got to say have been increasingly productive. (BTW during my TV session last night there was a neat close of up the book Culture of Narcissism by Christopher Lasch, which was a nice touch.) This week my therapist helped me make a major breakthrough with the realisation that the feelings I hold from my exes may not be entirely appropriate, but it’s a work in progress and I’m clearly not fixed quite yet. One downside to the week however was that it ended up being rather expensive – I was left to pay for Louise’s bill at Benihana restaurant, admittedly after gatecrashing her dinner date with Andy. You might be justified in saying that I deserved that one but I also managed to pick up an eye-watering bar tab at Guard’s polo. I made the schoolboy error of keeping a card behind the bar. All my MIC chums must have heard my tab number because they all waded in and by the end of the day I practically had to take out a second mortgage to pay it off. Love and Kisses, Spencer. Therapy: This week my therapist helped realise that the feelings I hold from my exes, like Louise (pictured), may not be entirely appropriate, but it's a work in progress and I'm clearly not fixed quite yet .","Spencer says he has been plagued by new girlfriend syndrome .

"By . Julian Robinson . Customers at a Little Chef were stunned after the Duke of Edinburgh dropped in as they were enjoying breakfast. Prince Philip is said to have spent 15 minutes at the diner near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, while he was on his way to a private engagement. It is not yet clear whether he was tempted by one particular item on the menu - the chain's £10.99 'Royal Breakfast' fry-up. Customers at a Little Chef were stunned after the Duke of Edinburgh, pictured, dropped in as they were enjoying breakfast . One witness told The Sun that an 'extraordinary' convoy of upmarket vehicles descended on the car park. 'There was massive security and everyone was wondering who on earth had turned up. Then we realised it was the duke.' It is thought that some off his staff purchased coffee but that Prince Philip himself did not have anything to eat.

Welcome to his world: Along the journey we will be having a look at some of Spencer's favourite things: adrenalin sports, fine-dining, luxury travel, fast cars and some even faster women . Along the journey we will be having a look at some of my favourite things – adrenalin sports, fine-dining, luxury travel, fashion, male grooming, health, fitness, fast cars and possibly some even faster women. For those of you who don't follow the Made In Chelsea show, it’s a BAFTA award winning TV programme that is now in its sixth series on E4. It’s all about the loves and lives of a group of young people who live in and around the SW3 area of London. The show airs every Monday at 10pm on E4 for the next 12 weeks and I’m going to give you a running commentary of the main events just after it finishes at 11pm every Monday. I’m also going to do other blogs which will consist of other aspects of my life outside of the show, and those will come out most Thursdays. So here goes for my first blog about Made In Chelsea Series six, episode one. The show opens with one of my psychotherapy sessions in Harley Street. At the end of the last series I had rather acrimonious split from my then-girlfriend Lucy Watson and was accused of having fidelity issues. I thought it might be worth exploring these parts of my psyche in more depth and I have to say although I was nervous at first I feel as thought I get quite a lot from these sessions and continue to take them both on-and-off camera. Describing myself as an entirely changed man isn’t yet hugely accurate but at least I am trying to change. Slightly less therapeutic was when my ex Lucy Watson revealed on the show, that she thought I had cheated on her with at least four women. Case of the ex: 'It was apparent from yesterday evening's show that Lucy Watson isn't going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating,' observes Spencer . Now, I have to say I’m glad this is all in the past now, and have since fully apologised to her for my behaviour. Perhaps I was on the rebound from my relationship with Louise Thompson, but real feelings did develop for Lucy Watson and I certainly didn’t want to hurt her. But perhaps my wiser friends who warned me I was making a mistake rushing into another relationship so quickly were right after all. It was apparent from yesterday evening’s show that Lucy Watson isn’t going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating. She gave short shrift to a would-be new suitor at the pool-side party and the resulting scene was painful to watch. Lucy was approached by a young guy called Freddie asking her for a date. She treated him to a dose of her trademark froideur, and then nerves got the better of the poor guy, he shook Lucy’s hand a couple of times too many and she shot him down in flames, much to Rosie Fortescue’s amusement. New kids on the block: New boys Freddie and Miffy, prior to Freddie's unsuccessful attempt to get Lucy on a date . My other ex, Louise doesn't seem to have had much luck over the summer either and has managed to lose five phones in swift succession. Shares in Carphone Warehouse are in great shape as a result, but her relationship with Andy Jordan didn't appear to be doing quite so well. I paid her a visit on a purely platonic basis at the end of the episode to see how she was bearing up after a fierce row, only to face accusations of getting involved in things that are none of my business. Well she’s still a good friend and I do care about her, so what’s the crime in that? All that was left to do then was to have a nice atmospheric Steadicam shot of me walking through Sloane Square, whilst the credits rolled and the MIC theme tune 'Midnight City' by M83 played in the background. Verge of tears: Louise Thompson's cordial chat with Lucy Watson . I genuinely believe this will be the best series yet. Welcome back to Chelsea everyone. Lots of love, as always, Spencer. Xxx . PS – Catchphrase of the week comes courtesy of the wonderfully eccentric Francis Boulle. When questioned by Rosie of how he ended up naked in the pool, he coolly answered: 'Things happen'.","Spencer Matthews is our... Male Online (see what we did there?)

"By . Jennifer Newton For Mailonline . Gang members who paid impoverished Chinese villagers up to £2,500 to donate kidneys, which were smuggled around the country in boxes labelled as seafood have been jailed. Qingshanhu District People's Court heard that the gang had originally started out illegally stealing organs from patients in Nanchang, the capital city of east China's Jiangxi Province. Their organ trafficking programme proved so profitable that they moved from exclusively dealing with brain-dead patients to paying regular individuals to donate organs. Members of the gang at Qingshanhu District People's Court where they were jailed after paying impoverished Chinese villagers to donate a kidney . Their operation was so highly organised that they had even hired a ward at the Nanchang Huazhong Hospital, to carry out the operations. The kidneys were then packaged in boxes and labelled as seafood before being sent on to the end destination where they were transferred into patients who paid tens of thousands for the illegal organ. Mo Yongqing who was responsible for delivering the organs said that claiming they were frozen seafood worked even when suspicious security guards had checked the contents. But the gang were caught by adverts that they were making online with increasing frequency for new people to donate organs. The court jailed 12 members of the gang for sentences ranging from three years to 12 years for trafficking in human organs. A donor, who was paid £2,500 for their kidney, shows the scar from the surgery where the organ was removed . It heard that the gang had made £150,000 profit from selling the kidneys to the recipients for £12,000, having paid the original owner of the kidney just £2,500 for the donation. One donor, a 21-year-old from Anhui Province, told the court that he had wanted to earn some money to show his father he could live on his own, and had been assured that he could live a perfectly normal life with one kidney. Like the dozens of other donors he was recruited online and said that the gang had taken him to Nanchang in October 2011. He added that prior to the transplant, he stayed in a motel under guard and was taken to two hospitals to see if he was a match with patients needing a transplant. One of the consent forms signed by a donor, whose organ was then illegally sold on by the gang . About three weeks later, he said he was blindfolded and taken to a hospital to have a kidney removed after which he was paid the promised £2,500. Another man, a 27-year-old, said he sold a kidney to pay gambling debts and was taken from the city of Guangzhou to Nanchang in November 2011 to have it removed. The gang paid the private Nanchang Huazhong Hospital £3,400 for the hire of a room for each operation. Jiang Zhenglin, a doctor, earned around £1,000 for each operation and nurses 'borrowed' from other hospitals were paid up to £400. Local media reported that many of the gang members had previously sold organs or had been transplant patients and took part because of the money to be made. They were regarded as unlikely to betray the other members because of the fact that they either had illegal kidneys themselves, or had been paid to donate a kidney which is also illegal.","Gang members jailed for paying impoverished villagers £2,500 for a kidney .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Russia today imposed a 'full embargo' on most food imports from the West in retaliation for sanctions over Ukraine - a sweeping move that will cost Western farmers billions of dollars but could also lead to empty shelves in Russian cities. The decision shows that President Vladimir Putin has no intention of bowing to Western pressure over Ukraine and will instead try to strike back at the West. It also demonstrated that the Kremlin is ready to inflict damage on Russia while pursuing its course in Ukraine. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also warned that Russia could block transit flights for European and U.S. Airlines to the Asia-Pacific region. Scroll down for video . 'Sanctions only lead to a deadlock': Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announces a 'full embargo' on most food imports from the West in retaliation for sanctions over Ukraine . In televised comments, he told a government meeting: 'Russia is introducing a full embargo on imports of beef, pork, fruit and vegetable produce, poultry, fish, cheese, milk and dairy products from the European Union, United States, Australia, Canada and Norway.' The ban goes into effect immediately and will last one year unless 'our partners demonstrate a constructive approach' with regards to sanctioning Russia, he said. 'Of course this is a serious decision for the suppliers of such foods from these countries.' The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency, and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies. Could lead to empty shelves: Shoppers buy imported fruit at a supermarket in Moscow. Experts say local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban because of poor efficiency and shortage of funds . Russia depends heavily on imported foodstuffs - most of it from the West - particularly in the largest and most prosperous cities such as Moscow. In 2013, the EU's agricultural exports to Russia totalled 11.8 billion euros (£9.3 billion), while the U.S. Department of Agriculture says food and agricultural imports from the U.S. amounted to $1.3 billion. Experts said that local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector has continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds. The damage to consumers inflicted by the ban will be felt particularly hard in big cities like Moscow, where imported food fills an estimated 60-70 per cent of the market. Medvedev said Russia could go further and ban Western carriers from flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia - a move that would significantly swell costs and increase flight time. Unrest: The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia of fomenting tensions in Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to pro-Moscow separatists (above) who has also been blamed for the shooting down of flight MH17 . He said there has been no decision on that yet, and wouldn't specify when and under what conditions the move could be taken. Medvedev made it clear that Russia hopes that the sanctions will make the West revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions. 'Until the last moment we hoped that our partners would understand that sanctions only lead to a deadlock, and no one needs them, but they didn't,' he said. 'We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us.' If the West doesn't revise its course, Russia may follow up by introducing restrictions regarding imports of planes, navy vessels and cars, Medvedev warned, but added that the government will realistically assess its own production potential.","PM Dimitry Medvedev strikes back at the West with year-long sanctions .

"By . Spencer Matthews . There has been a surprising new trend for men in Chelsea this week which has seen several of them walking around topless. Alex Mytton turned up in Binky Felstead’s kitchen wearing nothing more than a snug pair of briefs and Jamie Laing has taken to doing his housework in a pair of superhero pants. I wanted to join in the craze but in London it’s getting far too cold for that, winter has well and truly arrived. Miami Nights: Vigorous clapping at Miami Heat game led to seriously swollen hands . The coldest night of the year so far coincided last week with the opening of the new Perrier Jouet champagne and shots roof terrace at London’s rock and roll hotel – the Sanctum Soho on Warwick Street. As always, when free drinks are involved the music industry descended in droves and the roof was packed with hip rock and indie bands, as well as a good friend of mine Stacey Jackson, whose dance music video I appeared in. The terrace comes complete with a hot tub but no one was brave enough for that in practically sub zero temperatures. It’s not just the cold outdoors that’s been bothering me, there’s been a rather frosty atmosphere around London’s SW3 neighbourhood from some of the residents recently as anyone who watched last night’s Made In Chelsea show could have seen. So myself and Jamie decided to decamp to sunnier climes. There was the rather tenuous excuse of some promotional work in Florida and we were off. One nine-hour BA flight later and we could hear the seductive chant of 'Bienvenido a Miami'. Spencer's secret: I took a quick selfie with my sunnies on with one of the models who recently was called for a casting for Victoria's Secret. I think you can see why... We were invited to stay with Bill Dean, a billionaire who runs one of the biggest privately owned engineering companies in the USA. Four years ago he bought an exquisite colonial-style mansion with amazing views of Miami Beach, and transformed this amazing $40m property into a breathtaking 15 bedroom house with marble floors, outdoor hot tubs, three fountains, a waterfall, three guest cottages, a spa, and even its own nightclub. I first met Bill when he was on holiday in St Barths and he is a totally charming guy and most generous host. It would have been rude not to take up his invite especially as I may not have the chance to see him in Barths this Christmas. Things started well as soon as we touched down. Temperatures are in the 30s so it was straight into shorts and T-shirts. Since that point it’s pretty much been one long party. First up Story nightclub on Miami Beach on Friday - It’s a huge super-club with a beautiful dancers and an amazing light show, it had great energy and we had a table booked for us in the middle of it all. But this was merely the aperitif for the weekend’s fun but the best was yet to come - Liv club on Saturday night was off-the-hook. It’s quite simply one of the best clubs in the world. A room packed with some of the most beautiful people (and by people, I mean women) in the world, dancing suggestively, up for a good time, and friendly. Home from home: We were invited to stay with Bill Dean in his mansion, a billionaire who runs one of the biggest privately owned engineering companies in the USA . Mix that up with several shots of Patron Tequila, a theatrical backdrop and confetti liberally sprayed in the air and then you start to get an idea of a big night out at Liv. The club went on to 5am and then it was time for the after-party back at Bill’s mansion. We had some new friends back in the limo and then Jamie and I entertained them with a game of topless bartender in the club at the mansion. Thankfully both myself and Jamie are in impeccably good shape at the moment. I’ve been working out hard down the gym and have been taking these amazing new Forza T5 Super Strength diet supplements – but more about that another time, this was party week, not work-out week. Another tough day followed on Monday when we took our new friends out on Bill’s 90 foot Warren yacht called Moksha – it’s the Hindu term for reaching enlightenment, and I think we came close on this boat ride with four top models. We work out: Me and Jamie (R) are in great shape right now so had no qualms ripping our tops off . I took a quick selfie with my sunnies on with one of the models who recently was called for a casting for Victoria’s Secret. I think you can see why. One last big night before we return to Blighty and we were off to see Miami Heat play Pheonix Suns with Court-side seats at the American Airlines Arena. The home side won 107-92, with LeBron James scoring 35 points. So we had to celebrate again at a club. Rude not to.

"By . Jill Reilly For Mailonline . A Buddhist Chinese monk has caused controversy after it emerged he had accepted cash to bless a businessman's Porsche. Recently everything from palatial new homes to controversial business ventures are beginning to be blessed, but it was the businessman's request to have his brand-new sports car prayed over in a temple in the city of Xiaogan, in eastern China's Hubei province, that has really caused anger across the country. Software development company boss Tao Hung brought the high-performance car to the monk so he could pray that he would drive safely in the vehicle and be 'lucky' in always reaching his destinations on time without incident. Chinese monks have caused controversy after it emerged that are accepting cash to bless the lifestyles of the wealthy . A businessman's request to have his brand-new Porsche blessed in a temple in the city of Xiaogan, in eastern China's Hubei province, has really caused anger across the country . But critics have said that the blessing goes against Buddhist tradition and that greed and money are not part of the teachings - in fact greed, hatred, and delusion are known as the three poisons. Several people also branded the blessing pointless saying that if the man wanted to avoid accidents, he should drive slowly and take care not to count on God to do the job for him. One commentator writing online said: 'He may have money but one wonders how he came to make it, given the fact that he shows an eminent lack of intelligence.' The businessman himself declined to comment and the monks said that blessing means of transportation has always been part of their Buddhist tradition and there was nothing wrong with agreeing to pray that the man's Porsche delivered him safely after each journey.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A photographer has been accused of glamourising sex attacks after releasing a fashion shoot that bears chilling similarities to the gang rape of an Indian woman on a bus. Raj Shetye's images entitled The Wrong Turn show a distressed woman in high-end clothing fending off male models on a bus. In one of the pictures, a model holds her down on a row of seats while another appears to be kissing her on the leg. The images have provoked outrage online . with critics claiming Mr Shetye had based the shoot on the gang rape of a student in Delhi in December 2012 which led to widespread protests across the world and forced India to confront its culture of violence against women. Scroll down for video . 'Disgusting': This image is one of a series of pictures by Indian fashion photographer Raj Shetye which critics say have been inspired by infamous gang rape of a woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012 . Four men were sentenced to death in September last year over the attack, referred to as Nirbhaya, a Hindi word for 'fearless' which is now used as a pseudonym for the victim. Saniya Scott ‏tweeted: 'Heard about #Nirbhaya inspired modeling photo-shoot. Could anything be more demeaning? Wasn't right in ANY sense. Inspiration is no excuse.' Priya ‏@pliyaaa said: 'Sickened to my very core! Just how someone can think of glamorizing a heinous act like rape is beyond me.' Sufiya Ahmed added: 'Disgusting fashion shoot glamorising rape in India. Now rapists will think they are fashionable studs.' 'A way of throwing light on the issue': Mr Shetye denied the shoot was inspired by the Delhi bus attack but said he wanted highlight the dangers for women in a way that he knew how . Outrage: Critics took to Twitter to express their disgust at the photo shoot . Mr Shetye, who is Indian, issued a robust defence of his project and attacked his critics for misinterpreting his attempt to highlight the dangers facing women in India. In a statement to MailOnline, he said: 'In today's times when freedom of speech and expression is ripped off from a person merely through social media, it is a plight for an artist to keep his work in perspective and independent of public opinion. 'It's unfortunate that I am compelled to justify my artistic expression of a social issue just as many artists (big and small) have had to do in the past. I still strongly stand by work.' Mr Shetye denied trying to replicate the Nirbhaya attack but said his aim was to focus on the plight of the poor who are often forced to take public transport. He added: 'Being a part of society, it breaks my heart to see my mother, my friends, my sister constraining themselves professionally and personally just to be safe. 'It's an imbalanced society where the rich can afford the luxury and safety attached to driving in their own vehicle, but the majority of women still commute on buses, autos and trains. 'I believe that I have managed to achieve my goal of starting dialogue on these issues. If the cost to set the ball rolling is that I have to be the bad guy here, be it that way.' Supporters: Demonstrators hold a placard outside a court in New Delhi as four men who gang-raped a student on a bus in Delhi are sentenced to death last September . He said he does not intend to profit from the project, adding: 'The intent of this shoot is not commercial gain. 'The aim is purely to create art that will garner public opinion about issues that concern women.' None of the top designers which supplied the clothes have been credited publicly, he added. Mr Shetye later took the images down from his official website. The Delhi bus gang rape was one of the most high-profile cases to hit India in recent years in a country where rape offences are reported every 21 minutes on average. More recently, it emerged last month that a 14-year-old girl was dragged into a forest and raped on the orders of a village council in remote eastern India in retaliation for a sex assault blamed on her brother. Earlier this year, two teenage girls were allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a zero tolerance approach on crimes against women, but violence and discrimination against women in remain deeply entrenched in society.","Raj Shetye's images show distressed woman fighting off men on a bus .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Iraq's new president has snubbed the powerful incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by nominating the deputy parliament speaker to form the new government. But the move raises fears of more infighting in the government as the country faces the threat of Sunni militants in the north. A member of al-Maliki's political bloc said 'we will not stay silent' over the decision. Hussein al-Maliki, Maliki's son-in-law said: 'The nomination is illegal and a breach of the constitution. We will go to the federal court to object to the nomination.' Scroll down for video . Deputy parliament speaker Haider al-Ibadi (left) has been nominated by Iraq's President to succeed Nouri al-Maliki (right) as Prime Minister. Al-Maliki's allies have declared the decision illegal . Al-Maliki had indicated he would seek . a third term as prime minister, rejecting calls by Sunnis, Kurds, . fellow Shi'ites and regional power broker Iran to step aside for a less . polarising figure who can unite Iraqis against a raging Sunni insurgeny. In . a televised address, Fouad Massoum gave Haider al-Ibadi 30 days to form . a new government and present it to parliament for approval, expressing . his hope he would succeed. Mr . Ibadi, who pledged to form a government to 'protect the Iraqi people', . was nominated for the post by the Iraqi National Alliance, a coalition . of Shi'ite parties that Mr Maliki's State of Law is part of, but has . turned against him. Mr . Maliki's Shi'ite-dominated bloc won the most parliament seats in April . elections and the prime minister sees himself as rightfully keeping the . post. Out in force: Iraqis chant pro-government slogans and display placards bearing a picture of embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki during a demonstration in Baghdad . Taking to the streets: An Iraqi soldier stands guard amid tight security measures by Iraqi security forces during a pro-government demonstration to show support for embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki . In a midnight speech, . Mr Maliki said he was filing a suit against the president for neglecting . to name him prime minister by Sunday's deadline and all but demanded he . be renominated. Critics say . Mr Maliki, a Shiite, contributed to the crisis by monopolising power . and pursuing a sectarian agenda that alienated the country's Sunni and . Kurdish minorities. Mr . Ibadi's nomination came hours after Mr Maliki deployed his elite . security forces in the streets of Baghdad, partially closed two main . streets - popular spots for pro and anti-government rallies - as . hundreds of his supporters took to the streets. Precautions: Iraqi forces check people in Baghdad's commercial district of Karrada as security measures are reinforced across the capital after PM al-Maliki said he would take legal action against the new President . 'We are with you, al-Maliki,' they shouted, waving posters of the incumbent premier, singing and dancing. Mohammed . al-Ogeili, a lawmaker from Mr Maliki's list, rejected the nomination of . Mr Ibadi arguing that this move 'runs against the constitution' because . Mr Maliki's party is the largest bloc and the National Alliance has no . right to present any candidate. 'This decision would lead the country to a big problem and the president bears full responsibility for this situation,' he said. After Washington endorsed Masoum's attempts to break three months of post-election political deadlock that have hamstrung Baghdad's response to the Islamic State, Secretary of State John Kerry called on Maliki not to resort to force or 'stir the waters' when Iraqis were seeking a change of leader. In pointed remarks, he said: 'The government formation process is critical in terms of sustaining stability and calm in Iraq and our hope is that Mr Maliki will not stir those waters. 'There will be little international support of any kind whatsoever for anything that deviates from the legitimate constitution process that is in place and being worked on now.' As police and elite armed units, many equipped and trained by the United States, locked down the capital's streets, Kerry added: 'There should be no use of force, no introduction of troops or militias in this moment of democracy for Iraq.'

Monday, senior U.S. officials said the Obama administration has begun . directly providing weapons to the Kurdish peshmerga forces who have . started to make gains against the Al Qaeda breakaway group. Fleeing jihadists: U.S. and Kurdish flags flutter in the wind while displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community pour across the border from Syria into Iraq after a week-long journey through blazing hot mountains . President Barack Obama warned Americans on Saturday that the new campaign to bring security in Iraq requires military and political changes and 'is going to be a long-term project.' Obama said Iraqi security forces need to revamp to effectively mount an offensive, which requires a government in Baghdad that the Iraqi military and people have confidence in. Obama said Iraq needs a prime minister - an indication that suggests he's written off the legitimacy of the incumbent, al-Maliki. Critics say the Shi'ite leader . contributed to the crisis by monopolizing power and pursuing a sectarian . agenda that alienated the country's Sunni and Kurdish minorities. Just hours after al-Maliki's speech, the U.S. State Department said Sunday it 'fully supports' the new Iraqi president. State . Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement the U.S. supports . the process to select a prime minister 'by building a national consensus . and governing in an inclusive manner.' She said the U.S. rejects any effort to use coercion or manipulation in the process of choosing a new Iraqi leader. The U.S. airstrikes have reinvigorated Kurdish forces battling the Islamic State militants in northern and western Iraq. On the run: The Yazidis said Islamic State militants had given them the choice of converting to Islam or dying . Kurdish forces retook two towns from the Sunni militants on Sunday, achieving one of their first victories after weeks of retreating, a senior Kurdish military official said. Kurdish peshmerga fighters were able to push the militants of the Islamic State group out of the villages of Makhmour and al-Gweir, some 28 miles (45 kilometers) from the Kurdish capital of Irbil, Brigadier General Shirko Fatih said. The United States launched a fourth round of airstrikes Sunday against militant vehicles and mortars firing on Irbil as part of efforts to blunt the militants' advance and protect American personnel in and around the Kurdish capital. U.S. warplanes and drones have also attacked militants firing on minority Yazidis around Sinjar, which is in the far west of the country near the Syrian border. In the Kurdish capital on Sunday, the president of the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government, Massoud Barzani, said American military support has been effective thus far, but, he added, peshmerga soldiers require more firepower to defeat the militants. 'We are not asking our friends to send their sons to fight on our behalf,' Barzani told The Associated Press in a brief interview. 'What we are asking our friends is to provide us support and to co-operate with us in providing us with heavy weapons that we are able to fight this terrorist group.' Barzani met Sunday with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who travelled to Baghdad and Irbil pledging France's commitment to providing humanitarian aid. Fabius also met with al-Maliki and called on Iraqi leaders to unite in the face of the escalating crisis. 'The marching order is solidarity,' Fabius said. He called on Iraqis to form a 'government of broad unity so that all Iraqis feel represented and together lead the battle against terrorism.' A week ago, Al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi air force to support Kurdish forces against the militants, in a rare instance of co-operation between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government, which have for years been locked in disputes over oil and territory. Meanwhile, thousands of Yazidi refugees fleeing the militants continued to pour across the border from in Syria after a week-long journey through blazing hot mountains. Followers of an ancient religion with links to Zoroastrianism, the Yazidis said the militants had given them the choice of converting to Islam or dying. As they crossed the border, many Yazidis said they had lost sisters, daughters, young children and elderly parents during the trip. They said militants sprayed gunfire at fleeing crowds, sometimes splitting up families by taking the women and killing the men. It was not clear how many Yazidis were missing. In the span of 30 minutes, about a dozen displaced Yazidis approached one journalist, pleading for assistance to find their loved ones. British officials estimated Saturday that 50,000 to 150,000 people could be trapped on Sinjar Mountain, where they fled to escape the Islamic extremists, only to become stranded there with few supplies. Britain said its air force has already dropped water containers and solar lanterns over the mountains. U.S. and Iraqi aircraft also have dropped humanitarian aid for the minority Yazidism. U.S. Central Command reported that the U.S. military conducted a fourth airdrop of food and water Sunday. During his Sunday blessing at the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed outrage at the violence aimed at religious minorities in Iraq and called on the world 'to stop these crimes.' He cited 'the thousands of people, including Christians, who have been brutally forced from their homes, children who have died from thirst during the escape and women who have been seized.' He also spoke of 'the destruction of religious, historic and cultural treasures.' In a statement issued Sunday, the European Union said it was 'appalled by the rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation, with hundreds of thousands civilians, mainly from minorities, fleeing the areas of conflict.' Some of the militants' acts 'may constitute crimes against humanity and must be investigated swiftly, so that the perpetrators are held accountable,' the EU said.","Deputy parliament speaker chosen to succeed incumbent Nouri al-Maliki .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A former lead detective in the Oscar Pistorius murder investigation has been accused of telling 'blatant lies' to incriminate the athlete. In his closing arguments at the murder trial, the Paralympian's lawyer Barry Roux claimed Hilton Botha had given contradictory evidence at the runner's bail hearing last year. Mr Roux also attacked the prosecution for not calling the disgraced police officer to give evidence. Mr Botha quit the investigation after it was revealed he was facing manslaughter charges in a separate case. Oscar Pistorius leaves court after the first day of closing arguments by the defence and prosecution . Earlier, chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel . used his closing arguments to accuse of Pistorius of repeatedly lying . during his testimony in a crude attempt to defend the murder charge. Alluding to his career as a track star, Mr Nel the athlete had 'dropped the baton of truth'. Mr . Nel cited flaws in the defense, saying the Paralympian's legal team . floated more than one theory about what happened on the night that . Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door in his home. Defense lawyers had argued . that Pistorius fired in self-defense, fearing an intruder, Mr Nel said, . but they also raised the possibility that he was not criminally . responsible and accidentally shot because he was 'startled.' 'It's . two defenses that you can never reconcile,' Mr Nel said as Pistorius . sat behind him in the dock, occasionally flicking through documents. Stressed: Oscar Pistorius reacts as he listens to the state prosecutor summarising evidence yesterday . Studious: Oscar Pistorius takes notes during the closing arguments from the prosecution in his murder trial . The amputee appeared calm in contrast to past occasions when he vomited and wailed in the dock . The . once-celebrated double-amputee appeared calm, in contrast on past . occasions during which he retched, vomited and wailed in the dock in . apparent distress. The . prosecution has argued that Pistorius intentionally shot Steenkamp . before dawn on Valentine's Day last year after a fierce row and claimed . he knew she was in the bathroom. Mr . Nel ended his closing argument by saying Pistorius was guilty of . pre-meditated murder because he then 'made up his mind' to find his gun, . walk through to the bathroom and shoot. 'That, my lady, is pre-planning,' Nel said to the judge. Deliberation: Pistorius speaks with a member of his legal team ahead of the final arguments of his murder trial . Yet . Mr Nel said Pistorius should still be convicted of murder even if the . court accepts he did not know it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle, . arguing the athlete intentionally shot at and killed a person with no . reason to believe his life was under threat. Barry Roux, the chief defense lawyer, listened and checked files as Mr Nel spoke for hours. Mr . Nel was occasionally questioned by Judge Thokozile Masipa and urged to . speed up elaborations on written arguments of more than 100 pages that . were submitted to the court last week. Mr . Roux began his final arguments before Masipa postponed proceedings . until Friday for the defense to finish. Masipa will then adjourn the . trial to deliberate with two legal assistants on a verdict. Tense: Oscar Pistorius arrives at court in Pretoria to hear the closing arguments in his murder trial . Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the main charge of premeditated murder. Mr Roux noted that some of the evidence at the scene, which Nel referred to, had been moved around by investigators. 'We're not talking about a conspiracy,' Roux said, calling it unintentional tampering. Mr . Roux also noted that Hilton Botha, the former chief investigating . officer in the case, had acknowledged mistakes in police procedure but . was not called by the state as a trial witness. According . to Mr Nel, Pistorius was vague in allegations that police had possibly . tampered with evidence around the scene of the shooting, including fans . and a bed cover strewn on the floor of his bedroom. It . was also improbable that the athlete, in his version, rushed with his . gun to investigate a purported sound in the bathroom without first . trying to talk to Miss Steenkamp and confirm that she was safe, the . prosecutor said. Strain: Reeva Steenkamp's father, Barry (second left) arrives at court with wife June (second right) for the first time in the trial . 'We cannot . argue that he was the worst witness ever, that honour belongs to . someone else,' said the prosecution's written argument. 'The accused was, however, demonstrably one of the worst witnesses ever encountered.' The . prosecution said Pistorius also 'used well-calculated and rehearsed . emotional outbursts to deflect the attention and avoid having to answer . questions.' A psychologist . who examined Pistorius during a court-ordered observation period . concluded that the athlete had become severely traumatised since the . killing and could become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues . to get mental health care. The . fathers of the Olympic runner and Steenkamp, a model and television . personality, were in the Pretoria courtroom for the first time since the . trial began in early March. Brave: Barry and June Steenkamp arrive at the high court in Pretoria as the trial reaches it final stages . Support: Pistorius's father Henke (above) also made his first appearance at the trial . They sat at opposite ends of a long bench . in the gallery. Pistorius is said to be estranged from his father, . Henke, and Steenkamp's father, Barry, has been ill. Pistorius's . older brother Carl, who has regularly attended court sessions, was in . an intensive care unit in a South African hospital and was on a . ventilator because of injuries suffered in a serious car crash last . week, the Pistorius family said in a statement. In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces three separate gun-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Because . South Africa has no trial by jury, Judge Masipa will decide if . Pistorius committed murder, is guilty of a negligent killing, or if he . made a tragic error and should be acquitted. The runner also would be . sent to prison for years if guilty of murder without premeditation or . culpable homicide. Masipa told Nel and Roux that they had only until the end of Friday to complete their final arguments in court. 'Unless, of course, you want to work on a Saturday and perhaps Sunday, after church,' she said, smiling.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A doctor has become the second confirmed case of Ebola in Nigeria after helping to treat a U.S. businessman who died from the disease, it emerged today. Nigerian authorities said tests were also being carried out on three other people who treated Patrick Sawyer after they reported similar symptoms. The second case of Ebola in Africa's most populous country is an alarming setback as officials across the region battle to stop the spread of a disease that has killed nearly 900 people. Scroll down for video . Nigerian medics (left) are on high alert after a doctor who treated U.S. businessman Patrick Sawyer (pictured, right, with his daughter Ava) for Ebola was confirmed as the second person to contract the virus in the country . Health authorities in Liberia have also ordered that all those who die from Ebola be cremated after communities opposed having the bodies buried nearby. Over the weekend, health authorities in the West African country encountered resistance while trying to bury 22 bodies in Johnsonville, outside the capital Monrovia. Military police helped restore order. In Nigeria, Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said test samples are pending for three other people who had shown symptoms of Ebola and that authorities are trying to trace and quarantine others. The confirmed second case in Nigeria is a doctor who had helped treat Mr Sawyer, the Liberian-American man who died on July 25, days after arriving in Nigeria from Liberia. 'Three others who participated in that treatment who are currently symptomatic have had their samples taken and hopefully by the end of today we should have the results of their own test,' Chukwu said. On the front line: Medics wait to screen passengers at Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos . The emergence of a second case raises serious concerns about the infection control practices in Nigeria, and also raise the spectre that more cases could emerge. It can take up to 21 days after exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear. They include fever, sore throat, muscle pains and headaches. Often nausea, vomiting and diarrhea follow, along with severe internal and external bleeding in advanced stages of the disease. Doctors and other health workers on the front lines of the Ebola crisis have been among the most vulnerable to infection as they are in direct physical contact with patients. The disease is not airborne, and only transmitted through contact with bodily fluids such as saliva, blood, vomit, sweat or feces. High alert: A Nigerian health official uses a thermometer at Murtala Muhammed Airport to screen for Ebola . Sawyer, who was travelling to Nigeria on business, became ill while aboard a flight and Nigerian authorities immediately took him into isolation upon arrival in Lagos. They did not quarantine his fellow passengers and have insisted that the risk of additional cases was minimal. Nigerian authorities said a total of 70 people are under surveillance and that they hoped to have eight people in quarantine by the end of Monday in an isolation ward in Lagos. The emergence there is particularly worrisome because Lagos is the largest city in Africa with some 21 million people. Health officials rely on 'contact tracing' - locating anyone who may have been exposed, and then anyone who may have come into contact with that person. That may prove impossible, given that Sawyer's fellow passengers journeyed on to dozens of other cities and the health workers who treated them may have exposed family members. Nigeria is the fourth country to report Ebola cases and some 887 people are now believed to have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.","Three others who treated Patrick Sawyer also suspected of having disease .

General Manuel Noriega has been in jail since 1989 on drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering charges after being driven from power in a U.S. invasion. The 80-year-old has now filed a lawsuit against publishers Activision Blizzard for creating a villain in his name and image which he claims has boosted their profits and damaged his reputation. Battleground: Former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega pictured (left) in 1989 before he was ousted from power by the U.S. and (right) as he appears in the video game Call Of Duty Black Ops II, a depiction he is suing over . In the game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, he is described by characters as 'a piece of s*** and old pineapple face himself, Manuel Noriega'. The latter insult refers to his pockmarked face which gave rise to the nickname at the height of his power. He also randomly shoots members of the Panama Army, his 'own private police force', according to the Independent. The lawsuit, filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court, says the makers used his image to 'heighten realism in its video game... this translates directly into heightened sales for defendants'. Cashing in on his image? In the game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, the jailed 80-year-old is described by characters as 'a piece of s*** and old pineapple face himself, Manuel Noriega', the latter in reference to his pockmarked appearance.

'Defendants' use of plaintiff's image and likeness caused damage to plaintiff. 'Plaintiff was portrayed as an antagonist and portrayed as the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes, creating the false impression that defendants are authorized to use plaintiff's image and likeness. 'This caused plaintiffs to receive profits they would not have otherwise received.' He is seeking damages for 'unjust enrichment, unfair business practices, and violation of common-law publicity rights.'","Manuel Noriega, now 80, was ousted from power in U.S. invasion in 1989 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Russia may be stripped of assets around the world after an international court ruled it must pay $50billion in compensation for the government's role in destroying the country's largest oil company. Yesterday's verdict by the Permanent Court for Arbitration increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia at a time when it faces new, potentially painful sanctions from Western powers. Yukos was once Russia's biggest oil company, but was broken up after anti-Kremlin owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, shortly after President Vladimir Putin warned Russia's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics. Scroll down for video . Lawyers acting for shareholders of collapsed Russian oil firm Yukos speak after the Kremlin was ordered to pay $50bn in damages to their clients over its role in destroying the company with outsized tax demands . The court, a body that rules on corporate disputes, said the Russian government owes the money to the former majority shareholders in Yukos Oil Co, which it said was forced into bankruptcy with outsized tax claims by Putin's government. Moscow vowed to fight the decision, raising the prospect of a new round of legal battles as the shareholders seek to enforce the decision by seizing Russian state-owned assets in 150 countries around the world. They can attempt to seize any assets used for commercial purposes. That means that while embassies are safe, planes, art, commercial property, gas pipelines and oil rigs are not. 'It's the end of the beginning,' said Tim Osborne, executive director of GML, formerly Group Menatep Ltd, whose subsidiaries brought the suit to the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. The court said Russia had used tax claims to take control of Yukos in 2003 and silence its CEO, Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Putin who had begun to use his vast wealth to fund opposition parties challenging Putin's power. Yukos was broken up after anti-Kremlin owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky (left) was arrested in 2003 shortly after President Vladimir Putin (right) warned Russia's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics . Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint as he boarded a plane in Siberia that year and spent more than a decade in prison as Yukos's main assets were sold to a state-owned company. Yukos ultimately went bankrupt. Monday's ruling, one of the largest commercial arbitration awards in history, adds to Russia's economic problems just as the U.S. and European Union are debating further sanctions against the country because of its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine. Though the country has ample reserves, uncertainty over the impact of the sanctions has seen economic growth forecasts plummet and investors are pulling money out of the country at almost twice the pace as last year. The court's three-member panel, chaired by Yves Fortier, Canada's former permanent representative to the United Nations, determined Russia was not acting in good faith to collect taxes when it levelled massive claims against Yukos, even though some of the company's tax arrangements might have been questionable. The state launched 'a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr Khodorkovsky from the political arena,' the court said. Broken up: The former Moscow headquarters of Yukos. The court said the Kremlin launched 'a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets' The blunt verdict accusing the Kremlin of giving the go-ahead to crush one of the nation's biggest companies contrasts sharply with earlier cautious rulings from other international courts, which were carefully phrased to avoid blaming the Russian leadership for destroying Yukos. The dismantling of Yukos and the arrest of Khodorkovsky were a defining moment in Putin's rule. It was then that his government began to take back control of the country's energy industry and sought to re-assert itself internationally as a force to be reckoned with rather than a crumbling post-communist shell. Putin most recently went on to assert Russia's claims over Crimea, annexing the peninsula on the Black Sea in March, and to offer support to rebels in Ukraine's east. But the wake-up call for the West began in the early 2000s, when Putin forged a deal with Russian businessmen who had created empires by snapping up the jewels of the Soviet state in oil, gas and chemicals. The Kremlin offered its protection for the oligarchs' often murky deals. In exchange, the tycoons pledged to not meddle in government policy. Khodorkovsky was the only man who broke this rule. After his imprisonment, Yukos' main assets were ultimately bought up by state-owned Rosneft, making it the largest oil producer in Russia. In Monday's ruling, which was dated July 18, Russia was ordered to pay the damages within 180 days or begin paying interest. If Russia declines to pay, shareholders can attempt to seize Russian assets abroad. 'We're over the first and most important hurdle,' Osborne said. 'It's now a question of enforcing it.' Damning: The verdict by the Permanent Court for Arbitration (above) in The Hague increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia at a time when it faces new sanctions from Western powers . The amount of damages, although half as much as originally claimed, is colossal - nearly as much as Russia spent on the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the most expensive Olympics in history. Russia's options are limited. Though the arbitration decision is final, it can seek what is called a 'setting aside' of the award before courts in the Netherlands. The threshold for review is high, however, and lawyers for GML said they were confident Russia had no chance on that front. The Russian finance ministry said it would take that path, fight what it called a one-sided and political verdict in the other courts in the Netherlands. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russian authorities 'will use all possible legal means to defend their position.' Leonid Nevzlin, the top beneficiary of a trust controlling GML that has launched the suit, told Ekho Moskvy radio shareholders would search for and freeze Russian assets around the world if Moscow doesn't pay up. Nevzlin pointed at a suit won by a Swiss company, Noga, which claimed $1.1 billion from Russia and led to seizures of Russian assets worldwide in 2008. It eventually forced Moscow to opt for a settlement. Khodorkovsky, who had given his stock in Yukos to Nevzlin, said the ruling will make a 'strong impression' on Putin, saying his lieutenants had sought to downplay the likelihood of such an outcome. 'I'm sure that they haven't told Putin how disastrous the ruling will be, and I'm very happy today,' he said on Ekho Moskvy. Though the case has been a decade in the making, the timing of its release is unfortunate for Russia, experts said. Between the crisis in Ukraine, the possibility of sanctions and the payment of a massive judgment on Yukos, investors in Russia now face 'the perfect storm,' said Gianna Bern, who teaches finance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. Bern said that while Russia could probably handle paying $50 billion, not paying could prove more problematic. 'Foreign investors are going to be on the sidelines waiting to see how they handle this,' she said. 'They will look at this and see if the Russian Federation respects the rule of law.' The main stock index in Moscow fell almost 2 per cent on Monday. Rosneft said in a statement it is not party to the litigation and it did not expect to be affected by it. It believes the deals to purchase former assets of Yukos 'were fully legitimate.' Shares in Rosneft were down 3.6 percent in trading in London. Monday's decision is not the only one facing Russia this week. The European Court of Human Rights is set to rule on Thursday on another Yukos lawsuit - one involving 55,000 shareholders that were not part of the GML group. This group includes $6 billion in investments by U.S. pension funds and other institutions. No one involved seems to think this is even close to over, with lawyers on all sides taking up positions. 'The Yukos affair is likely to come back to haunt the Russians,' said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington and a long-time Russia watcher. 'You don't steal companies.'","Russia used outsized tax claims to bankrupt country's largest oil firm .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Taliban militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades attacked Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital today in one of the most audacious assaults on the facility, used by both civilians and the military, in a year. The attack on the airport comes at a time of great uncertainty for Afghanistan as a recount of votes from the second round of a disputed presidential election got under way. The poll is meant to mark Afghanistan's first democratic transfer of power. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Afghans run for cover after Taliban militants launched a rocket attack on Kabul's military airport . The attack lasted about four hours after four militants armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades opened fire on the airport from the roof of a building just to its north. 'Four terrorists were killed by police special forces. The area is being cleared now, there are no casualties to our forces,' said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi. The airport is home to a major operational base for NATO-led forces that have been fighting Taliban and other insurgents for 12 years and is bristling with soldiers and police, guard towers and several lines of security checkpoints. Militants fire rockets into the airport almost every week, causing little damage, but frontal attacks on the heavily guarded facility are rare and represent an ambitious target for insurgents. Line of defence: Afghan policemen arrive at the site of a Taliban attack in front of Kabul's military airport . The attack was similar in tactics to last year's assault on the airport, when seven Taliban insurgents including suicide bombers attacked after taking up positions inside a partially constructed building nearby. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attack. A Kabul airport official told Reuters all flights had been diverted to other cities. In such circumstances, passenger planes are immediately diverted to other Afghan cities such as Mazar-i-Sharif in the north or Herat in the west. Tense: The attack on the airport comes at a time of great uncertainty for Afghanistan as a recount of votes from the second round of a disputed presidential election got under way . 'Due to the closeness of the attack to the runway, Kabul airport is now closed to all flights,' the official said. Planes could be heard circling above Kabul as the attack unfolded. A Reuters witness near the scene earlier saw black smoke billowing above the airport and heard several explosions. A car had been set on fire not far from the scene. On Tuesday, a car bomb detonated in a crowded market killed 43 people and wounded at least 74 in the eastern province of Paktika, close to Afghanistan's porous border with Pakistan.","Gunmen launched assault on heavily-guarded base for NATO-led forces .

Callum Copson from Kennoway, near St . Andrews, suffered a massive wound to his stomach after being slashed with a knife while protecting his girlfriend on holiday. The 19-year-old was said to be on the 'road to recovery' after two life-saving operations, although doctors warned he is 'not out of the woods yet'. Consultant surgeon Ozgur Basaran said: 'Callum is lucky to be young, to be that close to the hospital and to receive immediate treatment to his wounds. Callum Copson, left, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday when he went to the leather shop in Marmaris to exchange a bag with his girlfriend Erin Brown, right, who is maintaining a round-the-clock vigil by his bedside . 'He had suffered extensive and severe damage to the major arteries serving his kidneys and other internal organs. 'We . worked for seven hours to repair the damage. But he later suffered . further internal bleeding and we had to operate a second time.' Mr . Copson suffered a massive wound to his stomach and had to squash his . intestines back inside with his own hands after being sliced with the . jagged edge of a fruit knife after a row over a handbag. He had jumped in to protect his girlfriend Erin Brown, 18, after angry shop . staff started lobbing belts, bags and shoes at her following a row . over a refund on a faulty bag last week. But . as Callum stepped in to shield Erin from the onslaught a 14-year-old . local boy snatched up a knife, dashed into the shop and plunged the . blade into Mr Copson's stomach then fled. British . tourists tried to help stem the flow of blood as the shocked Scottish . teenager clutched his stomach and begged for help. A row developed inside the leather shop in Marmaris, pictured, when Mr Copson was stabbed in the stomach . Eye-witness . Sandra Dempsey, 54, said: 'There was blood everywhere. You could see . his insides spewing out. It was unbelievably shocking. 'The poor lad just . kept repeating ""I don't want to die"" over and over.' Following the surgery, Mr Copson was put into an induced coma for 48 hours. On Sunday, he was bought out of the coma and taken off oxygen and was able to breathe for himself. But he remains in intensive care at the private Ahu Hetman Hospital in Marmaris. 'I'm pleased to say that Callum is well on the road to recovery,' added Dr Basaran. But . the private surgeon added a note of caution saying: 'He's not out of . the woods yet - but he's young and strong and making good progress.' His . parents Eric and Lorraine Copson, who flew to Turkey to be at their . son's bedside, told local reporters: 'As soon as we got the call to say . Callum was hurt we left our two daughters with family and got on the . first plane to Marmaris. 'I'm delighted that our son is alive and improving,' said Mr Copson. 'We'd . like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the fabulous doctors and . nurses who have worked so very hard to save Callum's life - words alone . cannot express our gratitude to them.' Callum Copson's parents Eric and Lorraine have rushed from their home in Leven, near St Andrews to join a bedside vigil for the teen . He added: 'We came on a family holiday here four years ago and Callum just fell in love with the place. 'He decided to come back with his girlfriend Erin because he just loved Marmaris so much.' The furious row erupted in a leather shop in the popular tourist resort of Marmaris last Wednesday night. The . couple were staying at the Amore Hotel, had bought a bag in the shop on . Monday - but realising it was faulty returned to the shop a couple of . days later. Ms Brown told police: 'I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible but that I could pick a replacement bag. 'When I picked a bag the owner said it was too expensive so I asked for a refund again and that's when the argument started.' Following the attack, 14-year-old Mehmet Karabulut was taken to the police station by his father who works in the bag shop. Karabulut, . who, according to family friends, has mental-health issues, told his . father and the police that he could remember holding a blood stained . knife, . but nothing more. He was remanded in custody by a judge who has ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the troubled teen. Family . friend Nadir Koyunbakan said: 'Mehmet has some psychiatric problems. He . snatched the knife and stabbed the British boy when he saw him arguing . with his boss. 'We are . devastated for Callum Copson and his family. They are guests in Turkey . and this should never have happened. We are so very sorry.'","Callum Copson was stabbed once in a leather shop in Marmaris, Turkey .

There’s more than 90 years between 15-week-old Ada Kate Smith and her great-great grandmother Evelyn Guy, who is 93. Incredibly, it's the second time the family have had five generations alive at once - the last time being when Ada’s father Daniel, 33, was born. One for the family album! Five generations of the same family (from left) Raymond Guy, 73, Lesley Smith, 53, Daniel Smith, 33, Evelyn Guy, 93 and 15-week-old Ada Kate Smith celebrate the new arrival . However, just three years later they sadly returned to four generations following the death of David Parry. He reached the grand old age of 96 when he died in 1984, and was pictured in the original newspaper photograph holding baby Daniel. The family, who all come from Preston, Lancashire, but now live across the country, got together for photograph of the momentous occasion. The next generation down from Evelyn is her son Raymond Guy, 73, who now lives in Kendal, Cumbria, followed by daughter Lesley Mitchell, 52, who now lives in Wales. Lesley's son Daniel Smith, 33, lives in Nottingham, and finally Daniel’s daughter. Evelyn, who moved to Preston in 1939 but now lives in sheltered accommodation in Ashton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I am very proud of them all, they have all done so well.' We've done it before! An article from the local paper from when the family marked its first five-generation milestone with the birth of Daniel Smith 33 years ago . The family re-enact the picture taken 33 years ago when Daniel was born . Raymond, who used to work as a sales rep for Nestle, said: 'As a family, we are just very good at breeding! 'I would say we're quite a healthy family, we look after ourselves. But I would say the longevity comes from my mum's side. 'My dad's parents unfortunately didn't last as long so it must be my mum with the good genes. 'I think it's very unlikely we'll get to six generations. I've already told Daniel he'll have to hurry up and marry Ada off but that will mean me living until 100, I think! 'We're absolutely over the moon though, we think it's a lovely achievement for our family to make.' Daniel said: 'I wanted us to get together and have the photo, it was quite unusual to have five generations when I was born and now it’s happened again with Ada. 'It’s really lovely, a special day in many ways.' Evelyn has two sons, six grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.","93 years between baby Ada Kate Smith and her great-great grandmother .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A school has provoked outrage among war veterans after flying the German flag on the anniversary of D-Day. Members of the Royal British Legion condemned the decision by Arden Academy to hoist the black, red and gold flag on the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings. Teachers at the school in Knowle, near Solihull, are also understood to be angry. 'Out of order': Arden Academy in Kowle in the West Midlands has angered war veterans after flying the German flag on their grounds on the 70th anniversary of D-Day . A source said: 'Some staff were very upset, some lost relatives during the war. 'I think it was extremely insensitive. To put the flag up on D-Day is just appalling.' However principal Martin Murphy defended the move, insisting the flag was a way of welcoming German exchange students who were visiting that weekend. Jeff Stocks, who served in the Navy and is now chairman of the Royal British Legion Solihull, was also critical. 'In my personal opinion, they should not have done it, not around D-Day,' he said. 'It’s going to cause a lot of upset and anger, especially with ex-servicemen.' 'Did not intend to cause any upset': Principal Martin Murphy defended the move, insisting the flag was a way of welcoming German exchange students who were visiting that weekend . Courage: Soldiers land on the French coast in Normandy during the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944 . Ray Warren, branch chairman of Knowle British Legion said ex-servicemen would be 'disgusted.' He said: 'Considering there are two celebrations this year - the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the 100th anniversary of the First World War - it's very out of order. 'I think many ex military would be disgusted to see the German flag. 'It is a very unusual step for Arden to take and I am quite shocked. 'We have got very few ex servicemen left now and I think for them to see something like that is out of order. 'These men have suffered enough and there are lads who are still serving their country.' Mr Murphy, the interim executive principal at Arden, said: 'We did not intend to cause any upset. The flag was there to simply welcome our German exchange students, who arrived at the weekend. 'The flag was put up in time for their arrival. We were celebrating the arrival of our German students, who are really enjoying their time in Solihull at the moment.' Mr Murphy said having good relations with exchange students is something the school has been part of for years.","Arden Academy in Solihull condemned by members of Royal British Legion .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A grandmother was crushed to death by a falling tree branch in front of her young grandchildren while waiting for a bus. Rambai Senghani, 56, was taking the children, aged five and two-and-half, home from school when the branch crashed 30ft to the ground at around 4pm yesterday. The terrified children, said to be pupils at nearby Donnington Primary School in Willesden Green, north west London, escaped death by inches. Tragedy: A 56-year-old woman was killed at this bus stop in Willesden Green, London, when a huge branch fell on top of her while she was taking her two grandchildren home from school . Workers at a health centre opposite joined horrified passers-by in trying to lift the 20ft branch to free the woman, but she was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. A man in his 70s, who is also believed to . have been waiting at the bus stop, was injured and taken to hospital, . where his condition was today described as 'serious'. Today relatives paid tribute to their 'hero, teacher and foundation'. Laying flowers at the scene, Mrs Senghani daughter, the mother of the two children, was too upset to speak. Four family members held each other as they laid a bouquet of roses and lilies with the message: 'To our dearest mother, our hero, our teacher, our foundation... Rest in peace we will never forget you.' Unstable: The 20ft branch fell to the ground after shearing off from this part of the tree . Scene: Branches believed to be from the fallen tree lay next to the wall where Rambai Senghani was sitting . Another relative, Ratan Patel, who visited the scene, said: 'She died here, it’s so sad, I will miss her. 'She was a very good lady, so kind and a family lady. 'She looks after the grandchildren every day. Her grandkids were asking is she going to be ok, is my grandma going to be alright?' Police cordoned off the road for several hours before her body, which had been covered with a blue plastic sheet, was taken away by ambulance at 9pm last night. Workers with chainsaws chopped up the branch. At 2pm this afternoon, three council contractors arrived to make the tree safe. However, the bus stop where the tragedy happened had remained in use throughout the day. Neighbours in the tree-lined Harlesden Road today told how they heard a loud crash as the branch snapped and fell 25 feet onto a wall where Mrs Senghani had been sitting in the shade. Grief: Floral tributes are left next to the tree . Jacki Park, who lives in a block of flats overlooking the No. 6 bus stop, said: 'The sound was terrifying. 'My heart stopped when I looked out. The tree was lying across the road and the woman’s legs were sticking out from underneath. 'A car stopped and people ran out and they tried to lift the tree to free her. 'People from the health centre opposite rushed out and were trying to save her. I saw an elderly man shaking on the pavement. 'There . was a little boy sitting on the wall and the branch was almost on top . of him, just inches from his legs. I don’t know how it missed him. It’s a . miracle. 'He was screaming . and he couldn’t move. A man came and led him away. Another child, a . little girl, was standing just down the pavement. 'A scooter was by her body I think it belonged to the little boy. 'That’s my stop. I’d got off a bus just minutes before the tree fell. It could have been me. I’m so sorry for that lady.' Judy Kerr, 71, who lives yards from . the scene, said told how neighbours had been concerned over the . maintenance of the trees which stand along the perimeter of gardens . outside her apartment block where Mrs Senghani died. She . added: 'For the last few years we have said that something serious is . going to happen because when it’s windy those trees sway so much. They . need to be cut down. 'The . council has come to prune the trees but they only do the lower branches . and never touch the top. They should have done something with them a . long time ago.' Brent Council has launched an investigation into the accident amid claims by residents that the trees had not been properly maintained.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . First Minister Alex Salmond was mauled during last week's TV independence debate over his refusal to spell out a 'Plan B' if Westminster refuses to allow Scotland to use the pound . Alex Salmond is 'running out of opportunities' to win next month's independence referendum it was claimed today - as a new poll showed a huge lead for the 'No' camp. A survey, carried out amid the fallout from last week’s TV showdown between Mr Salmond and the former Chancellor Alistair Darling, gives the pro-UK campaign a 22-point lead over the nationalists. The findings come just five weeks before voters north of the border go to the polls in the September 18 referendum. More than 1,100 Scots were asked their voting intentions between Monday and Thursday last week – coinciding with Tuesday’s independence debate. According to the YouGov poll, published in the Sun today, some 55 per cent of Scottish voters now plan to vote No to independence, compared to just 35 per cent who plan to vote Yes. But once the ‘don’t knows’ are stripped out, the No camp lead by 61 to 39 per cent. Polling expert Anthony Wells, of YouGov, said Mr Salmond was running out of time to turn his poll ratings around. He said: ‘Yes campaigners had hoped that the Commonwealth Games would have narrowed the gap and it hasn’t. ‘With five weeks to go and a 20 point No lead to overturn, the Yes Scotland campaign need a game-changer and are running out of opportunities.’ Better Together campaign director Blair McDougall added: 'Alex Salmond's failure to be honest with Scots about his Plan B on currency is costing him votes. 'It's clear that the momentum in this campaign is with those of us who believe the brightest future for Scotland is to remain part of the UK. 'Alex Salmond wants us to take a leap into the unknown with independence. He wants us to take a huge risk with the future of our country. Yet he can't tell us what money our wages, pensions and benefits would be paid in. 'He can't say what currency we would use to invest in our schools and hospitals. And he can't be clear about what money we would be paying our supermarket and energy bills in.' Mr Darling, the leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, added: ‘This is yet another encouraging poll. ‘However, we are in no way complacent. There are just six weeks to go and we will be fighting for every vote. ‘What is clear, though, is that the closer we get the more people are looking at the nationalists plans and realising that they make no sense.’ But a spokesman for Yes Scotland said: ‘This poll is unchanged from the last YouGov poll in June. ‘Two other polls in the past week have shown support for Yes as high as 47 per cent — including the snap poll conducted after last week’s debate.’ ‘Yes vote is Scotland’s one opportunity to protect the NHS from Westminster privatisation, create more jobs in Scotland, and transform childcare instead of wasting billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons.’ Today’s YouGov poll also showed that 39 per cent of Scots believed there should not be another referendum if Scotland votes No. Just a quarter of Scots believe say there should be another poll within a decade, while 17 per cent say it should not be for at least another 20 or 30 years. Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, and Alistair Darling, the chairman of Better Together, took part in a live television debate hosted by Bernard Ponsonby at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow last week . Today’s findings follow last week’s TV mauling of Mr Salmond by the Labour MP Mr Darling. The SNP leader was lambasted over his failure to tell voters what would happen if Westminster refused to allow to Scots to use the pound after independence. Following his disastrous TV performance Mr Salmond insisted there was no acceptable 'Plan B' if an independent Scotland is barred from using the British pound. The First Minister said dropping the pound 'implies settling for what's second best' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the UK. Mr Salmond has also reiterated his threat to refuse to pay Scotland's share of the national debt if he is barred from using the pound. He said: 'That means taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be lumbered with up to £5billion a year in debt interest payments. 'And Scotland would start life as an independent country debt-free. That's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union.' The poll, carried out after the live debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling, shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence . During Tuesday’s bruising TV debate with Mr Darling, when Mr Salmond failed to answer questions about his ‘plan B’, the First Minister has claimed ‘it’s Scotland’s pound and we’re keeping it’. Polls following the debate showed that 56 per cent of Yes voters want Mr Salmond to draw up a ‘plan B’, with only 35 per cent content for the First Minister to remain silent. The alternatives are a separate Scottish currency – either pegged to the pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro, or using the pound unilaterally in the way that East Timor and Panama use the U.S. dollar. Keeping the pound is by far the preferred option for Scots, but if a deal is ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular, according to the poll. Mr Salmond has gambled his political future on convincing voters that Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are bluffing when they said they would rule out a currency union. The poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this, and 39 per cent of Scots believe they are telling the truth.","SNP leader faces mountain to climb with just 5 weeks to go until referendum .

Her body was then discovered outside a village in Moradabad district, around three hours from Delhi, police said. Her family say she was raped.

Yesterday, an Indian woman claimed she was gang-raped by four officers at a police station in the state, which is India's most populous with more than 200 million people. The woman said she had gone to the station overnight on Monday in the state's Hamirpur district to seek her husband's release when she was attacked.

They were attacked after going into a field to relieve themselves at night because they did not have a toilet at home. Their families refused to cut the bodies down from the tree for hours in protest, saying police had failed to take action against the attackers because the girls were from a low caste. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged all politicians to work together to protect women, in his first comments on the issue since the hanging of the girls sparked public outrage. Modi warned politicians against 'politicising rape', saying they were 'playing with the dignity of women' in his first speech to parliament since sweeping to power at last month's national elections. India brought in tougher laws last year against sexual offenders after the fatal gang-rape of a student in New Delhi in December 2012, but they have failed to stem the tide of violence against women.","19-year-old suspected rape victim has been found dead in Uttar Pradesh .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke has revealed that he blocked Margaret Thatcher privatising the NHS as Health Secretary in the 1980s. The former Cabinet minister who was sacked in last week's reshuffle said Mrs Thatcher wanted to 'go to the American system' but he refused. Mr Clarke has also lifted the lid on his rows with Number 10 under David Cameron - and how the Tory press office tried to block him going on TV by pretending that he was ill. Ken Clarke has left office with a parting shot at David Cameron - and revelations that the Tories tried to sell off the NHS . Mr Clarke, speaking to the Observer, said he had stand-up rows with Mrs Thatcher over her health proposals. He said: 'I had ferocious rows with her about it. She wanted compulsory insurance, with the state paying the premiums for the less well-off. 'I thought that was a disaster. The American system is hopeless, dreadful.' He also reveals how he had a 'great row' with the Tory head office a few months ago when they told the BBC he was ill and couldn't go on Question Time when, in fact, he was in rude health and raring to go. Mr Clarke said he rang the producer of the show, adding: 'She said ""I'm told you're ill"". After that I got even more freelance.' The former Chancellor also lashed out at the growing euroscepticism in the Tory party. In a parting shot against Mr Cameron he said a vote to leave the EU would leave the Prime Minister a diminished figure on the world stage. He said: 'Being prime minister will be a less important job if we leave the European Union. You'd become a minor player in all kinds of situations.' Deriding the view of Eurosceptics that the UK could forge its own bilateral agreements outside the EU, he says: 'The idea that the United Kingdom could negotiate a serious trade deal with the United States on its own … is ridiculous.' Mr Clarke also downplayed the current economic recovery - and said it had some way to go before it was real. He said housing bubbles followed by collapses remained a British disease that has now spread outside London. Ken Clarke spent three days watching the cricket at Trent Bridge earlier this month, before being sacked from the Cabinet by the Prime Minister . He said: 'I very much hope the British are going to get out of this ludicrous cycle of ridiculous housing booms followed by housing crashes.' Echoing one of the central messages of Labour leader Ed Miliband, he said: 'We don't want to be a low-skills, low-productivity, long-hours economy.' He added: 'We're only halfway through … We've saved the country from calamity but we've got a long way to go before we get a competitive economy, with sustainable levels of growth and all that.'","Clarke says he 'ferocious rows' with the Prime Minister over plan .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron said the Labour leader needed to tell middle earners which taxes he was planning . David Cameron today sparked a furious row with Labour after accusing Ed Miliband of planning a series of tax rises on the middle classes. The Prime Minister said the party's deputy leader Harriet Harman had called on middle earners to 'contribute more' in taxes - pointing to remarks she made in a radio interview. But Labour accuse Mr Cameron of 'lying' and claimed Miss Harman was merely defending the current situation in which the middle classes pay more in tax than the poor. During a fiery Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, Mr Cameron said: 'Labour would put a tax on you jobs, on your mortgage, on your home and on your pension.' He said Miss Harman's remarks showed Labour had a 'big tax problem'. Mr Cameron added: 'The Deputy leader of the Labour party on the radio said this: ""I think people on middle incomes should contribute more through their taxes."" That is what she said. 'That is their policy, the squeezed middle will be squeezed more. Now he needs to tell us which people are going to pay which taxes. 'Because on this side of the House we've cut council tax, we've cut petrol duty, we've cut the jobs tax, we've increased the marriage couple's allowance.' He added: 'Tell us where are the middle income taxes coming.' Middle earners in Britain £26,000 a year - with the average family income is £32,600. Mr Miliband dismissed Mr Cameron's accusations as 'totally desperate'. The Labour leader added: 'He has nothing to say about the cost of living crisis.' He also accused the Prime Minister of overseeing the worst squeeze on living standards in history. It came after figures revealed this morning that pay had gone up by just 0.3 per cent in the year to May - far below inflation at 1.9 per cent. Following the row in the Commons today, Miss Harman wrote to the Prime Minister, accusing him of misrepresenting her comments. She said: 'You claimed at Prime Minister's Questions today that ""yesterday Labour announced - in an important announcement - that it is now their policy to put up taxes on middle income people."" This is not true. It is a lie.' Miss Harman's remarks came on her monthly radio phone in on LBC. Ed Miliband said the Prime Minister's remarks were 'desperate'. Mr Miliband said: 'He has nothing to say about the cost of living crisis.' She was asked by a called what Labour were going to do 'to help the middle classes'. Miss Harman said: 'I would say Henry one of the things that I would argue that should probably make a really big difference to you is having a really good health service. Because you don’t want to have to pay for health insurance. 'You don’t want to have to pay to go private to get really good healthcare system. 'And I think that is not just for working class people it’s for middle class people as well. And the same with education, you know, really good school system that helps people from lower income families and middle income families as well so I think that actually the idea that there are some things that help people on low incomes and other that help people on middle incomes.' She then added: 'Yes I think people on middle incomes should contribute more through their taxes. But actually they need those public services like the transport system.'","Harriet Harman said middle earners should pay more to fund public services .

This . was followed up with more booze – a ‘Commonwealth cocktail’ of . ingredients from 71 countries, which Mr Clegg said was ‘not bad at all’. He also named his . favourite vinegar – balsamic – and shared a tray of empanada, a Spanish . speciality cooked by his wife Miriam and carrying the words ‘Sunday . Brunch’ in dough. Miriam had done most of the work, he said, adding: ‘I assisted throughout. I brushed the thing with egg and chopped and diced.’ But . his efforts were deemed ‘ridiculous’ by Lib Dem activist Charlotte . Henry, who wrote a blog entitled: ‘As the world burned, Nick Clegg . cooked.’ On Saturday the Deputy PM tweeted a picture of himself with an empanada with 'Sunday Brunch' baked in . Tory and . Labour MPs expressed surprise that Mr Clegg, a member of the National . Security Council, was able to devote so much time to the show. Labour MP Grahame . Morris said: 'Nick Clegg displays an alarmingly cavalier indifference . given the seriousness of the situation. He is supposed to be Deputy . Prime Minister, not a contestant on Master Chef.' John Mann added: 'It . sums up Clegg's priorities.' The appearance came as David Cameron held crisis talks with world . leaders over the crisis in Ukraine. The . Prime Minister spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the . French President Francois Hollande, before the Foreign Secretary Philip . Hammond held an emergency meeting of the Government's Cobra committee at . 1pm. But . Mr Clegg, attempting to boost his poll ratings as the party heads for . disaster in the next general election in May, spent the morning on TV. Mr . Clegg's aides defended his decision to appear on the show. A spokesman . said it was a long-standing commitment and that he did not miss any . meetings on the crisis. Mr Clegg tweeted this picture of himself on the show alongside hosts Mr Lovejoy and Mr Rimmer . The . programme, which Mr Clegg’s spokesman said had more than a million . viewers, changed the format for its high-profile guest by interviewing . him about why he went into politics and how his party had fared in . coalition. Asked about Flight MH17, he said it was ‘just heart-breaking’ and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. He also said he was always on duty and that ‘with modern technology … people can always reach you’. The Deputy PM was able to speak to an audience which does not usually watch politics shows . His . spokesman said the Cobra meeting was just for the Foreign Secretary and . officials, not other ministers, but Mr Clegg had been briefed on it. Asked about the weekly sessions of Prime . Minister's Questions, Mr Clegg said: 'I think the whole thing has become . a complete farce.' He added: 'It might have had its time once but this is a place where you can't call people by their name, you have to call them ""right honourable blah blah blah"" or if they have a legal background you have to say ""right honourable, learned"", if they are actually in the Army it's even worse, you have to say 'right honourable, learned, gallant"". 'It's just people... shouting at each other, it's a very concentrated, gladiator, sort of spectacle. 'There are some people who might like it, my own view is most normal people - and most normal people don't follow the ins and outs of politics - find the whole thing totally off-putting. 'This is a place, Westminster, where some of the pomp and ceremony is all right but some of it is just so out of date. This is a place which had a 19th-century shooting gallery but didn't have a creche until quite recently. 'That tells you everything you need to know about a place that is still, by my view, far too stuck in the past.' Defending the decision to form the coalition, he said: 'You can, if you want, stand on the sidelines and throw stones and feel completely pure and you never have to take a difficult decision, you never have to face a difficult dilemma. 'I actually think if I had done that, if my party had done that, actually you would think ""are we ever going to step up to the plate or not?"" 'I personally think the history books will look back and realise that back then, back in 2010 after those debates and everything, people had to step up to the plate because we needed to clear stuff up.' Mr Clegg has faced a barrage of criticism, and his party has suffered in local and European elections, since 2010. Mr Clegg used the show to attack Prime Minister's Questions and share his sympathy with the victims of the MH17 missile attack . The Lib Dem leader said: 'Politics at the end of the day is about the marriage of your ideals, which you have got to hold on to, but also practicality. Sometimes, frankly, they don't fit perfectly well together."" Asked if he had been ready for the attacks he faced in Government, Mr Clegg said: 'It's like any job. You can't prepare for it completely until you start, until you actually do it. 'I absolutely knew that if the Liberal Democrats, for the first time in their history, either went in with Labour or the Conservatives you would really annoy a whole bunch of other people, by definition, because you have got this very polarised, pendulum swing politics - it's either the red team or the blue team and suddenly you've messed it up by the yellow team getting in there as well. 'Did I really imagine some of it would be quite as vitriolic? Perhaps not, but you can't spend all your life answering back to people who just want to insult you, you have just got to get on with the job, and that's what I try to do.'","Deputy PM criticised for spending hours on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The Chancellor George Osborne has seen his approval ratings soar as the economy recovers. But experts have warned that a new crash could be round the corner . The world economy is as vulnerable to a financial crash as it was before the recession hit in 2007, the global bank watchdog has warned. Soaring levels of government debt in Europe and America and easy loans in the developing world have left the global economy in the danger zone, according to the respected Bank for International Settlements. A fresh crash could be devastating for Britain -with debt now more than double what it was in 2007, leaving the Government powerless to intervene. In 2007, Government debt was just 36 per cent of GDP, but has since topped 75 per cent. And despite recent falls in unemployment, the number out of work in Britain is still higher than before the recession struck. The jobless rate has dropped to 6.6 per cent - but this remains more than half a million more than in early 2008. Unemployment jumped from 1.6million - or 5.2 per cent - in early 2008 to a peak of 8.4 per cent or nearly 2.7million in late 2011. But it has fallen rapidly in recent months to just under 2.2million or 6.6 per cent – its lowest level since late 2008 and well below the 7.9 per cent jobless rate the Coalition inherited from Labour. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements said booming economies outside Europe and America were also much more important to the global economy now - so any crash in these countries would have a bigger impact in Britain and elsewhere. China, Brazil, Turkey and other booming economies have seen personal debt levels soar. Their government debt has also increased to an eye-watering 175 per cent of GDP. But at the same time, average borrowing rates are just one per cent - encouraging people to take on even more debt. The bank's chief Jaime Caruana told the Telegraph that easy credit in developing countries could hit their economies hard when it comes to an end. He said: 'Markets seem to be considering only a very narrow spectrum of potential outcomes. 'They have become convinced that monetary conditions will remain easy for a very long time, and may be taking more assurance than central banks wish to give.' He added: 'If we were concerned by excessive leverage in 2007, we cannot be more relaxed today.' The financial sector was hit hard in the 2007 crash. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements has warned that low interest rates in developing countries pose a future risk to the global economy . A fresh global crash would hit Britain hard. Families are already mired in debt - as the above table of the top 10 most indebted British towns shows. Government debt has also soared since 2007 . The bank said the 'ramifications would be particularly serious if China, home to an outsize financial boom, were to falter'. It said: 'Time and again, in both advanced and emerging market economies, seemingly strong bank balance sheets have turned out to mask unsuspected vulnerabilities that surface only after the financial boom has given way to bust.' Government debt in the West is even higher than in poorer, developing countries - hitting 275 per cent of GDP, up 20 per cent since 2007.","Easy loans in the developing world pose a risk to the global economy .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Teachers were celebrating today after Michael Gove was ousted as Education Secretary. The controversial minister was dumped from the Cabinet by David Cameron to become the Government's chief whip in the biggest shock of the reshuffle. Teachers' unions  welcomed the surprise announcement after years of bitter antagonism against his reforms, which culminated in last week's classroom walk out-in a dispute over pay and pensions. Downing Street insisted Mr Gove would play a key role in the run up to the election and had not been demoted - but the decision to move him comes amid increasing evidence that he is 'toxic' with voters. In May a poll for YouGov found he was the most hated politician in the Government. Scroll down for video . Michael Gove was deeply unpopular with teachers and his demotion from the Cabinet was welcomed by unions this morning . During his four-year stint at the Department for Education Mr Gove clashed frequently with the educational establishment he dismissed in private as 'the blob'. Teachers' unions attacked his attempts to introduce far-reaching reforms to England's schools system. He pushed through radical changes to exams, the curriculum, childcare, primary school testing, teachers' pay and league tables. At the same time, Mr Gove spearheaded the introduction of one of the Conservatives' flagship education policies - free schools - and threw the doors open to allow all schools to apply to become academies. But his time in charge has been marked with a spate of strikes - and claims that he wants to take the education system back to the 1950s. Just last week the National Union of Teachers staged the latest in a series of national walkouts in a long-running bitter row over pay, pensions and conditions. Mr Gove will now become 'minister for TV' - and will tour the television studios in the run up to the next election promoting the Government. He will also ensure the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne maintain an 'iron grip' on the Conservative Party over the crucial next nine months. Privately educated Treasury minister Nicky Morgan, 41, will replace Mr Gove as Education Secretary. Mr Gove's removal was welcomed by teaching unions - part of the educational establishment which he reportedly derided in private as 'the blob'. Christine Blower, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers’ union, said: 'Michael Gove has clearly lost the support of the profession and parents for justifiable reasons. 'His vision for education is simply wrong. His pursuit of the unnecessary and often unwanted free schools and academies programme, the use of unqualified teachers, the failure to address the school place crisis and endless ill-thought out reforms to examinations and the curriculum have been his hallmark in office. 'Michael Gove’s search for headlines over speaking to the profession has clearly angered teachers. We remain in dispute over the direction of Government policy, which we believe is undermining the education service. 'We will be seeking a very early meeting with Nicky Morgan, the incoming Education Secretary, and we look forward to not only a new personality but a more conciliatory approach, one that demonstrates an improvement in policy for children, teachers and young people.' General secretary of the Association of Teachers & Lecturers Mary Bousted added: 'David Cameron has belatedly realised that Michael Gove's ideological drive is no substitute for measured, pragmatic reform of the education system. 'Time after time he has chased newspaper headlines rather than engage with teachers. 'The dismantling of the structures which support schools, the antagonism which he displayed to the teaching profession and the increasing evidence of chaos in the bodies he established, in particular the Education Funding Agency, has led Cameron to one conclusion - Gove is more of a liability than an asset. 'Successful education systems value the views of the teaching profession, which Gove insulted when he called them 'the blob'. ATL looks forward to a more constructive relationship with his successor, Nicky Morgan.' The Education Secretary was a lightening rod for the teaching profession's anger over the Government's reforms . Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union said that Ms Morgan is inheriting 'a teaching profession on the brink of a recruitment and retention crisis after an unrelenting assault on teachers' pay, pensions and conditions and their professionalism'. He added: 'Teachers are buckling under the pressure of increased workload and the threat of job loss, and morale is at an all-time low.' Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers was more conciliatory - praising Mr Gove as a 'sincere and radical reformer of education'. But he added: 'He often failed to bring the profession with him, which sometimes meant that his reforms did not land in schools as well as they should have done. 'His diagnosis was often right, but his prescriptions were often hard to swallow.' Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw appeared shocked as he learnt of Mr Gove's departure during a call-in session on LBC Radio. 'I'm surprised and shocked that this has happened. I'm a great admirer of the Secretary of State, I think he's been a transformative and radical minister of education.' Michael Gove's sacking immediately began 'trending' on Twitter - as one of the most talked about events in the country . Mr Gove's move to Chief Whip will be seen in Westminster as a demotion from a job in which he has shown a personal passion for free schools and stringent academic standards but has met fierce opposition from teaching unions. As Chief Whip Gove will not be full member of Cabinet, Number 10 have confirmed. But the Prime Minister's official spokesman this morning rejected accusations that Mr Gove had been demoted. He said: 'I know that the new Chief Whip has been involved in planning for the reshuffle for some time. 'What we have seen Michael Gove achieve over the last four years, a series of landmark reforms in the education system. 'Now, going forward, in the run-up to the general election, the Prime Minister wants Michael Gove, just as William Hague, right at the heart of his government team. 'That’s why he has taken on the role of chief whip, and as part of that you should expect to see a great deal of Michael Gove on you television and radio channels.' Mr Cameron also welcomed his Mrs Morgan's appointment. His spokesman said: ‘He appoints the people who are right for the job and he thinks Nicky Morgan’s track record makes her the right person for that role.’ The spokesman highlighted that Mrs Morgan had championed help with childcare bills while at the Treasury. Public sector workers - including thousands of teachers - marched across the country last week   over pay, pensions and cuts . In the most dramatic reshuffle of his premiership, Mr Cameron also promoted Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to replace William Hague as Foreign Secretary after the surprise announcement last night that the former Tory leader was moving to become Leader of the Commons before quitting as an MP next year. Liz Truss becomes the youngest member of Cabinet at 38 after being appointed Environment Secretary to replace Owen Paterson, who ran into trouble over the failed badger cull and his handling of the winter floods, as well as antagonising green groups with his scepticism about man-made climate change. But Labour described the reshuffle as the 'massacre of the moderates' as a host of right wingers were promoted. Former Treasury minister Nicky Morgan was announced as the new Education Secretary. She is a privately-educated mother of one, who trained as a solicitor . Nicola Ann 'Nicky' Morgan completed her rapid rise to the Cabinet this morning, replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary. The London-born 41-year-old only become an MP in 2010 - representing Loughborough in the East Midlands. She was quickly made a junior whip before becoming a Treasury minister in October and attending the Cabinet in her second role as women's minister - a position she will keep as Education Secretary. Mrs Morgan is a trustee of the Conservative Christian Fellowship and voted against same-sex marriage because of her faith. This is widely seen as the the reason Mr Cameron split the women and equalities brief last year - leading to accusations that she was the 'minister for straight women'. Teachers celebrating Mrs Morgan's rise may be left disappointed - as she has strongly backed every single education reform pushed through by Mr Gove. She voted very strongly for free schools, academies and tuition fee increases. The Tory minister has also never attended state school herself - attending the exclusive £4,701-a-year Surbiton High School in south west London. Mrs Morgan went on to study law at Oxford before becoming a high flying city lawyer in 1996.","Michael Gove made chief whip and will no longer be a full member of Cabinet .

On average the bosses of Britain's 100 biggest companies took home £4.7million last year - up from £4.1million the year before, according to the High Pay Centre. Ordinary workers, meanwhile, earned £26,884. The gap between bosses and workers has soared over the past 20 years - from just 60 times the average wage in the 1990s. Bosses of Britain's 100 biggest companies earned £4.7million last year - 180 times the average worker . The High Pay Centre today urged to take 'radical action' to close the gap, such as requiring firms to cap executive pay at a fixed multiple of their lowest paid employees. It said shareholders were still signing off soaring executive pay despite being given the power to vote them down at annual meetings. The think tank said trust in business was being damaged by the perception that an executive 'elite' were reaping all the rewards from economic growth. High Pay Centre director Deborah Hargreaves said: 'It's time to get serious about tackling the executive pay racket. The Government's tinkering won't bring about a proper change in the UK's pay culture. 'We need to build an economy where people are paid fair and sensible amounts of money for the work that they do and the incomes of the super-rich aren't racing away from everybody else. 'A maximum pay ratio would recognise the important principle that all workers should share in a company's success and that gaps between those at the top and low and middle earners cannot just get wider and wider.' The gap between City bosses and ordinary workers has soared over the past 20 years, the High Pay Committee said . While FTSE chiefs take home millions each year, ordinary families are sinking into debt. A report last week revealed how Southampton, Peterborough and Newcastle were the most indebted places in the country . A Business Department spokesman said: 'The Government has introduced comprehensive reforms to give shareholders more powers in order to restore the link between top pay and performance, which in recent years has become excessive and increasingly disconnected. 'We've seen chief executive pay increase substantially over the past three decades, with CEOs earning 139 times the average employee in 2011, up from 47 in 1998. It's only in the last few years that we're beginning to see more restraint applied.'","Bosses of FTSE 100 firms took home £4.7million on average last year .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Southampton, Peterborough and Newcastle are Britain's worst debt blackspots, figures released today show. At the end of 2013, people living in and around Southampton were £1,880 in debt per person - the highest in the country. Peterborough was the second hardest hit town in the UK - with people  owing £1,869. Newcastle sits third in the debt league, with personal debt levels of £1,550 per head. Britain's personal loan hotspots, marked on the map, highlight how easy credit has hit families across the country . Today's figures also show that of Britain's £902 billion-worth of  mortgage debt, around a quarter was held in London. When the rest of the South East is included - almost half of all Britain's mortgage debt is held in thw wider area around the capital. In Wales, the total amount of mortgage debt was just £28.6 billion at the end of last year - which comes to just under the combined home loan debts in  South West London alone - at £29.7 billion. In Scotland, the total outstanding mortgage debt was £64.3 billion. The mortgage and personal loan data has been provided by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, Santander, RBS, and Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks. Today's figures came after it was revealed that Britain’s household debt mountain had already hit a record high. At the end of last year it had soared to £1.43trillion, the Bank of England revealed. Personal debt has risen steadily since the financial crash, and is now higher than the previous record seen five years ago. The top 10 most indebted towns in the country range from Southampton on south coast to Manchester, Newcastle and Preston in the north and Galashiels in Scotland . The Bank of England said personal debt has risen again to £1.43trillion, higher than the previous record seen in 2008 . The increase is seen as a sign of increased consumer confidence, as the economic recovery gathers pace, but it could also mean more people relying on credit to make ends meet. The amount of money owed by individuals in October last year stood at £1,4trillion the Bank said. It is £29million higher than the previous high of £1,429,595,000,000 seen in September 2008, just before the financial crash hit. But new figures show that £1.27trillion is now owed in mortgages and £158million in consumer credit.","People in Southampton owe £1,880 each - the highest in the country .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron was today accused of doling out honours to former ministers sacked in the reshuffle in a bid to 'sweeten the pill of dismissal'. The Prime Minister is preparing to recommend that two Tory MPs be made Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Former international development minister Alan Duncan and ex foreign office minister Hugh Robertson are in line for the honour, according to reports today. David Cameron was accused of an 'abuse' of the honours system for doling our knighthoods to sacked ministers to 'sweeten the pill of dismissal' Oliver Heald, who was Solicitor General until Monday, will also get a knighthood. Veteran minister Ken Clarke, 74, meanwhile, is in line to become a Companion of Honour - one of the highest honours available, according to the Evening Standard. This top honour is reserved for the Queen and just 65 other members. The honour is awared for service of national importance and Mr Clarke will join illustrous company including the painter Lucian Freud, Professor Stephen Hawking, naturalist Sir David Attenborough, and ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major. In Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Cameron defended handing out knighthoods. He said: 'I want a team that reflects modern Britain. I make no apology for saying I think in public life we should recognise public service.' His remarks came after Labour's Jonathan Reynolds had asked: 'Can the Prime Minister now explain why he’s given more knighthoods to men that he’s sacked than he’s appointed women to the Cabinet?' Labour MP Stephen Pound accused the Prime Minister of abusing his power. He said: 'I’ve nothing against long-service medals but using honours to sweeten the pill of dismissal is an abuse.' Alan Duncan (left) and Hugh Robertson (right) were sacked in this week's reshuffle, but are now in line for a knighthood . Sarah Champion, MP for Rotherham, added: 'David Cameron has now sacked and then knighted more men than he’s appointed women to the Cabinet. 'This patronage for the old boys’ club shows just how out of touch Cameron is. Dishing out honours and gongs as golden goodbyes to keep his sacked ministers happy not only undermines the honours process, but also shows yet again how the Prime Minister overlooks and forgets about women.'","Tories Alan Duncan, Oliver Heald, and Hugh Robertson set to be knighted .

The prospect of a Monaco-style F1 Grand Prix on the streets of London has moved a step closer after the coalition announced new powers for Town Halls to stage motor races. Councils will be able to sign off major motor races on public roads for the first time, instead of needing to get specific approval from Parliament. Unveiling the move as he opened Williams' new F1 engineering facility in Oxfordshire, David Cameron said it would mean 'more races, more events, more money coming into our country'. Scroll down for video . The London Grand Prix route is likely to come past Parliament before turning left down the Embankment on the north side of the river . Planning ahead: A detailed 3.2 mile Formula 1 circuit is believed to have drawn up by Bernie Eccleston . He added: 'We're going to change the rules so that local councils are able to make the decision so you don't have to have a private member's Bill through Parliament, which we think will be great news for British motor sport.' 'More races, more events, more money coming into our country and more success for this extraordinary industry.' The Prime Minister said F1 was 'an amazing success story, eight of the 11 teams based here in the United Kingdom, 41,000 people working in the industry in the Oxford area alone, working for about 4,300 companies'. 'It really is something we should celebrate. It seems to me it's an industry that is in good heart and good spirit with incredible investment, permanent improvement, taking place.' The idea of a Monaco-style Grand Prix on the streets of London has been mooted for some time - with F1 team sponsor Santander even producing a video of what it might look like. Boris Johnson has signalled he is ready to support a project. The Government's announcement follows a consultation earlier this year, and the change is expected to be added to the Deregulation Bill in the autumn. It could be in force before the general election next year. The Prime Minister's spokesman said local authorities would be obliged to consult local people and ensure all necessary safety precautions were in place. While it will significantly open up the opportunities for hill climbs, motorbike races, and rallies across rural Britain, the biggest impact could be in paving the way for a Formula One race which passes Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. Billionaire race boss Bernie Ecclestone believes a London Grand Prix could become the most iconic race in the motorsport calendar - supplanting Monaco as the jewel in the F1 crown . Lewis Hamilton last week won the the British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit, but in future he could have the chance to win twice on home soil . The race is a long-held ambition of Bernie Ecclestone, the 83-year-old motorsport supremo, and Jenson Button, the driver. Mr Ecclestone has even previously said he would be prepared to foot the bill race, given it could even overtake Monte Carlo as the jewel in Formula One’s crown. Button, who fronted a major campaign for the race with his then team-mate Lewis Hamilton in 2012, said earlier this year: 'The thought of a race through the capital’s streets was only a dream when they initiated the project, but changes to the law bring the idea a step closer to reality.' The measure also clears the way for the hosting of Formula E, the all-electric car championship, in Britain, with a race planned for next summer in Battersea Park.","PM says he will pass new law letting councils close roads for motor races .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband is 'lobbying hard' for a one-to-one White House meeting with Barack Obama in a bid to convince voters he is a Prime Minister in waiting, it was claimed today. The Labour leader allegedly hopes his links with the US President's former advisor David Axelrod will smoothe the way for a meeting in Washington. But Mr Miliband's success blocking Britain's involvement in military action in Syria has left 'bruises' in Washington, a former senior aide to Mr Obama has revealed. Labour leader Ed Miliband is said to be desperate for a one-to-one meeting with US President Barack Obama, in a bid to boost his image as a Prime Minister in waiting . PJ Crowley, a former Assistant Secretary of State, said Mr Miliband’s opposition to strikes on Syria had angered the White House. He said: 'I’m sure there are some bruises from the experience of last Fall. The rejection in the House of Commons did have ripple effects here in terms of how the president confronted the prospect of a military strike against Syria. It did alter the President’s strategy.' Mr Miliband was accused of 'playing politics' with the vote over Syria - after first indicating to the Prime Minister that he would back strikes before withdrawing Labour's support. Mr Cameron's Commons defeat forced the US President to step back from military action, with only the French left backing armed intervention. Ed Miliband's team was delighted after the French President Francois Hollande broke protocol to meet the Labour leader outside the Elysee Palace in Paris in 2012 . Mr Miliband has hired former Obama aide David Axelrod as an election advisor and hoped his links to the US President will help smoothe the way for a White House meeting . Mr Crowley added that the President may not find the time for Mr Miliband - even if the Labour leader turned up in Washington. A Labour spokesman said the report, aired on the BBC this morning, was just 'speculation'. But according to the report, Mr Miliband is 'very keen' to meet the US President before May’s election. Mr Miliband met the US President at Buckingham Palace when Mr Obama visited the UK on a State Visit in May 2011. Tony Blair was the last leader of the opposition to get a meeting with a US President. In 1996, Mr Blair was pictured with Bill Clinton in the White House . Neil Kinnock's meeting with Ronald Reagan in 1986 was a disaster for the Labour leader after the US President attacked the party's policy on nuclear disarmament . But a White House meeting would spark memories of Tony Blair's successful talks with Bill Clinton in 1996 - a year before sweeping to victory. Labour were said to be delighted after French President Francois Hollande posed with Mr Miliband outside the Elysée Palace in Paris. Mr Blair was the last leader of the Opposition to be welcomed to the White House. During a press call afterwards, journalists asked President Clinton: 'Do you hope that you’re sitting next to the next Prime Minister of the UK?' Mr Clinton, who was facing re-election, replied: 'I just hope he’s sitting next to the next President of the United States.' Pictures of the Barack Obama and David Cameron, like this one at a US basketball match in 2012, are valued in Downing Street . Labour leader Ed Miliband is 'very keen' for a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, according to the BBC . Mr Cameron has cultivated a close relationship with the US President, despite the traditional ties between the US Democrats and the Labour party . Jonathan Powell, who organised Mr Blair's trip, told the BBC: 'It’s the nearest that a leader of an opposition gets to a job interview. It has to go right. If it goes wrong, there are very serious consequences back home.' He said Mr Miliband should not organise the meeting in Washington unless he can be certain that it will go well - otherwise his chances of becoming Prime Minister could be damaged irrevocably. Mr Powell said Neil Kinnock’s meeting with President Reagan in 1986 went 'disastrously wrong' after the White House attacked Labour’s stance on nuclear disarmament. Tory MP Priti Patel said Mr Miliband's bid for a meeting with President Obama was 'pretty desperate'. She said: 'Ed Miliband’s scrambling around for a date with Obama – it’s obviously a last-ditch attempt to rescue his flagging public image. 'But it will take more than begging for a photo op with the American President to convince the British public he could be PM.'","Reports claim Miliband wants to hold talks with President in Washington .

Devon and Cornwall Commissioner Tony Hogg spent £7,617 in 16 months on products to publicise his work, figures have revealed. Mr Hogg’s office said the items were to 'encourage participation' from members of the public. Devon and Cornwall crime commissioner Tony Hogg has been criticised for spending more than £7,000 on promotional materials . The former Royal Navy commander spent by the cash between November 2012 and March this year. Other items bought by Mr Hogg also included pens, notepads, leaflets, and posters. The spending emerged after a family in Barnstaple, Devon demanded to know how much he was spending after their son came back from school with some of Mr Hogg's promotional gear. The boy’s father, Jay Duggan, said students were given a talk about Mr Hogg’s work, and items were handed out. Mr Duggan said: 'I believe that the money would be better used by the actual police, as opposed to fuelling his vain justification of his job.' Nigel Rabbitts, of the Police Federation in Devon and Cornwall, which represents officers up to the rank of chief inspector, said: 'How Tony Hogg spends money is an ongoing concern. 'Any increase in bureaucratic spending means less money for police officers in the community.' During the same period, commissioner Sue Mountstevens in neighbouring Avon and Somerset spent £2,626 on promotional materials. In Dorset, Martyn Underhill spent £7,420. Mr Hogg’s office said spending on such items was 'carefully-costed'. It said: 'We have a responsibility to consult on a wide variety of issues with local people, and we believe that it is therefore appropriate to encourage participation by providing a range of literature about the work we do, and offer some small items that advertise our contact details. 'We are no different to many other public-facing, and funded, organisations in this regard.' Theresa May introduced police and crime commissioners in 2012 to give the public more say over how their local forces are run. But they have been dismissed as a waste of money and Labour has vowed to scrap them . Elected police and crime commissioners were introduced by the Government in 2012 to give the public more of a say over how their local forces are run. Some 41 were elected with the power to hire and fire chief constables and control over a combined police budget of £8billion. The role of the PCCs is to be the voice of the people and hold the police to account. But they were elected on a turnout of just 15 per cent. Labour said they had a 'derisory public mandate' and were born out of a 'increasingly poisonous' relationship between Tory MPs and the police. But Exeter Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said: 'Labour opposed police and crime commissioners as a wasteful distraction at a time when the police were having to impose deep cuts on the service. 'Their performance has not generally impressed and I'm pleased Labour is committed to replacing them with a cheaper and more representative system of police accountability through police boards to release much needed money for front line policing.' Mr Hogg was elected in November 2012 in a ballot which saw just fifteen per cent of people across the two counties turn out to vote. He has previously been criticised for having more staff and spending more money than the former police authority. Mr Hogg has 20 people working for him, while the previous authority had 17. The Tory crime commissioner, who picked up a salary of £85,000, is a retired sailor who spent more than 30 years in the Royal Navy. He served in the Falklands War and in the Gulf and was commanding officer of RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, reaching the rank of commodore.","Devon and Cornwall police and crime commissioner Tony Hogg under fire .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The Government is considering making it illegal not to report  child abuse, David Cameron revealed today. The Prime Minister's remarks came after NSPCC chief Peter Wanless said it should be a crime for someone to keep abuse secret in order to protect an organisation or an individual's reputation. Mr Cameron, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions today, said: 'Should we change the law so there is a requirement to report and make it a criminal offence not to report? 'The Government is currently looking at that and of course both reviews will be able to examine this particular point and advise us accordingly.' But he added: 'I think it may well be time to take that sort of step forward.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister said the Government was considering plans to change the law on reporting child abuse . Mr Cameron suggested he favoured changing the law to make it illegal not to report child abuse . Individuals and organisations could be placed under a legal obligation to report child abuse . Home Secretary Theresa May had earlier left the door open to a change in the law in response to allegations that politicians, and institutions including the government, the BBC, the NHS and the Church were part of an Establishment cover-up of decades of sexual abuse. In a major change in policy, Mr Wanless, who is leading a review into the Home Office's handling of abuse allegations, said he now backed so-called 'mandatory reporting' of abuse. Mr Wanless told the BBC: 'If someone consciously knows that there is a crime committed against a child, and does nothing about it because they put the reputation of the organisation above the safety of that child, that should be a criminal offence.' He also backed the idea of imposing a duty on hospitals, boarding schools and children's homes to report abuse. As recently as March the NSPCC said it was opposed to 'blanket mandatory reporting'. The charity previously said it felt 'criminal sanction against those who hesitate is unfair', but added that the law should focus on people in positions of responsibility who have failed to act. The government has ordered two inquiries in response to growing public concern about the way allegations of abuse were dealt with. Mr Wanless is examining how the Home Office dealt with records dating from 1979, after it emerged 114 relevant files are missing, presumed to have been destroyed. A separate, more wide-ranging, inquiry into how abuse was dealt with in every corner of society is being carried out by a panel chaired by former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss. Home Secretary Theresa May says the wide-ranging inquiry into abuse will examine mandatory reporting . Former Tory Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan has urged the government to consider mandatory reporting of abuse as part of the reviews. 'As there is still no duty to report suspected abuse, .... the inquiries [should] look again at mandatory reporting of suspected abuse in regulated activities. 'I have already discussed that with the for Education and hope that the Home Secretary will take it up as well.' In the Commons, Mrs May indicated that she expects the panel inquiry to examine whether there are 'any gaps in what we currently do that mean we are not properly protecting children and, if there are, what appropriate mechanisms could be put in place to ensure that those gaps are filled'. The prospect of mandatory reporting has been welcomed by other charities. Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: 'I think this is a really significant U-turn for the NSPCC and hugely welcome - it's a big step in the right direction.' A lawyer who represents 176 victims of disgraced television personality and serial abuser Jimmy Savile welcomed the NSPCC's turnaround. Liz Dux, a lawyer with Slater & Gordon, said: 'The NSPCC's backing for mandatory reporting is a welcome and significant moment in our fight to protect future children from predators like Savile, Harris, Smith and Hall. 'This, coupled with an announcement earlier this week by Theresa May that an independent inquiry is to be held, signals we are moving in the right direction - the victims will take some heart. 'Universally the victims I work with say they want change, they support mandatory reporting. 'We must not pass up this opportunity to protect our children and we must not delude ourselves that outrages like these ones will never happen again - if we don't act they could. Ms Dux called for mandatory reporting to be brought in in open institutions such as schools, as well as closed institutions. 'I would urge the NSPCC to go one step further and back mandatory reporting for both open and closed institutions,' she said. 'There are examples where mandatory reporting would have stopped offenders in open institutions as well, why should the children there not be afforded the same safeguards?'","Prime Minister said ministers are considering a change in the law .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Birmingham schools were targeted by hard line Muslim governors in a 'planned and orchestrated' plot to radicalise pupils, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs today. He said headteachers in the city had told him that schools were being 'infiltrated' by extremists in a bid to take over the day to day running. The remarks come after Education Secretary Michael Gove said Birmingham City Council had questions to answer over claims it ignored warnings about the 'Trojan Horse' plot to takeover schools. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, told MPs that eight or nine headteachers had told him there was a plot to take over the day to day running of schools . Education Committee chair Graham Stuart said political parties like the Conservatives and Labour had always tried to influence the way schools were run . Speaking to MPs on the Education Select Committee this morning, Sir Michael was asked to explain what evidence there was that previously 'outstanding' schools had been targeted by Islamic extremists. He said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated. 'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target. They believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies. 'They believed governing boards couldn't take place in the normal way. They believed all that was planned and orchestrated. This was all in Birmingham.' He said in the future he wanted to see inspectors in schools once every three years - instead of one inspection in five years today. But when asked by MPs if pupils had been radicalised in the schools, Sir Michael said: 'We didn't see that. The issue of extremism was outside of our remit.' The Ofsted chief inspector told MPs: 'What we did see was the promotion of a culture, which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism.' He added: 'What we did see was governors coming into schools to move staff and for governors of the school to promote their ideas. It was distressing for me as an ex-headteacher to see teachers being treated that way.' Sir Michael confirmed that Ofsted has been looking at around 20 schools across England that have been downgraded from outstanding to inadequate due to 'failings in governance'. Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, he said: 'We are looking at other schools where this might be a problem. We’ve certainly been to schools in Bradford and Luton.' Sir Michael's appearance at the Commons came after the Education Secretary this weekend said it was essential extremists were not given an a platform to radicalise pupils. Speaking to MPs on the Education Select Committee this morning, Sir Michael was asked to explain what evidence there was that previously 'outstanding' schools had been targeted by Islamic extremists. He said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated. 'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target.

Sir Michael's appearance at the Commons came after the Education Secretary this weekend said it was essential extremists were not given an a platform to radicalise pupils . Former top counter-terror police officer Peter Clarke was asked to review the handling of extremism in schools over more than a decade . A major report by former top counter-terror police officer Peter Clarke is expected to criticise officials in Birmingham and Whitehall for failing to act on concerns about teaching in some schools. Head teachers told Ofsted there was an organised campaign to impose a ‘narrow, faith-based ideology’ at some schools in the city. It placed five of the city’s schools in special measures after ‘deeply worrying’ findings. Mr Clarke was brought in to carry out a review of the way complaints were handled an acted upon during more than a decade. The inquiry has identified up to 25 state schools, some directly run by the council, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Mr Gove told BBC One’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘There are broader questions about the extent to which these activities were coordinated and the extent to which those responsible for these activities may have had a broader agenda. ‘Peter is looking into that and we have to wait to see what he concludes... ‘There are questions for the local authority and of course for my department, the Department for Education about what was known and what was done.’ He defended his decision to appoint Mr Clarke, the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism, to lead the investigation. ‘There was some criticism, right at the beginning of this process, when I appointed Peter. People felt that it was in some respects, too dramatic and authoritarian a step. 'But the view that I took was if you have a police officer of unimpeachable integrity to conduct these investigations, if people are at the end of this process cleared, given a clean bill of health, then that is the most effective way of ensuring that public confidence can be restored.’ Mr Clarke’s report is expected to be published later this summer. The government has announced that schools will be shut down if they fail to promote British values. Mr Gove called for a 'robust' defence of liberal values in the face of the challenge from Islamist extremists. 'Islamism is a perversion of Islam in the same way that communism was a perversion of socialism and fascism is a perversion of nationalism,' he said.","Eight or nine headteachers told him schools were being 'infiltrated'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron today said he would be heart broken if Scotland voted for independence. The Prime Minister, speaking in Perth, told Scottish Tories the campaign to keep the UK together was 'an issue of the heart'. He said: 'It would break my heart to see our United Kingdom break apart.' Mr Cameron the ‘silent majority’ who reject Scottish independence to stand up against nationalist bullyboys. David Cameron addresses party activists in Perth, Scotland today as he campaigned to keep the union together . Voters in Scotland are due to decide whether Scotland stays in the Union in an independence referendum on September 18. Mr Cameron said: 'If Scotland walks away from the United Kingdom and votes for separation, it's not for a trial period, it would be permanent.' He said: 'Why is it suddenly a good idea to make your sister working in Edinburgh or your brother working in London living in a foreign country? 'Why is it suddenly a good idea to split away from the organisations that have helped this country be everything it is in our world today? 'I don't think they have made a powerful case at all and I think they have left every single key question unanswered.' Mr Cameron said there is no certainty about what currency an independent Scotland would use, if it would be a member of both the European Union and Nato, and what the costs of leaving the UK would be. 'None of the key questions have been answered,"" Mr Cameron insisted. 'It's extraordinary when you think how long Alex Salmond has planned this moment. He's had years to think of the answers but yet with 77 days to go you can see he is Alex the unready - not a clue about the enormous gamble he would be taking with our nation's future.' The Prime Minister insisted the ‘noise of the nationalist few’ risks drowning out those with a quiet, deep belief in the future of the United Kingdom. He accused the Scottish government of using ‘threats and warnings’ to try to prevent business chiefs speaking out about the dangers of voting for independence in a referendum due to take place on September 18. There has been increasing scrutiny of the tactics used by an army of so-called ‘cybernats’ - nationalist internet bullies who pour bile over anyone who dares to oppose their cause. Author J K Rowling was branded ‘w***e’, a ‘c***’ and a ‘union cow’ on Twitter last month after giving £1 million to the ‘no’ campaign and urging Scots to stay in the UK. After Bill Munro, founder of the firm Barrhead Travel, warned of the ‘impending disaster’ of a ‘yes’ vote, the cybernats took to social media sites to insist they would never use his firm again. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘A huge amount of pressure is being put on businesses by the Scottish Government, with all sorts of threats and warnings against speaking out and saying what they believe is the truth. ‘I come across business leader after business leader - large and small in Scotland - who wants to keep our United Kingdom together and thinks it would be crazy to have border controls, different currencies and split up our successful United Kingdom. ‘I urge them to speak out, talk with their work forces about the strength of our United Kingdom and then vote to keep it together.’ Mr Cameron, who has Scottish ancestry, said he would be left 'heartbroken' if the country voted to leave the UK . First Minister Alex Salmond, who met the Queen at Holryroodhouse this week, has seen support for independence fall to just 35 per cent in recent polls . Nearly half of Scots believe Alex Salmond should resign if he loses September's referendum, according to a new poll. Even a quarter of those who voted for the SNP in 2011 think the First Minister should stand down, the figures suggest. But Mr Salmond has already insisted that he plans to stand at the next Holyrood election, regardless of the referendum result. 'Whatever the political circumstances, there will be an election in 2016 and the people will choose the First Minister,' he said recently. However, the Scottish Daily Mail revealed that one high-profile Nationalist said: 'If there is a No vote, Salmond is gone. 'It doesn't matter how close the result is. If we lose, he will have failed and will stand aside. That is certain.' Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is the only obvious candidate to succeed Mr Salmond and earlier this year she finally admitted she would like the top job. The YouGov poll shows that 45 per cent of Scots believe Mr Salmond should resign if the country rejects independence, and 41 per cent believe he should continue as First Minister. Among Yes supporters, about 12 per cent believe that Mr Salmond should stand down in this scenario, rising to 24 per cent of those who voted SNP at the 2011 election. The poll also shows that only a third of Scots believe the online debate about independence has been conducted in a 'polite and respectful' manner.  Thirty-two per cent of respondents said online supporters of the Yes campaign are 'mostly' or 'almost entirely' rude and aggressive. Meanwhile, 21 per cent said the same of No supporters. Addressing a rally in Scotland today, Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve heard the noise of the nationalist few, but now it is time for the voices of the silent majority to be heard,’ he is expected to say. ‘The silent majority who feel happy being part of the UK; the silent majority who don’t want the risks of going it alone; the silent majority who worry about what separation would mean for their children and grandchildren.' Mr Cameron will add: ‘With 77 days to go, we need the voices of the many to ring out across the land. For each one to realise that they are not alone because there are millions just like them. ‘And this is how we rouse them to find their voice. We tell them: we’ve achieved so much together; we’re safer together; we’re better off together; we’ve got the best of both worlds together. ‘And finally let’s tell them this: You can be proudly Scottish and want to stay in the UK. ‘Too many people in this country have been made to feel that you can’t be a proud Scot and say “no thanks”. You’ve got to choose between the Saltire and the Union flag. ‘That is wrong. Loving your country means wanting the best for it – and for Scotland that is staying in the UK. So yes – you can be a patriotic Scot and vote no.’ Blair Jenkins, chief executive of the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, said: ‘David Cameron is seriously out of touch if he thinks there is a silent majority in Scotland in favour of the Tories and their austerity agenda. 'The reality is there is a very vocal majority against David Cameron governing Scotland, with just a single Tory MP here. ‘Thanks to the Westminster system, another 30,000 children in Scotland have been pushed into poverty because of Tory welfare cuts - yet the Westminster parties want to spend up to £4 billion a year on new Trident nuclear weapons. 'Nothing better illustrates the need for a Yes vote in September, so that we can put bairns before bombs.’ Author J K Rowling was branded 'w***e', a 'c***' and a 'union cow'on Twitter last month after giving £1 million to the 'no' campaign and urging Scots to stay in the UK . Business for Scotland chief executive Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp said: ‘David Cameron is repeating the same old tired UK line about businesses being afraid to speak up but business people across Scotland are already speaking up and don’t feel at all intimidated. ‘The Prime Minister… might be having difficulty getting businesses to speak up for no because the message they’re trying to sell is simply not credible.’ Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond yesterday claimed that rejecting independence would leave Scotland subject to public spending cuts. ‘Anything other than a vote for independence would be a vote for continuing Conservative austerity, no matter which Westminster party wins the 2015 election,’ he wrote in a letter to Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. But a spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘It is not credible for [Mr Salmond] to suggest that Scotland’s finances would be stronger as a separate country. Every independent expert forecaster agrees that a separate Scotland would have a deficit double the size the UK’s.’ The latest polls suggest the no campaign maintains a strong lead. A YouGov poll this week showed 54 per cent of Scots intend to vote no to independence, and 35 per cent yes, with 11 per cent undecided.","Prime Minister said independence 'would break my heart'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The passport chaos threatening to ruin thousands of family holidays has got worse over the past month - despite a raft of emergency measures introduced by the Government to tackle the backlog of applications. Passport Office chief Paul Pugh told MPs this afternoon that the number of applications in the backlog had soared by 25,000 to 508,000 since June. But Mr Pugh, appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, insisted his staff were getting on top of the problem. He added: 'The Passport Office is not in chaos.' He also revealed that despite the growing chaos, the Passport Office was in line to make a £50million 'surplus' this year. Passport Office chief told MPs this afternoon that the number of applications waiting to be processed had grown over the last month . Mr Pugh arriving at Portcullis House this afternoon ahead of his grilling by the Home Affairs Select Committee grilling . Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham . Mr Pugh, who earns more than £100,000 a year, said there were 483,000 applications waiting to be processed on June 1. But by June 22 the figure had grown to 537,663. He said the number had since dropped to 508,000. Chair of the committee Keith Vaz said: 'Work in progress is going up. The number of passports issued is going down.' Mr Pugh accepted the number of applications waiting to be processed had increased since he last appeared in Parliament, but said: 'We are doing our best to meet urgent travel needs for our customers.' The Passport Office chief last month told MPs that of the 483,000 applications waiting to be processed, around 55,000 would not be sent out on time. Mr Pugh was challenged over the soaring amount of money being spent on overtime to clear the backlog. Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Passport Office was on course to spend £5million this year on overtime. He said: 'The level of overtime has doubled. Surely that's freakish?' Mr Pugh said: 'I would not disagree with your description of it being a freakish level of overtime.' The exchange came after MailOnline revealed staff at the Passport Office had clocked up nearly a million pounds worth of overtime in May. After extra staff were drafted in to deal with crisis - with some working seven days a week - overtime costs hit £964,742  in May, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said. The revelation, which will infuriate the thousands of families who face missing their holidays this year, came after the Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to apologise for the chaos. The Passport Office said it has been dealing with the highest demand in 12 years, with a surge  in applications catching it by surprise. Those who desperately need travel documents have been told that they can get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days. Minister have also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension. Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get. Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service. The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved. Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved. The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application. But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free. British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents. And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary has announced. But it emerged  that nearly three quarters of countries will not accept the 12 month emergency extensions. Only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports. Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published on the Government website 'gov.uk'. The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports. The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high. The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor. Passport office workers have also been forced to speak out over the pressure they are being put under to clear the backlog. One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point. Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the 500,0000 backlog of applications. He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.' The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out. 'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue. 'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired. 'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.' He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.' The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'. Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed .","Passport Office chief Paul Pugh said the application backlog had grown .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ministers today revealed they had refused to sack the head of the Student Loans Company - despite revelations thousands of graduates had been sent Wonga style letters from fake law firms demanding money. Student Loans Company chairman Christian Brodie apologised to ministers and offered to resign over the 'misleading' letters sent out by the agency in an attempt to recover debts. The 'clear and unequivocal' apology came in a meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable last week, but Mr Brodie's resignation was not accepted. Business Secretary Vince Cable (right) turned down Student Loans Company chief Christian Brodie's resignation, the Universities Minister David Willetts (left) revealed today . Wonga was forced to hand out around £2.6million to customers in compensation for sending fake debt collection letters . The Government agency sent out letters under the name of Smith Lawson and Company Recovery Services - a firm it set up - demanding repayment for graduates that were in arrears. But in a Commons statement today, the universities minister David Willetts said ministers believed Mr Brodie had a 'very important' job to do at the Student Loans Company - and claimed it would be unfair for him to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old. More than 300,000 graduates received letters from Smith Lawson and Company over a 10-year period, it has emerged. The system was stopped on June 27, following the Financial Conduct Authority's public condemnation of payday lender Wonga for similar 'aggressive and misleading practices'. Like the Student Loans Company, Wonga sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action. The firm - which is the UK’s biggest lender - agreed to pay £2.6million in compensation to customers for making up the law firms to pressure debtors into paying up. It sent bogus letters from made up law firms ‘Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon’ and Lowe Legal Recoveries’ to mislead customers into believing their outstanding debt had been passed to lawyers. Despite condemnation from MPs over Wonga's behaviour at the time, Government minister Mr Willetts today backed the Student Loans Company. In a Commons statement he said: 'Christian Brodie, the chairman of the SLC made a clear and unequivocal apology on behalf of the company in a discussion with the Secretary of State on Thursday July 3. I also spoke to Mr Brodie on Thursday to investigate what had happened. 'Mr Brodie tendered his resignation as chairman to the Secretary of State but this was not accepted. The Secretary of State and I have confidence in his leadership of the Student Loans Company. The multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin (pictured), has been criticised over his former company's decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers . 'We see Mr Brodie having a very important job to do at the SLC to oversee the significant investment the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) is making in the company to enable it to transform its products and operations and overall levels of customer service. 'We are both clear that it would be unfair for Mr Brodie to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old, particularly as he had only been chairman since he joined in February of this year.' The Student Loans Company has been issuing letters to graduates who fall into arrears on their repayments under the name of Smith Lawson and Company since 2005, Mr Willetts said. In total, about 309,000 people received letters, which were sent to individuals who had failed to respond to several contact attempts by the SLC. The practice, which was seen as a 'low-cost alternative' to referring these graduates to debt collection agencies, was approved in late 2004 by the SLC's board at the time and ministers under the Labour government, Mr Willetts said. He insisted that the approach was not known to him or Mr Cable before recent media coverage of the issue. While the Student Loans Company had not broken any rules or charged graduates for receiving the letters, Mr Willetts said, he added that 'it was clear that a public body should be holding itself to the highest standards in the treatment of its customers'. He said: 'It is important that the Government recover taxpayers' money, but it must do so in a way which is fair. 'It must not use misleading tactics to get people to do the right thing. The SLC has apologised and now stopped issuing letters under the Smith Lawson trading name. I will be working with the company to ensure that lessons are learnt to ensure there is no repeat in future.'","Business Secretary Vince Cable turned down Christian Brodie's resignation .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Mass immigration from Eastern Europe has driven down wages in parts of Britain and put pressure on essential services, the Government's official advisors have warned. A new report by the Migration Advisory Committee said some areas of the country are 'struggling to cope' with high levels of immigration that have put pressures on public services like the NHS, schools and transport. The committee found in some areas of the country where there has been an influx of foreign workers there was a 'negative impact on the wages of the low paid'. It also attacked the weak 'compliance and enforcement' of the minimum wage - with poor inspections and 'feeble' penalties. The report added: 'An employer can expect a visit from HMRC once every 250 years and a prosecution once in a million years'. The Migration Advisory Committee's report showed how more Britons were leaving  than moving back to the country from abroad. At the same time around 200,000 foreigners came to the UK every year . The report also revealed that low skilled men and women had been badly hit since 1997. In total, there are now a million fewer low skilled British workers in jobs than there were when Labour came to powert . Home Secretary Theresa May's official immigration advisors today warned that poorly paid workers in some parts of Britain were seeing their wages eroded by cheap foreign labour . The Migration Advisory Committee attacked the education system for failing to prepare children for work. It said this was leaving British youngsters unable to compete against better qualified immigrants. Sir David Metcalf - the committee's chair - said the Government target for school pupils to achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A to C meant schools could not 'devote resources to the top end and bottom end of the ability range'. As a result, less academically talented pupils were not prepared for the world of work, he said. Companies take on immigrants because their literacy and numeracy is better than young British candidates, he added. Sir David said many firms also believe British workers are less good at 'getting out of bed in the morning' for shift work and dealing with customers politely. A spokesman for the committee said: 'The arrival of one million migrants in low-skilled jobs during the last 10 years has left local authorities struggling to cope with rapid population change.' The official report  revealed that some 75 per cent of the 2.9 million rise in the foreign-born population in the past decade was concentrated in just a quarter of Town councils - putting pressure on housing and public services in those areas. One study of pay in London, the report said, had found the 20 per cent lowest paid had seen wages fall by 15 per cent on average. It added that schools in some areas of the country had seen a 'marked increase in the number of migrant pupils', adding that this may 'impose additional costs'. Overall, the report stated: 'The impacts of migrants on average wages.. tended to be positive at the top of the wage distribution and negative at the bottom.' Labour MP Frank Field said: 'This report sheds a small amount of light on what has been blindingly obvious for a long time to people at the bottom.' The committee warned that future EU expansion – with eight candidate countries containing 90 million people earning a third to half of average EU wage levels – needed to be managed better than before. Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows in 2013 there were 2.1 million people from overseas working in low-skilled occupations. Of these, 1.2 million were born outside of the EU. But Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, the two major enforcement bodies designed to protect vulnerable workers, are under-resourced and their penalties are too weak to tackle the exploitation of migrant workers in low-skilled jobs. Professor Sir David Metcalf, chair of the MAC, said: 'Our flexible labour market has served us well. But vulnerable low-skilled workers, whether British or foreign, need protection. 'There is incomplete compliance with and enforcement of labour regulations, and regulatory resources and penalties are inadequate.' The Migration Advisory Committee released a map showing that low skilled European immigrants were concentrated in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and London - with much of the North East and Scotland barely touched . UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the European Parliament that Britain could vote to stay in the EU if free movement was scrapped . Sir David added: 'A typical employer can expect a compliance visit just once in 250 years and a prosecution once in a million years. 'We must also redouble our efforts to equip our young people with the skills to compete in a flexible job market.' Across the country, the report found that migrant workers over the last 20 years have not had a 'major impact' on the pay of British workers or on people's prospects of finding a job. A Government spokeswoman today defended the enforcement of the minimum wage. She said: 'The vast majority of employers pay the minimum wage. Our targeted, intelligence-led approach shows us that non-compliance on the adult rate is less than 0.8 per cent. 'For those that don’t comply the Government has taken action. To deter flouters, we have quadrupled the financial penalties up to £20,000 per employee and named and shamed 30 employers for failing to pay the basic rate. HMRC act on every minimum wage complaint reported and last year alone found £4.65 million in back pay owed to over 22,600 workers. 'We recognise there is more to do and are working across Government to see what further action is needed to prevent illegal working.'","Migration Advisory Committee says parts of the country 'struggling to cope'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband today revealed he was 'absolutely convinced' that Britain should stay in the EU - as he ruled out promising a referendum. The Labour leader rejected calls from the party's biggest union backer Unite to match David Cameron's pledge or lose votes at the next election. But Mr Miliband said who had 'no truck' with those wanting to take Britain out of the EU and said a referendum was not one of the country's 'priorities'. Foreign Secretary William Hague said Labour was 'too weak to trust the British people'. Labour leader Ed Miliband today ruled out offering voters a referendum on Europe - unless there was a transfer of powers to Brussels . He was backed by Ed Balls who said a pledge now would threaten jobs and investment in the UK. But the Tories accused Labour of not trusting the people . Mr Miliband said: 'There should be an in/out referendum if there is a further transfer of powers from Britain to the EU. 'But I am not going to follow others in saying that we should commit to spending the next three years focusing on an EU referendum in 2017, when we have so many other things to sort out in this country and we need businesses to invest here. 'It is not the priority for the country. Instead we must act now to reform the European Union to make it work for Britain.' Mr Miliband said: 'Many business people are worried about the drift of our country towards exit from the EU. I understand your worry. 'Let me be clear: I am absolutely convinced that our future lies in the EU. 'For jobs. To tackle big strategic questions from climate change to crime and terrorism. And because I care about the outward-looking character of Britain.' Mr Miliband's remarks came after Unite called on Labour to 'urgently reconsider' its opposition to a referendum. The Prime Minister has pledged to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels if he is re-elected next year. He will then hold an in/out referendum in 2017. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said denying a referendum would suggest that Labour was part of a 'political elite' that did not trust the electorate. He told delegates at the union's conference last week that 'ducking this question is seen as part of Labour's commitment to business'. Unite chief Len McCluskey said blocking a referendum could leave Labour open to accusations that it was part of a 'political elite' that did not trust the public . UKIP leader this week dismissed David Cameron's pledge to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU. He said the Prime Minister was 'whistling in the wind' But he said: 'That is a vast hostage to fortune. I would not like to be Ed Miliband explaining why he is not joining other parties in offering the British people a vote on something that is clearly a growing source of public concern. 'It is time that Labour's leadership took a new look at the referendum question. We do not seek a referendum to take Britain out of the EU, we seek a referendum rethink in order to help Labour into power. 'Without such a pledge, our party will stand exposed, Ukip will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the Tories will hypocritically charge Labour with being anti-democratic. In a tight election, this can make the difference.' Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'It’s the same old Labour: they’re still too weak to trust the British people. 'An EU referendum is about democracy, it’s about dealing with the problem of democratic consent for our EU membership that’s part of Labour’s disastrous legacy: signing away powers from Britain to the EU without the British people’s democratic permission. 'The only way to ensure a referendum on our EU membership in 2017 is to vote Conservative, because Labour won’t give the people their say.'","Ed Miliband says holding a referendum on EU 'not the priority' for Britain'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Most Britons would be happy to pay more tax to save the NHS, a new poll has found. Some 57 per cent of the public would be prepared to see taxes rise to protect the NHS, according to a new survey. Just over four in 10 voters said they would not. The revelation comes amid warnings that the NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase spending. A clear majority of the public would be prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS, according to a new ComRes poll . All age groups are prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS - except 35-44 year-olds - including three in five Conservative voters and two-thirds of Labour supporters. The public also do not appear to care who provides their treatment - as long as it is free. Some 67 per cent said they did not mind if health services were run by the NHS or by privately owned businesses, provided it was free, while 30 per cent disagreed. A majority of Labour supporters - 59 per cent - say they do not mind who provides NHS services, with the working class least bothered of all. The research, carried out by ComRes for The Independent, also found that voters trust Labour more than the Conservatives on health issues, with 33 per cent backing leader Ed Miliband to protect the NHS, and 29 per cent trusting Prime Minister David Cameron. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: 'Beyond the economy and immigration, the NHS will be the key policy issue on which the 2015 general election is decided, and the fact that most Britons say they are willing to pay more tax in order to protect the NHS just goes to show the peril of being seen by voters to neglect it. 'Although traditionally it has been difficult for the Conservatives to get traction with voters on the NHS, voters seem to trust neither leader particularly to protect what is perceived as a valuable national institution.' Meanwhile, Labour's poll lead has dropped from five to two points since last month, ComRes found. Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points, the Conservatives are unchanged on 30 per cent, Ukip is up four points to 18 per cent, the Liberal Democrats are down one point to a record low of seven per cent. ComRes interviewed 1,005 British adults by telephone between June 27 and 29 to gauge public support for extra health spending and the use of private companies to deliver services . David Cameron is less trusted than Ed Miliband to protect the health service from cuts - but only just - according to the survey . The public's support for higher taxes to pay for the NHS comes after senior MPs said the health service could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending. Over the weekend, former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis. He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service' if spending was not increased. Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'. Labour is intending to make the the NHS a key battleground at the next election and has promised a 'big offer' on health care. It is considering three options to boost NHS spending: a ring-fenced rise in national insurance contributions for employers and workers; delaying the deficit-reduction programme and a budget increase once the nation’s books have been balanced. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to increase the NHS's budget amid warnings that the health service is facing a financial crisis . As Chancellor, Gordon Brown raised National Insurance by one per cent in 2002 to help bring Britain’s spending on health up to the European average. Some Labour figures are wary that such a pledge now could undermine Mr Miliband’s 'cost of living' agenda as higher NICs would put more pressure on family budgets. But last night Labour supporters of a major health cash promise took comfort from the ComRes findings. Patrick Diamond, a former Downing Street policy adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: 'These poll findings demonstrate there is a real appetite among the British electorate for higher taxes to ensure the NHS remains on a sustainable financial footing. 'The key policy issue is how to make NHS spending more transparent so voters know how well the extra money is being used, combined with measures that widen choice and control over services to maintain the public consensus for a universal, taxpayer-funded NHS.'","Almost six in 10 voters prepared to see taxes rise to protect the NHS .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Retired Britons get £600-a-year less than those in America because of EU red tape strangling people's pension pots, research has revealed. OAPs in the UK can expect a pay out of around £2,850 a year from a £50,000 retirement pot. But in the States, pensioners with the same size nest egg will get £3,450. Pension experts say this £50-a-month gulf is because EU financial regulation is twice as strict as that in the States. A British pensioner with a £50,000 retirement pot would receive £2,850-a-year, but in the US a pensioner with the same size nest egg would get £3,450 . EU rules force British insurance companies to hold twice as much cash in reserve compared to those in the US - driving down the amount they can pay out in annuities to pensioners. Because the regulation forces shareholders in UK pension companies  to put more cash on the line as an insurance policy, the shareholders demand more profit in return - eating in to people's retirement incomes. UK insurers  demand a profit margin of around 20 per cent on annuities. In the US meanwhile, insurers generally look for a return of just 10 per cent. An annuity is what most people in the UK choose to spend their pension savings on at retirement. Pensioners hand over your pension fund to an insurer - who have to pay back a guaranteed income for life in return. In 2013 around 400,000 annuities were sold worth £12billion. Insurers generally work on the assumption they will have to pay a 65-year-old a pension until they are 90. From a retirement pot of £100,000, insurers work out that they will make around £55,000-£60,000 by investing this cash over 25 years. From this, pensioners will get an annual income of around £5,700-£5,900 — which works out at up to £148,000 over 25 years. This means £12,000 is left over. Of this, £5,500 goes on overheads and middle men - with the remaining £6,500 in profit for the insurance company. But insurance companies will make much more than £6,500 on average - because most people don't live until they are 90. A healthy 65-year-old is likely to live until they're 84, official figures show. This effectively gives insurers six years of extra profit. Someone who passes away at 84 could receive as little as £94,000 from their £100,000 retirement pot, leaving insurers with around £30,000 in profits, according to experts. New rules come into force next year which give pensioners much more freedom over how they spend their pension pots. People should even be free to blow their pensions on buying a Lamborghini if they want to, pensions minister Steve Webb has said. The centrepiece of the Government's March Budget was a plan to allow people to withdraw their pension pot as a cash lump sum instead of investing in a pension plan, which ministers claim will give people choice to spend their money how they wish. In the US peoples have total freedom on how to spend their pension savings - forcing annuity providers to pay out more to encourage pensioners to choose their product. In the UK the best annuity rate was £5,700 a year for every £100,000 invested. But in the US, pensioners could get $6,900 a year for $100,000 invested. This is some 20 per cent more paid to pensioners in the US than in the UK. Alan Higham Retirement Director at Fidelity said: 'Regulators need to explain to the public why they build in so much higher ""health & safety"" requirements to UK at pensioners' expense compared to the USA. 'From April 2015, pensioners can vote with their wallet and at these poor prices, I cannot see many choosing to buy annuities.' Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: 'For many years consumers have felt that they were not getting good value from their annuities. 'But from next April people will be free to do what they want with their pension pot. 'No one will be forced to buy an annuity and if someone thinks they can get a better return through an alternative way of using their pension pot then this Government will not stand in their way.' Pensions minister Steve Webb has introduced new rules to give pensioners more freedom over how they spend their retirement savings . Former Downing Street pensions adviser Dr Ros Altmann warned told MailOnline that British pensioners were losing out. Former Saga chief Dr Altmann said: 'UK pensioners are being royally ripped off. In the US you can choose whether you want to buy an annuity or not. But companies here have a captive audience because they have to buy an annuity. 'I think it is essential that people take advice before looking into an annuity and that they shop around. The evidence is clear when you look other countries - they are much better rates.' Labour’s Shadow Pensions Minister Gregg McClymont MP added: 'Annuities as they stand do not work for the majority of savers– low and middle income savers with smaller pension pots. 'We support more options for savers, but the quality of financial guidance savers receive is paramount. 'George Osborne promised and must deliver high quality impartial face to face guidance for the hundreds of thousands of savers who retire annually. The devil is in the detail when it comes to the Chancellor’s Guidance Guarantee.' Annuity rates have been on the wane for the past 15 years and are now at an all-time low . WHAT IS AN ANNUITY? If you belong to a non-final salary pension scheme, by the time you retire you will have built up a lump sum in your personal pension pot. This may be used to buy an annuity from an insurance firm, which guarantees a specified annual income for the rest of your life. How much you receive is based on life expectancy and government interest rates. WHAT CAN I EXPECT TO GET? Someone aged 65 with a £50,000 pot can expect around £2,850 a year. But in the States, pensioners with the same amount will get £3,450. WHY ARE PAYMENTS SO POOR? Annuity rates have fallen steadily for the past 15 years because of increased life expectancy. The longer we live, the longer our pension pots will have to support us. More recently the Bank of England’s policy of quantitative easing has led to a drop in the interest paid on Government bonds. Because insurers use the yield on these bonds to set annuity rates, pension payouts have fallen steeply. WHAT TYPES OF ANNUITY ARE THERE? The simplest, and most common, offers a fixed income for life, with no inflation proofing and no provision for a surviving spouse. Once you take an annuity your entire pension pot is gone. If you die a year later, the income stops and your family will not get access to savings you had. Annuities for the chronically sick and smokers can be up to 40 per cent higher than normal because they have shorter life expectancies.","Excessive EU 'financial health and safety' is hitting UK pension incomes .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Under fire Labour leader Ed Miliband was publicly backed today - by veteran left winger Ken Livingstone. Mr Miliband has come under pressure after polls showed the Tories had moved ahead of Labour in the wake of David Cameron's row in Brussels. But Mr Livingstone said he had 'no doubt' that the Labour leader would become Prime Minister next year. Ed Miliband unveiled Labour's new economic policies in Leeds today - promising to give more power and money to English cities outside London . Ken Livingstone was twice beaten by Boris Johnson in his bid to become London mayor. The veteran left winger has urged Mr Miliband to ignore Blairites within the Labour party calling on him to be less radical . Ed Miliband was today accused of 'misleading' the public after claiming four out of five private sector jobs created under the Coalition had been in London. The Labour leader said he would hand more money and power to regional cities like Leeds and Manchester to boost the economy outside the South East. But the Tories said the figure was out of date and that over the last 12 months four-fifths of new jobs have been created outside London, according to the the Office for National Statistics. Business Minister Matt Hancock has written to Sir Andrew Dilnot at the UK Statistics Authority seeking clarification, and has called the data used by Labour 'several years out of date, and therefore misleading'. He also said he could not turn down a peerage to become a minister under Mr Miliband - despite hitting 70 next year having twice been beaten by Boris Johnson in the fight to be London mayor. Mr Livingstone's endorsement, in an interview with Total Politics magazine, will do nothing to counter claims that the Labour leader has taken the party to the left since taking over from Gordon Brown. It comes after firebrand union leader Len McCluskey said he stood 'fully behind' Mr Miliband at the next election. Mr Livingstone said the next Labour government would be as radical as Margaret Thatcher's in the 1980s. He said: 'Ed will change Britain. In my lifetime, only two governments have changed things: Attlee’s and Thatcher’s. 'Ed’s will be the third. By the end of Ed’s administration, the Tories will have to adjust in the way that Blair adjusted to Thatcher. 'He will set that new agenda – I have no doubt about it. I’m always saying to Ed - ignore all those old Blairites who are still hanging around saying tone it down tone, it down.' The former London mayor also dismissed concerns that Mr Miliband was too 'weird' to be elected Prime Minister. He said: 'Ed is much more normal than I am. He’s actually interested in detail and facts. 'Ed does not give a damn about what he’s wearing, his hairstyle - I’m sure he’s surrounded by people telling him he needs to do this and that but he really doesn’t care any more than I did, and therefore he will change Britain. Ed is like me, he doesn’t want to be there, he wants to do something. 'He will hate all the trivial crap. People have always thought I’m weird - I collected reptiles for god’s sake, I make Ed look normal. 'Everybody thought I was weird - and with my voice, and my lack of any fashion sense, you know. 'If you think back, if Winston Churchill became leader of the Tory Party today, the media would say he’s an alcoholic, he’s overweight, he smokes - he sounds weird. If you look at the people who changed Britain, it’s not because of their looks.' The Labour leader has faced accusations that he is 'too weird' to become Prime Minster. But the former London mayor Ken Livingstone said the country did not care . Labour has fallen behind the Conservative Party in the polls, according to a survey released by Lord Ashcroft this week . A ComRes poll found that Nigel Farage is seen as the 'weirdest' political leader, ahead of Labour's Mr Miliband . Asked about accepting a peerage to work under Mr Miliband, he said: 'That’s a question you need to put to Ed.' He added: 'I’ve always said to him, this is the last chance in my lifetime of getting a Labour government that works, I will do anything to help you get there. 'You can’t turn down your party leader if they ask you to do something – how could you?

"By . Thomas Burrows For Mailonline . Former rugby league player, Keith Mason, 32, has spoken with officers regarding an alleged hit-and-run . Former rugby league star Keith Mason is being investigated by police over an alleged hit-and-run that saw a family, including a girl of eight, requiring hospital treatment. Mason, 32, who played for Super League giants St Helens and Huddersfield, has spoken with officers about a collision in Birstall, West Yorkshire. A mother and her two daughters, aged eight and 11, were treated in hospital after the head-on crash between two cars. They were in a Mini that was left badly damaged following the crash with a 4x4 Nissan Qashqai on Saturday afternoon. A witness said the former rugby league prop reversed his damaged car afterwards. The woman, a friend of the family who did not want to be identified, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'The car was smashed up and her youngest daughter hurt her neck and bit her lip - there was a lot of blood. 'The driver of the Nissan reversed after the crash. He got out of the car and came over.' Mason was then said to have fled on foot. Since retiring from Super League, Mason, who lives in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, has been pursuing an acting and modelling career. He has already landed a role alongside Hollywood star Mickey Rourke in crime drama Skin Traffik and has said he would love to appear in a James Bond film. At the time, he said: 'It's been a whirlwind. To have a part alongside some of the best actors there'll ever be is amazing. 'I am just a normal lad from ­Yorkshire and now I am seeing all this glitz and glamour, it's surreal. But I am really enjoying the lifestyle. I could get used to it. 'I'm from a humble background, with a single mum who brought five kids up on a council estate. I've had nothing given to me, so I know I need to work very hard to get anywhere in life.' Last year, . Mason was awarded almost £150,000 in damages after his former club . Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his team-mate, . Scott Moore, was posted online. He was dismissed from the team on grounds of gross misconduct in October 2012 after the picture appeared on Twitter. But . Moore successfully argued that his  former employees wanted to get rid . of him because of his expensive contract and that the Twitter picture . was only a smokescreen. Mason, 32, pictured here playing for the Huddersfield Giants, has spoken with officers relating to a collision in Birstall, West Yorkshire, which happened on Saturday . Mason, who is now a budding actor and model, asked his Twitter followers on Wednesday if they would like to see him appear back in the Super League . West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Mason, who has not been arrested, is 'helping with enquiries'. Richard Cramer, Mason's lawyer, told MailOnline: 'Keith is co-operating with the police and it would be inappropriate to make a comment at this time.' A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police told MailOnline: 'Police were called to reports of a road traffic collision on Cambridge Road, Birstall at 4.53pm on Saturday August 9. 'The incident involved two vehicles, a Qashqai and a Mini. An eight year old child in the Mini was left with slight injuries. 'The Qashqai driver has got out and spoken with the Mini driver and then left his car and walked off from scene. 'Police have recovered the Qashqai and are treating it as a fail to stop collision.

Around one and a half million bikes were sold before the BMX craze of the 1980s took over. This was despite the bicycle being unstable, slow, heavy and trickier to ride than conventional bikes. A lighter Mark 3 Chopper was launched in 2004 made of aluminium with various safety features . Mr . Oakley, died in May 2012 after a battle with cancer. He drew up the . design for the Chopper on an envelope as he travelled home from the USA, . in 1967. Moving . away from the traditional, diamond-shaped frame, Mr Oakley developed a . bike with huge handle bars, a bulky, padded seat with a back rest and a . car-like gear lever on the main frame. Initially, attempts to sell the Chopper in America were unsuccessful. But sales took off in the early 1970s in the UK and according to Raleigh, 'changed the way a generation of British kids rode'. The . Chopper was so popular, Raleigh sold 1.5 million of them in the UK . alone and the strange bike is credited with saving the company from . bankruptcy. Raleigh . made two versions of the bike - the Mark I from 1969 to 1972 and then . the Mark II from 1972 to 1983. They also produced a number of limited . edition bikes. In August 1983, production of the Chopper ceased as BMX bikes became the fashionable choice. But in 2004, due to popular demand, a limited edition Chopper, costing between £200 and £300 for a Mark 3 model, was released. The special edition bikes will be available for a select few - as Raleigh will only produce 400 of the iconic cycle. They are set to retail for £250 and can be ordered via any Raleigh shop. They will hit the high street in September this year. Producton of the original Chopper bike ceased in August 1983, as BMX bikes became the fashionable choice .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nigel Farage today accused MEPs of descending into 'naked militarism' by 'goosestepping' the EU flag around Brussels. The UKIP leader accused European leaders of ignoring growing euroscepticism across the continent by pushing ahead with 'ever closer union'. The controversial remarks, in the European Parliament today, came after he turned his back as the 'EU anthem' was played to open up the new political session yesterday. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage addressed the European Parliament during a debate on the last EU summit, in which the UK lost a vote against Jean-Claude Juncker becoming Commission President by 26 votes to 2 . The UKIP leader said David Cameron was 'whistling in the wind' if he thought he could convince every other European country to hand powers back to Britain . In his speech Mr Farage said the Prime Minister's humilating defeat trying to block Jean-Claude Juncker from becoming Commission President proved that Britain would not be able to renegotiate its position in the EU. He said Mr Cameron was 'whistling in the wind' because the master of Europe was Germany's Angela Merkel who was not going to give way. Mr Farage said: 'Dave obviously misunderstood the mood. After some initial encorougement from a few other member states thinking they might block Mr Juncker. 'He ran into the new golden rule of EU politics which is when Mrs Merkel speaks the other member states obey.' He added: 'Having lost 26-2 in the last vote.. are we going to win 28-0 in the council of ministers? I don't think so, it isn't going to happen, we are whistling in the wind and we are closer now to exit than ever.' The UKIP leader pointed to the way the EU's top jobs had been 'stitched up' between the main federalist parties - who all want more power for Brussels - as proof that nothing had changed. He said: 'What have we seen in the last 24 hours? We've seen naked militarism, with the EU flag being virtually goosestepped around the yard, we've seen the European anthem.' Mr Farage said the EU was descending into 'naked militarism' by parading its flag around Brussels like a nation state . Mr Farage said the European Parliament's presidency to Martin Schultz - despite the fact that his group had lost the May elections . Mr Farage's controversial speech today came after he was accused of 'shocking disrespect' for turning his back on the EU's national anthem as the European Parliament was opened in France yesterday. The UKIP leader's public show of dissent came after the German socialist Martin Schulz was reappointed president of the European Parliament - in a shady 'backroom stitch up' sparking anger in Britain. Mr Schulz was backed by MEPs to carry on in the £213,000 a year role, despite the fact that his Socialist group lost May's European elections. Mr Schulz was elected by MEPs in Strasbourg after they observed the European anthem. Although most MEPs stood up for it, British Tory MEPs sat quietly while UKIP MEPs turned their backs on the orchestra and the EU flag. Steven Woolfe said the show of protest was against the 'done deal' for Mr Schulz's election as president of the EU parliament. He said: 'Only the Labour group in the EU and their Socialist partners clapping Shultz in his speech for EU Parliament president.' UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall MEP added: 'We don't recognise or respect the EU flag or anthem. They are both symbols of our servitude inside a political union which the British people reject. 'We will do everything we can in European Parliament to oppose the Federalist system which ignores our national democracy and pushes millions of people across Europe into poverty and unemployment. We stand up for our people, not the EU flag and anthem.' Nigel Farage and other UKIP MEPs turned their backs as an orchestra performed the European anthem in the European parliament in Strasbourg today . Newly elected Scottish UKIP MEP David Coburn  climbs stairs as he attends the opening session of the European Parliament today . But Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder criticised the UKIP MEPs for their 'shocking disrespect' during the opening ceremony, describing their actions as ""rude'. MEPs from Parliament's three main pro-EU groups agreed to keep Mr Schulz in place after he backed his rival Jean-Claude Juncker to become president of the European Commission last week. In his role Mr Schulz - who has campaigned against budget cuts across Europe - will take home a pay and perks package worth over £213,000 a year. Martin Schulz (left) has been chosen to be the European Parliament's president for another term, risking further anger from the Prime Minister . Former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker was backed to become European Commission president by German Chancellor Angela Merkel . The EU's 'national anthem' comes from Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' In 1985 European leaders adopted the tune as its official anthem. According to the EU is the anthem 'expresses the European ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity'. But the EU insists: 'The European anthem is not intended to replace the national anthems of the EU countries but rather to celebrate the values they share.' The Left-wing MEP who has also attacked tax havens will pocket £124,000 of his cash in special allowances without paying any taxation at all. He won today's vote by 409 to 314 - despite refusuing to turn up for a debate between different candidates, including Tory MEP Sajjad Karim on Monday night. Mr Schulz was the spitzenkandidat - or leading candidate - for the Socialists to become the European Commission. But he lost out in the race for Brussels' top job to Mr Juncker who was backed by EU leaders on Friday. Mr Farage said: 'There are no losers among the EU elite after this election. Everyone is a winner. 'This is a big stitch up. For them, it's damn all to do with democracy and it's all about the carving up of power among the EU elites.' Pawel Swidlicki, of the think tank Open Europe, added: 'The re-election of Schulz via a secret ballot following a backroom stitch-up between the main centre-right and centre-left blocks epitomises the EU's democratic flaws and exposes the hollow nature of the arguments in favour of spitzenkandidaten. 'Schulz is an aggressive proponent of increasing the power of the European Parliament and so will be a big obstacle to EU reform.' Mr Schulz has been the president, or speaker of the EU assembly, since January 2012. His reelection makes him the first MEP in the parliament's history to serve two consecutive terms. As president of the assembly, the German MEP will become one of the most well paid parliamentarians in the world. Brussels' three presidents - Herman Van Rompuy, left, Jose Manuel Barroso, centre, and Martin Schulz, right, accepted the Nobel Peace prize on behalf of the EU in 2012. Mr Van Rompuy is the president of the European Council, representing EU leaders. Mr Barroso is the president of the Commission - Brussels' governing bureaucracy - until he is replaced by Jean-Claude Juncker. And Mr Schulz is the president of the European Parliament - representing MEPs . According to the Telegraph he will receive over half of his income in special presidential tax free allowances - with annual 'subsistence' payments worth £89,000 and a 'residence' allowance worth over £35,000. He will also receive an extra 'representation allowance' worth £14,000 a year as well as having two limousines, BMW 7s with drivers for his personal use. The rest of the EU's plumb jobs will be agreed in a fortnight - with the president of the European Council of EU leaders and the new EU foreign policy chief up for grabs. The Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Dutch leader Mark Rutte and Andrus Ansip, the former Estonian leader, are in the running to replace Herman Van Rompuy as EU Council president. Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, meanwhile is the favourite to replace Baroness Ashton as EU foreign minister.","UKIP leader told MEPs the European Union was guilty of 'naked militarism'

It is one of many 'industrial clusters' - areas that specialise on a single product - that have emerged in recent decades as a result of the booming Chinese economy. Fu Quanguo, 64, pioneered the trade in the 1970s. He said: 'We used to collect the human hair locally, but now it comes from all kinds of countries, like Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Vietnam.

"By . Mia De Graaf . They are still at school. But Generation Z is already powering its way into the world of work. Motivated, creative, and - crucially - tech-savvy, the world's two billion under-17-year-olds are sparking a wave of entrepreneurialism. Scroll down for video . The big leagues: Today's youngsters are inspired by Britain's Nick D'Aloisio, 18, (left), who sold his news app for $30million last year, and Maya Van Wagenen (right) had landed a film deal with DreamWorks at just 15 . Author's dream: She was born the same year as Google but already has a three-book deal with Random House . They are the first batch of 'digital natives': most of them are younger than Google, which launched in 1996. And having watched their baby-booming parents struggle up work ladders, they plan to put their expertise into practice as early as possible. Poster girls and boys of the generation include Nick D'Aloisio, 18, who taught himself code at 12, created the news app Summly at 15, and sold it to Yahoo for $30 million last year. Another is Beth Reekles, 18, has won a three-book contract with Random House publishers after her first book The Kissing Booth was released online - and shared 19 million times. And this year DreamWorks handed a multi-million dollar film deal to 15-year-old Maya Van Wagenen for her memoir about school dynamics, Popular: Vintage Wisdom for a Modern Greek. They are leading a change of tide, with youngsters born into a recession desperate to 'make something of themselves'. Dan Schawbel, founder of research firm Millennial Branding and author of Promote Yourself, told MailOnline: 'Generation Z has everything at its finger tips. 'You can start taking classes online or connecting with experts before you're 10 years old. 'Teenagers are now giving influential TED talks, building their reputation and networking before they have even left school. 'The majority of them  would rather be entrepreneurs than employees. The world-changers: 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai (left) was shot by the Taliban and survived to be an activist. Logan Laplante, 13, (right) has become a proponent of alternative schooling after giving a TED talk . 'It means there is a huge emphasis on alternative education: do I need to pay for school or should I just invest in my own business? 'I think it's going to be a positive thing but it is the first generation to see it play out so we don't know what to expect.' New research suggests today's teens and tweens are focussing on their big move - rather than wiling away time on social networks. More than 75 per cent of Gen Z aim to turn their hobby into a full-time job compared to 50 per cent of the generation before, according to a survey by recruitment agency Intern Sushi. Four in five secondary school students believe they are more driven than their peers. Popular culture is saturated with powerful youngsters - from Romeo Beckham, modelling at the age of 10, to Lorde, who at 17 has won two Grammy awards and landed a commission to soundtrack the next Hunger Games film. The majority of England's World Cup squad was born in the early to mid nineties, and some of fashion's most influential bloggers have yet to reach university. But it seems many also want to change the world. Two thirds of under-17-year-olds want to have an impact on the world with their jobs, compared to just a third of the generation before. With social entrepreneurship now one of the most popular career choices, the figures also revealed a quarter of 16-to-19-year-olds are currently volunteering. Leaders in this field include 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban and survived to become an activist. Another is Logan Laplante, 13, who has shaken up debate in the education sector by promoting his concept of 'hackschooling': breaking from the structure of organised education. His first talk has amassed more than five million views online, and sparked numerous responses from leading figures in the schooling world. And 19-year-old journalist Rene Silva, from Brazil, has already published his first book, having set up a newspaper at the age of 11, and live-tweeted a police raid on his neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro at 17. It is a shift in priorities that appears to have been sparked by the wave of unemployment and the rise of tuition fees. Model example: Romeo Beckham (left) dived into the world of work at the age of 10 with a campaign for major fashion house Burberry. Lorde (right) has landed two Grammy awards before the age of 18 . Connected: People can start connecting with experts and building a business online before they are 10 . Ina Miskavets, senior consumer and lifestyles analyst at research firm Mintel said: 'Having come of age in an era of rising self-employment and new ideas driven by rapid advancements in technology, children and teens are beginning to aspire to one day owning their own businesses. 'This is becoming more of a trend, especially in light of increased tuition fees at English universities, making some question the benefits of higher education.' However, there are fears this tribe of youngsters, in their bid to succeed, are spreading their focus too thin. Ika Erwina, a retail and technology analyst for Mintel, said: 'Compared to previous generations, kids and teens increasingly live a sedentary lifestyle. 'These digital natives are interconnected and tend to divide attentions across multiple platforms and channels, prompting impatient behaviors, quick-fix mentality, and instant gratification. 'Their loyalty is likely to mirror this trend, spreading thinly across brands, and easily switched.'","Generation 'Z' born through recession are inspired to run own businesses .

I have created a page called Brian Lynn My Final Adventure... please could you check it out and share my dads story .... if not then thank you so much for taking your time to read this XxX . I would like you to meet my Father Brian Lynn… . On July 4 2013 sadly my father passed away, he was a very happy chap that loved to surround himself with family, happiness, joy and most of all he loved to travel. On July 26 2014 I decided to send my dad on his final adventure. A message in a bottle containing a letter, a penny for good luck and a small tub containing dads ashes. All that I ask, is if you see him perched on a shore, take the message out pop your name, date and location on the letter.

Don't forget to pop the lid back on tight and throw him far enough back in to the water, so he can carry out the rest of his FINAL ADVENTURE. Thank you so much for taking the time, I dont know if this will workout but I would love for this to reach as many shores as possible. Mrs Welsh said: 'He always loved his travelling, it just sort of came to me one day, I wanted to do something special for him but I couldn't quite put my finger on what I wanted to do for him. 'Dad did a lot of cruises, especially in the last ten years when it felt like he never came off cruises. 'He took his camera with him, you would think that maybe 50 or 60 photos of the exact same location would be enough, but obviously it wasn't, he just took loads and loads. He loved it. 'He had his hand into everything in life, he was a pitman and from there he went on to be a gardener. 'He was 76, but he retired about 10 years ago around the same time he started on the cruises. 'His main love was Egypt and he actually said to me before he died ""just stick us in your pocket, with a little hole in the pocket, and walk around the Pyramids scattering my ashes"". 'I'm not sure you're allowed to do that, so this is the next best thing.' Brian Lynn developed a passion for travelling and particularly enjoyed visiting the Pyramids in Egypt . Mrs Welsh shared her story online on the site Lostbox and has been taken aback by the response. 'I'm so overwhelmed by all the response now since I put his story online, everyone wants to find Brian. 'If he was here now and he could see the response he would be absolutely ecstatic. 'I've had so many messages, it's absolute crazy. Reading through those messages I've never felt so many emotions, sad of course, but at the same time, so happy. 'I think people will be a little be intrigued about what's in there, you can see my dad's photo in there. 'I've asked them to put their name, date and location on the note and if possible send me a picture.'

"By . Lucy Osborne . Tragedy: Geraldine Jones, 51, had just beaten breast cancer when she died after falling off a horse at a beach in South Wales . It was her dream to ride a galloping horse along a beach with the wind in her hair. Breast cancer sufferer Geraldine Jones promised herself she would achieve her goal if she survived the disease – and finally got her chance when she was given the all-clear after four years. But the 51-year-old’s longed-for moment turned into bitter tragedy when she was thrown off her horse and died. Her friend – an experienced rider – and a passing jogger administered first aid and  a coastguard rescue team was sent to the scene. But despite their efforts, Mrs Jones was pronounced dead in an air ambulance. While undergoing treatment for cancer, the mother-of-two is thought to have written a list of things she wanted to do when she beat the illness – a twist on the ‘bucket lists’ prepared by those with a terminal condition. After learning that she was free of cancer, Mrs Jones started her bid to tick off all the items on her list. She began by going on holiday to Gower in south Wales last Sunday to visit a friend and ride horses together along the picturesque Llangennith Beach. Another friend said: ‘Riding on the sand was something Geraldine was really looking forward to. We’ve been told there was a huge smile on her face as she walked down to the beach.’ Mrs Jones’s husband Tim, 53 – with whom she had two sons, Olly, 16, and 12-year-old Henry – was too distraught to speak yesterday at home in Fownhope, Herefordshire. A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘He has been inconsolable ever since. She had faced this cancer battle and they had overcome it together … And then this goes and happens. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything more tragic in my life. ‘She has always wanted to ride a horse on the beach … It was part of her bucket list … Our hearts just go out to her husband and two young boys.’ Accident: Mrs Jones was fulfilling her dream of riding down a beach on horseback when she was thrown off, suffering fatal injuries . Scene: The incident took place at Llangennith Beach on the Gower Peninsula, South Wales, last Sunday . Fighter: Mrs Jones, is survived by her husband, Tim, and her two sons Oliver and Henry . The neighbour added: ‘Her experience of cancer, the uncertainty at the time and the news that treatment had been successful, created a heightened appreciation of the smallest things and a greater determination in her that she would live life to the full, be a successful businesswoman and spend quality time with her family.’ Mrs Jones, who had been the head of marketing and communications at St Michael’s Hospice near Hereford, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2010. She ended her seven years at the hospice to become a freelance communications consultant 12 months ago. Hospice staff were said to be in tears after the news of her sudden death was announced. Chief executive Nicky West said: ‘Geraldine was a much-loved member of staff at St Michael’s Hospice and her former colleagues have been devastated by the news. ‘Geraldine’s vibrant personality and zest for life made an enormous contribution to St Michael’s. Her exceptional writing skills and empathy for patients and families helped create thought-provoking articles about our work here. ‘Geraldine’s love of life brought joy to the people she spent time with. Her sudden death is a shock, leaving friends and former colleagues saddened and in tears.’ Mrs Jones, who was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, was an experienced rider but had never galloped on sand before. Swansea coroner’s office said it would not make a decision on whether to open an inquest until the results of a post-mortem examination were known. Steve Jones, Swansea coastguard’s manager, added: ‘[The riders] were not doing anything wrong. They were just enjoying the day, as everyone was.’","Geraldine Jones, 51, had just been given the all-clear from breast cancer .

"By . Sam Webb . Faith: Maciej Grochowski was sacked from a gym after several warnings that he was making staff and clients uncomfortable by discussing his beliefs . A Jehovah’s Witness who was sacked as a fitness coach after telling a gym member that yoga would allow ‘evil’ into her body has won a pay out for unfair dismissal. Maciej Grochowski was sacked from  the Virgin Active gym in Heywood, Rochdale, after several warnings over complaints he was making staff and clients uncomfortable by discussing his beliefs. He was finally told to leave after writing a series of emails to bosses spelling out his religious opinions on issues such as Halloween and satanism. An employment tribunal ruled he was unfairly dismissed as he had not breached the terms of a final warning banning him from discussing religion when it was ‘unwelcome’ or ‘made others feel uncomfortable’. Virgin Active was ordered to pay Mr Grochowski £653.50 - after a 75 per cent reduction for his conduct prior to the dismissal.

Mr Grochowski was first warned about his behaviour in June 2011, after several members contacted the gym to see when he was working so they could avoid being there at the same time. They explained they felt uncomfortable because of his frequent discussions on religious beliefs. Within a fortnight, a colleague complained about ‘homophobic views’ he had raised in the staff room.

He was sacked for breaching the warning after sending the emails in November 2012. But the court ruled the warning did not constitute a ‘blanket ban’ on discussing religion and Mr Grochowski had no cause to think he would cause distress.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Brazil are in danger of ruining the narrative of their own World Cup. This has been a joyful three-and-a-half weeks in South America and Brazil’s place in their own final would not do a romantic plot-line any harm. Nevertheless, the host nation’s reaction to the loss of their best player last Friday has begun to  take a little of the shine from their presence in the last four. We can understand Brazilian  sadness at the injury to Neymar. The impish forward is the star player in a flawed team and, for a while, looked the best chance Brazil had of lifting the trophy in Rio on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down for Brazil star Neymar heads home in helicopter to recover . Down and out: Neymar was ruled out for the tournament after suffering a back injury . Grounded: The Brazilian was hit in the back by Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga during the quarter-finals . That he is gone, though, is a cause for regret but not recrimination. Brazil’s reaction to his injury — caused in the challenge with Colombia’s Juan Camilo Zuniga — has not reflected well on them. It was a poor tackle, certainly. Zuniga will not take any great pride in it. It was, however, Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team that set the tone on that brutish night in Brasilia. It was the players in yellow who sought to reduce the contest to a test of physicality as much as football, their coach who clearly did not fancy taking on Colombia purely at what Brazil themselves once classified the Beautiful Game. The bottom line is that if you go out looking for fights, there is always a chance you may not win and, even if you do, you are always likely to sustain collateral damage. Devastating: Neymar was carried off on a stretcher and his World Cup dream was ended . Zuniga was not the villain that night. Scolari was the coach who devised the tactics, Fernandinho his henchman and Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo the man without the common sense or courage to do anything about it. Brazil, though, have thrashed about wildly since they realised the extent of the fall-out. Somehow they persuaded FIFA to look retrospectively at Zuniga’s challenge on Neymar, unsurprisingly the disciplinary committee yesterday decided to take no action against the Colombian. Their appeal against the booking that  rules Thiago Silva out of today’s semi-final against Germany was also unsuccessful. Escape: Zuniga will not face any punishment for his challenge on Neymar . Tearful: Neymar sent an emotional message to the Brazilian public after his injury . All this against a background of sentimentality and noise about their fallen child. Scolari told us that, after the injury, Neymar could not feel his legs. Then on Sunday the Brazil team doctor revealed that impact 2.5cm further along Neymar’s spine could have left the Barcelona player with permanent damage. We should all be glad the 22-year-old escaped that, of course, but this is a rather transparent brand of propaganda from Brazil and, in all honesty, it is better left untouched. Neymar, after all, is due to be playing again by the time the La Liga season starts in Spain. Wave: Neymar boards a helicopter after leaving Brazil's World Cup camp to return home . Meanwhile: Luiz Felipe Scolari's side train ahead of their semi-final showdown with Germany . Whether Scolari and his cohorts are trying to place undue pressure on today’s referee Marco Rodriguez or make Joachim Low’s Germans think twice about making their tackles we can only speculate. If that is the plan, we can only imagine that Sebastien Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels are not worrying too much about it. If Brazil are to reach the final and pay back their public on a tournament that has cost millions then they will not bully their way to Rio. That was a one-trick hand and it has been played.","Neymar's injury suffered in Brazil's win against Colombia has ruled him out of the World Cup .

"Roy Hodgson was offered the option to recall Chelsea captain . England boss declined chance for Terry's international return . Three Lions lost World Cup 2014 opener to Italy, 2-1 . By . Martin Samuel . On the journey home, as he reflected on what had proved to be Italy’s winning goal, one wonders whether Roy Hodgson recalled a conversation he had with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke in the build-up to this World Cup. As reports of John Terry’s exceptional form for Chelsea grew more consistent and insistent, Dyke approached his manager and gave him an option. If he wanted to attempt to persuade Terry (right) out of international retirement, the chairman said, he would make it happen. It was a well-intentioned gesture. VIDEO Scroll down to watch John Terry already in training ahead of pre-season . Fine form: Former England captain John Terry was magnificent for Chelsea last season . Dyke would have known the controversial nature of such a call and the criticism of his organisation that would undoubtedly follow — but he did not want Hodgson’s chances of success weakened, by what remains a collision between Terry and the governing body. Hodgson declined the offer. Whether he thought Terry’s baggage would be more trouble than it was worth, or simply felt a sense of loyalty to Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka, the central defenders who had got him to Brazil, we may never know — but the invitation went no further than that discussion. If, however, Hodgson believed Terry’s inclusion carried an imbalance of risk-reward, he was mistaken. Heads, you lose: Gary Cahill lost his man in Mario Balotelli, who scored Italy's winner in Manaus . Pain game: Cahill and England goalkeeper Joe Hart are floored after Balotelli wheels away to celebrate his winner . Terry remains the finest organiser of a defence in the English game. There is no guarantee that England would have held out in Manaus had he been in the team — but they did against Italy the last time, and there would be greater confidence about the reckoning with Uruguay and Luis Suarez in Sao Paulo if Terry were playing. Still, we lie on the bed we have made now.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Some athletes just refuse to heed the warning signs, to take notice of the directions on the road. Some athletes just take what they can and keep moving forwards. That, in many ways, is the secret to Dirk Kuyt’s impact at this World Cup, the reason why he is now one of only seven Dutch footballers to have played 100 times or more for the Oranje. VIDEO Scroll down for Team Profile: Netherlands & qualifying highlights . Taking on fluids: Marathan Man Dirk Kuyt is proving pivotal for Holland . Runner runner: The versatile Dutchman has played in a variety of positions for Louis van Gaal so far . Once nicknamed ‘Mr Duracell’ by his . first manager at Liverpool, Rafael Benitez, Kuyt nevertheless spent so . long on 98 caps that even he may have wondered if his juice had finally . run out. Prior to this World Cup, the 33-year-old had not played for his country since last year. He would, he announced, retire from the international game after this tournament. On Saturday night, however, following the shoot-out win over Costa Rica, Kuyt stood in the interview area at Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova and talked about his re-emergence as a pivotal cog in Louis van Gaal’s team, the striker turned left wing back who just never seems to stop running. ‘Yes, it is new to me but I am enjoying it,’ Kuyt smiled. ‘Playing for your country, even in a role you are not accustomed to, makes you very proud and you just want to be successful. ‘We have the chance to reach another World Cup final, so we have to give everything for that. The way I look at it is simple. If you want to do something, you have to go in the same direction as the coach and Louis van Gaal is the perfect  manager to make that happen.’ Pointers: Kuyt with team-mates Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder in training . Cool, calm and collection: Kuyt scoring his penalty in the quarter-final shoot-out against Costa Rica . Dirk Kuyt has only played three times inBrazil, but already he’s covered the best partof a marathon. In his three games in Brazil, Kuyt has run onaverage more than any other Dutchman. He also beats any of his Argentine opponents. Average km per game: Dirk v HollandD Kuyt 11.30W Sneijder 11.14A Robben 11.08D Janmaat 10.93D Blind 10.88 . Average km per game: Dirk v ArgentinaD Kuyt 11.30M Rojo 11.20J Mascherano 10.76P Zabaleta 10.54F Fernandez 10.30 . Kuyt didn’t play in Holland’s opening two games against Spain and Australia here in Brazil and it seemed as though he would remain in the shadows. He emerged in his new wing-back role in the final group game against Chile, however, and subsequent displays against Mexico and Costa Rica proved fundamental to Holland’s progress. Against Mexico — in the unyielding heat of Fortaleza — Kuyt was astonishing, playing in three positions and somehow maintaining his energy levels to win the corner from which his team equalised with five minutes left. That game was played in 38-degree heat — many fans seated in the sun moved to the walkways at the back of the stands in search of shade. Played on the anniversary of his father’s death and a day that brought him his 100th cap, Kuyt seemed unfazed, his personal heat map so impressive down both sides of the field it’s a wonder his boots didn’t leave two trenches behind. Cog: He has proved himself to be a key part of Louis van Gaal's plans after not starting the first two games . Versatile: Kuyt vs World Cup . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . Kuyt is one of only seven Dutchmen to win 100 caps: . Edwin van der Sar 130Frank de Boer 112Rafael van der Vaart 109Giovanni van Bronckhorst 106Wesley Sneijder 104Phillip Cocu 101Dirk Kuyt 101 . In the dressing room afterwards, team captain Van Persie paid his own tribute. ‘We have given Dirk a very nice gift for his 100th international game,’ revealed Van Persie. ‘I had a little speech for him. I told him I am so proud of him and that he is an example for young and old. ‘There are only seven players who have reached this number and he stayed a long time, stabbing away on 98. It is fantastic, if anyone deserves this, it’s him.’ Typically, Van Gaal devised his plan to use Kuyt’s reserves of fitness, energy and professionalism as a wing-back as far back as early May. Centurion: Kuyt joins an esteemed list of players with 100 Holland caps . Complimentary: He will be hoping to continue being the hardworking man behind the creativity . Ground covered by Kuyt in the quarter-final against Costa Rica. Only Wesley Sneijder ran more for the team. Leading up to the tournament, the player sold to Fenerbahce for just £1million by Liverpool two summers ago knew his time may be about to come again. He was ready. During his six years at Anfield, Kuyt’s appetite for hard work was always apparent. There were others more gifted but few who made quite as much of what they had. Against Costa Rica, his contribution was almost faultless. This time it lasted 120 minutes and he registered an 88 per cent pass success rate and won 71 per cent of his aerial duels. Then, just as importantly, he stepped forward to convert a penalty in the shoot-out. ‘Yes, I was tired,’ he reflected. ‘But you do what you have to do for the team don’t you? Fatigue doesn’t come in to it after a certain level. The game is still going on so you follow it.’ Even Dutch football’s most famous curmudgeon has appreciated his impact. ‘With Kuyt, you can, at a tactical level, go in all directions,’ reflected Johan Cruyff. ‘When you have someone like him walking around, you are blessed.’","Kuyt has proved a vital member of Van Gaal's bid for World Cup glory .

Arjen Robben believes his attempt to con the referee early in Sunday’s dramatic last-16 win over Mexico did not influence the result or the penalty decision that came after he again fell theatrically under a challenge. The Dutch FA reacted aggressively on Monday when they realised just how much profile had been given to Robben’s post-match admission that he had tried to illegally win a free-kick during the 2-1 win in Fortaleza.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Nearly every team which reached the last eight of this remarkable World Cup had nervous moments. But none came as close to elimination as Holland. Only five minutes remained in the Fortaleza oven against Mexico last weekend when Wesley Sneijder’s right foot kicked new life into the Dutch challenge and ripped a hole in the hearts of the Central Americans. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s penalty a few minutes later completed the Dutch revival but that afternoon led to some introspection within Louis van Gaal’s squad. So we may see a slightly different approach to Saturday’s meeting with Costa Rica. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis Van Gaal say Holland are not a fantastic team . Eyes on the prize: Arjen Robben insists Holland need to go in for the kill for the remained of the World Cup . Preparations: Holland players train ahead of Saturday's quarter-final showdown against Costa Rica . On target: Holland's Wesley Sneijder fires the ball through a crowd of bodies to equalise against Mexico . Arjen Robben reflected: ‘I thought during the first half we weren’t good when Mexico had possession and that will have to improve against Costa Rica. ‘In general, I think we were stronger when we had the ball, so that’s a plus. We have to do that more. We let Mexico play a bit too much. In the second half I was on the ball more and I could threaten the opposition going forward. That’s a much nicer feeling.’ Van Gaal’s approach to this tournament has been interesting. Recognising, perhaps, that his squad is not blessed with quality throughout, the incoming Manchester United manager has set Holland up to soak up pressure and use the pace of Robben and the intelligence of Wesley Sneijder and Manchester United's Robin van Persie on the counter-attack. At times it has worked spectacularly, as it did in their opening demolition of Spain. At others - against Australia and then Mexico - it has almost been their undoing. At home, question marks are asked constantly of Van Gaal’s approach and it says much for his players’ faith in him that they adhere slavishly to his instructions. Demolition: Robben shoots and scores during Holland's 5-1 mauling of Spain in the group stage . It would appear, though, that Holland are preparing to be more proactive at Arena Fonte Nova on Saturday. ‘Of course in Holland we’re used to playing 4-3-3; attacking football with two wingers,’ agreed Robben. ‘But I think you also have to look at the quality of the squad. That’s what we did and what the manager did. ‘We spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system. I think it’s very functional, maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing, but still very good. ‘And we’ve played four games and scored 12 goals, so that’s pretty positive. Positive: Holland have scored 12 goals in just four matches at this summer's World Cup finals in Brazil . ‘I think we are on a mission together and when you come to a World Cup it’s not to enjoy the weather and enjoy the beach in Rio. You’re here to win matches and to go as far as possible. ‘I don’t think the expectations were that high before the tournament and as a result we can be very proud of where we are.’ Certainly there is a sense of purpose among the Dutch that has not always been apparent in previous tournaments. They do, though, occasionally look as if they are a step away from implosion.Costa Rica will have precious little fear on Saturday. They have already shown the ability to take down superior opposition and victories against Uruguay and Italy were as deserved as they were unexpected. The Dutch will suffer from the absence of the injured Nigel de Jong and it will be interesting to see how they line up. Against Mexico, the Dutch back three looked uncomfortable at times without the former Manchester City midfielder to shield them. With Robben in the team and in such prime form, however, Holland will continue to be dangerous. Few in Holland can remember seeing him play better. Ecstatic: Robben celebrates following Holland's dramatic comeback against Mexico in the last-16 . ‘I just feel very strong,’ he said. ‘I feel good, I feel fit and I think that’s the most important thing because I can transfer everything onto the pitch. I’m having a lot of fun and really enjoying it here. Mentally, I feel really good and, physically, I feel very strong. ‘I can play my football and I’m really happy that I can help the team. I think we (the senior players) also have the responsibility for the younger guys. ‘We try to take them along and I think we’ve got a good mixture of experience and youth at the moment. Again, everything we do, we do together and it was beautiful to turn the Mexico game around as a team.’","Arjen Robben keen for Holland to take charge of Saturday's quarter-final clash with Costa Rica .

"By . Martin Samuel . Is there anything more pointless than a World Cup opening ceremony? Joining the league against the march of the unstoppable Sepp Blatter perhaps? Trying to find where the money’s gone again? Putting the toothpaste back in the tube? The Olympic flame lighting gala is part of the wonder of the event. Fortunes are spent, the biggest names are hired. Histories unfold and the Arctic Monkeys rock out. By contrast, there will be 18th birthday parties in Essex this weekend that have more wit and imagination than this. Trio: Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte perform during the opening ceremony of the 2014 World Cup in Arena de Sao Paulo . Start: J-LO acknowledges the crowd after singing the official World Cup song 'We Are One (Ola Ola)' alongside Pitbull . High notes: Singer Leitte performs during the opening ceremony of the 2014 World Cup where the Brazuca ball was before it split into segments . There were plenty of perfectly viable ways to start this World Cup — the ceremonial beheading of various disgraced FIFA executive committee members, for instance — but Brazil 2014 went for the usual. A cast of hundreds twirling colourfully but to no real purpose, representing the same old cliches that bear about as much resemblance to the true soul of Brazil as Morris dancers would cut to the heart of old England. Still, it was good to see the spirit of Frank Sidebottom rekindled in the dancers with what appeared to be footballs for heads. They resisted the opportunity to do Frank’s own World Cup song, Three Shirts On The Line — a pulsating tale of the time his ball went over next door’s fence — but you can’t have everything. All opening ceremonies have a central theme, though, and this was no exception. Nature, people and football — ‘Brazil’s greatest treasures,’ according to FIFA, who would know a bit about plundering them — were the subject of this one, which included 660 dancers, floaters and others just standing for large parts of the process wondering how hot it could get inside a giant football head before a person passed out. As ever, the action was ripe with hidden meaning. In the mood: J-LO, Leitte and Pitbull perform on the central stage in Sao Paulo ahead of the World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia . The World Cup stage: The Brazuca ball split into segments to allow Pitbull, J-LO and Leitte to perform during the opening ceremony . Looking on: A Brazil fan waits for the start of the Group A match against Croatia, which the host nation won 3-1 . A mix of all kinds: A Mexico fan looks on while wearing his eccentric peacock-feathered headdress during the opening ceremony in Sao Paulo . Many had the tall folk on stilts down as representing the trees of the Amazonian rainforest, but those of a more creative bent will have instantly spotted the subtle representation of England’s back four against Germany in Bloemfontein. The same stilted sideways movement, uncannily similar pace. Maybe the trees turned quicker and had a better positional sense, but there is always a degree of artistic licence where these festivals are concerned. Soon after, dancers in national costumes old and new celebrated together, some performing somersaults and cartwheels, representing the joy that is felt among the various members of FIFA ExCo when the bloke from Qatar turns up with a sackload of readies. More formally attired attendants represented the lawyers telling journalists they can’t make jokes like that, because nothing of this nature has been proven. And that they’re racists, probably.

The helicopters circling overhead told a different World Cup story, one of resentment and unrest, but nothing fell down, so by the standards of modern tournament organisation, this equates to a triumph. The Arena Corinthians is another of those FIFA-endorsed projects that goes down so well in countries whose citizens still dwell in slums. Sao Paulo, the club and the city, had a perfectly passable 67,000-capacity stadium in town that needed modernisation. Instead, FIFA insisted on a new ground and this was built to the east of the city for Sao Paulo’s great rivals Corinthians, huge and white, with fabulous views of the local poverty.

Maybe this will change as the competition progresses and Brazil with it, but right now the idea of football returning to its spiritual home feels like a headline more than a truth. Those inside the stadium were noisy, enthusiastic and clearly good to go, but the rest of the country is still asking what the World Cup can do for them.

The court ruled that the deal between Real and the Madrid council, which would allow land adjacent to the stadium to be incorporated into the stadium overhaul, should be suspended because the European Commission is examining it for possible illegal state aid.

'For me, it's always very important, the choice of captain,' van Gaal told the official club website. 'Wayne has shown a great attitude towards everything he does.

'It looks like Wayne's going to be the main candidate for it, so I don't see why not,' said Jagielka at the official Barclays Premier League launch. 'If you look at the way he's matured over the last few years, obviously there's games where he probably does get a little too heated up, but that's what we love about the way he plays - his passion. 'And I'm sure the England fans would love that as well. 'I think it's definitely a good decision for Manchester United to make him captain and I think the way he's progressed over the last few years, settling down with a family and all sorts, I think he'd be a great choice as England captain.'

The 31-year-old defender backed Rooney to thrive on guiding United's youngsters through the Premier League ranks this season. England finished bottom of Group D in Brazil with just one point and no victories in a lacklustre campaign, with captain Gerrard retiring in the aftermath. Boss Hodgson revealed earlier this week he has never considered standing down, hinting that Rooney is the front-runner for the captaincy, and Jagielka believes appointing the former Everton striker would be a shrewd move.

"By . John Drayton . Southampton are keen on Javier Hernandez but face a difficult battle to fend off competition from Inter Milan. The south coast club can offer more cash up front than the Italians in particular but Hernandez would be keen to play European football if he left United. The Mexican has been continually linked with a move away from Old Trafford and is currently on United's pre-season tour of the USA. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Javier Hernandez in Mexico training at the World Cup . On the move? Javier Hernandez (left) is wanted by Southampton and Inter Milan . Spot on: Javier Hernandez scores for Manchester United in their penalty shootout win over Inter Milan . And Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is confident of signing up to three new players in the next week. Speaking after his side's 3-1 pre-season friendly win over Brighton, he told the Southern Echo: 'We are close to signing two or three new players and we hope to bring them in in the next week,” said Koeman. 'We show our ambition. Of course we lost some good players but that’s part of the life and part of the good season Southampton had last season. Still we are with the same ambition as before.' Sportsmail revealed that Southampton had asked for Hernandez during talks over a deal for Luke Shaw in June. In an interview with Corriere dello Sport on Tuesday, he said: 'I know there is much interest in me from the Italian club and I thank them for this. Uncertain future: Morgan Schneiderlin has been linked with a move to Tottenham . Saints marching on: Southampton's players celebrate James Ward-Prowse's goal in the win over Brighton . 'There are also other teams and everything obviously is pleasing, but right now I belong to Manchester United and it would be disrespectful to mention other teams even though I do not know what will happen once the tour of the US concludes. 'Do I liked the Nerazzurri? They are a great club, but if I were to transfer, I would not say no to any club. Italian football, however, is amongst the best in the world, I have followed it since I was little and it would be a very important showcase at a personal level. 'I am a professional player, I am committed and working in this direction, ready for any eventuality, but at this moment I cannot say any more.' Optimistic: Ronald Koeman is confident of signing three new players within a week . Koeman has seen Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Luke Shaw leave this summer but is hopeful Morgan Schneiderlin - who was left out of the win over Brighton - will not follow suit. He added: 'He was not in a good shape to play because he has been training only for five or six days and normally he will play next week against Leverkusen at home. 'About his situation, we wait. He is a player of Southampton and I hope he will continue as a player of Southampton.'","Hernandez keen to play European football next season which Inter can offer .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has backed Daniel Sturridge to stake his claim as the club's most influential player after the loss of Luis Suarez. The pair scored 52 goals between them last season as Liverpool came within two points of winning the Premier League title before Suarez was sold to the Barcelona for £75 million. Despite losing a striker voted as the Player of the Year, Fowler insists the club will move on and Sturridge will emerge from under the Uruguay international's shadow. Scroll down for videos... This is your moment! Daniel Sturridge (C)  will shine following the departure of Luis Suarez . Double act: Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 league goals between them last season . 'He's got that chance now, to go out there and prove to everyone what we already know: that he's a great player,' Fowler told Liverpoolfc.com. 'We know he's been a shining light since he's been here, but now he's got even more of a chance.' The player known as 'God' at Anfield has seen a succession of great forwards arrive and leave Merseyside and Fowler has no doubt that cycle will continue in the wake of Suarez's departure. 'He's a great player, but no-one's bigger than the club and we all know and accept that,' Fowler said. Living legend: Robbie Fowler has seen great players come and go at Anfield . 'We all know he's a phenomenal player, but Liverpool as a club, they just go on. Think of all the players that have gone in the past -- great players -- and they've always adapted and gone on to do well. 'When Ian Rush went, someone came in and done a job -- obviously I came in after Rushie, I forgot about that! I come in and done alright, then Michael [Owen] was there - he was always handy as well; you've got Fernando Torres who was brilliant at Liverpool. He leaves and Suarez comes in and does an unbelievable job. 'Now all of a sudden people are saying 'what will we do?' but Liverpool as a club will always go on. Whatever team Brendan [Rodgers] puts out, they'll all be singing from the same hymn-sheet and wanting to do well.' CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"By . Elliott Bretland . Follow @@EllBretland . Southampton fans will be wondering whether they'll have a team left to support when the Premier League kicks off in the three weeks time as the summer exodus down on the south coast shows no signs of stopping. Following Southampton's impressive eighth-placed finish last season, it was expected certain members of the squad would move on. As it was, boyhood Red Rickie Lambert moved to Liverpool for £4million and was followed to Anfield by Adam Lallana who joined Brendan Rodgers' side in a £23million deal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Southampton's two summer signings Tadic and Pelle . Mass exodus: Southampton have willingly allowed a number of key players to leave the club this summer . Switch: Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert both left Southampton for Liverpool following an impressive season . Red Devil: Talented left-back Luke Shaw joined Manchester United from Southampton in a £30million deal . Man at the helm: Mauricio Pochettino left St Mary's this summer to take charge of league rivals Tottenham . Meanwhile, talented left-back Luke Shaw joined the Louis van Gaal revolution at Old Trafford as the 19-year-old signed for Manchester United for £30million. Now, with still six weeks of the transfer window remaining, it was announced on Friday that Dejan Lovren is on the brink of joining up with Lallana and Lambert on Merseyside. Just as that news was sinking in, Saints . supporters then had to hear young right-back Calum Chambers is all set . for a £12m switch to Arsenal. 'When will it stop?' followers of the . club must be thinking. Perhaps once Morgan Schneiderlin - heavily linked . with Tottenham - joins up with former Southampton boss Mauricio . Pochettino at White Hart Lane? Yes, even the manager departed. After that, bad boy Dani Osvaldo will likely return to Italy with Inter Milan keen on the former Roma striker while frontman Jay Rodriguez, interesting both Spurs and Liverpool, has at least been offered a five-year contract to ward off any potential suitors. Plenty to shout about: Saints centre-back Dejan Lovren is on the brink of a £20million switch to Liverpool . Soon to be rivals? Calum Chambers is moving to Arsenal while Morgan Schneiderlin is wanted by Spurs . With barely anybody left to play, the question has to be asked: Why have Southampton stood aside to see most of their playing squad jump ship? It seems there's been no fight, no 'hands off warnings', nothing. Such is the nature of the Premier League, . any players with a smidgen of talent who perform well for an entire . season will undoubtedly be hoovered up by the big boys. However, boasting a squad of such quality, the club could have done more in an attempt to keep much of the side together. Where is the ambition? Often these situations turn into long-running transfer sagas with the player either switching on August 31 or staying put. Not for Southampton, they've been quick to strike deals. Southampton are in a strong financial position and could have easily told interested parties that the club's best players were not for sale. Instead, they chose to roll over and cash in at the first opportunity. Of course, while it is wise to think about harmony . among the camp and the damaging influence a player who doesn't want to . be there can have on the dressing room, Southampton must also consider . the fact that you need 11 players to play a football match - at this . rate, that won't be possible. Bad boy: Inter Milan are keen on signing Dani Osvaldo who joined the Saints from Roma last summer . On target: Frontman Jay Rodriguez has at least been offered a new deal to ward off any potential suitors . Would half the team have left had former executive chairman Nicola Cortese remained at the club? The . Italian, who stepped down from his role at St Mary's over alleged 'differences' with . owner Katharina Liebherr, is adamant the squad would still be . together if he was still there. Speaking to BBC Sport in May, Cortese said: 'I knew the . players themselves wanted to stick together because this vision was . something they believed in, too. I didn’t see any reason for them to go. 'We created those talents. It was key to keep them. You don't produce them just to sell, otherwise you give away your ambition. 'I . didn’t have written offers, but I obviously had phone calls. My answer . was that it was not going to happen for at least the next two seasons. 'The other chairmen respected that. Until the day I left, there were no offers.' Adamant: Nicola Cortese believes Southampton's star men would have stayed had he remained in charge . Following the mass departures, it is now up to new manager Ronald Koeman to start the rebuild job. The Dutchman arrived from Feyenoord earlier this summer and has already raided his former club for £8million striker Graziano Pelle. Serbian wideman Dusan Tadic, a £10.3million signing from FC Twente, has also arrived but Koeman, with just two new signings so far, has his work cut out in replacing so many vital players in just over a month. If Koeman . is given the majority of funds from the countless player sales, . Southampton should have nothing to worry about. They may even be buoyed . if the money is invested in the infrastructure of the club. Tough task: New manager Ronald Koeman must essentially build a Southampton first team from scratch . Floored: New Southampton striker Graziano Pelle looks on during the Saints' friendly win over Swindon . However, . 51-year-old Koeman has essentially been tasked with building a squad . from scratch that is capable of finishing in the top-half of the table. That's a whole load of players who will need to gel in a short space of . time. Southampton's . recent successes have stemmed from the club's esteemed academy but it . mustn't be assumed that top players will continue to come coming through and so the . club have to spend.

"By . Simon Jones . Tottenham have struck a deal with Swansea to sign Ben Davies and Michel Vorm with Gylfi Sigurdsson and cash going the other way. The £15million arrangement sees Tottenham pip Liverpool to both targets. Davies, a 21-year-old Wales international, has moved to White Hart Lane despite Liverpool's overtures because he believes he will play more regularly.

The 30-year-old Vorm will provide competition for Hugo Lloris who recently signed a new five year contract. Liverpool have interest in Sevilla's Alberto Moreno which is threatened by Atletico Madrid. He is also considered over-priced and it could prompt a renewed bid for Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand. Playing time: The prospect of first team football led Davies to choose Tottenham over Liverpool . They have offered the buyout clause of £8.5million for Loic Remy at QPR, but he may have to drop his wage demands for the deal to be concluded.

With convenient timing, Liverpool agreed on Saturday an £8.5million fee with QPR for French World Cup striker Loic Remy at the same time they were playing their first match on English soil since selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Boyhood Liverpool fan Lambert, who was released by them at 15, made his debut in yesterday’s 2-1 win at Preston. The contest was rendered meaningless by an avalanche of substitutions that saw a total of 47 players used.
