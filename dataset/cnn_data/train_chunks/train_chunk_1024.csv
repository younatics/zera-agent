"Nearly a quarter of British holidaymakers are willing to travel from a remote airport for cheaper flights and endure one or two connections, a survey of 9,000 Brits has revealed. And a third of travellers would be willing to sacrifice refreshments for an entire flight if it meant securing a cheaper fare. However, despite this, Ryanair - which specialises in cheap fares to out-of-town destinations without any on board frills - has been voted the worst airline in the UK. Out of favour: Holidaymakers rank other airlines higher than Ryanair for value for money . When asked to name their favourite, holidaymakers voted for British Airways which topped the poll with nearly a quarter of the vote (23 per cent), followed by Virgin Atlantic in second place, according to the annual TripAdvisor study. At the other end of the scale, Ryanair was named Brits’ least favourite airline, with nearly half of all votes polled (49 per cent) – compared to just two per cent naming it their favourite airline. The age of austerity seems to be having an impact on business travel too, with 72 per cent of business travellers having flown on a no-frills airline in the last 12 months. In fact, British business travellers are now less likely to fly exclusively with a full service airline (28 per cent) than British leisure travellers (32 per cent). The annual air travel survey by TripAdvisor also revealed that when it comes to finding the cheapest airfare, the travel agent is no longer the go-to source for most British travellers. Best overall: British Airways has been named the UK's favourite airline in a poll . Fewer than one five say they find the lowest prices using the traditional route, compared to over a third who say they can find the cheapest fares on price comparison sites. Almost a third of Brits cite their previous experience of flying with an airline as one of the three most important factors when choosing flights. The survey also revealed that over half of British travellers have experienced flight delays in the last 12 months and, of those, one in six (15 per cent) suffered delays lasting for more than six hours. Yet despite the high number experiencing delays, only one in ten (10 per cent) chose to claim compensation. However, the good news for travellers is that, for those who did make a claim following a delay, two-thirds said they received compensation successfully. In-flight meals: A third of passengers would be happy to ditch food on planes in favour of cheaper fares . Katherine Clark, regional business development director for TripAdvisor Flights, said: ‘Flights can make up a significant part of a trip in terms of both cost and experience,  the results of this year’s survey show that price continues to be a concern, with a significant portion of British travellers willing to forgo some comfort for savings.’ The survey also revealed those inflight amenities that British travellers could not do without. Over three-quarters (76 per cent) said that legroom is most important to them, compared to just six per cent naming inflight entertainment options and three per cent naming meal options as most important. The least favoured inflight amenity was duty free shopping, with less than one per cent of the vote.","Budget airline was voted UK's least favourite by 49% of 9,000 surveyed .

"Benefits are to rise by almost 50 per cent more than the average wage, sparking another coalition row over curbing increases in handouts. New inflation figures today showed the rate of inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in September, its lowest level for nearly three years. But the inflation figure will be used to determine increases in benefits and pensions, and is significantly higher than the 1.5 per cent average annual pay rises which bosses are giving to those in work. Many with jobs have faced pay freezes. The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has been higher than annual pay rises for most of the last two years, which means wages have failed to increase in line with the cost of living . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to hold talks with Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith about changing the way hikes in benefits are determined. The September inflation figure is used to decide by how much benefits rise. Whitehall estimates suggest £14billion could have been saved since 2008 if they had risen in line with wages instead of inflation. The Consumer Prices Index fell to 2.2 per cent in September, down from 2.5 per cent in August and the lowest level since November 2009, the Office for National Statistics. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has made clear he wants to ensure that work always pays more than benefits . Latest figures show average earnings for people in work are up by only 1.5 per cent year-on-year, which means their income is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living. Last year CPI was 5.2 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats battled to secure the full rise in benefits. If benefits had been increased in line with pay rises last year, at 2.5 per cent, it would have saved £5 billion. Chancellor George Osborne wants to find £10billion in extra savings from the welfare bill, which the Lib Dems are resisting . Lib Dem minister David Laws has highlighted how his party has ‘fought battles on uprating of benefits to make sure people who are poor don't get pushed further into poverty’. However, with the Tories committed to finding an extra £10billion in savings from the welfare budget, pressure will grow to look again at the way rises are calculated. Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg rejected the idea of a further raid on benefits. He said: 'The idea that of that £16billion [welfare budget] we are just going to scoop out £10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest, no. Flatly no. Of course not.' While inflation has dropped, gas and electricity rises are expected to push it higher after four of the ‘big six’ energy firms announced price rises. Mr Osborne is expected to announce the outcome of talks with Mr Duncan Smith on changing the way increases in benefits and pensions are decided. Today the Treasury said September's fall in the inflation rate would bring 'welcome relief to the budgets of families and businesses'. Economist Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said while inflation had fallen close to the Government's two per cent target, the decrease was likely to be 'the last for a while'. Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said the drop in flation was welcome, but further hikes in energy and food prices loom in the coming months. She added: 'Instead of easing the squeeze, the Government is making things even harder for families on low and middle incomes. 'Millions of families and pensioners will be worse off because of the 3p rise in fuel duty and cuts to child benefit in January, and the granny tax which comes in on the same day that millionaires get a tax cut in April.'","Inflation in September was 2.2 per cent which will decide the rate of increase in benefits and pensions .

"Milkman David Reid, 71, ran down a cyclist when driving his float on the wrong side of the road and then carried on his round saying he had customers to serve, Burnley Crown Court heard . A 71-year-old milkman who ran down a cyclist when driving his float on the wrong side of the road carried on his round saying 'they are dangerous' and he had customers to serve. David Reid stopped briefly to check on Royal Navy submariner Paul Reynolds, 36, as he lay injured in the road before getting back into his vehicle and telling a teenage passenger: 'I think he's dead.' He then delivered milk to four houses before eventually going to a post office to raise the alarm - but made 15 more deliveries before returning to scene of the crash in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Today, Reid was fined £3,000 and given a 70 day suspended sentence plus 70 hours unpaid work after he was convicted of careless driving at Burnley Crown Court. He was found not guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by a jury at an earlier hearing, but was handed 10 penalty points for failing to report an accident. Mr Reynolds, 36, who was cycling to his naval base at the time of the crash, was in a coma for six months and has been left permanently disabled. He suffered severe head injuries and multiple fractures to his pelvis in the accident on February 27 last year and requires two carers round the clock in a nursing home. Reid, who has worked as a milkman for 50 years, was driving on the wrong side of the road at 8mph when he crashed head on into Mr Reynolds, causing the submariner to smash into the windscreen. The 36-year-old was thrown on to a grass verge several metres away and his bike was left entangled in the railings. A 15-year-old schoolboy who was travelling with Reid told an earlier trial: 'Dave got out to see if he was alright, he said hello to him and he came back and said to me 'I think he's dead'. 'He kept saying 'What do I do?' and then he went 'Cyclists, they are dangerous on the road - they do not pay attention.' ' Mr Guy Mathieson prosecuting said: 'The collision caused the cyclist to propel up into the air seemingly striking his head on the windscreen. He was left on the grass verge the bike left entangled in the railings. 'Mr Reid found him unconscious and unresponsive. But rather than alerting the authorities he carried on with his milk round. He said that he had to in effect, because, 'I have customers that I can't let down'. 'He stopped at a local post office about 6.15am 10 minutes after the accident happened. He alerted the person at the post office and gave details of where and what had happened but didn't leave any of his own details and left instructions that the person at the post office phone the police. 'He then finished the round and completing the day's work. Mr Reynolds, 36, who was cycling to his naval base at the time of the crash on Bank Lane, Barrow, Cumbria, has been left permanently disabled . Reid was fined £3,000 and given a 70 days suspended sentence plus 70 hours unpaid work after he was convicted of careless driving . 'Members of the public came across the scene and found Mr Reynolds in the position he was in and attended to him.' Mr Reynold's parents John and Margaret whose younger son Carl died in 1994 from leukaemia said they had to travel 120 miles a day to sit with their son at his bedside for five hours each day. His mother described herself as 'heartbroken and his father 'a broken man'. Reid insisted he had been driving carefully and claimed the impact occurred when he had started to make a right turn on an unlit street he likened to 'a black hole.' He added: 'There was a whoosh across the front of my screen. I didn't know what it was. I heard a bang. 'I said to him 'can you hear me?' a few times. There was no response. He was just lying there. I didn't dare touch him. I went back to the van and as I did that I looked around to see if any house lights were on. There was only one about twenty yards away, but it only had a sort of landing light.' Speaking at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Reid: 'You drove into a head on collision with Paul Reynolds who was on his way to serve Queen and country as a submariner' Reid said he went to the Post Office to call for help because he did not have a mobile phone. After going to the post office and asking someone to ring the emergency services he was in a 'confused' state of mind and made fifteen more milk deliveries before dropping off his young helper. He said: 'It isn't in my nature at all to be callous. I was driving as I normally drive and that is careful'. His counsel Mr Richard Vardon said: 'He still can't understand why he behaved in the way he did after the accident. He is at a total loss as to what was going through his mind.' But Judge Graham Knowles QC told Reid: 'You drove into a head on collision with Paul Reynolds who was on his way to serve Queen and country as a submariner. You exited, checked Mr Reynolds, you thought he was dead. You went on your delivery before doing anything to help. He was alive but catastrophically injured. 'You drove on the right hand side of the road and oncoming traffic could have no view of you until a late stage. It boarded on in my view the dangerous. This is a bad case but so far as harm goes it is one of the worst. I'm sure your driving was a cause of his injuries, true was he did not have lights on, no high visibility wear - but your driving was a cause of the collision. 'The fine - that is the only sentence I can impose - is not and could not be a measured of the valuation of the harm done and grief caused on that February morning.'","David Reid was driving his milk float on the wrong side  when he hit cyclist .

"A father who was left 'moments from death' by a major heart attack was told he had to return to work or lose his benefits while he lay in hospital waiting for quadruple bypass surgery. Colin Rogers, 58, was hooked up to heart monitors when he received a phone call telling him he was expected to continue a government work programme. The father, from the Wirral, Merseyside, said concerned nurses noticed his heart rate beginning to accelerate after the call to his mobile phone. Colin Rogers, 58, was waiting in hospital for quadruple bypass surgery after a heart attack when he received a phone call telling him he had to return to a government work programme . Mr Rogers, pictured with his wife Carol, was lying in bed, hooked up to heart monitors, when he received the call to his mobile phone from contractors A4e . Mr Rogers was admitted to Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, after suffering severe chest pain. His wife, Carol, was later told the former factory worker was 'moments from death' as his heart failed on September 27. Specialists said he had to undergo quadruple heart bypass surgery, but while he was waiting for the operation, on October 6, Mr Rogers received a phone call from A4e - a company contracted to provide the government work programme. A manager at the company told Mr Rogers he had signed up to the scheme and would have to continue with it. Mr Rogers, who is now recovering at home, told the Liverpool Echo: 'I couldn't believe that they were ringing me because I had given my wife a list of people who needed to be told and she had contacted the Job Centre and told them A4e needed to be informed what had happened to me. 'So I was completely shocked and I said to the guy I couldn't believe he was phoning me, that he was supposed to have been told that I had a heart attack. 'This guy was persisting about wanting to discuss the next plan of action but I said I was ending the conversation and put the phone down.' Mr Rogers, who worked for Champion Spark Plugs until the factory closed down, said a nurse noticed his heart rate monitor and asked if the 58-year-old was all right, but he was too 'embarrassed' to tell her what had happened. Back at home: Mr Rogers, who is now at home recovering, said he was shocked at the call and hung up on the A4e manager . Mr Rogers, from the Wirral, Merseyside, was given quadruple heart bypass surgery at Broadgreen Hospital, in Liverpool . He added: 'I was disgusted with what had happened. I want to work, but all I seem to be doing is fighting these people.' Mrs Rogers said: 'He was not supposed to be stressed. It's been horrendous, Even though my doctor said he may never work again, they are saying to us he has to finish the back to work programme.' Their son, Craig, told MailOnline: 'He's at home and is trying to recover from a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery.' A spokesman for A4e said: 'The telephone call that was made to Mr Rogers had been pre-arranged two months earlier, and when we rang him, we were unaware that he had been taken seriously ill. 'A4e had not been directly informed that Mr Rogers was seriously ill before we made the call to him, and we could not have known he was in hospital. 'The conversation was very brief and as soon as we realised Mr Rogers was in hospital, we ended the call. All the correct procedures were followed, and no further contact has been made. 'Our adviser apologised profusely at the time. We wish Mr Rogers a full recovery and are obviously sorry that this has caused him distress.' A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said correct procedures had been followed.","Colin Rogers, 58, was left 'moments from death' by a major heart attack .

"When Tina Lessiter joined a gym, she was hoping to lose weight, get fit and put her divorce behind her. What she hadn’t anticipated was falling in love with her female fitness instructor. But Miss Lessiter, 38, is now planning a future with the woman who helped her shed four stone. Scroll down for video . Tina Lessiter (right) gained four stone after her divorce. But after joining a gym and shedding the weight, she also found love with her fitness instructor Gemma Mullinger (left) Recalling the first time she met Miss Mullinger, Ms Lessiter said: 'I really admired the way she carried herself. She stood out, and lit up the room. I thought if I tried really hard, I could one day look as good as she did' She was introduced to personal trainer Gemma Mullinger, 26, last year when she joined a gym for the first time, and the pair soon became close friends. Miss Lessiter said: ‘I thought of her as a great mate and it hadn’t crossed my mind to be with someone of the same sex. ‘We went on a night out together as friends and by the end of the evening we were a couple.’ Miss Mullinger said: ‘I’d never thought of being with another woman until I met Tina, and neither had she, so it took us by surprise. ‘We’re both amazed at how happy we are together.’ Miss Lessiter, a community care worker from Barnstaple, Devon, became overweight and unhappy following the breakdown of her seven-year marriage in 2006. In the years that followed, her weight ballooned to nearly 18st as she fell into habits of eating junk food to make her feel better. Ms Lessiter began attending the gym six nights a week, and became goood friends with Miss Mullinger . Feeling unhealthy and unmotivated, she decided to seek out a personal trainer. She said: ‘My brother-in-law Sam handed me a leaflet for a local ladies-only gym. I reasoned that I’d been sitting around doing nothing for too long, so I decided to take the plunge and give it a go. BEFORE . Breakfast: Croissants . Lunch: Cheese and ham sandwich made on thick white bread, chocolate bar . Dinner: Indian takeaway with naan and rice . Snacks: Savoury snacks such as pasties . AFTER . Breakfast: Smoked haddock with poached eggs, fruit and vegetable juice . Lunch: Leftover home-made pork and vegetable curry . Dinner: Fresh seafood pasta . Snacks: Fruit, nuts and seeds . ‘I’ve always been big. I can’t remember a time when my weight didn’t fluctuate. ‘When I split from my husband in 2006, things rather spun out of control. I’d happily eat an extra-large bar of Galaxy chocolate all to myself. I found being in a room surrounded by so many fit people quite intimidating. ‘Luckily Gemma, who led the classes, was really welcoming. I really admired the way she carried herself. She stood out, and lit up the room. I thought that if I tried really hard, I could one day look as good as she did.’ In June 2013, Miss Lessiter weighed 17st 10lb and wore size 20 clothing. She started going to the gym up to six nights a week, and found herself bonding ever closer with Miss Mullinger. She added: ‘We both loved food, so Gemma was able to help me make the switch over from the unhealthy, fattening food I was eating to a diet plan, tailored just for me.’ Before beginning her weight-loss programme, Miss Lessiter typically ate croissants for breakfast, thick white bread with cheese and ham and a chocolate bar for lunch, and an Indian takeaway with naan bread and rice for her evening meal. She would snack on savoury snacks such as pasties during the day. Today, she often eats smoked haddock with poached eggs and fruit and vegetable juice for breakfast, followed by leftover home-made pork and vegetable curry for lunch, with fresh seafood pasta for her evening meal. When she snacks she enjoys fruit, nuts and seeds. Miss Lessiter now weighs 13st 10lb and wears size 14 dresses. Miss Mullinger said: ‘I’m really proud of the journey that Tina has been on. I would love her whatever she looked like, but having been through a similar journey myself before I became a personal trainer, I know how tough it can be to make that turnaround.’ Miss Mullinger helped Ms Lessiter's weight fall by four stone from 17st 10lbs and a size 20 . She said since meeting Miss Mullinger, she no longer watches TV. 'We prefer to spend time away in our campervan, enjoying the countryside, walking and spending time with our family and friends'","Tina Lessiter, 38, was 18st and size 20 due to overeating after her divorce .

"Nurse David Hadfield, who has been found guilty of repeatedly headbutting a seriously ill pensioner at the Royal Blackburn Hospital . A critical care nurse is facing jail after he was found guilty of repeatedly headbutting a seriously ill pensioner he was meant to be caring for in hospital. David Hadfield, 54, struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead three times while he was being treated at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. The pensioner, who was confused and having trouble breathing, was attacked after he became distressed when Hadfield changed his sheets. Today the jury at Preston Crown Court found Hadfield guilty of unlawful wounding, prompting cries from the public gallery from his family. Hadfield, who will be sentenced next month, showed no emotion as the verdict was read out and shook his head as he left the dock after the judge warned him he will face jail. Mr Bretherton, who was left with three cuts to his head, had been admitted to hospital in August last year after being diagnosed with acute pancreatits and Hadfield was assigned to look after him. During the four-day trial, Tim Storrie, prosecuting, explained: 'Thomas Bretherton was struck more than once causing wounds to open on his head after he was repeatedly headbutted.' Hadfield had claimed that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheets and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him. But giving evidence at court, his colleague Leanne Whittaker, a staff nurse, said: 'This was a very poorly patient. He wouldn’t have had the energy to move himself forward. 'I was stood at the nurses’ station and I was alerted that there was shouting. 'It got louder and then I heard something like ""shut up and lie down. It was a man’s voice. 'I put the monitor on so I could see what was going on and it looked like Hadfield threw himself forcefully into the patient. 'He did this three times and made contact three times with the patient’s forehead. 'I shouted out ""that is absolutely disgusting"" and everybody was shocked.' Pensioner Thomas Bretherton was being treated by Hadfield at a ward at the Royal Blackburn Hospital when he was attacked . The court was told Mr Bretherton had been calm and sleeping when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheets. Caroline Piper, another colleague who gave evidence during the trial, had been standing 40 feet away when the incident happened on August 6. She said: 'The patient was lying at a 45 degree angle. 'His hands were being held and so he was trying to sit forward. 'He did lunge forward with his head but he did not make contact with David. 'He wasn’t near enough to make contact. Today, Hadfield, was found guilty of assault at Preston Crown Court, pictured, and was warned he will face jail . 'David then lunged with his head towards the patient and I saw their heads clash. 'David lunged towards him three times. 'I was stunned and baffled by what I saw and I couldn’t make sense of it.' Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although his passing was not related at all to the incident. Judge Simon Newell said: 'Given the nature of the assault and the circumstances which are well known to all of us, you are likely to be given a custodial sentence.' Hadfield was released on bail until he is sentenced on November 25.","David Hadfield struck Thomas Bretherton, 72, at Royal Blackburn Hospital .

"Police in Houston have charged two men for the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jose Meraz, who was slashed to death with a machete. The boy's mutilated body was discovered in a heavily wooded area near the Addicks Reservoir by a dog walker. A third suspect, a 14-year-old male is being referred to Harris County Juvenile Probation Department authorities on a murder charge. 14-year-old Jose Meraz was slashed to death with a machete and his body was left in a wooded area . Meraz was a student at Houston's Stovall Middle School and was known as the 'Traveler' as he lived with various family members and friends when his parents returned to their native Honduras. According to relatives, the lack of stability affected him and he grew depressed. His emotional state meant he was targeted as a potential recruit by gangs and he was a member for a short time. However, he found comfort when he moved in with his aunt and then Maria and Jose Martinez, pastors of Minesterio Internacional Restaurando Los Muros, at a house church in north Houston. In the weeks afterward, he seemed to have turned a new page, the couple said. Meraz's body was discovered on September 17, two days after he was brutally murdered - police in Houston have now charged Jose Granados-Guevara, 22, and William Alexander Valladares, 17 with murder . Police said Meraz's decision to 'want out' of a gang was 'one of the motivating factors that led to his death' Following his death, friends and family linked his death to the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang, which is known for using machetes when carrying out acts of violence. Police and federal authorities have declined to discuss the specifics of the killing but said his decision to leave the gang was a 'motivating factor' that led to his death. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant Sturdivant said: 'Jose Meraz was a member of this organization for a short amount of time and he did not want to be a member in the future he wanted out and that was one of the motivating factors that led to his death.' Though gang violence is a persistent problem in parts of Houston, Meraz's death has stood out for its savagery and for his youth. Meraz had been a pupil at Stovall Middle School, 25 miles away from where his body was found. Principal Elsa Wright said: 'We grieve the loss of one of our students. We express our sincerest condolences to the family' Houston police homicide detectives arrested Jose Granados-Guevara, 22, and William Alexander Valladares, 17. They are both charged with murder. A third suspect, a 14-year-old male is being referred to Harris County Juvenile Probation Department authorities on a murder charge. Police have also charged Granados-Guevara with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for shooting a person in June.","Jose Meraz, 14, from Houston, Texas, was slashed to death with a machete .

"Rickie Lambert has arrived in Liverpool for his medical ahead of a £4million move to Merseyside. The Southampton striker, who was an unused substitute during England's 3-0 win against Peru on Friday night, was released by the Reds when he was just 15. Now Lambert looks set to link-up with Brendan Rodgers' side, should he complete routine tests without hiccup. On his way: Rickie Lambert (left, next to Adam Lallana) has arrived at Liverpool for his medical . Smoke and mirrors: Liverpool were very protective of their prospective new signing on Saturday morning . On arrival: The club's doctor Zaf Iqbal was pictured leaving Liverpool Spire Hospital after the medical checks . Hotshot: Lambert has been Southampton's talisman since they won promotion to the Premier League in 2012 . The initial £4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes, while the club were keen to keep his whereabouts under wraps. He arrived at Liverpool Spire Hospital at around nine o'clock on Saturday morning; after the medical, a club car reversed right up to the entrance before bundling the striker into the back. Lambert was then taken to the club's training ground at Melwood ahead of a flight back down to Southampton later in the afternoon. The 32-year-old, who began his career at Liverpool’s academy, will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club. He could even be followed by two of his team-mates from Southampton, as Liverpool are still negotiating for £25m-rated Adam Lallana and have also targeted Dejan Lovren to bolster their defence. A boyhood Liverpool fan, Lambert finally looks set to earn his big move after a career largely spent in the lower leagues. He wasn't deemed strong enough by Steve McMahon at Blackpool as a youngster before moves to Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers. Alan Pardew then spent £1million to take the target man to St Mary's in 2009. Rodgers wanted the deal done before Roy Hodgson takes his side away to Brazil for the start of the World Cup.

"T. Candice Smith, 31, and her friend were driving down a three-lane Las Vegas interstate in 2012 when her steering wheel began to lock up. The car's engine stopped and Smith's friend had to push the car to the side of the highway to avoid being hit. Smith told the New York Times that the car's shutdown wasn't due to a mechanical failure -- it was her auto lender. Smith's story is similar to that of many people who have borrowed from auto lenders that utilize what are called 'Starter Interrupt Devices.' These devices enable auto lenders to prevent a borrower's car from starting with the push of a button, according to the Times. Starter Interrupt Devices: These devices emit flashing lights, beeping noises and then shuts down the car and prevents it from starting . If a borrower misses an auto payment, lenders may activate a device installed in the car in an attempt to 'remind' the borrower to make the payment. The device emits flashing lights, loud beeping noises and may even prevent the car from starting. The Times reports that the devices are being utilized for many borrowers with credit scores 640 or below. The devices are said to be a way to help repair poor credit and encourage borrowers to consistently make payments on time, according to the Times. David Sailors, executive vice president of Lender Systems Inc., one company that makes starter interrupt devices, said the devices are a 'tough love approach' to helping borrowers make their payments on time. 'We want to help [borrowers] get on their feet,' Sailors told the Times, 'but sometimes it does require a very consistent reminder and in some cases the disablement of the start of their vehicle if they haven't made their payment on time.' Borrowers with a credit score at or below 640 are considered 'subprime,'  and the Times reports that roughly 25 percent of auto loans made last year were considered subprime. This has since increased. Starter interrupt only: Many starter interrupt device manufacturers like PassTime and Lender Systems Inc. say the devices do not shut down moving vehicles, but prevent them from starting . The Times refers to this as the 'subprime boom' and the devices enable lenders to give auto loans to high-risk borrowers. So, borrowers can get auto loans a little easier, but not without having one of these devices installed in their vehicles, ultimately giving lenders final control. The Times reports that these devices have been installed in more than two million vehicles. The Times tells of lender Lionel M. Vead Jr., the head of collections at First Castly Federal Credit Union in Covington, Louisiana, who has once even 'disabled a car while [he] was shopping at Walmart.' The Times reports that Vead can monitor more than 800 borrowers at a time via a computerized map that uses a red marker to show the borrower's locations. Easy loans: Borrowers can get auto loans a little easier, but not without having a starter interrupt device installed in their vehicles, ultimately giving len (stock image) Vead can spot borrowers on the map who have not made their payments and remotely shut down their vehicles at any time. Vead told the times that using the device 'gets [borrower's] attention.' Though the device's purpose is to ultimately benefit borrowers, many have reported lenders shutting down their vehicles at inconvenient times. Many state laws prohibit lenders from seizing cars until the borrowers are in default, which means they have not made a payment in at least 30 days, the Times reports. Many starter interrupt device manufacturers like PassTime, which Smith had in her car, and Lender Systems Inc. say the devices do not shut down moving vehicles, but prevent them from starting. Smith told the Times that her auto lender's (C.A.G. Acceptance) use of the device made her feel helpless. 'I felt like even though I made my payments and was never late under my contract, these people could do whatever they wanted,' Smith said, 'and there was nothing I could do to stop them.'","T.

"In the end an entire season of blood, sweat and tears was decided by one man sitting in a lorry in a Twickenham car park. This unimaginably tense game - taken to extra-time by two magnificently committed and professional teams - came down to the wire. As Northampton desperately hurled themselves at Saracens’ battered, bruised and exhausted defenders it looked as if the north London side were going hold on for two more seconds to claim the Aviva Premiership title they so desperately craved. But out of the gloom at the bottom of the ruck, a pair of hands - belonging to Alex Waller - reached out, inches from the line, and Northampton’s forwards celebrated. Matchwinner: Alex Waller scored a dramatic try in extra time as Northampton Saints beat Saracens . England's finest: Northampton beat Saracens 24-20 on Saturday to be crowned Aviva Premiership champions . Champagne moment: Northampton players celebrate their Aviva Premiership final win . Diving over: Ben Foden scored Northampton Saints' opening try in their Aviva Premiership final vs Saracens . All smiles: George Pisi (right) scored Northampton's second try after collecting Stephen Myler's grubber kick . Try-time: Pisi celebrates putting Northampton 12-9 ahead against Saracens at Twickenham . Last gasp: Marcelo Bosch (left) scored a late try for Saracens to force extra time in the Aviva Premiership final . Saracens: Goode, Ashton, Bosch, Barritt, Strettle, Farrell, de Kock, Barrington, Brits, Stevens, Borthwick, Botha, Brown, Burger, B. Vunipola. Replacements: George, Gill, Johnston, Hargreaves, Wray, Wigglesworth, Hodgson, Wyles. Try: Marcelo Bosch . Penalties: Owen Farrell (3), Charlie Hodgson (2). Northampton: Foden, K. Pisi, G. Pisi, Burrell, North, Myler, Fotuali'i, Corbisiero, Haywood, Ma'afu, Manoa, Lawes, Clark, Wood, Dickinson. Replacements: Hartley, A. Waller, Mercey, C. Day, Dowson, L. Dickson, Wilson, Stephenson. Tries: Foden, Ken Pisi, Alex Waller. Conversions: Stephen Myler (3). Penalty: Myler. Attendance: 81,193 . Referee: JP Doyle (RFU) Not for the first time in the game, . referee JP Doyle was unsure whether to award the try and asked . television match official Graham Hughes - sat in a broadcaster’s trailer . behind the North Stand - for guidance. He had the Aviva  Premiership . title in his hands and he immediately knew the magnitude of the call as a . wry smile crossed his face. ‘I’m not sure if that was a try,’ Doyle said. Nobody . in the ground was. Eventually, after countless replays on the big . screen, Hughes decided in Northampton’s favour. They had won their first . Premiership title. Saracens players dropped to their knees, knowing . their richly promising season had seen them finish empty-handed yet . again. The irony was, if . fly-half Stephen Myler - or anyone else for that matter - had kicked a . simple drop-goal attempt in the build-up to Waller’s contested try, with . Saints having scored two tries to Saracens one, a final scoreline of . 20-20 at the end of extra-time would have handed the Midlanders the . trophy anyway. But they bet the house and won the lot. ‘I . was sure I’d scored it but I just wasn’t sure if the cameras had seen . it,’ said Waller, sporting a black eye from an earlier collision which . had left him needing extensive treatment on the floor. So close: Charlie Hodgson could have won the final for Saracens in normal time but his conversion hit the post . On the mark: Fly-half Owen Farrell kicked Saracens into an early 6-0 lead at Twickenham . ‘Thankfully, . it did. It was one of the most ferocious games I’ve  ever played in and . the extra- time took its toll fitness-wise. It was an incredibly tough . game.’ Technically, . probably, awarding Waller’s try was the right decision. But it was also . almost unimaginably cruel for a Saracens side who  finished the regular . season nine points clear at the top of the table and are, on balance, . the best side and deepest squad in England. To . compound the Londoner’s agony, they believed Owen Farrell had scored a . legitimate try after 63 minutes only for Doyle to again defer to Hughes . while the Saracens fly-half had treatment on the floor for a lower leg . injury he sustained kicking the ball into the crowd in celebration. With . Alex Goode lining up the conversion, Hughes — who moments earlier had . declined to refer a blatant forward pass from Luther Burrell to George . North in the lead-up to George Pisi’s 58th-minute try — prompted Doyle . by asking him ‘is there anything you’d like to check?’ and upon review . he decided that Saracens full-back Alex Goode’s flicked pass to Chris . Wyles was marginally forward and the ‘try’ was chalked off. It prompted a furious response from chief executive Edward Griffiths after the game. ‘Most . teams in the Premiership would say the protocol has become a shambles, . it’s almost “make it up as you go along”,’ said Griffiths. ‘Some . referees use the TMO as a kind of video operator, “show me that again . please”, others take instruction, others take guidance. ‘This sounds like sour grapes but it isn’t, because this would be the case had that final try not been given. ‘The TMO process is a shambles.’ False dawn: Farrell (centre) thought he had scored Saracens' first try of the game but it was disallowed . Hoof: Farrell injured himself after booting the ball in celebration before referee JP Doyle ruled out the try . Ouch: Farrell (right) was attended to by a physio (left) before he was replaced by Charlie Hodgson . Distraught: Farrell was replaced after injuring himself celebrating his disallowed try in the second-half . After . last week’s crushing defeat to Toulon in the Heineken Cup final at the . Millennium Stadium, it was astonishing to see the Saracens players . flinging themselves into every contact as if it were the first game of . the season. The courage on display from both sides was remarkable, even by modern rugby’s standards. In . keeping with the warrior spirit which has served them so well all . season, and led superbly by Steve Borthwick in his 265th and final . Premiership appearance, Saracens refused to accept they were out of the . match at 14-9 down with seven minutes to play and continued to press . until Marcelo Bosch squeezed over in the corner to level proceedings. Fly-half . Charlie Hodgson — another player fortunate to still be on the pitch . after being knocked into next week, seconds after replacing Farrell, by a . thunderous hit from Courtney Lawes — hit the right-hand upright from . the tightest of angles and match entered its extra time drama. Up for grabs: Saracens and Northampton were competing for the Aviva Premiership trophy on Saturday . Breaking through: Luther Burrell (second left) holds off Owen Farrell (left) and Marcelo Bosch (second right) Passionate following: Northampton supporters were out in full force for their team at Twickenham . There are so many ‘what ifs?’ for Saracens. What . if Billy Vunipola, so desperate to win he was almost combusting, had . not been penalised for crossing seven minutes into added time, leading . to Jackson Wray’s effort being disallowed? What if TMO Hughes had spotted Burrell’s earlier forward pass in the lead up to Pisi’s second-half try? What if Hodgson had kicked that conversion? But . in the end this group of arch pragmatists, coached expertly by . Ulsterman Mark McCall, will know there are no prizes for second place. ‘It . was a strange game and a strange finish,’ said Myler. ‘We probably . didn’t deserve to win because in a game like that it’s a shame either . side has to lose.’ The . debate on whether an entire season should be decided by one man watching . a television screen in a truck will rage on. But this was high drama, . no doubt.","Northampton Saints beat Saracens 24-20 to win the Aviva Premiership final at Twickenham .

"A nurse who successfully fought Maine's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients may be free to go wherever she pleases, but her boyfriend has been told to continue to stay away from the campus where he's a nursing student. Ted Wilbur insists that the University of Maine at Fort Kent (UMFK) asked him to stay away after his girlfriend, Kaci Hickox, hit the headlines amid attempts to quarantine her after she returned from treating Ebola patient in West Africa. The university contends he voluntarily agreed to stay away, and the voluntary agreement remains in effect. Scroll down for video . Ted Wilbur remains barred from returning to his studies at the University of Maine at Fort Kent despite his girlfriend Kaci Hickox being declared 'not contagious' by state officials on Friday . Ray Phinney, associate dean of student life and development at UMFK, said on Monday that the university is willing to revisit the agreement. ‘I am not concerned he is a threat to anyone’s health,’ Phinney told The Bangor Daily News. ‘My only concern is how the other students would react to him being here.’ However some of Wilbur’s classmates have expressed concerns about him returning to class sooner than November 10, when the 21-day Ebola incubation period expires for Hickox, admitted the dean. 'Ted is aware there are some real concerns,' Phinney said. 'Most [students] are concerned about the ""what ifs,"" like, ""What if Kaci begins to show symptoms?""' Hickox, who contends that she poses no real danger because she's not showing symptoms, fought attempts to quarantine her after returning from Sierra Leone last month. A Maine judge sided with her on Friday, rejecting the state's attempt to restrict her movement. The big 'What if?' Some of Wilbur’s classmates have expressed concerns about him returning to class sooner than November 10, when the 21-day Ebola incubation period expires for his girlfriend . The judge signed a final order on Monday. Even with the order, Hickox has said that she plans to stay away from public places out of respect for local residents. She and Wilbur live together in Fort Kent in an off-campus home. Steve Hyman, one of Hickox's lawyers, said there's no reason for Wilbur to be prevented from setting foot on campus. He said attorneys plan to talk to Wilbur to see what he wants to do between now and November 10, when the incubation period ends. While Hickox completes her monitoring period, Wilbur has been participating in his UMFK accelerated nursing program via online classes. He admitted to the media last week that taking his classes online was not ideal and prevented him from taking exams or participating in on-campus assignments. ‘No matter what, the safety of our students is our number one concern and that extends to Ted,’ said Phinney.

"A Victorian man has made a full-admission to the shooting deaths of three of his neighbours, telling 000 operators 'I just killed three people', a court heard. Ian Francis Jamieson, 63, has been charged with three counts of murder on Thursday night, after the shooting deaths of three members of the same family in a small Victorian town. Peter Lockhart, 78, his wife Mary Lockhart, 75, and Mrs Lockhart's son, 48-year-old Greg Holmes, were killed in the incident on Wednesday night. A barefoot Jamieson faced an out-of-sessions hearing at Bendigo police station at about 10pm and was remanded in custody. Detective Sen-Constable Jason Wallace told the court that during police interviews Jamieson made 'full admissions' to the three murders, according to Herald Sun. The court heard that when Jamieson called 000 on Wednesday night, he 'said he had killed three people'. Scroll down for video . One of the properties in rural Victoria where three family members were shot dead on Wednesday night . It was also confirmed that victim Greg Holmes had tried to reach help, calling police at 8.20pm on Wednesday night to report the argument with Jamieson, according to Herald Sun. Two officers arrived at the Mulga Ridge Road property and were told by nearby campers that someone had been heard calling out for help. Det-Sen-Constable Wallace told the court that the officers were unable to find Mr Holmes but his ringing phone led them to his body in a paddock. After locating Mr Holmes' body, the officers heard gunshots from an adjoining property across the road. Given the circumstances, the officers retreated from the scene to call for back up, Superintendent Graham Kent explained. A four hour siege ensued, with police able to communite with Jamieson on the phone, before he peacefully surrendered himself. A second body was found in a driveway and the third at the rear entrance to a home. The individuals were neighbours in the rural town, a small settlement called Logan, 2km from Wedderburn, in north west Victoria. Police and neighbours allege an ongoing but minor dispute about farming practices is the possible reason behind the murders. Detective Superintendent Peter De Santo said the disagreement between the neighbours had escalated out of the blue. 'There is some history of minor disputes in the past and when I say minor, at the very bottom end of disputes between neighbours,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'It's just very hard to fathom how this has all unfolded.' Local Geoff Maxwell was aware of the fight, but told AAP, 'nobody ever dreamt it would be so serious'. Three family members have died after they were allegedly shot at Wedderburn near Bendigo . Officers were called to a rural property at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots . Police said the firearms involved in the incident were registered and had recently been inspected. There was no history of violence, major disputes or ongoing assaults between the neighbours, he said. Loddon Shire mayor Gavan Holt said he understood the dispute was about farming. 'My information is that some time ago, a couple of years ago, they had a minor dispute - not a major issue and not a family matter – but a small disagreement over farming practices,' Mr Holt told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm being told that this was a long-running neighbourhood dispute over matters occurring on land which has escalated far beyond where it should have gone,' he said. He said the victims were very well know in the 1000-person town, with Mr Lockhart part of a five-generation farming family in the district. The incident took place in a small town more than 200km north-west of Melbourne . Mr Lockhart, a retired cereals and sheep farmer, lived on the property with his wife who was also killed. Mr Holmes, his stepson, lived on a house on an adjoining property. Mr Holt said the Lockharts and the man in custody all have other children with families  who live in Wedderburn, he added. Mr Holt said the community would support each other through the tragedy. 'All we can do is say we are there for you,' he said. 'There's lives wrecked here and it's our job to just be there for them in any way we can.' A local resident confirmed that 'Peter and Mary have been in town their whole lives.' Logan resident Rosie Camilleri said it was a big shock. 'It's a pretty quiet town here. Everyone gets along pretty well. It must've been something that was brewing for a while.' Jamieson will appear in Bendigo Magistrates Court on Friday.","Ian Francis Jamieson, 63, charged with three counts of murder .

"Stephen Fry, who is one of Britain's most followed Twitter users, has quit the social networking site . Stephen Fry,  who is one of Britain's most followed Twitter users, has  quit the social networking site over safety fears. In a cryptic final tweet to his 7.8million followers, the actor and TV presenter said he would be leaving Twitter until December - but did not reveal why. He said that he is filming 'in a place whence I've been advised it is safest not to tweet'. Fry's tweet, published earlier today, prompted speculation from some fans that he is filming for Star Wars Episode VII, which is scheduled for release on December 18. Another speculated: 'You're either filming in Parliament or a football club dressing room then. Good luck, see you in December'. In the tweet, Fry said: 'Closing down on Twitter while filming. 'In a place whence I've been advised it is safest not to tweet. See you December. Here goes...' He also updated his Twitter bio to say: 'Away November: sadly not taking new tweet requests all month.' Fry, 57, who presents the quiz show QI, has built a huge following on Twitter since he joined in September 2008. He is considered part of the Twitterati and is often named in lists of the most influential people on the site. But it's not the first time Fry has taken a hiatus from the website. In 2009, Fry famously threatened to leave Twitter for good because he felt there was 'too much aggression and unkindness around'. He also took temporary respite from the site for just a few hours following the publication of revelations in his memoir, More Fool Me, in September. Some of the revelations which hit the headlines included the admission he had taken cocaine while in several highly-respected institutions, including in Buckingham Palace and the House of Lords. Talking about his 15-year addiction, he wrote: ‘I take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly, to the owners, managers or representatives of the noble and ignoble premises and to the hundreds of private homes, offices, car dashboards, tables, mantelpieces and available polished surfaces that could so easily have been added to this list of shame. Fry's tweet, published earlier today, prompted speculation from some fans that he is filming for Star Wars Episode VII, which is scheduled for release on December 18 . ‘You may wish to have me struck off, banned, black balled or in any other way punished for past crimes; surely now is the time to reach for the phone, the police or the club secretary.’ Fry is famously outspoken and uses his Twitter profile to express some of his views. He faced a furious backlash in July after attacking the country’s most high-profile police inquiry into historic sex abuse, Operation Yewtree, while hosting a Labour fundraiser. He urged guests, who included Labour leader Ed Miliband, to remember that ‘people are innocent until proven guilty’ and singled out former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for criticism. Last year he offended Russia by claiming the 2014 Winter Olympics should be moved from Sochi because President Putin ‘is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews’ before the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In 2010, he offended feminists and many women by saying they don’t like sex. And the year before that he defended the MPs’ expenses scandal saying it was ‘not important’.","The actor is one of Britain's most followed Twitter users, with 7.8m followers .

"Maureen Robb, 58, from Arbroath, suffered excruciating headaches . Maureen Robb's headaches were so excruciating that they left her face partly paralysed and she could barely talk. During particularly bad attacks, her eyelids drooped and her jaw dropped. 'I've suffered from headaches all my life,' says Maureen, 58, a retired supermarket cashier from Arbroath in Scotland. 'Even as a baby my mum told me I used to cradle my head and cry uncontrollably. As soon as I was old enough, about three years old, I was able to tell her I had headaches on the left side of my head. She took me to scores of doctors but they didn't know what was causing the pain.' For years Maureen depended on strong painkillers, which she 'popped like Smarties', taking up to six a day despite her concerns about any long-term damage. 'I could never accept invites to social events because I wouldn't know how I'd be feeling. I'd usually hide in bed when my headache was really bad,' recalls the grandmother-of-three. But for the past two years Maureen hasn't needed headache pills - instead she's kept the pain at bay with a device that delivers a mild electric current into her neck. The portable hand-held device, called gammaCore, sends small electric pulses into the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart, lungs and digestive system. These messages activate chemical neurotransmitters in the brain. There are different kinds of messengers and one theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and as a result, sensations that are not normally painful are misinterpreted by the brain, causing headaches. The gammaCore is thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters. It has been developed to relieve migraines as well as cluster headaches (brief but extremely painful and debilitating headaches that can recur up to several times a day, for weeks or months). Maureen was prescribed the gammaCore by her specialist, Professor Peter Goadsby, a neurologist, and Dr Juana Marin, a headache specialist, both at King's College Hospital, London. gammaCore sends small electric pulses into the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen . Professor Goadsby's been leading research into the safety and efficacy of the device for different types of headaches since 2012 - in a year-long pilot clinical trial, 15 out of 19 cluster headache patients reported an overall improvement in pain levels and frequency of attacks of more than 50 per cent after regularly using gammaCore. The findings were presented at the International Headache Congress in Boston in September and larger studies are under way. Maureen was initially referred to Professor Goadsby in 2004. Before seeing him, she'd been given many different tablets for her headaches, including medicines used for depression (some, such as lithium, can sometimes control pain), as well as epilepsy drugs (which can suppress the over-activity in the brain involved in headaches). But these only dulled her pain and wore off after a few hours. She'd also been prescribed injections of morphine, and anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids and diclofenac, which are used as painkillers for certain conditions including migraines. 'I feared one day my organs would just pack up, I was having so much heavy-duty medication,' says Maureen. 'Doctors told me to try to cut down the amount because of the long-term side-effects steroids can cause, such as osteoporosis.' When she first saw Professor Goadsby he ran tests that showed that she was suffering from hemicrania continua, a rare type of headache that causes constant pain. He prescribed indomethacin, a drug known to help with these headaches. But while her headaches lifted, after a few weeks she had to stop taking the pills due to severe side-effects, including a stomach ulcer. Maureen then had an electronic device surgically implanted into her neck that delivered electrical stimulation to the brain through the occipital nerve, which runs from the base of the skull to the spine, and conducts pain. The device worked for two years until the batteries ran out (they weren't replaced as she was testing it as part of a clinical trial) - sending Maureen into despair once more. Then in 2012 Professor Goadsby prescribed the gammaCore. The technology was originally developed to treat conditions such as epilepsy, but then patients reported it also eased their headaches. 'It isn't a cure but gammaCore works miracles,' says Maureen . To use the device, a conductive gel is applied to the surfaces of the device and it is placed on the neck. The treatment, which takes about two minutes, produces a tingling or pricking feeling. Potential side-effects, although rare, include hoarseness, shortness of breath, or a change in voice while the treatment is being given (because of the effect on the vagus nerve). However, these are usually temporary and stop when two minutes are up. Maureen says the treatment made a significant difference within three months, reducing the severity and frequency of her headaches. She now uses gammaCore as a preventative measure three times a day. 'I still have a constant low-level headache, but it is nothing compared with the hell I used to experience,' she says, adding that she has not needed medication for two years. 'GammaCore has transformed my life. In the past my headaches were so bad I'd rather give birth three times than suffer from one. It isn't a cure but gammaCore works miracles. I now love entertaining my three grandchildren, which I couldn't do before.' The gammaCore is not suitable for patients with a pacemaker or hearing aid implant, as it emits a mild electrical current. It should also not be used by people who are diagnosed with narrowing of the arteries in the neck (carotid atherosclerosis) or those who have had surgery to cut the vagus nerve in their neck. The device has been licensed for treatment of migraines and cluster headaches, and while the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is considering approving funding, it is only available on the NHS for patients with exceptional circumstances. GammaCore is available privately, but at about £300 a month, it is not cheap (the device needs to be replaced monthly when the batteries run out though the manufacturer is working on a rechargeable device). Dr Mark Weatherall, a consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, London, said: 'For many patients, non-invasive neurostimulation offers an exciting and acceptable alternative to standard painkillers. Early results of trials with the gammaCore are promising, and further studies are eagerly awaited.' Patients interested in using the device can email Dr Juana Marin, a headache specialist at King's College Hospital, London, at h.marin@nhs.net.","Maureen Robb, 58, from Arbroath, suffered excruciating headaches .

"A dog walker was left covered in blood and needing emergency surgery after she was viciously attacked by two Staffordshire bull terriers. Tracy Hills, 47, was rushed to hospital after being mauled as she tried to protect her puppy in a park in Laindon, Essex on Wednesday. Passers-by tried to help the stricken mother, but were snarled at by the two dogs, who were only tracked down after a police helicopter was scrambled to the scene. Tracy Hills was left with injuries to her arms, legs, stomach and face after she was attacked by two Staffordshire bull terriers while trying to protect her pet beagle . Ms Hills was last night preparing to have surgery on tendons on her arms and skin grafts after she was left with injuries to her face, stomach, arms and legs. Meanwhile Finn, her one-year-old beagle, is recovering at home after also undergoing emergency surgery at a local vets. Ms Hills's daughter, Jade, 22, said: 'It was horrific.

"For a man who is said to despise the US President, North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un appears to be showing a touch of hypocrisy as he steps onto a red carpet from his own version of 'Air Force One'. A photo, published in the official North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun, shows for the first time the luxury Russian IL-62 jetliner that carries Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju on official engagements around the secretive country. At first glance, the aircraft bears some similarity to the US President's personal jet, bearing as it does North Korea's official name and flag and a star symbolising Kim on its tail, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported today, quoting the North's paper. Scroll down for video . North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un and his wife Ri SOl Ju flew into the operational airfield in the west of the secretive country using his luxury private jet . Dictator Kim Jong-un appears to have followed in the footsteps of US President Barack Obama who uses Air Force One to travel between engagements . On the Tarmac: Kim Jong-Un's plane is greeted by officers from the North Korean military as he arrives for the 2014 combat flight contest. The Russian plane has been converted to a private jet for the use of the dictator. The American President's jet is a a prominent symbol of the presidency and its power - and it now appears that Kim has decided not to be out-done, ensuring the North's flag and his own seal mirrors the livery of Air Force One. An official photo shows Kim and his wife walking along a red carpet from the aircraft past a guard of honour with a goose-stepping officer just behind them. They were arriving for the 2014 combat flight competition at a military facility in the country when the pictures were taken. Kim is giving the military men a salute as his wife walks slightly behind him, dressed in a green suit after their arrival at an undisclosed air base. On an earlier occasion two months ago Kim was seen alighting from a jet at Samjyon Airport, but on that occasion it was operated by the official government airline, Air Koryo. At first glance, Kim Jong-un's personal aircraft bears a close resemblance to the US President's personal jet, Air Force One . The American President's jet is described as being a prominent symbol of the presidency and its power, and it now appears that Kim Jong-un has decided not to be out-done . The South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train. In fact he has even tried his hand at the controls, it was claimed, although he is not known to have an qualifications as a pilot. 'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul. Kim's wife is presumed to support his preference for flying around North Korea, rather than travelling by road or train - Ri's father is said to have been a pilot. Meanwhile, . Chosun Ilbo reported, it emerged from that air base visit that Kim and . Ri were accompanied by Hwang Pyong-so, the new military politburo chief, . and Choe Ryong-hae, Hwang's predecsssor, who was in civilian clothes.

"A unique home that looks like it would be the perfect place for Bilbo Baggins to live in has gone on the market for a whopping $1.2 million. The mushroom shaped house could be the Lord of the Rings' character’s humble Hobbit hole, but it probably costs a lot more. The four bedroom property is located in Bethesda, Maryland and judging from its bizarre exterior would not look out of place in Middle Earth. Scroll down for video . Fit for a hobbit: This bizarre home looks fit for  Hobbit Bilbo Baggins and has gone on the market for $1.2 million in Maryland . Living room: The owners of the hobbit house, Edward and Frances Garfinkle, bought the property in 1967,  and added quirky touches to it . Exterior: the overall design was crafted by an architect who built the current home around the existing one back in the early 1970s . The 3,600-square-foot home was initially built in 1923. It has 2 full baths and one half bath and boasts 30-foot tall ceilings, an indoor fish pond, exposed wood beams, cave-like nooks, recycled barn-wood floors and skylights galore. The owners of the hobbit house, Edward and Frances Garfinkle, bought the property in 1967 and turned it into the quirky home it is today, adding high ceilings, exposed wood beams and skylights. It was crafted by an architect who built the current home around the existing one back in the early 1970s and included the couple's ideas in the design. Garfinkle said he worked with an architect that was into futuristic design at the time and used a spray-on material, polyurethane, that is also eco-friendly. The owner, an artist, told local news outlet WUSA9: 'At the time we were looking for something different. We did not want to be in a box.' But the project nearly left the ambitious couple bankrupt because it cost them $100,000 to $150,000 to create it. 'We were kind of misled into thinking it was an inexpensive way to build. It didn’t turn out that way. ... We did this when we were young. Looking back on it, it was probably kind of dumb,' Garfinkle told Bethesda Magazine. Mod cons: The house has a host of beautiful rooms including this one which has a sink and dish washer in it . Bedroom: This simple bedroom is just one of four which are located in the property in Bethesda, Maryland . Bathroom: The home features this pretty bathroom which has a shower and two double sinks in it . Interior: The house boasts 30-foot tall ceilings,  exposed wood beams, cave-like nooks, recycled barn-wood floors and skylights galore. 'A lot of people have wanted to see the interior. ... [Someone] would knock on the door, and they'd say, 'Can I come in?' And we'd say, 'No.' And they'd say, 'Why?' And we'd say, 'It's our home, we live here.' ... But, you know, it's been fun.' The family describe the entire home as their personal work of art. And now that their children have grown up and have moved out Garfinkle said that it's too much space for him and his wife, which is why they decided to sell. Local residents nicknamed it 'the mushroom house' but Garfinkle said that they have always thought of it as a giant circus tent. Stairway: The stairway features several pictures along it which lead up to the bedrooms and bathrooms . Quaint: This bedroom has two wardrobes in it and is a nice addition to the house which has been nicknamed the 'mushroom house' Art: This stunning house has gorgeous art work throughout, even in the living room and is described as the family's personal art work . Kitchen: It features a spacious kitchen with pots and pans hanging from the ceiling which opens out into the dining room and sitting room . Open plan: Edward and Frances Garfinkle were 'looking for something different when they bought it and did not want to be in a box' View: The house will offer its new owners incredible views but the project nearly left the current owners bankrupt . It is being listed by real estate company Long and Foster for $1.2 million and is described as 'lending itself to the creative eye.' Garfinkle said he hopes that its new owners will get to make it into their own home inside, but still keep some of its original design. 'Basically it would be nice if the design was retained and just went on being Bethesda's mushroom house,' he said. But the proud owners have decided not to do an open house to prevent crowds of people coming just to get a peek inside. Bathroom: This bathroom is decorated in blue and carries through the theme of fun, quirky art which can be seen throughout the house . Studio: The owner describes himself as an artist and said he worked with an architect that was into futuristic design . Old and the new: The couple have beautiful exposed beams in their house and curved walls alongside more modern necesities . Design: Local residents nicknamed the house the 'mushroom house' and Garfinkle said they always thought of it as a giant circus tent . Welcome home: The house  is a 3,700 sq. ft. structure that sits on the 4900 block of Allan Rd in Bethesda . The Hobbit: Actor Martin Freeman plays Bilbo in the highly successful Lord of the Rings films based on the J.R.R. Tolkien novels .

"A New South Wales man has been sentenced to eight years in jail after he drove while drug affected  and caused a car crash that killed a pregnant woman's baby and left her unable to conceive again. In court on Wednesday Judge Paul Conlon set a non-parole period of six years for Marco Paulo Silvestri, who crashed head-on into another vehicle as he tried to overtake a car on the Princes Highway at Dapto in Wollongong, NSW on September 30 last year. In sentencing Silvestri on three counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, Judge Conlon said the effect on Jacqueline Sparks had been 'truly devastating'. Jacqueline Sparks lost her unborn baby and her ability to have children in a horrific car accident . Ms Sparks, 27, lost her daughter Mia and her ability to ever have a family naturally in the crash. Her two brothers who were travelling in the car with her were also injured. Ms Sparks was looking forward to becoming a mother for the first time but now she is a 27-year-old going through menopause and feeling ashamed that she can never give her husband the large family they both desperately wanted. 'What makes it worse is I have this guilt that I'm holding [my husband] back from having a family, because he'd make such a wonderful dad, but it's not my fault,' Ms Sparks told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Sparks was air-lifted to Liverpool Hospital following the incident where doctors discovered the extent of her injuries: head trauma, broken ribs, fractured ulna, lacerations to the bone, punctured lungs, lost vision and the 'loss of her 32 week foetus'. The car crash was so severe her womb catastrophically ruptured upon impact and had to be removed. In a hearing in the district court in Sutherland last month, a victim impact statement read out on behalf of Ms Sparks described the pain she felt when she realised she had lost her daughter Mia. She was injured when drug-affected driver Marco Paulo Silvestri crashed into the car she was travelling in Wollongong, NSW last year . Ms Sparks' brother Tim McNamara (left) was driving the car at the time of the accident . 'I do not remember understanding nor being told what had happened but I do remember a single tear falling from my face onto the perfect little nose of my lifeless daughter in my arms,' she wrote. 'I have lost my daughter, my womanhood and my chance to ever become a mother naturally.' Ms Sparks, from Farmborough Heights in southwest Wollongong, feels angry at Silvestri for taking those things away. 'As remorseful as he did seem yesterday, everyone's remorseful after the act,' she said. 'If you get caught doing something you feel sorry. 'How many times before that had he driven on drugs?' Ms Sparks also feels upset that he was charged with dangerous driving and not manslaughter. 'It's frustrating with driving charges, it's seen as an accident it's not seen as a crime, but the car's a weapon as well,' she said. Ms Sparks hopes to see a bill known as Zoe's Law passed through NSW Parliament, which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more. The bill is named after Brodie Donegan's unborn daughter Zoe, who died at 32 weeks when she was hit by a drug-affected driver in 2009. Ms Sparks said her husband Chi Nguyen was devastated by the accident as the couple were looking forward to raising a large family together . But due to the accident Ms Sparks can no longer naturally give birth to children, and is already going through menopause at just 27 . In November 2013 the bill passed through the NSW Legislative Assembly 63 votes to 23, but it has yet to be introduced to the NSW Upper House. The controversial bill has faced strong opposition over concerns about the implications it would have for women seeking abortions. Ms Sparks just hopes to prevent other women from suffering in the way that she has. 'I know [Silvestri] won't be charged for manslaughter now but if it does happen again I think it's an important thing to realise it was a child,' she said. 'I just think a baby should be recognised as a baby and that person should be charged with something more.' Ms Sparks said the crash has devastated her husband Chi Nguyen. 'We both come from a big family - I come from four and he's from ten – and we both want a big family,' she said. 'If we do have to go into commercial surrogacy we're going to need literally $1 million to have four children.' And even if they choose to pursue surrogacy, they will face a number of obstacles including finding a surrogate and confirming that Ms Sparks can still produce eggs. The 27-year-old hopes to see a bill known as Zoe's Law passed through NSW Parliament, which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more . The crash had a major impact on Ms Sparks' family, pictured here are her brother Tim (left) who was driving the car, sister Jo, brother Jonathan who was a passenger, and her mum (right) 'I'm 27 and I'm going through menopause, it's ridiculous,' she said. 'Plus all these issues around Thailand surrogacy, surrogacy in NSW is illegal and for us to even have that option we'd have to consider overseas.' Ms Sparks said the crash has also affected her social life, especially at an age where many friends are getting married and having children. 'People don't really know how to be around you, they wonder if they should give their baby to you to hold or is that insensitive,' she said. 'Some of my best friends have recently had babies and I avoid it, I feel like I'm putting an awkwardness on them.' Her brothers Jonathan Sparks, 25, and Tim McNamara, 29, have also been severely affected by the crash. Mr Sparks' spine was crushed and he will never again be able to bend over or lift more than 15kg, which has had a major impact on his career as a chef. Ms Sparks also revealed the impact the loss of her only daughter had on her own life, and the difficultly she faces while her friends are all having children of their own . Mr McNamara feels guilty as he was the one driving the car. 'I know he's really depressed, he hasn't found work,' Ms Sparks said. 'Being the driver you have guilt like you could have swerved differently or braked sooner, even though it's not his fault at all.' On September 30, exactly one year after the crash, Ms Sparks and Mr Nguyen bought Mia a birthday cake and reflected on what life would have been like if she was there with them. In court last month, defence lawyer Bill Whitby read out apology to Ms Sparks and her brothers on behalf of Silvestri. But Ms Sparks finds the apology difficult to accept. 'Your actions have completely changed my life. I feel like a different person - mentally and physically. My happiness, my career, my self-esteem, my social interaction, my sleep, my energy, my laughter and above all, our daughter, is now gone,' she wrote in her victim impact statement. 'You chose to take drugs and you chose to drive dangerously. This is our life now and you gave us no choice.'","Jacqueline Sparks lost her unborn daughter and her ability to fall pregnant .

"Sting and wife Trudie Styler say they are looking forward to making Battersea Power Station their new London home and have bought an apartment . It has been billed as the way to transform and preserve one of London's best-loved landmarks by creating housing for thousands of people and panoramic views across the capital. And now Battersea Power Station has proved its new apartments are in fact fit for a rock star. Sting and wife Trudie Styler have confirmed they will be among the future tenants living among the redeveloped towers. The couple have bought an apartment at the iconic landmark as their new London base, adding to their extensive global property portfolio. It has not been confirmed if the apartment will be in or next to the actual power station. But with Sting's impressive fortune the couple are likely to have purchased one of the apartments at the higher end of the scale, where prices peak at £3million for a four bedroom house. Their new home could even be a penthouse for which prices have not been released, but are are available on request. Experts have predicted they could cost as much as £30million. The couple have already bought multi-million properties in Malibu, New York, Tuscany, north London and Wiltshire. They also put one of their London homes, on the Mall, on sale for £15 million earlier this year. Styler said: 'The exciting development plans for the whole site are a great solution for the regeneration of an iconic London landmark which has been in decay for the last 30 years. 'We are both very pleased to be part of this new community and really look forward to making our London home at the Battersea Power Station.' Scroll down for video . The couple announced they had purchased the apartment as Sting performed to 300 people in New York at an event to publicise the development. Rob Tincknell, CEO of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: 'I am thrilled that Trudie and Sting have chosen Battersea Power Station as their London home and really hope they enjoy being part of this exciting development.'

"France's Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls recently renewed his calls for Roma communities to be deported because ‘they cannot integrate’ One person was shot dead and at least 12 seriously wounded after a fight broke out between Roma gypsies on an illegal camp site in France. The bloodbath took place on the outskirts of Toulouse, in the south west of the country, on Friday afternoon following a row about stealing electricity. It comes after the country’s Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls renewed his calls for Roma communities to be deported because ‘they cannot integrate’. Major cities including Paris are full of gangs of the migrants who carry out all kinds of crimes, from robbery to muggings, often in broad daylight. Commenting on the latest outbreak of violence, a Toulouse police spokesman said: ‘One family wanted control of a power supply illegally linked to the camp. ‘When another objected there was a mass brawl, with guns, knives and metal bars used. Two men were rushed to hospital, with one dying from gunshot wounds. The other is seriously hurt. ‘Others involved are suffering from serious injuries including knife wounds and ones caused by blows from iron bars. There have been around twelve arrests.’ Toulouse mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has regularly called for the camp at Montaudran, on the south east outskirts of the city ‘to be shut down as soon as possible’. He said that many of those living there were behind crime sprees all over the city, with young children among those sent out to steal. It was first raided a year ago, with police making a number of arrests and confiscating stolen train cables and copper. Mr Valls said this year that he stands by remarks calling for the country’s Roma communities to be expelled. He said few could ever integrate into French society and ‘the majority’ should be ‘sent back to the borders’. Mr Valls has been criticised by human rights campaigners, the European Commission and and left-wing cabinet colleagues. Amnesty International has called for a ban on forced evictions which saw more than 10,000 Roma evicted from temporary camps in the first half of this year. It has said Mr Valls’ remarks were likely to ‘perpetuate stereotypes and encourage animosity’ among the approximately 20,000 Roma who have settled in France, mainly from Romania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia.

Amnesty International has called for a ban on forced evictions which saw more than 10,000 Roma evicted from temporary camps in the first half of this year (above, Roma community is evicted from camp in Lille) But Mr Valls said he saw no reason to correct comments that Roma lifestyles were ‘clearly in confrontation’ with French ways of life. ‘I’ve got nothing to correct,’ he said. ‘My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject. ‘The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people’, adding: ‘It’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world.’ Mr Valls recently said 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people’","Bloodbath took place on outskirts of Toulouse in south west of the country .

"Sri Lanka felt the full force of Alex Hales bat again but it was not quite enough for England to gain victory over the World Twenty20 champions at the Kia Oval because of the enduring unorthodox brilliance of Lasith Malinga. It was an unbeaten 116 from Hales that enabled England to become the only team to defeat Sri Lanka in that world tournament in Bangladesh in March. He appeared poised to do the same in the first big match of the Peter Moores era. Hales smashed 66 off 41 balls to lift England within reach of their formidable target of 184. But  Malinga, still the best ‘death bowler’ in the world, deceived him with a perfect slower ball to  earn Sri Lanka the spoils. Vital: Lasith Malinga and his Sri Lanka team-mates celebrate taking the wicket of England's Alex Hales . Big hitter: Alex Hales was in fine form against Sri Lanka at The Kia Oval . Even then, England came close to pulling off what would have been a significant win in their first Twenty20 international since defeat by Holland in Chittagong. But an unbeaten 28 off 15 balls from Ravi Bopara — again  batting too low in the order at seven — came just too late to avert a nine-run defeat. It may have been the genius of Malinga, now the Sri Lankan Twenty20 captain, that gave his side the perfect start to their tour but England were left to rue a miserable error in the field which ultimately cost them dear. Michael Carberry seemed to talk his way out of an international future when he blasted England for his treatment in  Australia. He may wish they had taken offence rather than offered him another chance here, after this pivotal mishap. England, with an inexperienced attack in the absence of Stuart Broad, still managed to keep the gifted Sri Lankan hitters in check for the bulk of their innings. Yet, once Carberry shelled a dolly of a chance to reprieve Thisara Perera off his fellow  debutant Harry Gurney, Sri Lanka managed to cut loose and hit 75 off their last six overs. Gurney, whose elevation this year has owed something to  injuries to fellow left-armers Reece Topley and David Willey, did little to impress on his one-day debut against Scotland in Aberdeen. Here he displayed intelligent variety in the face of threatening Sri Lankan hitting. Disappointing: But England were defeated by Sri Lanka in the opening Twenty20 international . Dominant: Lasith Malinga celebrates taking the wicked of Ian Bell in the second innings . Gurney claimed a notable first scalp in international cricket when he bowled Tillakaratne Dilshan. He added another in Lahiru Thirimanne before that blunder which cost him a third wicket and, more importantly, cost England the match. England had already put down two difficult catches — Chris  Jordan and James Tredwell offering lives to Thirimanne — and seen Jos Buttler miss a difficult stumping before Perera hit  Gurney straight up into the air. It should have been a simple catch for any one of Gurney, Eoin Morgan or Carberry. Sadly for England, it was the Hampshire man who took responsibility and duly let a regulation chance slip out of his grasp. ‘I was going for it initially and shouted for it,’ said Morgan. ‘But as I got closer Carbs was shouting his name so I stood as close to him as possible in  case there was a rebound. People drop catches but it was costly.’  Carberry has proved fallible in the field during his short international career and this miss was particularly painful. Perera, on 20 at the time, took full toll of the England bowling —smashing Jordan for 22 off the 19th over and powering Sri Lanka to 183 for seven with 49 off 20 balls. The depth in the Sri Lankan batting, even without Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar  Sangakkara, was demonstrated by the fact that five different players hit sixes. Perera smashed two of the six maximums that featured in the world champions’ innings before he was run out off the final ball. The . night was not to get any better for Carberry after he got the nod to . open alongside Hales. He fell for seven as England began their attempt . to stop Sri Lanka registering their ninth victory in 10 Twenty20 . internationals in this country. Bad start: Michael Carberry struggled at the top of the order once again for England . Eye on the ball: Sri Lanka's Lahiru Thirimanne struck a valuable 40 for the visitors . When Ian Bell, Joe Root and then Morgan — standing in for Broad here and expected  to become full-time Twenty20  captain later this year — soon  followed, England had a  mountain to climb. They came close to reaching the summit but Malinga had too much nous and England can only hope to fare better here tomorrow in the first of five one-day internationals. The fact they will attempt to do so without Hales, whose technique is still considered too loose for the 50-over game, might be something England care to look at again. Comfortable: The visitors celebrate securing their nine-run victory with a new-look side . Leader: Stand-in England skipper Eoin Morgan directs play from the field .","Sri Lanka win one-off T20 against England by nine runs at the Kia Oval .

"Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has sparked fury after comparing the Chancellor George Osborne to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. Lord Kinnock, who led the Labour party to two general election defeats in 1987 and 1992, said the public had gullibly accepted Mr Osborne’s ‘lie’ that Gordon Brown was to blame for the recession. He said this ‘big lie’ was the reason why Labour was still seen by the public as ‘the incompetent party’. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock compared the Chancellor George Osborne to Nazi minister Joseph Goebbels . The remarks, published by the Evening Standard today, were made at a Labour party fundraising event. He said Labour had borrowed £319 billion over its 13 years in Government – but this was dwarfed by the Coalition which had added another £465 billion to the national debt. Lord Kinnock said: ‘Yet we have the reputation of being the incompetent party, the party not fit to govern, the party that can’t manage the economy.’ Lord Kinnock said Mr Osborne used the six months after the general election when Mr Miliband was fighting a leadership contest ‘to encamp that deep into the consciousness, the deferential consciousness, the believe-the-worst consciousness of the British people. ‘And it’s still “Labour’s fault”. Goebbels said if you tell a lie, tell a really, really, really, big one.’ Lord Kinnock said Labour had left office with a growing economy and the deficit going down. He said: ‘But of course what George [Osborne] told everybody ...was what he had inherited was a Britain that was in danger of becoming Greece in the North Sea.’ Joseph Goebbels was the Nazi 'Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda' during the Second World War . Chancellor George Osborne was in his usual position next to David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today . Furious Tory MPs today attacked the comparison with the infamous Nazi propaganda minister. Bob Neill, the Bromley & Chislehurst MP, said: ‘It is a very desperate comment and an unpleasant smear which shows that Labour have nothing positive to say on the economy.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘Lord Kinnock was making clear how ridiculous and hypocritical the Conservative attack on Labour continues to be.'","Lord Kinnock led Labour to two general election defeats in 1987 and 1992 .

"Fraudster: When Lynsey Mitchell (pictured) was confronted, she told her fiancé she had cancer . A woman swindled her 'vulnerable' fiancé and his brother out of £150,000 which she spent on  hotels, limousines and concerts - while pretending she had cancer. Lynsey Mitchell, 31, was jailed for four and a half years today after a judge told her she had 'utterly destroyed' the lives of Richard Fortune and his brother Derek. Richard had a heart attack after discovering Mitchell's con  and he remains gravely ill in hospital awaiting a transplant, a court heard. The fraudster, from Swindon, Wiltshire, left the pair penniless after she stole their bank cards, took out payday loans against their family home and emptied their savings account. Richard  and Derek, who lived in their parents' former house, were so 'technophobic' that she was able to drain their accounts for three years without them finding out. Mitchell stole £41,000 from her fiancé and another £108,000 from his brother, Swindon Crown Court heard. She drained the majority of the money from Derek Fortune by making transfers into her own account between 2009 and 2012. Mitchell had also been taking out payday loans and catalogue cards in the name of her fiancé Richard, including a 256-month loan for £11,995 secured against his home. The scam was only uncovered in May 2013, when Derek Fortune made enquiries with his bank after becoming suspicious. He was told his current account balance had plummeted from £90,000 to being £2,495 overdrawn - while his savings account had a balance of just eight pence. When the pair began questioning her activity, Mitchell fled the country claiming she had to care for her terminally ill father in the Czech Republic. But she had already drained £149,000 from the brothers, which she splurged on luxury hotel rooms, limousines and taking friends to concerts. She justified her extravagant spending by telling the pair she had a series of serious illnesses, including cancer and liver disease, the court heard. Claire Marlow, prosecuting, said Mitchell had deliberately preyed on the vulnerable technophobes. 'Derek and Richard Fortune live together in what was their parents' house,' she said. 'They have a frugal lifestyle, and are unsophisticated in the ways of the world. Technophobic: Mitchell drained cash from her fiancé's brother for almost three years before she was shopped . 'They have not embraced the technological age and until they met this lady were inexperienced in relationships. 'She would tell them she was suffering from life-threatening illnesses including liver disease and cancer and at times was receiving treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. 'Enquiries revealed the money was being used on limousines and staying in a number of hotels as well as taking friends to concerts and at one stage she was in contact with an estate agent about buying a house. 'The total loss to Derek Fortune is in the region of £108,000 while the loss to his brother makes up the remainder of the £149,000.' Richard Fortune has since suffered a heart attack caused by the stress and remains in hospital awaiting a transplant, the court heard. In a victim impact statement read in court, Derek said: 'This money I will never be able to replace and was the savings of my life's work. 'I am on the point of losing my job where I have worked for 20 years because I have had to take so much time off to visit my brother. 'I fear that if I lose him through ill health I will not have anything worth living for. This seems to be a living nightmare which just gets worse. There is nothing left. 'Despite what happens to her today these debts will stay with us, and I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel.' Mitchell pleaded guilty to 15 counts of fraud and one of theft. Judge Peter Blair QC told her: 'You have utterly destroyed the lives of two men, who were vulnerable through their lack of sophistication in the modern world. 'They have months and years of misery ahead of them and you have devastated them with these actions.'","Lynsey Mitchell, 31, conned 'technophobic' Richard and Derek Fortune .

"A teenage girl who jumped from a road bridge was saved by a man who managed to grab her arm and a probationer police constable who dangled alongside her until help came. PC Dewayne Hamilton was hailed a hero after he vaulted the railings on the bridge over the A40 in Hillingdon, west London, and put his arm around the girl to stop her falling. 'There was then a terrifying ordeal, lasting several minutes, with the officer and the girl dangling over the road while they waited for further help,' a police spokesman said. Saved: PC Dewayne Hamilton is brought down from the railway bridge on a cherry picker . They were only saved when London Fire Brigade crews brought in a cherry picker to reach them and bring first the girl, then PC Hamilton to safety. The drama happened at about 11am today. A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers had only just arrived when the girl, in her mid-teens, jumped from the bridge. A member of the public managed to grab her arm through the safety rail of the bridge and held on until PC Hamilton was able to climb over and grab her. As police halted traffic on the busy A40, the London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service attended and were able to get a harness around the girl to help secure her until the cherry picker arrived. Both paramedics and firefighters went up on the cherry picker to rescue the girl. When she had been lowered to the ground they went back up to bring down the officer. The girl was taken for treatment by ambulance. 'She did not suffer any serious physical injury during the rescue. Both she and her family are receiving support,' the spokesman said. Inspector Lindsey Hannigan, of Hillingdon Police, said: 'This was an incredibly courageous act. 'What makes this even more impressive is that this officer only arrived at Hillingdon Borough one week ago as a probationer constable. 'His action, which placed his own life in danger, was an extraordinary act of bravery.' PC Hamilton said: 'I am just so glad I was there and able to make a difference. I have a child about this girl's age and all I could think about was saving her. I am so very happy we were all able to rescue her from danger.'","PC Dewayne Hamilton dangled from bridge over the A40 to save teenager .

Alexander, of Plymouth, admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefit between August 2010 and November 2011. Claire Tresidder, for the Department for Work and Pensions, said Alexander declared that he was 'virtually unable to walk' in his application for benefits.

"The U.S. Army War College revoked Democratic Sen. John Walsh's master's degree after an investigation completed on Friday concluded he plagiarized a research paper required to graduate, a college spokeswoman said. The Carlisle, Pennsylvania, college assigned an academic review board to the probe in August after The New York Times published a story showing that the Montana senator borrowed heavily from other sources for a paper he wrote in 2007. Walsh was pursuing a Master of Strategic Studies degree at age 47, a year before he became Montana's adjutant general overseeing the state National Guard. In this Feb. 11, 2014, file photo, Sen. John Walsh, a Democrat who represents Montana, right, and his son Michael, left, in the U.S. Capitol Hill. The U.S. Army War College has revoked Walsh's master's degree after it confirmed that he plagiarized a paper in 2007 . The board took less than a day to hear the case and make its findings Aug. 22, but the process of appeal and review wasn't completed until today. 'The board found that then Colonel John Walsh did commit the offense of plagiarism and thus his Master's Degree and status as graduate of the U.S. Army War College should be revoked,' War College spokeswoman Carol Kerr said in a statement. The review board made its conclusions less than 20 minutes after closing its August hearing, according to the report released by Walsh's office. Possible extenuating circumstances submitted by Walsh of post-traumatic stress disorder and a fellow soldier's suicide were not enough to support any other recommendation. 'It should also be noted that other students ... have had similar or more serious personal and psychological issues during their year at USAWC, and they have been able to successfully complete course requirements without resorting to plagiarism or other cheating,' the review board's report said. Walsh's office released a statement saying the senator disagrees with the findings but accepts the college's decision. 'I apologize to all Montanans for the plagiarism in my 2007 paper, and I am prepared to live with its consequences,' Walsh said in the statement. 'I may not be a scholar, but I am proud to have been a soldier who has served Montana and this great nation for 33 years in uniform.' His spokeswoman said he was not available for further comment. Walsh was appointed to the Senate in February when Max Baucus resigned to become ambassador to China. Baucus' seat is one of 33 up for review this fall, and Walsh intended to formally compete to fill it. He dropped out of the Nov. 4 Senate race in August after the plagiarism charges, however. Montana Democrats chose state lawmaker Amanda Curtis to replace Walsh as their candidate. She's running against GOP Congressman Steve Daines. Republicans need a net gain of six seats in November to take Senate control, and Montana is a prime target to pick up a seat that's been in Democratic hands for more than a century. The Senate race was seen as a tough one for Democrats even with the incumbent Walsh in the running. Now Daines is expected to have a bigger advantage going against a newcomer who doesn't have his name recognition or $1.7 million campaign bank account.","Walsh came under scrutiny in August for plagiarism .

"A Florida man who recently wore a shirt that read 'f*** the police' to a court squabble with state troopers somehow managed to walk out a winner. Michael Burns of Broward County complained to the judge that he'd been unfairly targeted by officers who were angry that he'd been recording them on video as they broke up a roadside gathering.

Scroll down for video . Risk taker: Michael Burns (left) wore a shirt that read 'F*** the police' to a court hearing where he was fighting a charge by state troopers . Burns writes on LiveLeak.com that he routinely records police. He was doing just that while police were kicking some citizens off a Florida roadside. 'It was public property and I was told they were only being kicked out to ""ruin their fun,""' Burns wrote on LiveLeak. After there was nothing left to record, Burns drove off. Police then followed him, he says, with six police cars pulling behind him when he was stopped. Burns says an officer forced him to remove a Fraternal Order of Police sticker, which the cop claimed was obstructing the numbers of his license plate. 'I refused to answer any of his questioned [sic] and advised him I would see him in court to fight it when he told me I had to take it off,' writes Burns. The quality of audio in the court video footage makes it difficult to hear exactly what the judge rules, but Burns says he won. 'I went to court wearing a shirt that said ""F*** the Police,""' he writes. 'I somehow still manage to win.' Police claimed a sticker was blocking the numbers on Burns' license plate.

"New probe: Two police officers who had contact with paedophile Jimmy Savile are under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission . Two detectives from Surrey Police who looked into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile are under investigation, it was revealed today. The serving detective constable and retired detective inspector interviewed women who claimed they were abused as school pupils by the shamed DJ. Savile was alleged to have abused girls at Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey in the 1970s. Officials from the Independent Police Complaints Commission are leading inquiries into the conduct of the two officers. They want to know if the pair properly passed on information about Savile to other forces. The watchdog is already investigating how officers working for Sussex, North Yorkshire, Surrey and West Yorkshire forces dealt with claims about Savile's predatory sexual behaviour. An IPCC spokesman said : 'The IPCC's independent investigation is now into the conduct of two Surrey Police officers who were involved in the police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile at Duncroft School in the 1970s. 'In addition to a retired detective inspector, a detective constable is now also subject to the investigation. 'The conduct investigation includes whether information was passed to other forces in a timely way. 'The inclusion of the second officer in the investigation follows a direction from the IPCC to the force to refer their conduct.' Savile, who died aged 84 in October 2011, was questioned by Surrey Police in 2009 over the Duncroft School allegations, which he denied. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled shortly afterwards that there was 'insufficient evidence' to bring charges. Abuser: Savile attacked a number of girls at Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey in the 1970s . A year ago, Surrey Police revealed it had interviewed more than 100 former pupils from the school, which closed in the 1980s. A police spokesman said they were looking at the scale of Savile's abuse there and whether any staff knew about it. A decision may be taken soon on whether to charge former staff. Operation Yewtree was launched in 2012 after it emerged the late television presenter had abused hundreds of young people and children over more than five decades. A total of 214 sex offences have been recorded against Savile across Britain.","Officers interviewed women who said Savile abused them at Surrey school .

"Scientists have found what they believe to be the oldest preserved human dissection in Europe. The specimen, which shows signs of surprisingly advanced medical techniques, is made up of an adult human head and shoulders with the top of the skull and the brain removed. Radiocarbon dating puts the age of the head, which is being studied by Philippe Charlier at University Hospital R. Poincare in France, at between AD 1200 and AD 1280. Scientists have found what they believe to be the oldest preserved human dissection in Europe . The researchers used medical scanners to create a 3D model of them, allowing them to see inside and analyse the methods used to preserve it . The head’s arteries are filled with a . ‘metal wax’ compound made up of beeswax, lime and cinnabar mercury. It was used as a preservative and as a way of giving the circulatory . system some colour. The preservation was so successful that the head retains some of the red hairs that made up its beard and moustache. The head’s arteries are filled with a ‘metal wax’ compound – made up of beeswax, lime and cinnabar mercury - that was used as a preservative and as a way of giving the circulatory system some colour. The presence of this substance suggests unexpectedly sophisticated anatomical expertise during the Dark Ages, experts say. This contradicts previous theories that this was a period of little scientific advancement and it proves that the man’s body was not simply dissected and then disposed of – it was preserved, possibly for use in medical experimentation. ‘It's state-of-the-art,’ Dr Charlier told LiveScience. ‘I suppose that the preparator did not do this just one time, but several times, to be so good at this.’ The preservation was so successful that the head retains some of the red hairs that made up its beard and moustache. The researchers have also been able to ascertain that when he died, the man only had four teeth left and that he was suffering from osteoarthritis. However, despite the sophistication of the preservation, the specimen has suffered some damage and shows evidence that it has been gnawed by rodents and infested with insects. The identity of the man is not known but the researchers, who are publishing their findings in the journal, Archives of Medical Science, suggest that he could have been an institutionalised person, a prisoner or a pauper whose body was never claimed. A scan showed that the arteries are filled with a 'metal wax' compound . The specimen, which shows signs of surprisingly advanced dissection techniques, is made up of an adult human head and shoulders with the top of the skull and the brain removed . The specimen, which is currently in a private collection, is to go on display at the Parisian Museum of the History of Medicine. ‘This is really interesting from a historical and archaeological point of view,’ Dr Charlier told LiveScience.’ He added: ‘We really have a lack of skeletons and anthropological pieces.’ Fragments of dissected human bodies from before the 19th century are very rare and have mainly been found in Venice, Italy, Marseille, France, Sens, France, and Douai, France. The first known human scientific dissections were carried out in Alexandria, Egypt, by Greek physicians in the early part of the third century BC. Human dissection made its first appearances in the Western world in Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. A close-up view of the head shows the preserved arteries . Richard the Lionheart ended up with a . heart full of daisies, mint and frankincense, a French study of his . mummified heart has discovered. The . analysis, by the same team who carried out the research above, also uncovered elements like creosote, mercury and perhaps . lime in the heart. The king's heart has been in the western French city of Rouen . since his death in 1199. The study’s leader, Philippe Charlier, suggests the flowers and spices were to give the king the ‘odour of sanctity’.Richard the Lionheart, leader of the Third Crusade, was ceremoniously laid to rest in three places. His entrails were interred in the central French town of Chalus, where he died in a skirmish with a rebellious baron; his body reposes at the Fontevraud Abbey, beside his father Henry II and later his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine; and his heart, wrapped in linen, pickled for posterity and placed in a lead box, was sent on to the Cathedral of Rouen. In 1838, the heart, already turned to powder, was rediscovered, transferred to a glass box and placed in Rouen’s Departmental Museum of Antiquities. Charlier, a forensic medical examiner, and his 11-member team used the latest biomedical techniques to decipher the composition of The Lionheart’s heart.","Scientists have found the oldest preserved human dissection in Europe .

"A Pennsylvania school district that made an embarrassing name for itself by trying to take a battle against 'I (heart) boobies' cancer awareness bracelets must now shell out nearly $400,000 following he protracted court battle. Easton School District agreed to a settlement amount of $385,000 that will go toward the ACLU attorney fees amassed over the four-year battle. The payments--to be made in three installments between Monday and July 1--will finally put to an end a case school district attorneys tried taking all the way to the supreme court. 'I (heart) boobies': A Pennsylvania school district that made an embarrassing name for itself by trying to take a battle against 'I (heart) boobies' cancer awareness bracelets must now shell out nearly $400,000 following he protracted court battle . The Supreme Court in March rejected an appeal from the school district that tried to ban students from wearing 'I (heart) Boobies!' bracelets. The justices left in place a federal appeals court ruling from August that found the bracelets were not 'plainly lewd,' nor had they caused a disruption. The lower court sided with two students who sued the Easton Area School District in 2010 with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union. Easton is one of several school districts around the country to ban the bracelets, which are distributed by the nonprofit Keep A Breast Foundation of Carlsbad, Calif. Just wanted to make a difference: The case started in 2010 when  Kayla Martinez and Brianna Hawk said they were trying to promote awareness of the disease at their middle school . 'The principle here is that even kids talk about important things, and when they talk about important things, that's what we should be encouraging,' Mary Catherine Roper, an attorney with the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said Monday. 'Kids should be able to talk about things that matter to them in language that is both respectful and familiar to them.' The district's solicitor, John Freund, said he was disappointed the Supreme Court won't hear the case. The ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 'robs educators and school boards of the ability to strike a reasonable balance between a student's right to creative expression' and districts' responsibility to make sure schools are 'free from sexual entendre and vulgarity,' Freund said. Groups representing school boards, superintendents and principals had supported Easton's appeal. The case started in 2010 when two girls, then ages 12 and 13, challenged the ban. Kayla Martinez and Brianna Hawk said they were trying to promote awareness of the disease at their middle school. They wore the bracelets on their school's Breast Cancer Awareness Day — in defiance of a ban that had been announced a day earlier — and refused to take them off. The girls filed suit after being suspended from class and banned from attending the winter dance. 'I am happy we won this case, because it's important that students have the right to stand up for a cause and try to make a difference. We just wanted to raise awareness about breast cancer,' Hawk, who was in eighth grade at the time, said in a statement distributed by the ACLU. Earlier Supreme Court rulings give schools the right to restrict vulgar speech or speech that is likely to cause 'substantial disruption.' Roper said districts still have that ability. 'In a situation where these bracelets were actually causing problems, school officials could take action,' Roper said. 'This is all based on a case where they weren't sparking inappropriate behavior or inappropriate comments. Schools always have the authority to keep order and prevent those things from happening.' Freund predicted the Supreme Court would eventually revisit students' free-speech rights. 'Unfortunately, it will take more lawsuits, more attorneys' fees and more chaos in the classroom,' he said. 'I am happy we won this case, because it's important that students have the right to stand up for a cause and try to make a difference.

"Farmers are threatening protests after Iceland cut the price of a four-pint milk carton from £1 to 89p. The budget store is using milk as a loss leader – selling below cost price to lure in customers – with the result it is even undercutting discount chains Aldi and Lidl. However, the news has angered dairy farmers who complain they have been hit with a succession of punishing price cuts which are forcing them out of business. Scroll down for video . Farmers are threatening protests after Iceland cut the price of a four-pint milk carton from £1 to 89p . The Farmers For Action campaign group has already held a series of blockades outside dairy and supermarket distribution centres in the past week, with more planned. And last night, farmers’ leaders accused Iceland of being ‘rash and stupid’ as they warned that the company is now likely to face its own protests. FFA chairman David Handley said: ‘This move by Iceland is a disgrace. It will feed through to lower prices paid to farmers. ‘The supermarkets are devaluing milk. We are almost getting to the point it is so cheap that people will buy it because it doesn’t matter if they throw it away. Some farmers are now getting as little as 27.1p a litre for milk to be sold in the high street, which compares to an average cost of production of about 32p . The Farmers For Action campaign group have called Iceland a 'disgrace' - pictured, chairman and CEO of the company, Malcolm Walker . ‘The dairy industry lost 49 milk producers in September.’ Rob Harrison, chairman of the National Farmers’ Union dairy board, said: ‘We will be speaking to Iceland. This continual devaluation of milk is a real concern to our industry. ‘It is rather rash and stupid to do this when lots of dairy farmers are suffering with low prices. ‘Either Iceland is screwing its suppliers or it is subsidising the cost of milk to shoppers. I hope shoppers vote with their feet and support farmers by ensuring they get a fair price for milk. Some farmers want to take action.’ The wholesale prices of milk and other dairy products have collapsed due to a glut in supplies. Some farmers are now getting as little as 27.1p a litre for milk to be sold in the high street, which compares to an average cost of production of about 32p. An Iceland spokesman said: ‘We have not changed the price we pay for our milk, only the price we charge to our customers. ‘We are operating in the most competitive food retail market in the UK any of us can remember, and decided to make a major investment of our own margin to help our customers by offering them really compelling, market-beating value on one of the key essentials they buy every day.’","Iceland slash cost of milk as way of luring customers into their stores .

"It was the explosive storyline that threatened to derail life as we know it in the gentle village of Ambridge. After a local gamekeeper is brutally murdered, one of the show's best-loved characters Ed Grundy is wrongfully jailed for life for a crime he didn't commit. Except, as fans of Radio 4's rural soap The Archers know, it never happened. New storyline: Brian Aldridge (Charles Collingwood, pictured with Tamsin Greig who plays Debbie Travers-Macy) had an affair and child with Siobhan Hathaway in the show instead of the story running the Eddie Grundy miscarriage of justice story . The director of BBC Radio Helen Boaden has revealed that she banned the programme makers from airing the dramatic plot twist because she felt it was too 'far fetched', leaving the show's editor close to tears. As a result of her executive decision, made in 2002 when she was Radio 4 controller, the show's writers were forced to rewrite a huge swathe of the script. Instead, they came up with Brian Aldridge's affair and child with Siobhan Hathaway, a storyline that played out over more than a year and boosted the programme's audience figures. The Grundy family of Ambridge: (clockwise from top left) Phillip Molloy as William, Edward Kelsey as Joe, Roslaind Adams as Clarrie and Trevor Harrison as Eddie Grundy who would have been wrongly jailed . Helen Boaden vetoed a storyline that would have seen lovable Eddie Grundy wrongly jailed . Miss Boaden, who earns £340,000-a-year, said that the proposed plot would have seen Helen Archer's 'deeply boring gamekeeper boyfriend' Greg Turner murdered, and Ed Grundy 'banged up for life a killing he did not commit'. She said it would have led to a 'long running rough justice story'. The village of Ambridge in the county of Borsetshire. Its goings on have been followed nationally since 1951 . Explaining her decision to can it, she said: 'Murders in country villages by people you have never met are unbelievably rare. And this felt so far fetched that I banned it. 'To the great chagrin of the then editor, who nearly cried. Vanessa Whitburn was appointed editor of the show in 1992 and stayed in the chair until her retirement in May 2013. She once commented: 'To be politically correct is really to be moral. It is having a correct moral stance. PC is, in fact, my moral plank.' Vanessa Whitburn . Many fans of the show disliked Whitburn and her changes to The Archers - one columnist said that she 'not only turned it into politically correct drivel but totally deprived it of its humour'. Whitburn told the BBC: 'I do not mind proper criticism, and we have a very intelligent audience out there who love the programme, and I love debating with listeners. What I don't like is cyber-bullying.' 'But as a consequence of my decision, she and her team came up with the brilliant and much more authentic Siobhan and Brian adultery story which gripped Middle England for over a year.' Eventually, Greg Turner was killed off in a different way, when he committed suicide in a 2004 episode. Miss Boaden contrasted the Archers - which is billed as the 'everyday story of country folk' - with more violent TV soaps such as EastEnders. Discussing the eventual confrontation between Brian Aldridge and his wronged wife, she said: 'In EastEnders resolving this issue of love and loyalty would have involved a lot of shouting and possibly some violent crime. 'In The Archers, such things are decided over the washing up.' In recent years, The Archers has been accused of introducing ever-more violent and dramatic plot lines - including bloody accidents and violent gangs - in a bid to increase ratings. Last year, former EastEnders producer Sean O'Connor took over the long-running show and promised to deliver 'Shakespearean' plots. Violence is not new in Ambridge - in 1957 Tom Forrest (Bob Arnold), the gamekeeper, shot  Bob Larkin (Lewis Gadge), a poacher .","£340,000-a-year director of radio Helen Boaden refused to let story go ahead .

"The contestant tipped as favourite to win the Great British Bake Off, who is portrayed as a working class builder actually went to a top school and has a university degree. Richard Burr has been painted differently to his middle class rivals by BBC producers, but it has been revealed that he actually manages his family’s building firm and lives in an affluent London suburb. The father-of-two attended elite Queen Elizabeth Boys’ Grammar in north London and received a first class honours degree in biodiversity and conservation at Birkbeck College in 2012. Scroll down for video . Richard Burr is portrayed as a working class builder but it has been revealed he went to a top London school . He is the fourth generation to work in his family’s building firm – and despite building his own home – he now runs the business in a management role. The baker, who is favourite to win the show next week, is described in an article by his former school as a ‘keen fisher, diver and cyclist’. ‘He is teaching his daughters eco-friendly ways to help animals by building homes for hedgehogs to hibernate in,’ it adds. According to his profile on the BBC website, he has his own allotment in his back garden and ‘volunteers for the National Wildlife Trust’. The 38-year-old lives in a detached house in Mill Hill, north London - thought to be worth at least £600,000, according to the Daily Star. He has also goes scuba diving, has holidayed in Marrakech, northwest Africa, and been skiing in the French alps.

"A rescue mission to save ginger Jihadist, Abdullah Elmir, 17, had to be aborted at the last minute, with fears those involved could be charged for assisting the teen, if he was found. The Sydney teenager gained notoriety, when he ran away from his Bankstown home with friend 'Fayez' in June, and declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a Youtube video. According to the Sun Herald, relatives in Sydney and Elmir's father in Lebanon tried to assemble a team, including a Sydney man who believed he could get in contact with the teenager, to find him. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled from Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Channel seven's Sunday Night program was also expected to travel with the group. But major concerns surrounded whether the team, if they found Elmir and gave him assistance, could be charged under the federal government's foreign incursion laws. The 17 year old could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the evidence is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions following his ISIS video rant against western society. AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said. Mark Llewellyn, executive producer of Sunday Night told the Sun Herald they had been approached by people who had concerns for Elmir. 'It was felt that at this early stage before he had been radicalised, it might be possible for members of his Sydney Muslim community to negotiate his exit from IS, especially given his young age,' he said. The father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams . Despite claims there was mounting pressure from federal agencies not to communicate with the media, Mr Llewellyn said the Australian Federal Police denied they 'place contact restrictions on members of the public'. 'We were informed these warnings also included the Muslim representatives who eventually pulled out of the plan.' 'For the record, we did not offer or attempt to negotiate any story fee.' Meanwhile, the father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams, according to Herald Sun. While Elmir's friends have admitted that  Elmir,  who this week appeared in a YouTube video rant, was 'expected' to run away to the Middle East. 'Some expected it, like he used to talk about it a bit,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' and someone who 'enjoyed politicking'. Australian security agencies are analysing the vision to determine whether a bearded man to Elmir's right is Mohamed Elomar, (one of the country's most wanted) the ISIS recruit believed responsible for radicalising and luring dozens of Australians to take up arms in the Middle East. While most of his best mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock. 'Yeah man, he's my friend and I don't want to talk about him,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was my mate but I don't talk about him'. But the teenage terrorist was described by another classmate as being 'very quiet, he was a good kid, we used to pray together at our mosque'. While most of his closest mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock . Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' while also someone who 'enjoyed politicking' 'He did a little bit of debating here, he liked knowing politics and did some politicking but he was mostly very quiet and never, ever got into trouble,' he said. 'Abdullah was in theatre groups at school and he liked playing basketball a lot.' When asked if he was one of those who thought Abdullah was capable of running away, he added 'no, no I didn't expect that but I know a few of his other friends say they heard him mention it'. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' Professor Barton said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Professor Barton added that young people were the easiest to radicalise. Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. Before Elmir joined ISIS, the ginger jihad was employed as a butcher in a shop in Bankstown, The Daily Telegraph. 'He made his own bed now he has to lie in it,' his former boss said. 'He was a good kid. The best kid.' Elmir's boss was furious when the 17-year-old called in sick, the same day Elmir reportedly told his mother that he was 'going fishing' and disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . As Elmir finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he's being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.","Rescue mission to save ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir was aborted a day before they were due to fly out .

"These never-before-seen images show a teenage Reeva Steenkamp in her days as a law student through the eyes of a close friend before her sparkling modelling career took off. As her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius begins a five-year jail sentence for her manslaughter, they offer a poignant insight into the innocent and beautiful life he cut tragically short. In one set of photographs, she is seen posing happily on a beach in South Africa, while others show her enjoying sleepovers and hot tubs with her university friends. They were captured by close friend Kerry Smith, 37, who attended university with Reeva in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where they both grew up. Scroll down for video . Intimate portraits: Never-before-seen images show the late Reeva Steenkamp posing on a beach during her time as a law student in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, before going on to become a top model . Blossoming talent: The model, who was shot dead by her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius last year, poses at Sardinia Bay in Port Elizabeth at the age of 19 in a set of photos taken by her close friend Kerry Smith . Beautiful: As her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius begins a five-year jail sentence for her manslaughter, the images offer a poignant insight into the innocent  life he cut tragically short . The images were a 'bittersweet reminder' of Miss Steenkamp for Mrs Smith, who spoke at the 29-year-old's funeral days after she was shot dead by the Paralympian on Valentine's Day last year. Mrs Smith said: 'Looking at these pictures, seeing Reeva laughing - going from that and then having to speak in front of her coffin, it's surreal. You just can't wrap your head around it.' An aspiring photographer, she tested her camera skills using Miss Steenkamp as her subject - and the result was a beautiful set of photos of the then-aspiring model. Miss Steenkamp would go on to graduate with a law degree at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, but made a dynamic career change after being scouted and named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa. She also worked for prestigious clients such as Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui. One set of photos shot by Mrs Kerry show Miss Steenkamp, then 19, posing innocently at Sardinia Bay in Port Elizabeth. 'Natural beauty': The images were a 'bittersweet reminder' for the model's friend Kerry Smith, who spoke at the 29-year-old's funeral days after she was shot dead by the Paralympian on Valentine's Day last year . Rising star: An aspiring photographer, Kerry Smith tested her camera skills using Miss Steenkamp as her subject - and the result was a beautiful set of photos of the then-aspiring model . She said: 'If there was ever any proof anyone needed to show that Reeva was truly a natural beauty, this is it. 'She did not have a stitch of make-up on and we didn't do anything fancy with her hair. 'She told me she wanted to go back into the modelling industry, but was hesitant because she wanted to have a stable career. 'She said ""modeling can't be forever because we get older, beauty fades, wrinkles appear"".' Despite her doubts, Mrs Smith managed to convince her to go to the beach for a few shots.

Reeva Steenkamp laughs in the hot tub during a party with friends while she was studying law at university . Mrs Smith added: 'She was shy and self-conscious at first, but eventually grew comfortable in front of the camera. 'Reeva was always the down-to-earth girl next door - you can see that the first few photos are of her in a black polar neck sweater with no flesh showing, and later with a bare midriff. 'The whole process was drowned out in fits of laughter while we tried to be professional and serious.' Other photos taken by Kerry show Miss Steenkamp sporting pyjamas and drinking coffee with university friends at a sleepover. Mrs Smith said: 'She had this really loud laugh, it wasn't cute and giggly - it was one of those laughs that made everyone laugh too.'

Downtime: Miss Steenkamp with friends Cornelia Nel (left) and Kerry Smith (centre) at a pub in Port Elizabeth . She met Miss Steenkamp at the University of Port Elizabeth in 2002, where they both studied law. Mrs Smith said she and Miss Steenkamp were passionate about issues like domestic violence and discussed plans to one day open up a clinic for women who were in abusive relationships. 'Reeva wouldn't back down from things that she stood against,' she said. 'She wouldn't keep quiet, and didn't change at all even when she was in the model business.' 'We were all asked to break off into groups for a project, and Reeva was in my group,' said Kerry. 'We lived just up the block from each other, and we rode into school together in the morning. It blossomed from there and we became the closest of friends.' Mrs Smith said she and Miss Steenkamp were passionate about issues like domestic violence and discussed plans to one day open up a clinic for women who were in abusive relationships . But she said the two grew apart after graduation in 2005 over of a clash of opinions about Kerry's partner at the time. Kerry said: 'I was in an unhappy relationship. Reeva didn't like my partner and couldn't understand why I was with him, so we stopped talking. 'She contacted me in 2007, after she found out that I had left him. She said it was her dream come true and she was glad I found happiness.' On February 14, 2013, Pistorius was arrested for questioning after shooting and killing the model  at his home in Pretoria, South Africa. He was formally charged with murder the next day - but claimed he shot Miss Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder. Close friends: Kerry Smith (pictured, left, earlier this year) and (right) with Miss Steenkamp  at a Law school ball in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 2004 . Pistorius testified during his murder trial that he mistook Miss Steenkamp (above) for a dangerous intruder about to come out of the cubicle and attack him when he shot four times through the door with his 9mm pistol . As Oscar's trial began, Kerry was painfully reminded of Reeva's tragic death. Kerry said: 'I was riveted at the outset of the trial and despite my personal connection to the matter I tried to keep an unbiased view when listening to the evidence being read. 'The only time I broke down was when I saw the head shot of Reeva which showed her wounds. 'I remember wondering ""why is her hair black?"" and then I realised it was all the blood.'

Speaking of verdict, Mrs Smith said: 'When the judge delivered a ""not guilty"" (of murder) verdict - I was horrified. 'I had to drive to my son's school for a sports game after hearing it. 'When I turned off the TV, I left to the school totally disillusioned with the outcome and for the first time since the trial started, I broke down. 'I still have no closure of her death - in my mind Reeva is still so vibrant and alive. I miss Reeva.

"The mother of a 16-year-old girl who was filmed being attacked in a brutal Snapchat video has revealed that her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead. Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, who had been on the run, turned himself into police on Saturday and is now in custody alongside Kailyn Bonia, 18, and a minor co-defendant, aged 17. The trio are accused of the horrific attack on 3 September in woods behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts. The video shows the teenagers assaulting and starting to rape the naked and impaired 16-year-old girl, as she desperately tries to get away,  according to prosecutors. Scroll down for video . Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (pictured yesterday) had been on the run for weeks, turned himself into police on Saturday . Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (left) is now in custody alongside Kailyn Bonia, 18, (right) and a minor co-defendant, aged 17. Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on Snapchat and recognized the location before leading police to the scene . Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on the video and photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene. Court documents state the girl was foaming at the mouth when she arrived at hospital, possibly on a narcotic and had cuts all over body  - when detectives interviewed her days later she could not recalled what had happened. The victim's mother told WHDH, her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead. 'What they did was disgusting it was sick, I almost lost my daughter,' the mother said. 'She was barely breathing she was found with nothing on.' 'She had fingerprints, at least two hands held down by her throat. ' Police found the girl partially-naked and covered in cuts and bruises in woods behind Waybright Elementary School (pictured) in Sangus, Massachusetts . 'Her breasts were bruised, her whole body was ripped, shredded, broken toes.' 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' the mom said. Yesterday Assistant Essex District Attorney Erin Bellavia stated graphic details of the video, in which she said Deihim can be clearly identified, reports the Boston Herald. Deihim had his pants unzipped and suspect  Bonia can be 'seen wrapping her arms around the victim's neck as if she was strangling her while grabbing at the victim's naked body,' Bellavia said. Deihim (pictured) and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping . Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia . 'She attempted to run away naked in one of the videos but she could not because she was so impaired,' Bellavia said and added that she is seen shaking her head as if to to protest against their actions. Bellavia said the unnamed 17-year-old male suspect who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.' Deihim and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping. The minor co-defendant is charged as a juvenile with identical charges and distribution of child pornography. The victim's mother is calling for the trio to be charged with attempted murder saying: 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated. 'I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.' Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student . The victim's friend who received the Snapchat videos took screen shots, according to a police report. The victim's friend asked the juvenile defendant where he was and he said, 'Waybright, but then realized he gave up where they were and panicked,' the report said. The two friends spoke after the victim was released from the hospital which is when the victim thanked the girl 'for saving her life,' the report said. Yesterday Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia. According to reports, when Bonia was arrested she called Deihim to alert him and said: 'Dude, I'm like being held for all these charges. Where is (juvenile defendant), this is all his fault. They should have him.' Deihim's lawyer, David Newton, said, 'Mr. Deihim turned himself in so he can answer to these charges. ... He's innocent till proven guilty.' Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student. He has been arrested several times - in August he arrested on accusations of dragging a woman with his car.","Severely intoxicated girl, 16 was found by police behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts .

"When Kina Webb-Owens, 33, was diagnosed with terminal heart disease, she found solace in knowing that her husband, Adrian, would be there to raise their three children. But on October 29, Adrian Webb, 34, was killed in a head-on collision en route to his second job in Indianapolis. If Mrs Webb-Owens succumbs to her illness, which could happen at any moment, her children, 16-year-old Kenya, 6-year-old Adrianna and 2-year-old Kyle, will become orphans. Scroll down for video . Tragic couple: Kina Webb-Owens, 33, is terminally ill with heart disease. Her husband, Adrian Owens, 34, was killed in a head-on crash October 29. Here the couple are pictured in their last photo together . Uncertain future: The plan was for Adrian to raise their three children (pictured) on his own after Kina's death, but now they will be orphaned . '[Doctors] didn't give me long to live, but I am still here. Grace of God,' the deeply devout widow told the station WTHR. Kina's only hope now is to undergo a heart transplant, but so far doctors have not been able to find a match for her. When Adrian Owens was tragically killed in the crash on Fall Creek Road, his heart was not damaged in the collision, giving his family a small glimmer of hope that he might be a match for Kina. But medics quickly determined that they will not be able to transplant his heart into her body. Still, Kina was determined to give the gift of life to others by donating her husband's organs. Living on borrowed time: Kina Webb-Owens is on a wait list for a heart transplant, but her prognosis in not hopeful. Her husband's heart was not a match for her . His heart, which sadly was of no use to his terminally ill young wife, went to a man in Indiana. ‘Take good care of it. You are getting an awesome heart. It's a hard-working heart,’ Kina said. Another Indiana patient received Adrian’s lungs and a kidney, and a Florida teenager got Adrian's other kidney. Kina Webb, a beauty salon owner, and Adrian, a construction worker, had been together for a decade. In September 2010, the couple got married, with their two oldest children on hand to celebrate their union. Paying it forward: Kina was determined to give the gift of life to others by donating her husband's organs . On Friday, Kina, her three children and their loved ones came together to bid a final farewell to Adrian.

"When Harry Redknapp was asked how he felt when his team’s only shot on goal hit the Derby net, he reacted with commendable candour. ‘Surprised,’ he said. He thereby succeeded in summing up the entire, outrageous occasion in a single word. Queens Park Rangers are back in the Premier League, and even their manager cannot explain how it came to pass. Redknapp warmed to his theme. ‘It was an amazing finish. We were hanging on,’ he said. ‘We were looking to get to extra time. It was our only hope, really. Maybe get to penalties, even. I’d be lying if I said otherwise.’ VIDEO: Scroll down for Redknapp: It was difficult to get out and attack Derby . Priceless: Bobby Zamora scored the goal that sent QPR back into the Premier Leagu . Never in doubt: Harry Redknapp shaking hands with Derby manager Steve McClaren at full time . Surprised: Harry Redknapp lead his side out of the Championship at the first time of asking . The old boy has been around for some time, long enough to know when honesty is the best policy. Any attempt to justify this travesty of a result would have risked mockery. So he accepted his triumph with subdued satisfaction, and he left his celebrations to a less public stage. By contrast, Steve McClaren made no effort to disguise his feelings. His team had out-played, out-thought and generally out-performed Rangers. Effectively, they had won every round by a decent distance, before getting caught by a farcical sucker punch seconds before the final bell. ‘Football’s a cruel game,’ said the Derby manager. ‘One lapse and you lose it. Credit to QPR, they’ve got the experience. But we kept on playing, probing. 'We thought with 30 minutes of extra time to go we’d get rewarded. Maybe the concentration went a bit at the end. Maybe we’re not quite ready yet. Maybe we’ve still got a bit of growing up to do. But I’m so proud of them. So proud’. His pride was justified, as was his sense of being cheated by fate. There was nothing more he could have done to deliver promotion, with its attendant £130 million and all the benefits for club and town. ‘Maybe we just weren’t ready,’ he kept repeating. But he didn’t really believe it. Derby were ready, but they were hopelessly unprepared for the sickening feeling of failure. Dejected: McClaren comforting his defender Richard Keogh after the defeat . Heartache: Derby players Will Hughes (left) and Craig Forsyth finding it tough to take the defeat . 2013Winners: Crystal Palace. Finished 11th inPremier League and in great form. Won£73.2m PL cash.

Losers: Sheff United. 8th inChampionship, and never been highersince. Now in League One. McClaren knew, just as everybody at Wembley knew, that his young team should have been preparing for something wonderful; the chance to turn out every week at the Emirates, Anfield, Goodison Park and the other cathedrals of the English game. Instead, they will continue their journey around the provincial repertory companies. All through that late, totally unwarranted goal. McClaren sat and thought out loud; miserable beyond words. ‘It’s going to take a few days, maybe weeks to get over this,’ he said. ‘We watched them celebrate, watched them pick up the Cup, saw them go into the Premier League. I told our lads to remember how much it hurt. We’ll get stronger. 'We’re growing, and when you grow, you can take a hit. We’ve taken a big one today.’ In fact, his own credentials were substantially enhanced by his side’s performance yesterday. It is McClaren’s fate to be reminded of his brief England experience every time he becomes involved in a major match. There is much talk of failure to qualify for a tournament and all that nonsense with the brolly. He takes it very well, knowing that he has a great deal more to offer. In fairness, a small shudder seemed to cross his face as he prepared to lead out his team. The skies burst, the rain fell in a stream; it was so very like that fateful night when Croatia came and conquered. But he squared his shoulders, delivered his side, and watched his lads pass with bright diligence and run with enterprising zest. By then, the early rain had soaked his big match suit. Redknapp’s impeccable threads suffered a similar fate, but he placed himself in the dugout through the worst of the tempest; glowering, twitching, possibly worrying that this game could be his last in the big league, so enormous were the stakes, so chastening the penalty for failure. In the past, he has produced some ebullient, resourceful teams. This was not one of them. Their first-half performance gave mediocrity a bad name, with the old lags of his back four defending willfully deep. The tactics were aimed at stealing a goal and grinding out a result. We had no idea of how well it would succeed. McClaren reappeared on the stroke of half-time, wearing a wet top and carrying a clipboard. His confidence was papable and apparently justified. That confidence grew immeasurably when Gary O’Neil was sent off for a trip on 59 minutes. Umbrella: McClaren's infamous 'Wally with a Brolly' moment from when he was England manager in 2007 . Off: Gary O'Neil was sent off in the 59th minute after a foul on Derby's Johnny Russell . Pivotal: And he thought his moment of rashness may have cost his side the game . Again, Redknapp would prove splendidly candid: “It was a cynical challenge, really,’ he said. ‘A deliberate foul. I couldn’t really argue.’ His team started to toil. Joey Barton suddenly seemed older than his years as his influence, never great, evaporated entirely. Bobby Zamora seemed unequal to the task he had been set. Another misconception. But poor Richard Keogh went on to make his calamitous error, and Zamora’s finish did the rest. Redknapp’s mood changed just once in his after-match press conference. He was asked about finances for next season. He spotted your correspondent. ‘Patrick Collins up there will tell you we’ve got a bigger wage bill than Atletico Madrid,’ he sneered. ‘Maybe you should ask him.’ In fact, last season Atletico Madrid finished third in La Liga. They also won the Spanish Cup. Yet their players were paid an average of £1,734,067, while their counterparts at QPR — who finished bottom of the Premier League — received an average of £2,142,611. Still, why should Harry worry about facts? He is back in the  Premier League. And one day, he may work out just how it happened. Error: Keogh's mistake let in Zamora to score the last gasp winner .

"A man's relaxing nightly shower sparked a horrific knife attack inside his own home, hospitalising him for four days with life-threatening injuries. Scott Hogan, 19, was stabbed twice in the back with a steak knife by his flatmate Matthew George Chandler, 21, in a 'spur-of-the-moment' attack on February 7 last year. Mr Chandler was reportedly fuming with Mr Hogan over his love of a long hot shower when the brutal incident occurred at their Southport unit on Queensland's Gold Coast. Unlikely attack: A man's relaxing nightly shower at his home in Southport on the Gold Coast, Queensland, turned violent . The court heard that after banging on the bathroom door of the Eugaree Street home to get Mr Hogan's attention, Mr Chandler shouted 'hurry up'. What began as a fairly common falling out between flatmates soon turned nasty. The court heard Mr Hogan first pulled out the knife when hustled out of the shower, confronting his flatmate and saying: 'Do you want some of this?'. Brutal: Scott Hogan, 19, was stabbed twice in the back with a steak knife by his flatmate Matthew George Chandler, 21, on 7 February last year at their Eugaree St home in Southport . The court heard Mr Chandler then battered Mr Hogan with a skateboard, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Another flatmate then pulled them apart. But later Mr Hogan charged at Mr Chandler in the kitchen and pinned him by his throat to the wall, Southport District Court heard on Tuesday. Mr Chandler grabbed a nearby steak knife and sunk it twice into Mr Hogan's back, leaving him with internal bleeding, the court was told. Mr Chandler admitted in court to stabbing his flatmate and pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm with a weapon. Barrister Alastair McDougall, who was representing Mr Chandler, explained: 'He’s very remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation should be viewed as very good.' Judge Clive Wall sentenced him to two years probation and did not record a conviction. The housemates are no longer in contact.","Scott Hogan, 19, attacked after a fight over his evening shower .

"​A depressed postman allegedly hoarded more than 40,000 pieces of mail dating back to 2005 in his Brooklyn home. Postal workers hauled mail for five hours out of the Flatbush apartment of Joseph Brucato, where the 67-year-old Vietnam veteran had stashed undelivered letters dating back to 2005. The mail had built up in the home as well as in Brucato's car and office locker while he suffered from depression and alcoholism, according to a complaint filed in a federal court in Brooklyn. Stash: Joseph Brucato, 67, was accused of hoarding more than a ton of mail in his Flatbush apartment that he was too depressed to deliver . Brucato's landlord, Bruno Honovic, told the New York Post that the postman had rented the apartment for 30 years and no one suspected him of doing anything wrong. 'It really shocked me,' said Honovic, 72. 'Our neighbor thought maybe he was moving and the post office was helping him out by lending him a truck.' The post office was tipped off when a supervisor saw a stockpile of undelivered letters in Brucato's car, which is not authorized to be used for mail deliveries. Brucato admitted he had used not only his car, but his locker and his home to ferret away letters, which came from his route in Flatbush. He cited 'personal reasons' for why he couldn't deliver the mail. In court, his lawyer said that he suffered from alcoholism brought on by depression. Magistrate Vera Scanlon ordered him to 'abstain from excessive alcohol consumption' before Brucato was released on his own recognizance. In all, Brucato's stash added up to a 'conservative estimate' of 2,500 pounds according to Special Agent Michael Wu of the Office of Inspector General. The U.S. Postal Service suspended Brucato without pay pending the result of the trial. Brucato faces up to five years. The post office now faces the task of delivering those 40,000 letters, though a spokesperson told the New York Daily News she did not know when customers would receive their mail.","Joseph Brucato, a 67-year-old Vietnam War veteran, was arrested Wednesday for stashing the letters in his home .

"Jonny Wilkinson claimed a second consecutive Heineken Cup crown in his final game on British soil on Saturday - but was keen to turn the spotlight on the ""incredible"" contribution of Matt Giteau in Toulon's victory over Saracens. World Cup winner Wilkinson landed 13 points with the boot at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium yet felt it was the performance of centre Giteau that was pivotal to the 23-6 win. The former England fly-half, who turns 35 on Sunday, will end 17 years of top-class rugby with Toulon's Top 14 final against Castres next weekend, and conceded watching Giteau execute a cunningly-disguised chip that yielded a fine try for the Australia playmaker underlined exactly why he will retire this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jonny Wilkinson after winning the Heineken Cup . Bowing out: Jonny Wilkinson won the Heineken Cup in his last ever game on British soil . Glory: The England legend lifts the trophy with his team-mates following their impressive victory . 'Matt's individual contributions to . the game were incredible, all the way through,' said Wilkinson. 'He's a . damn good player who can just about do everything, and he's the reason . why someone like me realises my time is up. 'You . look at him doing what he does, and you think that's where the future . of this team is. I certainly want to see him flourish, he's been an . inspiration to me, and I know he will be to this team in the future. 'Since . he's been here he's done nothing but bring this team up, give them more . and make us all better players. I wouldn't survive out there without . guys like him, his ability to selflessly do the extra work, take on . extra responsibility, make the difficult calls. 'He . could say ""that's not my position, that's not my job"" but he never . does. There have been times during the season where I haven't made the . first few kicks, and I've asked him to take the next one and he just . steps up and does it. 'He never says anything about it, he just gets on with it, and that's the kind of guy he is.' Wilkinson will move straight into Toulon's backroom staff as kicking and skills coach once he retires this summer. The . nerveless fly-half's haul of points on Saturday afternoon included a . trademark drop-goal off his weaker right foot as Toulon retained their . European title. Giteau's . stubbed chip caught Alex Goode cold to allow Drew Mitchell to claim the . loose ball and return the favour, with the Wallabies midfielder . ghosting home for the game's first try.

'Hell of a feeling': Wilkinson kicked 13 points against Saracen at the Millenium Stadium in Cardiff . Double: It was the second successive win in the tournament for Wilkinson's Toulon side . Despite . a near-unrivalled professional-era career, Wilkinson was once again at . pains to shake off the adulation that follows him around the globe. 'I've . made no secret of the fact I've been over-supported, I've been given . way too much respect,' he said. 'I've been given too much of an easy . life compared to others who have deserved so much more but haven't had . it. 'I've tried to keep my feet on the ground, otherwise someone's going to realise I'm a bit of a fraud. 'You're . lucky enough to be surrounded by such quality players, and yet it's not . these guys around me that get the adulation and applause. 'When guys go out of their way to cheer for you, it's humbling.' Wilkinson . admitted it will be a ""pity"" not to celebrate Toulon's triumph in . style, with Bernard Laporte's team gearing up for Saturday's Top 14 . showdown, a repeat of last year's final. Wilkinson . said: 'It's a hell of a day, but a great reward for a long journey for . this team. And I hope that it can continue for one more week. 'It's an experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life: it's a fantastic present. 'It's a pity but we do have to move on very quickly as we have another final to play.' Saracens . rugby director Mark McCall backed his team to show the resolve required . to shake off the defeat and challenge for the Aviva Premiership title . in Saturday's Twickenham final against Northampton. McCall backed captain Steve Borthwick to face Saints after continued pectoral trouble, and added: . 'One . of the great qualities is our ability to respond to the setbacks. Even . if we were playing Newcastle away I would back us to front up, but we're . in the Premiership final and I've got no doubt we'll give a good . account of ourselves in that too.

"Hundreds of asylum seekers are being put up at two more seaside hotels at the expense of the taxpayer as the Home Office struggles with the latest influx of immigrants. Coachloads of migrants have been taken to Bournemouth, Dorset, where they are being given taxpayer-funded beds and three meals a day at two hotels. More than 88 are staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel and 67 are being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel. Scroll down for video . More than 88 asylum seekers are staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel, 10 minutes walk from Bournemouth beach .

Earlier this week it emerged that 130 asylum seekers were staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, close to the Port of Dover. The wave of immigrants arriving from Calais is causing 'overcrowding' issues at detention centres in the London area, so hundreds are being moved into hotels on the coast. The Home Office is using Britannia hotel group to temporarily house the latest flood of asylum seekers looking to escape war-torn areas of Africa and the Middle East. Despite the holiday season coming to an end weeks ago both the Bournemouth hotels, which charge between £50 to £160 a night for a double room, are fully booked this weekend. At least 67 are being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel in Bournemouth . Ladies, thought to be asylum seekers, leave the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent . Abel Teages (left) and Abrham Embaye (right) are living at a hotel in Kent at the taxpayers' expense . Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, said the asylum seekers were part of a group of 800 that were being housed in a hotel in Croydon, but were now being dispersed to other locations. He said the group had been moved into the area by Clearsprings, a company employed by the Home Office to 'provide ready accommodation services' for people. He said: 'I am very concerned by this. 'I will be talking to the Minister for Immigration to make sure Bournemouth is not a targeted destination for asylum seekers in the future. Around  24 migrants were rescued from a refrigerated lorry in Dover after they hid to cross the Channel . Earlier this week it emerged that 130 immigrants were staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent . 'This is not ideal. I would have preferred they weren't there. But I have been assured these are exceptional circumstances.' Tobias Ellwood, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East, claimed the asylum seekers were being chaperoned by police, although there is no obvious police presence at either hotel. He said: 'I am seeking assurances that this isn't the thin end of the wedge. We need to make sure this is orchestrated in a safe and secure manner.' John Beesley, the leader of Bournemouth Borough Council, said: 'We have been informed by the Home Office that they were accommodating a number of asylum seekers in the town due to overcrowding in London. 'The Home Office has made it very clear to us that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short term measure and have reassured us that it will be for no more than two weeks. 'We are meeting with Home Office officials early next week to discuss the matter further.' The asylum seekers will not have access to local statutory services such as schools and social services while they are in Bournemouth. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it. 'We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure.' Staff at the three star Roundhouse Hotel claimed they were not aware of any asylum seekers at the hotel while a spokesman at the Heathlands Hotel said they would not comment on the issue.","More than 88 asylum seekers are staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel .

"Steve Way has been selected to run the marathon for England at the Commonwealth Games in July. But when the 40-year-old lines up next to his competitors it will mark another memorable chapter in a journey that has seen him transformed from an overweight smoker with a penchant for takeaways into an athlete who runs 130-140 miles a week while holding down a job in a bank. He came to the attention of many when he entered the 2014 London Marathon and was the third British competitor to finish behind Mo Farah and Chris Thompson. Turnaround: Steve Way was 16 stone and smoked 20 a day, now he's set to run for England in Glasgow . A time of 2.16.27 saw Way finish within the two hour 17 mark and become eligible for selection for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, something which seemed a million miles off even recently. Way told The Guardian: ‘I am a one-man band: a self-coached club runner. ‘At school I was the guy who hid in the bushes with my fat mate during the first lap of the cross country and then rejoined the field when they came round again. ‘I have never competed in a major championship before and until recently I had almost no contact with British Athletics. And now I will be running at the Commonwealth Games.’ Long haul:  Way breaking the British all time 100km road record at the Stockholm Ultra Marathon . Way's lifestyle has changed dramatically in the seven years since he decided to take up running as a means of getting fit and losing weight. Way said: ‘Towards the end of 2007 I could hardly sleep at night. I was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife too. ‘At that point half our meals were takeaways and I would eat chocolate and sweets all the time. ‘I was 16 1/2 stone and realised I had to do something radically different to break the cycle.’","Steve Way came to prominence following the 2014 London Marathon .

He told officers he was from Louisville, Kentucky, but did not know his address and had no phone, yet the Social Security number he gave them appeared to have been issued in Texas in 1988, . Following his arrest, an unnamed campaign donor reportedly asked Waters to help Mr Khoury, describing him as a cousin of a business associate, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Two years earlier, the donor had given $1,000 to Waters's campaign, prompting the judge to say: 'You run into a problem with any of your people, you get ahold of me,' court filings reveal. Agency: Court documents show Mr Khoury, 40, was arrested for illegally carrying an unloaded Glock .40-caliber pistol during a 2012 traffic stop in Holmesberg. But the entire arrest was a sting operation by the FBI . Waters then called Judge Dawn Segal, who was scheduled to hear Mr Khoury's case, identifying the defendant as a friend and asking her to help him, it is alleged. Judge Segal later reduced Mr Khoruy's charge to a misdemeanor, before his case was dropped altogether when he failed to appear for trial and court staff had no address on file. Earlier this week, Waters, who presided over hearings at Philadelphia's Criminal Justice Center, pleaded guilty to federal mail and wire fraud charges. Meanwhile, Judge Segal has been suspended from the bench by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, pending an investigation by the state's Judicial Conduct Board. Last week, her lawyer Stuart L. Haimowitz said she made the ruling she thought was right at the time. 'She believed that her decision was the correct one,' he told the Inquirer. 'Whether it was a real case or a fake case, she would have ruled the same way.' Prosecutors and defense lawyers who worked briefly on Mr Khoury's case said they barely remembered the man, and were not in on the FBI's sting operation. 'As I understand it, none of it was real. This whole sting was orchestrated,' Waters's attorney, Michael Engle, said. The police report on Mr Khoury's arrest said the arresting officer, John Snyder, pulled him over in May 2012 for driving erratically on a busy stretch of Torresdale Avenue.

Meanwhile, Judge Segal has been suspended from the bench by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, pending an investigation by the state's Judicial Conduct Board . 'When I approached the window, I asked him for his information,' Mr Snyder testified later at a hearing in the case. 'I noticed a black handgun on the floor mat area. I asked if he had a license to carry. He said, ""no"".' It remains unclear whether Snyder knew the case was a sting. All that remains of Mr Khoury's case is a manila court file on an office shelf in the Philadelphia courts building.

"A mother's face swelled to twice its normal size when she had an extreme allergic reaction to a hair dye. Jo Thomson almost lost her sight and even feared for her life as boils erupted all over her body. She said she did the recommended patch test before using the Schwarzkopf Live Color XXL home dye kit in the shade ‘Cosmic Blue’. Scroll down for video . Jo Thomson, 39, saw her face swell to twice the usual size after a terrible allergic reaction to hair dye . The mother-of-three had dyed her hair using a Schwarzkopf XXL Live home dye kit in shade 'Cosmic Blue' But within minutes, ‘it felt like someone had poured petrol over my head, then lit a match – my scalp was red raw and it hurt to even rest against my pillow’. She took an antihistamine and went to bed, but the next morning she awoke to discover she had swollen up and developed oozing boils. Her GP told her she was having a mild allergic reaction, and sent her home with antibiotics to recover. But soon she was unable to open her eyes and her sister took her to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate. Mrs Thomson, 39, was again told the reaction would settle and was sent home to recover. Mrs Thomson, having dyed her hair since her late teens, said had not been worried about the risks - especially as she had performed the patch test manufacturers recommend for safety reasons . But within minutes of applying the dye, her scalp was burning, and by the end of the night she was in agony . She is normally a full-time carer for her husband Paul, 32, but he ended up looking after her as her condition worsened to the point where the skin on her face began to peel off and her eyes glazed over with a thick jelly-like substance. ‘I was almost grateful that I couldn’t see myself,’ said Mrs Thomson, of Margate, who has three children, Tom, 20, William, nine, and Alfie, eight. ‘My children were terrified and ran away from me screaming that I was ugly, like a monster.’ She ‘hid’ at home for a month, before going to an optician who told her that her eyes were ‘peeling like pickled onions’. Within days, the skin on her face began to peel off and her eyes glazed over with a thick jelly substance . She said: 'My children were terrified and ran away from me screaming that I was ugly, like a monster' She was rushed to hospital for an operation to save her sight, and a brain scan and lumbar puncture to drain her spine of toxins, before returning home four days later. Her skin has largely healed, but Mrs Thomson is still scarred, is now colour-blind and suffers from anxiety and agoraphobia that means she is unable to leave her house. ‘It was terrifying,’ she said. ‘All I’d wanted was a new hairdo, but dying my hair almost killed me. ‘It was the worst mistake of my life. I’ll stick to my natural hair colour now.’ Schwarzkopf urged Mrs Thomson to get in touch with the firm, adding: ‘The safety and compatibility of our cosmetic products are a top priority in all of our activities.’ Mrs Thomson was told she was at risk of permanently losing her sight.

"It was one of his first-ever interviews - and it was with the British music sensation Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (TEED), at that. But for Ryan, a 30-year-old amateur interviewer for Byron Bay, his chat with the acclaimed U.K. electronic music producer at a Melbourne music festival at the weekend may have been his last. He said he felt ill when he realised he had left his notes behind which described the artist as 'f***ing boring to interview' and someone who 'just doesn't smile'. And the DJ, real name Orlando Higginbottom, had posted the rude note to his social media accounts. 'My night literally stopped dead in its tracks,' said Ryan, who did not want his last name published. Scroll down for video . Whoops! Ryan (right) interviewed Orlando Higginbottom (left)... but left his notes behind. Awkward: The electronic music producer (pictured) shared the journalist's notes on his Facebook and Instagram pages. Very candid: The brief described him as 'f****** boring to interview' and someone who 'just doesn't smile' The interview brief, given to Ryan by a superior at Blaire Magazine, said: 'Notes: He's English. Loves soccer and living a healthy lifestyle. 'He's f****** boring to interview (or the questions sucked), so you're going to have to be real creative with the questions and just have fun with this one. 'He doesn't give much eye contact at all, so don't be put off. He is listening.He just doesn't smile or something.' Despite the rude remarks, Higginbottom saw the amusing side of the situation. He posted the notes on his Instagram page with the caption: 'One of the funniest things ever to happen to me on tour!! (Don't leave your interview notes behind kids) FYI it's all true.' On tour: The 28-year-old found the notes during his Australian tour. Ryan said the artist was a 'pretty nice guy'. But he admitted it was a challenging interview - and not just because he was nervous. '(There were) a couple of two word answers,' he said. 'He really didn't give too much away.' 'Everyone else was super talkative and wanted to see what I was up to. 'It was kind of hard, and also because I've never really done anything like this.' Despite the musician laughing off the incident, Higginbottom's social media fans were quick to come to his defence, taking aim at the questions he was to be asked. '""He's f****** boring to interview"" they say as they proceed to come up with the most hideously boring questions known to man,' Chris Blondin Allen wrote. 'Sounds like a teedious (sic) interview,' Matt Van Schie agreed. As for Ryan, he said: 'I'm just glad I'm not a proper journalist.' That would not have gone down as well.

"Nigel Farage was in the House of Commons for the first time in 30 years today to see Ukip's first elected MP Douglas Carswell take his seat. Mr Farage hailed swearing in ceremony as an 'emotional' moment for the party. It comes after Mr Carswell trounced the Tories in last week's Clacton by-election, triggered by his defection to Ukip in August. Douglas Carswell was sworn in as Ukip's first ever elected MP in an official ceremony in the House of Commons this afternoon . He was congratulated by the Speaker John Bercow after the swearing in ceremony, in which MPs declare the loyalty to the Crown . Mr Carswell was shepherded into the chamber by former colleagues Zac Goldsmith and Sir Peter Tapsell – known as the 'father of the house' as the longest-serving MP. Arriving at Westminster, Mr Farage said he had not been in the Commons since he was 17 - although he has been to the Lords. Asked if it felt like an emotional moment for the party, he said: 'It does. I think it is a moment. I am here to represent Ukip and the millions of people who we represent.' As an MEP, Mr Farage does not have automatic access to the parliamentary estate, but was allowed in as the guest of two unnamed members of the House of Lords who sat with him in the peers' gallery in the Commons. From Mr Farage's position he looked directly down on Tory MPs – many of whom spotted him and exchanged nods. Before being sworn in, Mr Carswell told journalists he was 'delighted' that Mr Farage would be there. At the ceremony the Tory benches sat in silence, while Labour MPs heckled. Mr Carswell's return to Parliament today comes amid pressure on both the Tories and Labour to see off the growing Ukip threat by coming up with policies to cut immigration. London Mayor Boris Johnson has underlined his calls for Britain to be ready to quit the European Union and demanded curbs on freedom of movement as he made his pitch to win back disaffected voters. Ukip's first elected MP Douglas Carswell was sworn in today . In his regular column for the Daily Telegragh, the Mayor of London wrote: 'It is only reasonable for us to have some kind of further protections - involving points or even quotas, agreed with business - so that we can manage this pressure. 'It would be madness to close our borders to talent; but it is also madness to continue with a system that means we have no idea how many are coming or what burdens they may place on the state. 'Only David Cameron can conceivably deliver those changes, since he is the only leader who can lead reform of the EU. That is the point I hope the kippers (Ukip) will recognise in May next year. And the rest of us should recognise, in turn, that the kippers aren't wicked. They don't hate immigrants; they just hate the lack of control of immigration.' Ed Miliband will face restive backbenchers at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party tonight after his party came within a whisker of losing the Heywood and Middleton by-election. Deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted there was no 'wobble' in the Labour ranks and denied a leadership change would be required despite concerns about how voters view the party. Mr Farage has said Ukip would prop up a minority Conservative government if the Tories agreed to a swift and fair referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. The Ukip leader accused David Cameron of trying to kick the national vote, planned for 2017 if the Tories win outright next May, 'into the long grass'. The next by-election battle, which will be fought in Rochester and Strood, could lead to either Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband being ousted if their parties are given a further drubbing, he claimed. Pressed on who he would prefer to be prime minister after the general election, Mr Farage told the programme: 'Ask me that after the Rochester by-election because I think there is a possibility that one or both of those leaders may not be leading their parties in to the next general election.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage (centre) was in the Commons this afternoon to see Mr Carswell (right) sworn in as the party's first MP. Fellow Tory defector Mark Reckless (left) is fighting to hold on to his seat in Rochester after standing down . Clacton victor Mr Carswell has insisted the party is on course for victory in the Kent seat being fought by fellow Tory defector Mark Reckless, adding the win would 'fundamentally' change British politics. Recent polling has put the Eurosceptics nine points ahead and Mr Carswell said it 'felt a little bit like Clacton'. He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think things are looking OK there. If we can win there then I think things are looking fundamentally different.'","Farage in Commons for the first time in 30 years to witness ceremony .

"Luis Suarez is hopeful he will be fit to face England at the World Cup after undergoing keyhole surgery on his knee. Uruguay chiefs allege that the Liverpool striker sustained the injury on the final day of the Barclays Premier League season against Newcastle. The 27-year-old gave his nation a scare as he was rushed to hospital for an operation. Stricken: Suarez had to be wheeled out of hospital on Thursday night after his operation . In the spotlight: The Liverpool striker is mobbed by fans as he leaves the hospital . Shock: The news of Suarez's injury came as a big surprise on Thursday morning . Although it is uncertain he will . recover in time for Uruguay’s Group D opener against Costa Rica on June . 14 at the Estadio Castelao, Suarez is convinced he can be fit in time . for the tournament. ‘Thank you all for the support,’ he told La Ovacion in his native Uruguay. ‘I’ll work quietly and very hard in the coming days to be 100 per cent and help my team-mates.’ The . news will come as a relief to the South American nation, who reached . the semi-finals at the last World Cup in South Africa four years ago. Suarez’s mother Sandra Diaz was pleased her son’s surgery was a success. She said: ‘The surgery is over and thank God everything went well. What Luis had wasn’t as serious as we thought.’ Familiar face: Suarez is still a chance to play against his Liverpool team-mates when Uruguay take on England . Media scrum: Press wait outside the hospital where Suarez was being treated on Thursday . Hope of a nation: Uruguay's World Cup chances depend heavily on Suarez . But Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez suggested if Suarez’s recovery went to plan he could return to training in just over a fortnight. ‘We know the surgery was a success and that the injury is not serious. We have to wait and see how he recovers,’ he told Uruguayan newspaper La Ovacion. ‘We had very little time to react and without knowing the extent of the injury, we didn’t want to raise the alarm to the public. ‘These . are injuries that, considering Suarez’s fitness and if the recovery is . good, will not take long for him to return to play. ‘We have to calculate if he will arrive for the first, second of third (group game at the World Cup). ‘We know that normally the recovery period, if all goes well, is around 15 days to return to training. ‘We all know what Luis represents to the national team and more so, considering the great form he was in. Looking up: It was initially thought certain that Suarez would miss the World Cup . ‘Considering how valuable he is to the national team, it is a big concern for us.’ Suarez, who was named the Professional . Footballers’ Association and Football Writers’ Association player of . the year after scoring 31 league goals, is his country’s all-time . leading scorer with 39 in 77 appearances. He . picked up the injury in training and, following the meniscus surgery, . the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the . sidelines. Suarez’s sister . Giovanna said her brother began feeling an uncomfortable pain during his . last Premier League game and it returned during his first day of . training with the Uruguayan national team on Wednesday. Year to remember: Suarez scored an incredible 31 goals in 33 Premier League games last season . However, she believes the Liverpool star will be ready for the World Cup. ‘The problem is that these days he won’t be able to play, and will only be able to do physiotherapy,’ she said. ‘He underwent a magnetic resonance and it came out that he had to undergo surgery. It was that quick.’ On . the injury, an Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The . latest information is that we are deciding what to do, but there are . increased possibilities (involving surgery). Optimistic: Suarez's family are confident he will make the World Cup . ‘I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’ Suarez was checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil. With the final 23-man World Cup squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves Uruguay with very little wriggle room. Any decision to include Suarez - not match fit - would still represent a sizeable risk. Plenty to ponder: Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez will want to give Suarez as long as possible . They won’t be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn’t play his first game for seven weeks. Should Suarez be out for longer, it would heavily impact on Liverpool’s start to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven’t been officially informed. The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar Tabarez’s squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem later in the evening.","Luis Suarez thanks fans for their support after undergoing knee surgery .

"After floods revealed an ancient Roman site in Cumbria, archaeologists are beginning to uncover some of the many treasures buried within. Among the finds at the Papcastle site, in Cockermouth, is a statue of a local deity, believed to have been worshipped as a ‘Fertility Genius.’ The handheld carved figurine is seen holding a patera, a type of bowl, and a cornucopia, also known as a 'horn of plenty' - both seen as ancient symbols of fertility, nourishment and fortune - and it is described as being in ‘amazing’ condition. The ‘Fertility Genius’ statue (pictured) was found on a Roman site in Papcastle, Cockermouth and is said to be in in ‘amazing’ condition. Experts believe the statue is the image of a local deity and is seen holding a patera and cornucopia, both seen as ancient symbols of fertility . There is also an outline of what appears to be an altar, below the hand of the deity. Severe flooding in the Cockermouth region in 2009 revealed traces of significant Roman remains, and experts from Wardell Armstrong Archaeology began investigating shortly after. They uncovered a Roman fort on an area measuring approximately 27,000-square-feet (2,500-square-metres), dating back 1,700 years. The handheld carved figurine is seen holding a patera and a cornucopia, both said to be ancient symbols of fertility. The cornucopia, in particular, is a symbol of food and abundance dating back to the 5th century BC. It is also referred to as the Horn of Plenty and, in Greek mythology, was said to be the horn of a goat that was accidentally broken off when the animal was playing with Zeus. To say sorry, Zeus gave the horn certain powers meaning it could give its owner anything they wished for. It is often pictured full of fruits and flowers and is linked to fertility, fortune and abundance. A patera was a Roman drinking bowl from which ancient people believed they could drink the elixir of life. Frank Giecco, regional manager at Wardell Armstrong Archaeology said: ‘This [find] happens once in a lifetime. ‘You can work in archaeology all your life and never find anything like that. It’s incredible.’ Mr Giecco and his team also discovered two carved head statues - one male and one female. The archaeologists have speculated the male head is wearing what appears to be a Phrygian cap, which suggests it may be Mithras - a god worshipped between the 1st and 4th centuries. It could also be Attis, and if the male head does depict this Greek god, the female could be identified as Cybele. Phrygia was an ancient nation in western Turkey and its gods were worshipped across Europe. In Greece, Cybele was the goddess of nature and fertility, and in Rome she was known as Magna Mater, or Great Mother - both which tie in with the discovery of the fertility statue. A miniature stag and a Roman oil lamp were also discovered in the flood deposits. The dig is being run by Wardell Armstrong Archaeology on behalf of Grampus Heritage and Training as part of the Discovering Derventio project, with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is an ongoing three-and-a-half year project expected to run until the end of 2015.

"Richard Pease, 50, was jailed for eight months for being in charge of a hovercraft while drunk . A hovercraft pilot has been jailed today for being in charge of his passenger vessel while drunk, causing it to have near misses with a tanker and a busy pier. Richard Pease, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to a charge of being master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003. The court heard Pease collapsed at the controls as he failed to steer the craft on to its landing pad at Ryde. Sunyana Sharma, prosecuting, told Isle of Wight Crown Court that the 50-year-old gave a breath test six hours after the incident on June 22 this year which gave a reading of 96mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath - the drink-drive limit is 35mg. The defendant, who has 18 years' experience as a hovercraft pilot, told police that he had been drinking from a bottle which he had not realised contained alcohol in a bid to keep cool and hydrated during two journeys which carried a total of more than 130 people. But the court heard the defendant accepted that once he realised the bottle contained alcohol, he continued to drink from it. Sentencing Pease, Judge Susan Evans QC said: 'It's tragic that someone of your standing and with such an impressive past career should have destroyed all of that in one day. 'It was an appalling breach of your duty. You put yourself in a condition where you were unable to discharge your duty as pilot of a hovercraft and your responsibilities to your passengers, the crew and the other users of the Solent. 'Your actions could have resulted in tragedy but fortunately they did not.' Miss Sharma described how Pease had driven the Hovertravel craft Freedom 90 from Ryde to Southsea, Hampshire, with 95 passengers on board when it failed to reach the landing pad. He then piloted the same craft back across the Solent with 36 passengers on board when his assistant, handling agent John Randles, realised Pease had slowed down in the path of a tanker heading towards Southampton. Mr Sharma said: 'What is normal procedure, if safe to do so, the hovercraft will cross in front of of the tanker and not reduce the speed. Scroll down for video . 'It was noted the defendant did reduce his speed when coming across the front of the tanker, as a result of that observation, he (Mr Randles) asked the defendant if he had noticed the tanker to which he replied 'Yes'. 'At that point the defendant increased his speed and he averted a potential incident.' Miss Sharma then described how Pease started to lose control of the craft as it arrived at Ryde, missing the landing pad and headed towards Ryde Pier. She said that Pease collapsed at the controls and Mr Randles had to take urgent action to take control of the craft. Miss Sharma said: . 'As he was making the approach he failed to take the normal position on the landing pad so the craft would be landed safely. Pease was responsible for operating a Hovercraft like this one on a five-mile journey from Portsmouth to Ryde . Pease narrowly missed busy pier, seen in the background, and then failed to steer into the landing pad at Ryde . 'Ryde Pier is a traditional wooden pier, it carries a passenger train and vehicles and during summer it's very, very busy. 'As the landing was being made, Mr Randles asked the defendant if he was OK, to which the defendant replied that he was. 'The handling agent pointed out to the defendant he wasn't in line with pad as he was supposed to be. The defendant slightly adjusted the control but as he went to take control of the throttle, it appeared his hand slipped, he missed the control and he went to reach for it again. 'Unfortunately the adjustment made wasn't enough and the hovercraft was heading towards the pier rather than towards the pad. Hovertravel provides the fastest way to cross the Solent with a journey of less than 10 minutes. The company operates two hovercrafts and has carried more than 26 million passengers since it opened in 1965. Hovertravel is the world's longest-running commercial hovercraft service and is the only scheduled passenger service in Europe. Modern hovercraft were developed in the 1950s by British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell. They float on a cushion of air allowing them to travel over water and flat land surfaces. The steering of the craft is controlled by rudders, which are located in the slipstream behind each propeller. The captain can also use the propellers to change the direction of the craft. 'Once again the defendant was asked if he was ok, at that point there was no positive response. 'Upon a further question being asked, it was noticed the defendant had drooped and he had gone limp in the chair. 'As there was no response from the defendant, Mr Randles took immediate action and taking control of the hovercraft he landed it safely.' The court was shown CCTV footage showing the hovercraft weaving as it arrived at Ryde and coming to a halt as it headed in the wrong direction away from the landing pad and towards Ryde Pier. The court was told it was at this point that Mr Randles took over the controls and brought it to safety before another pilot came on board to bring it to the landing pad. Pease was taken to hospital by paramedics who noticed his speech was slurred and he was having 'alcohol sweats' and six hours after the crossing, he gave the positive breath test. Judge Evans said: 'Common sense says he didn't drink anything in the hospital and he must have been significantly more affected when he left the craft.' Describing Pease's actions as a 'grave dereliction of duty', Miss Sharma added: 'It's perhaps fortunate there was no serious injury or death from this incident.' Neil Fitzgibben, defending, said that Pease, a married father of two teenage sons, was of impeccable character and with 14,000 hours in charge of a hovercraft, he was Hovertravel's most experienced pilot. Pease collapsed at the controls before reaching Ryde. Pictured, the Hovertravel terminal at Ryde, Isle of Wight . He described how his client had been operating the hovercraft that day in hot conditions in the cabin and had felt unwell and dehydrated. In his lunch break at the pilots' mess in Ryde, he had found an opened bottle of water and had poured orange squash into it to drink when he went back on board to keep himself hydrated, Mr Fitzgibben said. He continued: 'The bottle is in the pilot's mess, it's not unusual for bottles and lost property to make its way into the pilots' mess room. He took the bottle on board. 'The Isle of Wight Festival had only finished a week previously, how it found its way into the mess is not known. 'He was consuming something he didn't know what it was, he should have been aware of what had been consumed. 'Mr Pease is as shocked and surprised as anyone that he was over the limit and secondly by so much.' He added: 'He had in the past sought help for dependency on alcohol when he was a much younger man in the Merchant Navy but I understand he had come to terms with that many years ago.' Mr Fitzgibben continued: 'The effect of what happened that day has brought about a severe bout of depression. He is a man consumed with remorse for what happened.' After the hearing, Miss Sharma confirmed that the sentence did not prohibit him from getting behind the wheel of a car. A Hovertravel spokesman said:'Throughout the court proceedings Hovertravel has co-operated fully with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's investigation. 'Following sentencing today, we can now conclude our own investigation. 'Hovertravel is fully committed to the health and safety of passengers and staff, with a comprehensive set of robust policies and a zero tolerance to alcohol and drugs all endorsed by the MCA.' Neil Cunningham, Maritime and Coastguard Agency Enforcement Officer, said: 'The master of any vessel has a duty of care to their crew and passengers, so to carry out this responsibility whilst under the influence of alcohol is totally irresponsible. 'Mr Pease was clearly not in any fit state to carry out his duties safely. It is incredibly fortunate that no-one was hurt in this case. 'I would like to take this opportunity to praise the quick thinking of a crew member on board the Hovercraft Freedom 90 for safely bringing the craft to a stop in Ryde and also to thank Hovertravel for its cooperation and assistance throughout this investigation.'","Richard Pease, 50, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty at earlier hearing .

"The supermarket chain Aldi has taken one of Roald Dahl's classics off Australian shelves after complaints over the word 'slut' was found in a children's book. Revolting Rhymes, published in 1982, was sold in stores on Wednesday but Aldi confirmed on Thursday that the book has been removed from sale.

Supermarket chain Aldi has taken one of Roald Dahl's classics off Australian shelves after complaints over the word 'slut' was found in Revolting Rhymes . Dahl's take on the Cinderella fairy tale sees Prince Charming decapitate Cinderella's two ugly step sisters' heads and she ends up marrying a jam-maker after she wished to marry a decent man. 'Poor Cindy’s heart was torn to shreds. My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads! How could I marry anyone who does that sort of thing for fun? The Prince cried, ‘Who’s this dirty slut? Off with her nut! Off with her nut!’,' the poem reads. Sydney Morning Herald reports the ban followed after a customer posted on the supermarket’s Facebook on Wednesday that the book had 'an unacceptable word in it for kids' but the comment has since been removed from the page. Aldi replied on Thursday morning on Facebook that: 'This particular book has been removed from sale. If you wish to return the book, you can do so at your local ALDI store.' An Aldi spokeswoman confirmed the book had been removed off shelves after 'comments by a limited number of concerned customers regarding the language used in this particular book.' But other books by the children’s author will continue to be stocked in stores, she said. 'Aldi Australia would like to inform all of our customers that we take the concerns from the community seriously,' she said. The book was sold in stores on Wednesday but Aldi confirmed on Thursday that the book has been removed from sale . Angry customers have taken to the supermarket's Facebook page to express their anger after one of Roald Dahl's classic was pulled off the shelves . Andy Griffiths, the author of Australian children’s classic The Day My Bum Went Psycho told Guardian Australia that 'this is the kind of material that kids love because kids want to go to those darker places and to the icky places, and explore them.' 'One of the best ways to do that is with humour, so that you touch the fearsome, the fearful, the disgusting that we all know is there, and the kids need to have it acknowledged,' he said. 'But with humour you take away the fear from that, it neutralises it and makes it something you can celebrate in a healthy way. 'Parents need to be reassured that it’s OK to read about people being beheaded, particularly if they’re evil, and this is a healthy phase of children’s development. I would say to them, it’s OK if you don’t want your child reading that [Roald Dahl] book, of course you have ultimate say. Another angry customer expressed her feelings after one of Roald Dahl's classic was pulled off the shelves . Following the action, appalled customers took to Aldi's Facebook page to express their disappointment over the decision. Sharon McGuinness said: 'Dear Aldi, you practised censorship yesterday, bowing to the opinions of a small number of people who unfortunately did not appreciate Roald Dahl's humour in his classic 'Revolting Rhymes'. You have also contravened the worldwide policy of 'Freedom To Read'. Now, that's truly revolting! Reinstate the book in all your stores, please!' Anne Ransley said: 'I am a long-term customer of yours. I am thoroughly disgusted that you have seem fit to remove a Roald Dahl book from your stores on the basis of a few complaints from narrow-minded people. The book in fact promotes the merits of good behaviour in children.' Steve Butler said: 'I've never done this before, but i'm using facebook to express my anger at your decision to remove Roald Dahl books from stores - absolute disgrace, you've reacted to the vocal, extreme 0.05%. Absolute shocker of a PR decission whoever was responsible for it, re-stock the books - appologise, learn and move on.' Following the action, appalled customers haven taken to Aldi's Facebook page to express their anger on the decision .","Supermarket chain Aldi has taken one of Roald Dahl's book off Australian shelves after complaints over the word 'slut'

"An entertainment company is suing the estate of Hollywood actress Marylin Monroe over the right to use the dead actress' three dimensional image. Delaware based company Virtual Marilyn LLC claim that they are the federal copyright owner of an 'audiovisual work and character artwork depicting a computer generated virtual actress adopting the persona of Marilyn Monroe'. However, the late actress' estate complains that Virtual Marilyn is 'likely to confuse consumers' and constitutes 'unfair competition'. Marilyn Monroe's estate is being sued by a company over the right to use the actresses 3D persona . The company claims that when Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, her persona rights 'expired' along with her . According to legal papers lodged at the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, the virtual company claims that Marilyn Monroe's 'persona rights' died along with the actress in 1962 and were never owned by her estate. The 13-page court document describes the case as 'conflicting claims to ownership and use of different types of intellectual property rights involving the persona of the deceased human being Marilyn Monroe'. It describes her persona as 'Marilyn Monroe's name, image, likeness, signature and voice'. The case could have massive implications for the estates of other dead celebrities who have failed to register their image rights before the deaths. In 2012 the United States Court of Appeals at the Ninth Circuit ruled that Marilyn Monroe's 'persona rights expired in 1962 when she died'. That same year the United States Copyright Office awarded federal copyright registrations to the company for a 'computer generated virtual actress adopting the persona of Marilyn Monroe' and of 'original computer generated characters adopting the personas of celebrated people'. According to court documents, the Hollywood star is described as 'the deceased human being Marilyn Monroe' The virtual company claims that while she was alive Marilyn Monroe 'never registered any aspect of her persona as a trademark'. The legal papers claim that she never agreed that her persona should be used 'in an exclusive manner that would provide an exclusive monetary profit for her probate estate or heirs'. As part of their claim the company is using several quotes from the actress to support their action. According to the legal documents, Marilyn Monroe said: 'I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else... I am not interested in money. I just want to be wonderful.' The court complaint claims that the actress was so widely photographed by so many different photographers that it would be impossible to claim an exclusive trademark on her image. The company said they wanted the matter to go ahead to a trial by jury.","Firm claims Marilyn Monroe's persona rights 'expired' with her death in 1962 .

"Brendan Rodgers has been rewarded for his outstanding work as Liverpool manager by signing a new contract that will keep him at Anfield for the long-term. Rodgers, who had 12 months plus the option of another year remaining on his old terms, has put pen-to-paper on deal that is believed to keep him on Merseyside until 2018. Liverpool came within two points of winning a first league championship since 1990 and attracted widespread praise for the entertaining brand of football Rodgers got them playing and Fenway Sports Group, the club's American owners, were eager to recognise the impression he has made since arriving from Swansea in June 2012. New deal: Brendan Rodgers has signed a new contract keeping him at Liverpool until 2018 . So near: Rodgers came within a whisker of guiding Liverpool to their first Premier League title in 24 years , only to ultimately lose out to Manchester City . Played 97 Won 54 Drawn 21 Lost 22 Goals For 206 Goals Against 118 (+88) Win Percentage 55.67 . Principal owner John Henry and Chairman Tom Werner jointly said: 'We are very fortunate to have a hugely talented individual leading our football performance and in whom we place our trust to deliver the vision we share for Liverpool Football Club. 'Brendan is at the heart of what we, as an ownership group, are trying to achieve on the pitch. This season has reaffirmed everyone’s belief that we can bring football success to Liverpool and we are all committed to working together to achieve that. 'Players and supporters have made it clear how important Brendan is to our success and so to have him commit to us for the long term is a great boost for everyone going forward.' Philosophy: Rodgers has long-term plans for the club as he aims to restore the glory days to Anfield . Mentor: Rodgers with Raheem Sterling, one of the young players he has helped to bring through into the first team . Brendan Rodgers said: 'I am both . humbled and privileged to be offered the chance to extend my stay at . this great Club. I am very happy to build on the foundations we have . built over the last two years and now we move onto the next phase which I . believe will be as exciting, challenging and rewarding. 'I . would like to place on record my thanks to the players and staff, who . have been absolutely brilliant for me since the day I started at this . great football club. 'I . am grateful to our owners and senior management team who have supported . me and who share my vision of how we can progress on the field. 'Finally, . I must thank the supporters who are at the heart of everything we do . here. I am honoured every day to lead this team and I thank the fans for . their continued support as together we strive to bring success back to . Liverpool Football Club.' Brendan, many congratulations on signing a new contract with Liverpool, how much does it mean to you to put pen to paper on a new deal here?It's a huge privilege for me to manage this club and to have been offered the opportunity to carry on with the work I have been doing over the last couple of years. It leaves me hugely honoured. I'm absolutely delighted to be able to continue what has been a really exciting time for the club. We'll look to move forward again next season and over the coming seasons. Salute: Rodgers celebrates at the final whistle following Liverpool's 3-2 win over Fulham at Craven Cottage, a match in which Steven Gerrard scored a last minute winner . You said that you wanted to wait until the campaign was over before singing - how important was the timing of this announcement for you?It was very important for me. We were talking through the season, but my focus was really on the team and the supporters. I wanted to just make sure we could focus entirely on what we were doing and on the job in hand. Any contract talk we would speak on afterwards. It was important that we tried to finish the season in the highest position we possibly could and that would allow us then to look at speaking about the contract after that. It was always going to be straightforward because I love being at Liverpool. There's still a lot of development in the club for me and it was always going to be straight forward once the season was finished.In terms of your vision for Liverpool, how far do you think the club has progressed since you arrived here in June 2012?I've been very pleased with the culture and the environment that we've created over the last two seasons. That has been key in helping us make the strides that we have. We've got a bunch of players now that are very hungry, who are very committed to helping Liverpool. I take great pride and I trust every single one of the players. They are truly professional in their approach. They dedicate their lives to making Liverpool the very best it can be. So I think the environment that we have created and the culture that we have for learning, for both senior and young players, I've been delighted with. But we'll now move into the next phase. We're into the Champions League. Our dream and goal is to win the Barclays Premier League. That's what we want to do. We've shown this season that we can compete for that. With some new additions in the summer, we believe that we can fight again. The objective for me was to try to get Liverpool established again as one of the leading clubs in European and domestic football and we're on course for that. Teamwork: Rodgers with captain Steven Gerrard (middle) and Raheem Sterling (left) after the win at West Ham . Having tasted the Anfield atmosphere at its finest towards the end of this season, how much are you looking forward to the famous Champions League nights back at Anfield?It's a real exciting time. I've seen the games before and I've been fortunate enough to have been at Anfield on a Champions League occasion and they are truly special occasions. You see the support the players get. We had it in the Europa League, when I sensed a little bit of that atmosphere. Of course, it's a different competition, but when we needed to get the win against Zenit St Petersburg, the supporters that night were incredible. Throughout my time here, in the big games, the supporters really show how passionate they are and they show why they are the great set of supporters that they are. We'll really look forward to it. We know that, in the Champions League, if we can perform well away from home, that in the home games, we're going to be hard to beat because of the supporters and the quality of the team.FSG today expressed their delight at the fact that you have signed a new contract - can you describe how important their support has been since you arrived at Liverpool?That has been key for me because, as a young manager, coming into such a prestigious club, I was going to need that time to implement the ideas that I wanted to. They had shown an inherent belief in my work since the very first day that we spoke. So our relationship is very strong. I'm a great admirer of theirs and their honesty and how they have given me the opportunity to be here. But, as I said, there's a real trust and a real strong relationship between both of us. I'm delighted for them because they put a young man in charge of a great club and they believed in me. One of the big reasons I came to Liverpool was because of them and hopefully they feel vindicated because of the work we have carried out over the last two years. I'm delighted now to be able to carry on that relationship with them. Delight: A handshake for defender Jon Flanagan after the 3-0 win at Old Trafford . What is your plan of action for the summer ahead of the next campaign - will we see new signings?That's the idea. Obviously it's the off-season and we have the World Cup and other various things going on. People need to refresh and have a break because we have a long season ahead next season. But in the meantime, we're still working on signings, the staff behind the scenes, myself, the recruitment team, Ian Ayre - we're all working hard still in terms of looking to get players in. Of course, at the club, where we are now, the signings are complex; they are not all simple signings. But we need to strengthen up the squad and that's something that we're working hard to do over the next number of weeks.Your relationship with the Liverpool supporters seems to have developed into something special, what is your message to them after today's news?First of all, I want to say a big thank you because they have been patient with me as well as the team. Their support for me is vital. They are the greatest supporters in world football. Liverpool supporters know their football and they know they are part of a great institution. I'm just very honoured and privileged every time they sing my name or show me that support out on the street. It's very, very important for me. It gives me great encouragement every day of my life that all the supporters I meet are very complimentary of the work that is going on at the moment. Hopefully now, this contract extension will allow us to develop that relationship even more, because it's a relationship that I want to continue.","Liverpool manager agrees new long-term contract at Anfield .

"Liverpool and Manchester United would have both received more than £70million extra in Premier League TV money had the cash been distributed based on audience. Brendan Rodgers' side collected £97.5m in television money last season, the most in the Premier League, but they would have been in line for £172.3m if the distribution was based on the number of TV viewers - a difference of £74.8m. Manchester United would have received £159.5m if the Premier League split their money more evenly based on UK audience. As it was, United picked up £89.1m, more than £70m less. Scroll down for the full table . Show me the money: Liverpool collected the most in TV revenue, but would have received more . The Premier League TV money distribution is among the most balanced in the world with every club receiving a £52.2m basic payment with the rest of the £1.56billion pot being shared based on final league position and TV appearances. But the system means the top clubs do not receive as much money as they could, as was the case last season when Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United were all at least £29m worse off. Fulham were the team to profit the most from the Premier League's distribution system. The west London club received £63.3m last season but would have only collected £26m, a difference of over £37m, if the money was based on their UK viewers. Difference:  United received over £70m less than they would have if the money was based on viewers . Cash: Manchester City won the Premier League, but still missed out on over £40m . So how did we work this out? First of all, we collected the official viewing figures for the 154 live games on Sky Sports and BT Sport during the 2013-14 season. This data came from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board, BARB (www.barb.co.uk). The average live TV audience was just over a million people and the most watched games all featured big sides playing each other, such as Liverpool v Chelsea (2.704 million) and Manchester United versus Arsenal (2.462m). The least watched games were Crystal Palace v West Ham (251,000) and Norwich v Aston Villa (281,000). How the money was actually distributed... How the money would have been distributed according to audience... Entertaining: Liverpool were on TV 28 times last season and their games received almost 37 million viewers . The ‘big’ clubs like Liverpool and United attract much bigger audiences than the ‘smaller’ clubs and, hence, are televised live more often. After adding up the total amount of viewers for each club, we divided the ‘equal share’ of the Premier League money proportionately according to those viewers. Liverpool, for example, with almost 37 million people watching their games, were awarded £148.9m for their viewing share in addition to the £23.5m their received for finishing second, a total of more than £172m. Cashing in: Fulham received over £37m more than they would have done according to their viewers . Raking it in: Real Madrid and Barcelona dominate the TV money in the Spanish league . Fulham, on the other hand, with just 5.8m viewers all season, were awarded £23.6m plus the £2.5m they were given for a 19th-placed finish, a total of just over £26m. Some people would argue that Liverpool get more viewers because they are on TV many more times than ‘smaller’ clubs like Fulham. And they were on the box a lot more: 28 lives games for Liverpool against eight for Fulham. But then Liverpool’s average audience per game was almost twice that of Fulham. The way the Premier League’s money is distributed is one example of its relative fairness. The big clubs get much less than they arguably deserve based on popularity, but sharing the money more fairly adds to the competitiveness of the league. In nations where clubs negotiate their own TV deals, the big clubs monopolise nearly all the cash, as is the case in Spain with Real Madrid and Barcelona.","Based on Sportsmail study, top clubs in England missed out on tens of millions due to Premier League's TV money distribution system .
If television revenue was distributed more according to audience, Liverpool would have received £172.3m, £74.8m more than they actually got (£97.5m)

"John Barnes rejects the similarities instinctively, as though fearful of the debate becoming trite. Both he and Raheem Sterling were born in Jamaica, played as wingers for England and Liverpool and have borne the nation's hopes for the team's creativity and flair at the World Cup finals. 'We're both from Jamaica and that's about it,' says Barnes dismissively 'He's right-footed and small. I'm left-footed and average size.' However, having established the differences, he warms to his theme. Raheem Sterling . Write caption here . Sterling heads off to Brazil this week where Barnes is the scorer of one of the greatest goals the Maracana Stadium has ever seen - his 35-yard dribble in 1984 in England's 2-0 win. And his 18 minutes in the World Cup quarter-final defeat against Argentina two years later was one the finest substitute appearances by an England player. Almost saving the day for England, Barnes crossed for Gary Lineker to score one goal and set him up for another chance which was agonisingly deflected wide. Yet those were probably two of Barnes's finest moments for England in a career spanning 12 years and which accumulated 79 caps. And they came when he was 22 and 23 years old. At Italia 90, he was injured by the time England produced their best performance abroad at a World Cup, pushing Germany to penalties in the semi-final. So there is an element of almost paternal concern when Barnes pleads for the wider public to be patient with Sterling and to understand that what we see with Liverpool may not be replicated with England in Brazil this summer. 'I still don't want to put so much pressure on him now that he has shown so much quality in the last few months of the season,' said Barnes. Dancing through the defence: John Barnes scored in the 44th minute in the Maracana. Roughly 35 yards from goal on the left wing, he chested down a lofted pass from Mark Hateley before gliding past five defenders on an amazing run. He evaded a last-ditch tackle to guide his right-foot shot from the edge of the six-yard box past helpless keeper Roberto Costa. 'Maybe he is going to be inconsistent because he is young. But in terms of what he did in the last few months of the season, he was probably the best player in England. Not the best English player; the best player in England, the best attacking player in England. 'In terms of the way we play, we both . like to dribble and Raheem has improved a lot of his end product. Now he . doesn't dribble all the time. He plays one-touch or two-touch football. He's able to score, he's able to create. At the start of the season, I . thought his end product wasn't what it should have been, but in the last . three months of the season - not just in terms of his dribbling but in . terms of his goalscoring, his ability to play one-touch, two-touch, his . football awareness - it all improved in a small space of time.' John Barnes's view that England play the wrong way to get the best out of Raheem Sterling seems to be supported by the stats. Sterling is part of a Liverpool side that loves to keep the ball - they boasted a 56 per cent possession rate during last season's Premier League. But England under Roy Hodgson, as Barnes points out, like to play their football in a very different way. Against a poor Peru side on Friday, England managed just 52 per cent possession, while at Euro 2012 they hardly saw the ball at all. During that tournament in Poland and Ukraine, England boasted a risible 39 per cent possession rate - only Greece and Ireland kept the ball less, while eventual champions Spain enjoyed more than 65 per cent. However, Barnes is hesitant to predict great things immediately. 'People threw that at me all the time,' said Barnes. 'You don't do for your country what you do for your club. It's because your country plays completely differently to the way that your club does. 'If you look at the way Sterling plays and the way Liverpool play, England don't play that way. The way England play - not dominating possession - is that going to suit Sterling? Because if you look at England players in the past couple of World Cups, the players who have made the most impact have been the defenders and hard-working midfield players. We play against teams who dominate possession. So it's a war of attrition, backs to the walls, whereby John Terry and Rio Ferdinand and the hard-working midfielders are the ones who are most important. 'We're . talking about looking at all these flair players but are England going . to play that way? England don't normally, as we saw against Germany and . Chile in November. England lost those games, so I would not expect . players to produce what they do for their clubs for their country.' All the most technically gifted Englishmen of the last 30 years . - Barnes, Glenn Hoddle, Chris Waddle, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and . Wayne Rooney - have experienced these frustrations to varying degrees . playing for England. 'All the flair players for England in the past, like Hoddle or Waddle, . were accused of not doing it for their country, because that is not what . the English way is. Now England is changing and is a much more . technical team. Nevertheless, they still don't dominate possession . against the Germans, the French, the Chileans and other South Americans. So how can you get the best out of all these flair players, who need to . have a lot of possession? 'That's . why these players do well for Liverpool, because they need to have a lot . of possession. To then say: ""Because you do that for Liverpool you're . then going to do that for England"" is unfair. 'It's not just against teams such as Italy or Argentina that we concede . possession, We played against Tunisia (in a pre-World Cup friendly in . 1990) and they would have had as much possession, if not more than us, . because that's not how we play. Samba style: England winger John Barnes celebrates his stunning goal against Brazil in 1984 . 'We might beat them because we're strong, we're physical we're good at set pieces and we've got good goalscorers. For players who rely on having a lot of the ball, as Sterling does and Jack Wilshere does - all of these attacking players we have - if England aren't going to play that way to keep the ball more than the opposition, are we going to see the best of them? 'That's why Steven Gerrard is going to be very important because, in defensive midfield, he will have a lot of work to do. Hopefully England can get the balance right. 'But the team reflects the manager. Is Roy Hodgson that type of manager, to say: ""Let's keep the ball for 50 passes in the back four?"" I don't think so. So regardless of what players you have, the team has to be reflective of the manager and the manager's philosophy. 'Perhaps he's going to play with Ross Barkley, Sterling and Wilshere and all these attacking players and when we get the ball we're just going to keep it for a long time. 'Roy Hodgson hasn't shown us that ever in his career. Even if he has got those players now with England, if that is not the type of manager he is England aren't going to benefit from doing it that way. 'It wouldn't surprise me if James Milner and people like that are very important because of the manager's philosophy of having hard working players who don't rely on possession to be effective. And Danny Welbeck may not have done well for Manchester United, but he's always done well for England in terms of alleviating pressure, working hard, tracking back. Only Roy Hodgson can tell us that.' Hodgson may be about to re-invent his persona in the minds of the public and unveil a free-flowing, attacking team. Or the gap between excited English expectations and the reality on the pitch will yet again provide a chasm of despair.","Barnes says Hodgson’s teams just don’t let flair players flourish .

"Lynsey de Paul left a poignant legacy beyond her lifetime of music, it was revealed yesterday. The singer-songwriter insisted on becoming an organ donor – and three vital organs were immediately matched after her death last week to strangers who might otherwise have died. Before an audience of stars from half a century of showbusiness, her brother John Rubin told her funeral: ‘I am extremely proud to say that even in death, she gave three people the chance of life.’ Miss de Paul, 64, was remembered yesterday by friends and fellow celebrities as her family gathered to say farewell to a musician whose songs became part of the culture of the 1970s and 1980s. Scroll down for video . Esther Rantzen was among the celebrity mourners at the funeral of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul who died at the age of 66 last week . Glam rock Queen Suzi Quatro could be seen making her way out of the service, while dabbing at her eyes. Right, Henry Kelly looks like he's been in the wars . She was accompanied by music producer and songwriter Mike Batt, pictured right . One of her biggest hits – Won’t Somebody Dance With Me – was played as her wicker coffin, adorned with a single red rose, was carried into a packed chapel at Hendon cemetery, close to her North London home. Mr Rubin explained how it came about, reluctantly admitting he played a part. He told the standing-room-only congregation of nearly 200 that as a teenager looking to hit it off with the girls at a dance, he was told by his parents to take Lynsey with him. ‘On arriving I quietly parked my kid sister on a chair at the edge of the dance floor,’ he said. He made sure she had something to eat and drink, he added. ‘But she remained alone at the side of the hall all evening. This profound experience must have left an indelible mark,’ he said with a smile. Miss de Paul died in hospital on October 1 after apparently suffering a brain haemorrhage. ‘Feisty’, ‘glamorous’, ‘vibrant and determined’ were among the words friends chose to pay tribute to a glamorous blonde who had relationships with stars including Sean Connery, Ringo Starr and Dudley Moore; ‘generous, selfless and talented’ to describe a teetotal, non-smoking, animal-loving vegetarian, who lived with a three-legged cat called tripod and fed squirrels and foxes in her garden. The service was held in Hendon, north London, close to where Ms De Paul lived . Actor Tom Conti, who starred in The Dark Knight Rises and Shirley Valentine, was seen at the church . Bruce Welch - rhythm guitarist for The Shadows - also attended the service in Hendon, north London . Her niece Olivia filled the chapel with laughter when she described her aunt as a 4ft 9in firecracker ‘apart from the fact that Lynsey would have insisted she was 5ft-and-a-half’. Those present should not mourn the singer’s death, she said, but ‘celebrate her life’. Among those attending were Pauline Collins and John Anderton, stars of ITV sitcom No Honestly, which used Miss de Paul’s song of the same name as its theme. She also wrote the theme to Hearts of Gold, the BBC series presented by another guest, Esther Rantzen. Among other showbiz friends were former Shadows guitarist Bruce Welch, actors Tom Conti and Shirley Anne Field, and singer-songwriter Suzi Quatro, who wiped a tear from her eye as she walked from the chapel to the grave.

"Ronny Deila has backed penalty row striker John Guidetti as he stressed there would be no cheating permitted at Celtic. The 22-year-old Swede won and scored a controversial spot-kick in Sunday's 4-0 William Hill Scottish Cup win over Hearts at Tynecastle. The Jambos were incensed when referee Willie Collum pointed to the spot after the on-loan Manchester City forward went down in the box following a challenge from defender Brad McKay. Celtic striker John Guidetti goes down in the penalty box after Brad McKay's challenge . It is understood the Scottish Football Association's compliance officer, Tony McGlennan, will not be taking any retrospective action against the Hoops player after viewing footage of the incident. And ahead of the Scottish Premiership game against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night, the Celtic boss contributed his thoughts to the debate. 'Maybe it was not a penalty but it is a long way from there to diving,' he said. 'It looked like he slipped a bit so it is nothing, it is a decision the referee has made. 'Of course I understand the discussion but he didn't do anything wrong.' Asked if Guidetti should have told Collum there had been no contact, the Norwegian replied: 'No, as a player you don't know everything that is happening. 'When you play you play to win and you are so focused on winning. John Guidetti scores from the penalty spot to put Celtic 2-0 ahead against Hearts . 'We don't want cheats, that's an important thing but I don't think he was wanting a penalty. 'Things happen in the game and over a long season it will even out, that's how it is going to be. 'But this situation isn't the reason why we won this game, we had a lot of chances and we deserved to win.' Deila also reiterated his backing of Aleksandar Tonev, whose appeal against his seven-game ban for racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan will be on Thursday. The on-loan Aston Villa winger was found guilty by a Scottish FA judicial panel, on the balance of probability, of 'excessive misconduct by the use of offensive, insulting and abusive language of a racist nature' during a Premiership clash between the two teams in September. 'We have to do everything in our power to get this away from Aleksandar,' said the former Stromsgodset boss. 'We don't believe Aleksandar is a racist. We believe him. 'It is word against word and you can't take it seriously when it is word against word. Celtic are keen to make Guidetti's move to Celtic a permanent one after scoring 11 goals . 'It should be real proof. 'If there is no more proof than word against word then we have to do everything we can to help Aleksandar. 'This is a real serious accusation, very serious, and you have to absolutely know that you are right. 'So I hope he doesn't get judged on word against word.' Efe Ambrose insists the Celtic squad will stand by the Bulgarian regardless of the appeal decision. The Hoops defender said: 'Anything that comes out of the appeal, we will stand by him as a team.' Following their win at Tynecastle, Celtic were drawn away to Dundee in the last 16 of the William Hill Scottish Cup, a tie described by Deila as 'a tough game'. However, the Parkhead boss has plenty of games before the trip to Tayside in February, starting with the visit of Thistle where a victory will take Celtic three points clear of Inverness at the top of the table. He said: 'We have the opportunity to go three points ahead and put pressure on the others. 'We'll do everything we can to make a good performance tomorrow. Hopefully we'll beat Partick.'","Hearts were incensed with penalty award during Scottish Cup tie .

"The app, dubbed Good2Go, allowed users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity . Despite all of its developer's good intentions, an app designed to tackle sexual assault has shut down. Dubbed Good2Go, the app allowed users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity. But to do so, they had to tell the app who they were sleeping with, when they were doing it, and how drunk or sober they were. They were then advised as to whether they could consent to sex. Lee Ann Allman created the app after speaking to her teenage children about sexual assault on American college campuses. However, earlier this week Apple removed it from its App Store citing that its developer guidelines do not allow 'excessively objectionable or crude content.' The firm did not give the exact reasons why the app was pulled. This led to Ms Allman deciding to remove the free app from the Android store, Google Play, and shut down the site completely. Ms Allman told Slate Magazine that, while Apple didn’t provide details about its decision to remove the app, 'they did say it was not deemed to be crude.' She added that she hopes to relaunch the app next year, without the registration steps. It is hoped it will be used by schools to talk about sexual assault and consensual sex. When the app launched, Ms Allman, who also runs Sandton Technologies, said she hoped the technology would help facilitate necessary conversations between sexual partners and encourage them to reflect on their sobriety. Last month, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law requiring all state colleges to adopt a policy of unambiguous, affirmative consent by students engaged in sexual activity. The so-called 'yes means yes' law will be the first in the nation to make affirmative consent language a central tenet of school sexual assault policies, proponents said.

The legislation, passed by the California State Senate in August as part of a nationwide effort to curb sexual assaults on U.S. campuses, defines consent as 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.' It also states that silence and a lack of resistance do not signify consent and that drugs or alcohol do not excuse unwanted sexual activity. The White House has declared sex crimes to be 'epidemic' on U.S. college campuses, with one in five students falling victim to sex assault during their college years. Ms Allman's app was said to have been a direct response to this legislation.

"New York City will come to a standstill tomorrow as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office said it will shut down the entire train and bus system at noon Saturday as Hurricane Irene moves up the east coast. The shutdown will include the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and Access-A-Ride. The last complete system shutdown in New York City was during a 2005 transit union strike. SHUTDOWN: The MTA will shut down the city's subway and bus system at noon Saturday as Hurricane Irene moves up the east coast . In a press conference Friday, Bloomberg warned that service may not be restored in time for the Monday morning commute. He said: 'There is no question that we're going to get hit with some wind and high water that is going to be dangerous.' MTA chairman Jay Walder added : 'I cannot stress enough: please do not wait for the last train, and if you don’t need to travel, please don't.' New Jersey and Philadelphia transit systems followed suit Friday, announcing system shut-offs as well. Like New York, New Jersey Transit and it's PATH service between New York and New Jersey will end at noon Saturday. Bus service will be suspended at 5 pm. New Jersey Governor Christ Christie said: 'ACES and Meadowlands service has already been suspended beginning at noon tomorrow. All rail service will be suspended.' In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said mass transit in the city of brotherly love and its suburbs will halt at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. All aboard: Hurricane Irene is expected to cause headaches for commuters shown lining up today as the storm barrels toward the Northeast . Commute woes: Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned that subway and bus service may not be restored in time for the Monday morning rush hour . You're grounded: Flights across the East Coast will be cancelled causing grid lock for thousands of travellers. This picture, taken on Tueday, shows a NOAA P-3 Orion turboprop, which photographs hurricanes from above, on the tarmac in Tampa, Florida . As Irene swirls in the Atlantic, . Americans have been warned to start preparing for travel chaos up and down the East Coast as airlines . began to cancel flights and get planes out of the way in preparation for . the storm's entrance onto the U.S. mainland. New York officials said most major bridges, including the George Washington and Verrazano, will be closed to all traffic if wind speeds exceed 60 mph. The storm has forced hundreds of flights to be cancelled over this weekend and while those in coastal areas will be immediately affected, delays could ripple across the country. Adding to the transit woes were the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights, as Southwest and American Airlines joined JetBlue in grounding planes. Most of the flights were cancelled from Saturday through Monday, mostly at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and in Boston, Bloomberg reported. American Airlines and its American Eagle affiliate, with an extensive network in the Caribbean, cancelled 126 flights on Thursday. Most were in the Bahamas and south Florida, including Miami, a jumping-off spot for flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Delta Air Lines reported four cancellations yesterday, and United just one. Airlines have already begun allowing travellers . to change flights without paying the usual financial penalties. Even before Irene's arrival, unrelated thunderstorms were causing delays of up to two hours today at major airports in the New York and Washington areas, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.

Hardy soul: Cory Ritz braces himself as a wave bursts onto a pier at the Boynton Beach inlet in Florida on Thursday . The service's CEO, Daniel Baker, predicted that Irene-related cancellations would pick up this afternoon and become significant on Saturday. Irene presents serious challenge. Because major travel hubs such as Washington and New York are in its potential path, flights that are cancelled or delayed there tend to ripple across the country. 'Most everyone expects New York to get hit, so you're obviously not going to leave a lot of planes on the ground in New York, waiting for a problem,' said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines. He said all the airline's flights on Thursday in the Bahamian capital of Nassau were cancelled and there were delays in Miami due to heavy rain. He said the airline would track forecasts before making decisions about cancellations for today. New York grid lock: Rain and dark clouds passed over the Empire State Building. Trains, buses and the subway could all be cancelled this weekend if Irene is too strong . Spanish tourist Noelia Chacon is travelling the East Coast with her husband and son. The family's vacation has been badly affected by the weather. They were evacuated from the Smithsonian in Washington after Tuesday's earthquake and now might limit their New York sightseeing due to Irene. 'We've had an earthquake and a hurricane so far. We'll see what's next,' Ms Chacon said, as rain fogged the windows of the hotel lobby.

"By SINEAD MURPHY FOR MAILONLINE . The Jane Austen Rules: A Classic Guide To Modern Love, by Sinéad Murphy, is out now for £9.99 . A lot has changed since Jane Austen wrote about women's quest to find a perfect match in 19th century Britain. But one fan of the writer believes many of Austen's lessons on love, found in her famous tomes such as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, still ring true today. The Jane Austen Rules: A Classic Guide To Modern Love, by Sinéad Murphy, outlines timeless tips inspired by the famed author. In this extract, she reveals how much of the advice applicable to Regency-era courting is just as relevant to the Tinder generation... Rule One: Be A Woman, Not A Girl . In Persuasion, Austen shows us the womanly fortitude of Anne Elliot is far superior to the girlish shenanigans of Louisa Musgrove. Louisa's flirtation with Captain Wentworth consists of little more than jumping over stiles and off steps so that he might catch her in his arms as a father does his child. But it does not work, either to win his heart or to keep her dignity - little wonder she ends the novel by literally having her head examined! Anne, by contrast, follows her own much more noble course and, in doing so, gives a lesson to us all. We should put away those childish tricks and conduct ourselves as an equal to our man. Rule Two: Find A Man, Not A Guy . There is a particular kind of creature who looks like a man on first encounter but who is, in fact, a very different species. Jane Austen would have called this creature a 'puppy' or a 'coxcomb'; we would likely refer to him as a guy. But however we choose to name him, we should always take care to avoid him! Look at Emma's poor Jane Fairfax, driven almost to distraction by the guy she has agreed to marry. Mr Knightley ends that novel in the hope that Frank Churchill may mature under Jane's guidance, but he is wrong. Boys may grow into men, yes, but guys never do! A new book takes the writings of Austen and applies them to modern-day dating . The book says women should ditch girlish, childish shenanigans - and be wary of men who won't mature . Rule Three: Listen to What They Say . Pride and Prejudice begins with one of the most famous lines in English literature - 'It is a truth universally acknowledged that a young man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife.' The line is dripping with irony, of course. That a young man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife is really no more than a home truth of the sort bandied about between women like Mrs Bennet. And yet - is the young man with the large fortune in this case in want of a wife? Indeed he is! It seems that women like Mrs Bennet - and like your mother and mine - do know a thing or two after all! Time-tested rules are never secret, rather, they are universally acknowledged. 'A well-fitting dress does not secure everything of importance, but it is certainly uplifting, of body and of mind' Rule Four: Dress Up . Jane Austen's England had little of the prudery of the Victorian age, when even the legs of the piano had to be dressed up! But still, her characters were a very long way from our penchant for dressing down. And it's not as if we enjoy a much greater comfort and freedom than Regency women did. On the contrary - by stretching to fit our every shape and size, dressing down has ruined the posture that Regency clothes demanded. Which is important - for, when we straighten our spines, we think more clearly; when we regulate our movements, we feel more in command; and when we hold our head up high, well, we hold our head up high! Perhaps a well-fitting dress does not secure everything of importance, but it is certainly uplifting, of body and of mind. Rule Five: Be Quite Independent . The 'quite' in this rule is what is important, since 'quite' can mean either 'completely' or 'moderately.' Austen means us to be moderately independent, not completely so, and in this she issues a challenge to our modern wont to avoid dependency of any kind. In Emma, Harriet Smith is a warning to us all not to have too little independence, of mind and of means. But in that novel, Jane Fairfax is also a warning to us all, not to have too much independence, of mind and of means. For complete independence of any kind precludes the real, mutual relation that Emma enjoys with Mr Knightley. Try not to have too  little independence of mind and of means - and speak up . Rule Six: Don't Just Sit There, Say Something! 'Sometimes,' write the authors of the modern dating bible 'The Rules', 'men just want to drive in silence without saying a word. Let them. Maybe he's thinking about how he's going to propose to you one day.' But for the Jane Austen woman, the idea of sitting demurely in the passenger seat, not just of the car but of the conversation, is, frankly, offensive! Elizabeth Bennet, for one, would never do any such thing, and sparkles throughout Pride and Prejudice with her lively and witty repartee - 'Tease him, laugh at him' is how she deals with the stand-offish Mr Darcy. Rule Seven: No Girlfriends . Sense and Sensibility's Lucy Steele is a great enthusiast for 'girl-talk'. But 'girl-talk' has that toxic tendency of making us more indifferent to what is real, transporting us to a realm of hyperbole in which nothing much matters - hence Lucy's utter carelessness as to which of the Ferrars brothers she ends up getting married to. Steer clear of 'girl-talk,' says Jane Austen, and keep your romantic analyses for the only one who merits them: your man. Steer clear of 'girl-talk,' says Jane Austen, and keep your romantic analyses for your man . Rule Eight: Prove It . Pride and Prejudice was originally to be called 'First Impressions' because it is all about the dangers of simply going with your gut. Elizabeth forms an early hunch in favour of Mr Wickham and against Mr Darcy and almost loses in love as a result. Thankfully, a little timely detective work proves that she has got the whole thing upside-down. When it comes to love, Austen would have us listen to our heart, of course, but not omit to look at all the facts. Rule Nine: Don't Just Sit There, Do Something! All the rage these days is for 'saying it' - say it with a card; say it with a kiss. But talk is cheap, and what a relationship needs is actions, not words. Take what is one of the most romantic moments in the whole of English literature, when Anne Elliot, exhausted from a long walk but politely declining the offer of a carriage-ride home, is obliged by Captain Wentworth to be assisted into the gig - 'quietly,' 'without a word,' but with his strong arms for support. Is there a reader in all the world whose fibres have not thrilled? Modern women should not only admit that we are looking for something but also expect that we will find it . Rule Ten: Have Great Expectations . One of the very fine things about Regency England was that it had great expectations on women's behalf. When Captain Wentworth is told by his friend Hayter that Louisa Musgrove and her family have formed expectations on the basis of his behaviour towards her, he describes himself as 'hers in honour if she wished it.' We modern women like to pretend that we're not looking for anything, that we have no agenda - almost as if dating a man because we have expectations of marriage and children were as despicable as visiting an invalid because we have expectations of an inheritance! But we would do very well to learn something of the Regency way, and not only admit that we are looking for something, but also expect that we will find it!","New manual applies writings of Jane Austen to modern-day dating .

Wei Chu apparently offered to rent out his girlfriend in a desperate attempt to fund the purchase of one of Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone 6 handsets. He was photographed outside Songjiang University as crowds of interested men gathered around. Seemingly aware that potential customers may want to spend various lengths of time with his partner, Wei Chu's offer is broken into various pricing categories: £1 an hour, £5 per day and £50 per month. According to posters on Weibo, he claimed his girlfriend was a willing participant in the scheme, which was advertised online under the slogan: 'Sharing girlfriend for pocket money.' Happy: Wei Chu claims his 21-year-old girlfriend Xiao Ai (pictured) is a willing participant in the scheme . Sales pitch: Wei Chu was photographed outside Songjiang University as crowds of interested men gathered around. He told them 'no funny business' could take place on dates he suggested focused on dinner or studying . Information: Wei Chu invited passers-by to log on to a nearby wifi network in order to check out images of his girlfriend and read a short biography on her (right).  He is hoping to raising funds to buy the new iPhone 6 (left) Alongside the new keyboards, messaging tools and photo features of iOS 8, Apple has also updated the software's security features. In an open letter to customers, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook announced the firm has changed the way encryption works in iOS 8. As a result the company can no longer bypass a user’s passcode, making it impossible for it to hand over data to law enforcement officers and governments. This is the case, even if a search warrant is served on the firm or customer. These new rules, however, only apply to data stored on the device, locked by a passcode, and Apple will be able to access data stored on iCloud if presented with a warrant for it. And because these new features only apply to iOS 8, data can be extracted where necessary on devices running older versions of the software, from iOS 4 to iOS 7, as has always been the case. Individuals interested in taking up the offer were given a short biography of the man's girlfriend, including details on her height, weight and hobbies. Wei Chu also made clear that the offer was in no way a sexual way - explaining that customers would be given the option to take his girlfriend on dinner or study dates. 'Service items include but are not restricted to: eating together, studying together, saving seats (in libraries/classrooms), three-person dates. Fees generated during dates should be split,' his placard read. Wei Chu's unorthodox entrepreneurship is just one extreme method of raising money to pay for the latest iPhone installment. Earlier this week, a Saudi Arabian man asked his future brother-in-law for an iPhone 6 as a dowry for marrying his sister, according to the International Business Times. Meanwhile, following the launch of the iPhone 5 last year, a Chinese couple were charged with human trafficking after admitting selling three of their newborn babies for £8,000 between 2008 and 2013 in order to pay for luxury items including an iPhone.","Man stood outside Shanghai university offering to 'share' his girlfriend .

"A man who got locked inside a Waterstones and tweeted his predicament has inspired the chain to give customers a chance to spend a night among the shelves. American David Willis creating a storm when he became accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch. Waterstones is now opening its doors for one night only at its biggest store to let bookworms read - then sleep. Waterstones have decided to run the competition of a one-night sleepover after a tourist became trapped inside recently . The winners will have their choice of bedtime reading . Hopefuls must answer the question 'if you were locked in a bookshop overnight what book would you read, and why?' and the winners will be drawn tonight. The eight-storey Piccadilly branch in central London have launched the competition to find ten lucky bookworms to spend Friday night inside the shop after they were swamped by thousands of people who wanted to be locked inside the beloved book stores. Waterstones have teamed up with Airbnb on this remarkable competition which includes free reign to wander the stacks, and a full breakfast in the morning. Rik McShane, Waterstones' retail director said: 'We were overwhelmed by the support on social media for David Willis when he was unfortunately locked in our Trafalgar Square bookshop last Thursday. 'Amidst this however were a great many message from people exclaiming how much they would like to spend the night amidst the books they love. Tourist David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, told followers that he had been locked inside the Waterstones store in Trafalgar Square for at least two hours . 'So we leapt at the chance to give them what they asked for, with the promise that we'd let them out first thing in the morning. ' David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, had been browsing in Waterstones on Trafalgar Square last night when he discovered the shop had been closed and he had been locked in. He then spent two hours inside the darkened store, desperately calling for help, before he was eventually rescued after he used Twitter to alert the world to his predicament. He posted a picture of himself behind shutters inside the darkened store with the message: 'This is me locked inside a Waterstones bookstore in London. 'I was upstairs for 15 minutes and came down to all the lights out and door locked. Been here over an hour now. Supposedly someone is on their way.' In a later post which was retweeted by more than 7,000 people, he wrote: 'Hi Waterstones, I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for two hours now. Please let me out.' When he was finally released, he wrote: 'I'm free.' Twitter users were quick to offer Mr Willis assistance - with some telling him to call police, a few offering him food, and others giving book recommendations to help him pass the time. Before he had been saved, journalist Gaby Hinsliff said: 'Need my bed but can barely sleep till I know the Waterstones One is free. Poor @DWill_. Hope they give him a book token to make up for it.' A one-night stay at the Piccadilly branch of Waterstones will be the prize for one lucky winner . Cry for help: Despite speaking to a security guard and calling police, it was a tweet that got Mr Wills freed . Locked in: American tourist David Willis said on Twitter that he was upstairs at the Waterstones branch in London's Trafalgar Square for 15 minutes before coming down to find all the lights out and the doors locked .

And web developer Tim Archer said: '@DWill_ @Waterstones tell them you'll be randomly moving the books until you are released, that should speed them up a bit.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called at around 9.35pm 'by a man claiming to be locked inside a shop'. He added: 'Officers attended and following the arrival of a key holder the man left the building shortly after 11pm.' The Waterstones website says the Trafalgar Square store closes at 9pm. The book retailer posted a message on its Twitter feed saying: 'We're pleased to announce that [Mr Willis] is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets.'

"Sunday's World Cup final between Germany and Argentina has left many England fans struggling to know who to support - if any team at all. The two football giants have grown to be England's greatest rivals on the international stage - inflicting a series of bitter World Cup defeats on the country's finest since 1966. But for David Cameron the choice is easy - Deutschland uber alles. The Prime Minister will cheer on the old enemy over the  Argentines this weekend, senior Downing Street sources told MailOnline. The Prime Minister celebrated Chelsea's 2012 Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in  the Laurel Cabin conference room during the G8 Summit at Camp David, in Maryland in the US . Mr Cameron  hugged Mrs Merkel after the penalty shoot out - won by the west London team at Bayern's stadium in Munich . Mr Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in last night's crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark Rutte 'furiously'. But after the Dutch crashed out in a penalty shoot out, Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans. Mr Cameron hopes his support for Germany will help smoothe his relationship with the country's Chancellor Angela Merkel and help land the UK a plumb job at the European Commission. The Prime Minister has been struck at how closely Mrs Merkel follows German football - even at global summits with other world leaders. A senior Downing Street source revealed how Mrs Merkel had to be asked to turn down her iPad at last month's EU summit in Ypres . The Chancellor was watching the Germany versus USA group stage match on her tablet in front of other EU leaders. Before Chelsea's 2012 win, Mr Cameron was forced to watch as England were humiliated by Germany in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The pair watched the game - which England lost 4-1 - at the G20 summit in Toronto, Canada . A source told MailOnline: 'She was watching it on her iPad but had not plugged in her earphones, so the sound was coming out. The Polish prime minister had to ask her to turn it down.' Mrs Merkel had earlier travelled to Brazil to watch the Germans destroy Portugal 4-0 in the team's opening game of the World Cup. She was pictured jumping for joy in the stands, before celebrating with the team in the dressing room afterwards. Chancellor Merkel was in the stands for Germany's 4-0 thumping of Portugal in the country's opening game of the World Cup . After the game, Mrs Merkel was pictured celebrating with the German team in their dressing room at the Fonte Nova Arena in Salvador, Brazil . Germany's Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski even posted a happy selfie with the Germany's leader following the drubbing of Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal. The 59-year-old football fan threw her arms aloft in celebration as she watched the outstanding Die Mannschaft from the stands in Salvador. Dignitaries around her - which included former France star and current Uefa chief Michael Platini - were more controlled. Unlike Mrs Merkel, the Prime Minister is not known as a big football fan - although he supports Aston Villa because his uncle Sir William Dugdale was the club's former chairman who took him to the first ever game when he was aged 13.

"Nasa has announced that the last six months were the warmest on record since 1880. April, May, June and August were each hotter than they have ever been before, while the month of July was the fourth-warmest it has ever been. The findings, experts claim, suggest that the current period is the warmest ever experienced by human civilisation. Scroll down for video . Washington DC-based Nasa says April to Sept was hottest on record. Their findings were backed up by the National Climatic Data Center. In this animation the deviation of global temperatures away from the average temperature are revealed, with blue being below average and red above average, for each month. Credit: Nasa . The research, reported by Slate, reveals how April was the first month in more than 800,000 years that atmospheric carbon dioxide reached 400 parts per million. April - Hottest on record, 0.77°C (1.39°F) above the 20th century average of 13.7°C (56.7°F). May - Hottest on record, 0.74°C (1.33°F) above the 20th century average of 14.8°C (58.6°F) June - Hottest on record, 0.72°C (1.30°F) above the 20th century average of 15.5°C (59.9°F) July - Fourth hottest on record, 0.64°C (1.15°F) above the 20th century average of 15.8°C (60.4°F) August - Hottest on record, 0.75°C (1.35°F) above the 20th century average of 15.6°C (60.1°F) September - NCDC to publish its results soon. A separate record of global temperatures by the National Climatic Data Center matched up to Nasa’s on how the planet is warming. June, for example, was found to be 0.72°C (1.3°F) above the 20th century average of 15.5°C (59.9°F) - the highest on record. For August, the surface temperature reached 16.35C (61.45F), above the 20th century average of 15.6C (60.1F). September, meanwhile, was found to be 0.8°C (1.4°F) above the 1951 to 1980 average, breaking a previous record in 2005 according to Nasa. ‘If we continue a consistent departure from average for the rest of 2014, we will edge out 2010 as the warmest year on record,’ said NCDC climatologist Dr Jake Crouch. Dr Crouch said that if the rest of the months this year are merely in the top five warmest - which is quite likely - then 2014 will rank as the warmest year on record. This table shows how, year-on-year, temperatures continue to increase. For 2014 April, May, June and August were hotter than they have ever been. July was the fourth warmest it has been since 1880. It is the hottest middle six months of a year since record began, and it's likely that 2014 will rank as the hottest year on record . The findings come as a 'mega-drought' continues to plague the US West Coast. On 19 Aug 2014 Lake Mead near Las Vegas, Nevada (shown) dropped to it's lowest water level ever as the 14 year drought continued throughout the US. The drought is clearly visible with the white rock exposed on the side of the mountains . It was ocean temperatures that were found to be particularly warm in the latest findings. By comparison surface temperatures in the US, Europe, Central Asia and Australia were near average. But the latest findings come as several states in the Western US continue to experience a 'mega-drought' - and scientists in California have warned it could last a century. The warnings come after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. Itis thought that later this year El Niño will also contribute to global temperatures, with the Noaa’s Climate Prediction Center saying there is a 60 to 65 per cent chance of at least a weak El Niño developing in autumn or winter. However it is not thought this will be enough to end the drought that is currently plaguing the US West Coast, despite it being expected to bring more rain.","Washington DC-based Nasa says April to Sept was hottest on record .

"The captain of a South Korean ferry that capsized in April killing about 300 people, most of them school children, has apologised for abandoning the ship. Lee Joon-seok is accused of jumping the ferry after telling hundreds of passengers to stay in their cabins, resulting in one of South Korea’s worst maritime disasters in history. The 68-year-old has apologised in court for his failure to rescue passengers, saying he 'never had any intent to kill.’ Apology: Lee Joon-Seok, centre, captain of South Korean ferry Sewol, has apologised for abandoning the ship when it sank at sea off Jindo, taking 304 people, mostly high school students, with it . ‘I have committed a grave crime. I am sorry,’ Lee told local news on Wednesday . Anger and grief gripped the nation after the disaster, and President Park Geun-hye's government was heavily criticised for what was seen as a botched rescue operation. The overloaded ferry Sewol had capsized while making a turn on a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju. The victims totalled 304 people killed or missing. Lee was among 15 crew members accused of abandoning the sharply listing ferry after telling the passengers to stay put in their cabins. Four, including the captain face homicide charges. Lee has denied any intent to kill. The rest face lesser charges, including negligence. Disaster: The ferry was on its way to Jeju island from Incheon, when it sank on April 16 this year . ‘I know I can't get out of the prison no matter how much my lawyer and God help me. But I can't have my children and grandchildren called a murderer's family,’ Lee said. ‘I have never had any intent to kill.’ Video footage of the crew abandoning the vessel after instructing the passengers, mostly teenagers, to remain in their cabins caused outrage across South Korea. Some crew drank beer while waiting for rescue, one of them told a court, in an admission that fuelled greater anger at their conduct during a critical time during the disaster. The court is expected to rule in November. In the wake of the disaster, South Korean police launched the country's largest-ever manhunt for Yoo Byung-un, the head of the family that owned the ferry operator, and his family and associates. Yoo was wanted on charges including embezzlement and negligence that prosecutors contend contributed to the disaster. Yoo was found dead in a plum orchard in June, but his body was not identified for more than a month, despite being the focus of a nationwide search. Forensics have failed to identify the cause of death. Kim Hye-kyung, a close aide of Yoo, was captured in the United States on charges of embezzlement and brought back to Korean authorities on Tuesday. Prosecutors view Kim as a key person managing Yoo's funds. Prosecutors sought on Thursday a four-year prison sentence for Yoo's first son, according to local media. His second son is still at large.","More than 300 people died in the ferry disaster in South Korea in April .

"A pilot who was stressed about being demoted made a series of errors that forced a holiday jet to make an emergency landing, a report has revealed. On a packed Thomas Cook flight from Fuerteventura to Newcastle, a fault with the wing flaps saw the plane divert to land at Manchester, with critical fuel levels which could have put passengers in danger. The plane eventually landed with just 900kg of fuel left. The jet should have had 1,627kg of 'final reserve,' as indicated in the Air Accident Investigation Branch's report. Scroll down for video . The Boeing 757 was diverted from Newcastle to Manchester, and landed with dangerously low fuel levels . The extra 20 miles lowered the fuel to dangerous levels, when the pilot could have landed the Boeing 757 at Edinburgh, which was closer, or back to Newcastle once the problem was corrected. The operator’s report proposed the following actions: . The report found that the 56-year-old pilot was worried about his career, as he was expecting to suffer a demotion. 'The commander was affected by the major re-organisation that was taking place in the company,' reads the report. 'He tried to put worries about his pending demotion to one side when he was at work but inevitably these still intruded into his mind. 'Without this distraction he may have been able to pace the crew actions more effectively. 'The direct effect for him was that he had been told that he would be one of several captains who would be demoted to first officer … and that his salary would reduce significantly.' It was discovered that neither the pilot or the co-pilot had flown on low fuel before, and they had not correctly issued a Mayday call at the earliest opportunity. On approaching Newcastle in August 2013, the plane was ordered to do a go-around' and land at a different runway to the one scheduled, but a problem with a wing flap saw the crew decide to head to Manchester for a 'longer runway.' Following this decision, a series of errors were made, basic checks weren't carried out correctly, and the aeroplane's extra journey would have obviously brought the fuel down to a dangerous level. 'Pilot type rating training as well as recurrent training is designed to ensure that pilots understand aircraft systems and are familiar with QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) checklists,' the report continues. 'This crew had difficulty applying their knowledge in an unexpected situation and did not use the QRH correctly. The checklists should have been run to completion, despite the interruptions. 'The low and imbalanced fuel state which developed could have had serious implications,' adds the report. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told Mail Online: 'As a result of the AAIB’s and our own internal investigation, we have completely reviewed pilot training for go-around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control. The aircraft landed safely at Manchester Airport. The flight path of the Thomas Cook plane - yet it was the journey from Newcastle to Manchester that saw the 'dangerous' fuel level reached . The Thomas Cook aeroplane landed at Manchester, when Edinburgh would have saved more fuel . The pilot decided not to land at Newcastle Airport, and instead go to another with a 'longer runway' 'At the time of the incident, proposed demotions were entirely due to the requirement to balance our number of captains and manage our costs in light of a significant surplus. 'Due to the subsequent review of our fleet and new aircraft and routes, we have now been able to reverse almost all of the demotions ahead of 2015.'","Boeing 757  forced into emergency landing at Manchester .

"Lyft operators hit the beach and burned their pink mustaches in protest of the company after it cut rates in September. Southern California drivers claimed that some were already struggling to make minimum wage before the company dropped fares a third time make rides more affordable for consumers. Vice was in Southern California with the organizers, who brought the mustaches they hang on the front of their cars in order to burn them in protest. Fiery: Lyft drivers removed the pink mustaches from their cars and tossed them in a bonfire aimed at protesting recent fare cuts . In spite of protesters toting pizza and beer, the mood on the beach was dour. The drivers, who did not share their names with Vice, admitted that most of those who still worked with Lyft were also driving for Uber on the side as a way to make a living. Some were hoping that with the situation deteriorating, Uber would acquire Lyft, believing that the bigger ride-sharing startup would raise wages once their competitor was swallowed up. What appealed to many riders was the culture at Lyft, which used the slogan 'your friend with a car' and encouraged to socialize with passengers. 'Lyft is a real community — with both the drivers and riders being inherently social — making real friendships and saving money,' Scott Weiss, a partner at venture capital investors Andreessen Horowitz, once wrote. Driver frustration with the company blew up late last month when another fare cut was announced via email. 'To keep phones buzzing with requests, we're testing 10% lower prices in Los Angeles starting today,' the message read. Many drivers had started on a guaranteed rate of $18 an hour, which converted over to a commission split with Lyft after a few months. Drivers have lately seen their fares cut to levels that made it difficult to earn minimum wage. So the drivers toted their shaggy, pink mustaches to the beach, set a fire pit ablaze with lighter fluid and torched a few symbolic 'staches. The protest comes at a time of a backlash against ride-sharing companies. The Chronicle reported that Lyft Plus drivers were lured by the promise of high returns to buy $34,000 luxury SUVs before the company scaled back the program, angering operators. The last year has also seen drivers protest against Uber in New York, San Francisco and Santa Monica.","Operators gathered on a Southern California beach for a protest against Lyft a week after the company cut Los Angeles drivers' rates by 10 percent .

"Arsenal will hand Arsene Wenger a £24m contract and £100m transfer kitty in the next 72 hours after he ended the club’s nine-year trophy drought. Sportsmail understands Wenger’s will sign a three-year deal worth in the region of £8million-per-season in wages. And he will be given the biggest transfer budget in Arsenal history to help him win the Premier League title for the first time since 2004. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moments of brilliance from Benzema and Bender . Finally: Arsene Wenger proudly holds aloft the FA Cup, won by beating Hull after extra-time at Wembley . The Red Sea: Thousands of fans turned out to celebrate Arsenal's first silverware in nine years . Wenger has been re-invigorated after watching his team beat Hull City in Saturday’s FA Cup final - the fifth time he has lifted the trophy as Arsenal boss - and will now stay at the Emirates. Asked if the new deal would be signed soon, he said: ‘Yes - because I go to Brazil on June 10.’ The length of the deal is viewed as a significant statement of unwavering support from the club’s hierarchy. And they will also give Wenger the all clear to go on an unprecedented spending spree this summer to ensure the club build upon their FA Cup success. Wenger will have £100m to spend on transfers and wages. His priority is to convince full-back Bacary Sagna and keeper Lukasz Fabianski to stay at the club, but the Arsenal manager has also identified three key areas to strengthen this summer. He wants a new striker, a holding centre-midfielder and a right-back. Hitman: Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema (centre) remains a top target for Arsenal . Combative: Wenger is also taking a keen interest in Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender (right) Up front: Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic is likely to be up for grabs, with Arsenal interested . Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema are among Wenger’s top striker targets. Bayer Leverkusen’s Lars Bender and Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin are midfielders who have been watched extensively by the Gunners scouts, while Toulouse’s Serge Aurier, Southampton’s Calum Chambers and Manchester City’s Micah Richards are right-back options should Sagna depart. Wenger said: ‘First we have to wait for Sagna and see what he will do - also Fabianski. After we have to bring in two to three players to strengthen the squad, that’s for sure. ‘Unfortunately everywhere we go there are many teams on the market at the moment.’ Sagna’s contract expires next month and he will hold talks with Manchester City this week over a four-year deal worth at least £100,000-per-week. However, as MailOnline exclusively revealed on Saturday, Manchester United are keen to hijack City’s move for the right-back.

They never say what you have done. ‘I believe as well that the quality of the club is its consistency. The special players help you to win trophies, but the quality of consistency is important for a club. ‘And on that front, we’ve been better than everybody. There are only two clubs in Europe who have qualified for the Champions League for 17 seasons consecutively. ‘That consistency demands special values inside the club. I work seven days a week because I want to win. It’s difficult. ‘Unfortunately you don’t win on command. Our job is very easy when we win things. When we don’t win, we need some strength to continue to grow. ‘Some clubs haven’t won a trophy for 20 years and they don’t get that question. ‘This is my 14th cup final and I fight very hard to win, doing everything every day of my life to try to win. If I don’t manage to do it, it’s not because of a lack of commitment. I try my best.’ In action: Wenger is also keeping tabs on Manchester City stalwart Micah Richards, who will leave the Etihad .","Wenger set to sign new deal after winning Gunners the FA Cup .

"An NHS hospital trust has banned reception staff from having a cup of tea at their desk because it makes them look like they might be slacking off from work . Bosses of Leicester’s three hospitals have brought in a ban on hot and cold drinks after complaints from patients who were already 'inflamed' about long waiting times. But the move has been criticised as 'draconian' by patients at Leicester Royal Infirmary and Glenfield and Leicester General Hospitals - and even the trust admits it could prove counter-productive by encouraging workers to take more frequent breaks from their desks. Hospital bosses in Leciester have banned reception staff, including those at Glenfield Hospital, from having drinks at their desk because it makes them look like 'they're not working hard enough' Michelle Scowen, matron for clinical support and imaging, announced the change in an email to staff. She said it will no longer be permitted for staff to have drinks in the reception areas of the clinics. She added: 'Clearly this activity has given the wrong impression to staff and the public that clinic staff are not working as hard as they might be. 'Members of the public are frustrated by long waiting times during clinics and for appointments and are inflamed by seeing members of staff enjoying hot and cold drinks at the reception desks.' However, staff will be allowed to have hot and cold drinks in kitchens across the departments, the Leicester Mercury reports. Bosses of Leicester’s three hospitals said they brought in the rules after complaints from patients who were already 'inflamed' about long waiting times . A clinic co-ordinator told the paper: 'We are often in work at 7.30-8am organising notes for the clinics which start at about 8.30am and we often don’t get time to take a break until about 1pm as clinics over-run. 'It is just wrong that we can’t have a drink in that time.' Health campaigner Zuffar Haq added: 'This is a ridiculous and draconian measure.' A spokesman for Leicester’s hospitals told MailOnline the decision had been taken after complaints from both other staff and patients. He said: 'We made the decision to stop allowing staff to drink in patient areas following feedback from our patients and other staff. 'They told us that it gives a bad impression. 'Having said that, our clinic co-ordinators have expressed concern that the new rules will result in unmanned reception desks, which would also give a poor impression. 'So we will be working with our colleagues to see if we can identify an appropriate solution.'","Staff at Leicester's hospitals have been banned from drinking at reception .

"Intervention: Ed Miliband has said he is prepared to get involved across British industry if he becomes Prime Minister . Ed Miliband has revealed he is prepared to launch state intervention across British industry if he becomes prime minister. The Labour leader said he would intervene in markets across the economy if he thinks it is justified following his pledge to freeze energy bills if he wins the 2015 election. Mr Miliband, who has boasted that he is ushering in a return of Socialism, said he wants to ‘make markets work in the public interest’. Asked whether he is prepared to take more action in other markets, he told Radio 5 Live: ‘Yes, we will be doing more to show the difference a Labour government would make. ‘We will tackle the cost of living crisis and one of the ways we’ll do it is by making markets work in the public interest.’ The centrepiece of Mr Miliband’s speech at the Labour Party conference was to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins power. But critics say the energy companies will simply ramp up prices as soon as the freeze is over, passing on even higher bills to customers. The Labour leader is understood to be considering moves to force water companies to introduce ‘social tarrifs’ to help poorer families pay their bills. Mr Miliband said: ‘Labour was right in the 1990s to say we want dynamic markets but when competition fails, you’ve got to make sure that the rules are right. ‘What’s happening in energy is the rules aren’t working; the rules of the market aren’t working and that’s why we’ve said we’ll have the price freeze if we win the election until 2017. We’re willing to take on the strong, the powerful interests in our society, if it’s required to ensure that we tackle the cost of living crisis.’ The Tories will seek to recast themselves as the friend of cash strapped voters this week when Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announces plans on Wednesday to help hard-pressed train commuters. Help: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is to make an announcement  to aid hard-pressed commuters this week . His department has already announced plans to ensure that ticket pricing is fairer, with a single costing half of a double ticket and plans for new flexible season tickets for part-time workers. The Tories are also examining plans to do more to tackle soaring water bills in a bid to win the initiative back from Labour. The latest research shows that water bills with four of the biggest companies have risen by a third since 2007-08, while investment to stop leaks has fallen, according to the report by Tory MP Charlie Elphicke which has been sent to Chancellor George Osborne. Energy firms are hoarding £1.2billion of customers’ money every year, allowing them to rake in millions in interest. More than half of British households pay bills by direct debit, meaning that charges are often overestimated in summer when usage use is lower, said regulator Ofgem.","Mr Miliband  says he wants to 'make markets work in the public interest'

"West Ham have joined the race to sign free agent midfielder Gareth Barry. The 33-year-old has offers from Everton and Arsenal but the Upton Park club are trying to improved terms over a two-year deal. Everton have offered Barry around £50,000 a week while Arsenal's is similar but Barry knows his playing opportunities would be more limited at The Emirates. West Ham are looking to push closer to £65,000 a week and would offer regular football. Wanted: Gareth Barry (right) has been offered deals by Everton, Arsenal and now West Ham . Barry has been a roaring success at Goodison Park in his anchor midfield role and Roberto Martinez wants him to continue aiding the younger players in the squad to develop. However, their concern that Barry could move elsewhere is reflected in the fact they are exploring potential deals with other players. Van Gaal's Manchester United revolution: New manager could splash £10m on Schweinsteiger (and FOUR Holland stars) after calling off pursuit of Kroos and Fabregas . Chelsea line up sensational move for Shaw... but can Mourinho hijack United's £27m deal? West Ham are understood to be considering bringing in former Everton chief scout Tony Henry as part of a revamp on recruitment. Henry used to work as an agent with Paul Stretford's Formation Group and helped Jorge Mendes to establish links in England. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is also interested in Joleon Lescott and is looking at a possible deal for Martin Olsson at Norwich. He will find out later today if Mauro Zarate has signed his three-year contract after arriving to finalise his move from from Velez Sarsfield. Chelsea's Demba Ba is still of interest to West Ham although he has an offer from Besiktas. Juventus have made a rival offer for Arsenal target Antoine Griezmann. The French winger has several admirers including Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool but Arsenal are understood to have followed up interest with an £18million bid for Real Sociedad's star performer who scored 20 goals last season. Juventus have opened talks with Real Sociedad sporting director Lorenzo Juarros and president Jokin Aperribay as the Italian champions look to place a bid of their own. Big summer: Antoine Griezmann (right) during France training in Clairefontaine ahead of the World Cup . Benfica and Monaco still want to hold talks with Tom Ince about a potential move. Ince and his father Paul have been in Italy meeting with Inter Milan officials over the 22-year-old's imminent transfer but Benfica and Monaco remain interested in a deal also. They will have a tour of the training ground and facilities before returning home on Tuesday. The pair were caught by Sky Sport Italia at Linate Airport in Milan and Tom said: 'I’m not yet an Inter player, I am very happy in the meantime to stay here for two or three days. Inter are a great team, Italy is a fantastic country, of which I have great memories.' Continental drift: Tom Ince (left) appears to be heading for Europe with several big clubs interested in him . Embellishing his own CV, Tom added: 'It is wonderful to be here aged 22. I’m young, English, I am a winger, a fun player to watch. Inter is changing, there are new young players and new leadership. And they are one of the most important clubs in the world. 'Have I spoken with (president) Thohir? He has told me that there are some changes, he wants to return Inter to greatness, to winning in Italy and in the Champions League, back to the level of this club. It’s great for me.' His father Paul added: 'It’s amazing that Tom is here now aged 22, he was five then. Now I am here for my son, I think you will know everything in a couple of weeks.' Sunderland have expressed an interest in signing Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni. The 35-year-old Argentine is a free agent despite Palace holding initial talks over extending his contract. Gus Poyet is interested having lost Keiren Westwood and Oscar Ustari who is looking to return to football in Spain. Sevilla, meanwhile, are showing interest in Sunderland midfielder Alfred N'Diaye. I'm a survivor: Julian Speroni (centre) in action during of Crystal Palace's successful fight against the drop . Leicester City have expressed an interest in Benfica striker Oscar Cardozo. The 31-year-old has admitted he could leave this summer but the Portuguese champions want around £12million. Benfica representatives are due in London today for talks with interested parties. Leicester want Cardiff's Fraizer Campbell but also want a tall striker who can dominate opposition defenders. They had an interest in 6ft 5ins Lars Veldwijk of Excelsior but Cardozo would represent a ready-made player for the Premier League albeit stretching their budgeted resources. Lokomotiv Moscow and Rubin Kazan have also shown interest in Cardozo. Nottingham Forest are understood to have made an offer for Veldwijk. Ambitious: Top-flight new boys Leicester are weighing up a move for Benfica striker Oscar Cardozo . Australian A League side Perth Glory are showing an interest in former Millwall forward Andy Keogh. The Republic of Ireland international is a free agent as his contract has ended at the New Den. The 28-year-old finished the season on loan at Blackpool and scored some important goals against Nottingham Forest and Wigan that helped the Seasiders stay afloat in the Championship. Perth are looking for a marquee signing to replace striker Shane Smeltz. The 32-year-old New Zealand international who scored against Italy in the last World Cup is leaving for rivals Sydney. Perth boss Kenny Lowe, formerly a midfielder with Hartlepool and Birmingham, was in Cardiff at the weekend among coaches revalidating their Pro licence badges. Manchester City are also looking to recruit for their Australian franchise Melbourne Heart with the likes of QPR and LA Galaxy target Frank Lampard already linked with a two year deal. Newcastle's latest object of affection in France is Nampalys Mendy at Nice. The 21-year-old midfielder left Monaco last summer and stayed in France despite tentative interest from Manchester United. Newcastle scouts have watched several Nice games of late with Mendy continuing to impress during his 36 appearances. Nice to see you: French midfielder Nampalys Mendy (right) has been watched by Newcastle scouts . Manager Alan Pardew has Montpellier's Remy Cabella and Lyon's Clement Grenier among his options for central midfield but is also keen to invest in players who have Premier League experience to help provide better stability in his squad. Lille, meanwhile, want Mapou Yanga-Mwiba while QPR are pondering an offer for Steven Taylor. Seydou Doumbia is still hoping for English clubs to follow up their interest in him. The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international has scored 20 goals in 24 games for CSKA Moscow including two against Manchester City in their Champions League tie in November. Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal all watched him and asked for reports yet the majority of enquiries to his agent Jean Bernard Beytrisson have come from Italian clubs. Atletico Madrid also like him and have asked to be kept informed of any change in his situation but Doumbia's preference would be England. The snag is CSKA are looking for £18million. Eye on England: Seydou Doumbia (right) of CSKA Moscow has ambitions of playing in the Premier League . Sheffield United and Huddersfield are hoping to persuade Yorkshire neighbours Halifax Town to part with goalscoring sensation Lee Gregory. Sportsmail has charted interest in the part-time electrician who scored 30 goals in the Conference last season only for Halifax to miss out on promotion in the play-offs to Cambridge United. Gregory has been watched by over ten clubs this season and is highly valued but is hoping a deal can be reached so he can finally get his crack at league football. Orlando City are considering making an offer for Cowdenbeath striker Kane Hemmings after he impressed in a friendly against Roma on Friday. The 23-year-old, who is out of contract next month, was given permission to play at the eleventh hour by Cowdenbeath after travelling over to look at facilities. Coach Adrian Heath was suitably impressed as Hemmings held his own against top class opposition and was unlucky to have a brilliant goal chalked off for offside. Coventry City have also shown interest in recent weeks for the former Rangers frontman.","Gareth Barry is wanted by host of Premier League clubs but West Ham are ready to trump them with £65,000 a week offer .

"Plastic bags are often bemoaned as a scourge of the environment, polluting the natural world with unwanted litter. But one professor has shown how they don't necessarily need to be viewed so negatively. He placed them under the microscope to reveal the hidden beauty on a tiny scale in the form of colourful blemishes, patterns and more. Professor Bernardo Cesare from Italy has taken microscopic images of plastic bags (shown). By cutting up bags into little pieces he revealed an amazing array of colours in the objects . While these spectacular pictures might look like stained glass windows, they are in fact just everyday plastic bags. Professor Bernardo Cesare, 51, put a stretched fragment of a bag under a microscope as he was curious to see what it would look like. Plastic bags are made of nylon which normally appears black under microscopic images. But when it is deformed, either through industrial processes or by being torn apart as it was by Professor Cesare, it exhibits unpredictable colours under polarised light – when light waves are aligned parallel to each other. Each of the images here shows just a small fragment of plastic bag, often just a few millimeters across. They show what a basic, colourless plastic bag looks like when it goes under the microscope. When zoomed in, the simple plastic carrier displays a stunning array of colourful patterns. Whilst the bag was under the microscope, Professor Cesare shone a polarised light on it to enhance the colours. The colours are created when light is split into its components. When it emerges from the plastic certain wavelengths are interfered with, creating the vivid display. Professor Cesare, who works as a professor of petrology - the study of rocks - and lives in Chirignago, Italy, was told by a friend that plastic bags provide such colourful patterns. This inspired him to create the images and reveal the hidden beauty of these almost universally hated objects. He said: 'They were taken at a friend's home. She owns a microscope because she's a geologist. 'She told me that they provided very colourful images. So I tried. 'I was there just to take artistic pictures, but I have been using a microscope for about 30 years for my research and teaching.' The amazing patterns became apparent when a piece of bag was shone with polarised light. Normally nylon - which the bags are made of - appears stark black when viewed under a microscope. But cutting it up unto millimeter-sized chunks unveils an array of blemishes . Professor Cesare used a stretched fragment of a bag under a microscope as he was curious to see what it would look like . Whilst the bag was under the microscope, Professor Cesare (shown) shone a special polarised light on it to enhance the colours . Professor Cesare said that bags without colour actually create more vivid patterns because light can pass better through them. He said: 'It was a colourless plastic bag. Transparent bags work better than coloured ones. 'Not all types of plastic are photogenic - it depends on the thickness and material. 'Plastic gives a lot of curved edges and continuous variations of colours. 'The colours are ""interference colours"" that form when polarised light passes through transparent matter such as crystals and in this case plastic. 'The colours depend on the thickness of the plastic foil, and on the orientation of the polarised light.' But while the images might seem amazing Professor Cesare says he doesn't have plans to exhibit them in any sort of art exhibit. He merely undertook the project for a bit of fun to reveal the beauty of the humble plastic bag.

"Domestic violence is more prevalent in suburbs with more bottle shops and pubs, a government inquiry has found. The hearing, which was submitted by The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), concluded that the only way to adequately protect women and children is by tackling alcohol abuse. It revealed that over half of all police call outs for domestic violence involve alcohol. The hearing, which comes from The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), found that half of all police call-outs for domestic violence involve alcohol . FARE chief executive Michael Thorn said 'It's important  that alcohol advertising does not promote sexist attitudes,' since the majority of domestic violence is committed by men . Chief Executive of Fare Michael Thorn told Daily Mail 'domestic violence has been an issue on our radar for many years.' Michael Thorn (pictured) says alcohol companies are targeting lower socio-economic neighbourhoods by opening more alcohol there . 'The narrative goes that where alcohol is involved you see higher rates of domestic violence, as well as a greater severity in the attacks.' The results showed that in Melbourne, a 10 per cent increase in liquor stores over the past decade has amounted to a 3.3 per cent increase in family violence rates in the same areas. In Western Australia, violence in homes increased by 26 per cent for every additional 10,000 litres of alcohol sold. 'There are strong socio-economic links. Alcohol companies are targeting the poorer suburbs by opening more liquor outlets there. This is something which urgently needs to be addressed.' Thorn says that advertising and marketing agencies also need to be pressured in order to curb domestic violence. 'Alcohol advertising remains to be very blokey, often broadcast in correlation with sporting events. 'The reality is that domestic violence is a very complex issue with some fundamental gender dimensions.The vast amount of perpetrators are men.

'It's important with this in mind that alcohol advertising does not promote sexist attitudes.' Mr Thorn says that government co-operation is vital in addressing the issue. 'The government should be looking more seriously at preventative measures. I think alcohol treatment and domestic violence services should be working together on the issue. 'Lastly, we need to tighten up on any discounted booze sales. The biggest influence on alcohol abuse is the price, so addressing alcohol tax would have an significant effect also.'

"First came the 3m tall kangaroos which were so big they were unable to hop like their modern-day cousins. Now scientists believe they have discovered womba-saurus, a giant wombat-like creature that was bigger than a small family car. At four metres long and 1.7 metres across the shoulders, the Diprotodon optatum was the largest marsupial of its time, weighing up to 2800 kilograms, when it roamed what is today known as Australia until they were wiped out about 25,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . The hippopotamus-sized wombat, known as the Diprotodon optatum was the largest marsupial, weighing up to 2800 kilograms and lived to be the size of a Mini Cooper vehicle . Scientists believed the beast may have had a short trunk because of the retracted position of the nasal bones, according to Australian Museum. Another prehistoric super-sized creature was the giant marsupial lion, which was found across Australia and were even spotted soon after Europeans settled Down Under. The thylacoleo carnifex had a wide, heavy, short-snouted skull with an extra long shearing tooth, according to Australian Museum. It grew to 1.5 metres long and 75 centimetres at the shoulder and weighed between 90 to 160 kilograms. The giant marsupial lion, called Thylacoleo carnifex had a wide, heavy, short-snouted skull with the longest shearing tooth and could grow up to 1.5 metres long . Scientists revealed new research that kangaroos are descended from giant ten-foot (three metre tall) creatures that were too heavy to hop. Pictured taller than basketballer Shaquille O'Neal who is 2.16 metres tall . News of the giant creatures that roamed ancient Australia comes after scientists revealed new evidence that modern-day kangaroos are descended from giant 3m creatures that were too heavy to hop. It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Professor Christine Janis, from Brown University in Providence, US, said: ‘I don't think they could have gotten that large unless they were walking.’ The team, whose research was published in the journal PLOS One, analysed bones from more than 140 past and present kangaroo and wallaby skeletons, making nearly 100 measurements of each animal. Unlike modern red and grey kangaroos, the giant animals called sthenurine kangaroos lacked specialised features enabling rapid hopping. Their bone structure indicated they had an upright posture and were able to support their weight on one foot at a time. Hop-less! Kangaroos are descended from giant ten-foot (three metres) creatures that were too heavy to hop, new research suggests. An illustration is pictured. Their extinct ancestors strode around the Australian outback 100,000 years ago, walking on two legs . It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback (pictured) Large-bodied sthenurine kangaroos - a now extinct relative to modern-day kangaroos - first appeared in the middle Miocene period and became extinct in the late Pleistocene. They were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs. The largest of these kangaroos weighed around 38 stone (240kg) - almost three times as much as a modern kangaroo. Larger hip and knee joints, as well as more stable ankle joints, meant the large animals were more suited to walking. It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback. The creatures had large hips and knees and stable ankle joints that would have helped them walk on two legs. Their hands were poorly suited for moving on all fours, but adapted for foraging. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback. Using elasticity in the tendons of their large legs to bounce is an effective, low-energy way to move at speed for long periods. But it only remains efficient if body weight remains low. The giant ancient kangaroos would simply have been too heavy, the scientists suggest. Professor Janis said: ‘People often interpret the behaviour of extinct animals as resembling that of the ones known today, but how would we interpret a giraffe or an elephant known only from the fossil record? ‘We need to consider that extinct animals may have been doing something different from any of the living forms, and the bony anatomy provides great clues.’ Whether or not reliance on walking rather than faster and more efficient hopping led to the ancient kangaoroos becoming extinct is unknown. Professor Janis said they may have struggled to elude human hunters, or been unable to migrate far enough to find food as the climate became more arid. In July, scientists from Colorado, Sydney and Burnaby in Canada discovered that a kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. 'We found that when a kangaroo is walking, it uses its tail just like a leg,' said Associate Professor Maxwell Donelan of Simon Fraser University in in Burnaby, Canada. ‘They use it to support, propel and power their motion. In fact, they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs.' 'What we didn't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing. It was pretty darn surprising,’ said Associate Professor Rodger Kram at the University of Colorado Boulder. This summer, scientists discovered that a red kangaroo's tail provides as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. The tail skeleton of a kangaoo is pictured right . Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. When grazing on grass, they move both hind feet forward 'paired limb' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies. 'They appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat,' said Professor Kram. 'But it turns out it is not really that awkward, just weird.' In human movement, the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake, which is not especially efficient, said Professor Kram. Professor Donelan said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg. ‘Their tails have more than 20 vertebrae, taking on the role of our foot, calf, and thigh bones.' The kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders, then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction.","The hippopotamus-sized wombat was the largest marsupial known .

"Commuters would be given a tax break worth hundreds of pounds to cut the cost of season tickets under plans unveiled by Boris Johnson. The London Mayor is urging the government to allow rail, bus and tube passengers to buy passes from pre-tax income, reducing the cost of getting to work. He called on Chancellor George Osborne to back the idea, which would benefit commuters without helping foreign tourists or daytrippers. Plea: London Mayor Boris Johnson is urging the Treasury to offer tax breaks for commuters to buy season tickets to cut the cost of getting to work . Ministers are expected to announce extra help to curb rises in rail fares this week, ahead of inflation-busting increases coming into force from January 1. Some season tickets have risen by more than 80 per cent in the last decade, costing passengers thousands of pounds. Last month Mr Osborne borrowed from supermarket slogans to declare ‘every penny counts’ as he signalled action to reduce energy and water bills, cut rents and limit rises in motoring costs and rail fares. But Mr Johnson today warned against using the ‘hopelessly blunt instrument’ of limiting annual increases in ticket prices. He revealed he is in talks with the Chancellor over offering a tax break on commuters' bus and train fares. Mr Johnson said: 'Employees should be allowed to pay for their season tickets from their pre-tax income.' The idea, similar to the current system of childcare vouchers used by many working families, would see the cost of a season ticket deducted from pay packets before tax and national insurance is taken out. A commuter buying a £784 annual bus pass would save £251 in tax and National Insurance, and their employer would save £108. Travel: Chancellor George Osborne last week announced plans to freeze fuel duty for motorists but is planning to do more for rail passengers in the coming weeks . Mr Johnson believes there is a ‘compelling case’ for the plan to be applied across the country. Mr Johnson said it would be ‘irresponsible’ not to raise fare income sufficiently to pay for the modernisation of London's ageing underground network and cope with a fast-rising population. But a tax relief would target workers' travel costs while a ‘hopelessly blunt’ fare freeze would benefit tourists and casual passengers who did not ‘need or deserve’ help. Mr Johnson: ‘Yes, there would be a cost to the Treasury - but then every year government spends huge sums trying to hold fares down. ‘This scheme strikes me as one George should consider further. You would allow continued investment in transport, and you would target your help at exactly the people who need it - not the millionaires and the tourists and the casual shoppers, but the hardworking people who are really turning the wheels of recovery,’ he wrote in the Telegraph. Mr Johnson said 40 per cent of passengers travelled for nothing - and that there would be mayhem if any attempt was made to strip the ‘affluent bourgeoisie’ of old-age bus passes. ‘The result is that the entire burden of fare-paying is carried by the 60% - and that includes the people who make this country work, the people on low or moderate incomes who travel large distances every day and who to their places of employment and who have absolutely no choice in the matter. ‘It is time we did something specifically to help them, and that something is to give tax relief on travel.’ ‘Employees should be allowed to pay for their season tickets from their pre-tax income.’ The Tories will seek to recast themselves as the friend of cash strapped voters this week when Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announces plans on Wednesday to help hard-pressed train commuters. His department has already announced plans to ensure that ticket pricing is fairer, with a single costing half of a double ticket and plans for new flexible season tickets for part-time workers. Mr Johnson added: ‘If you have to use public transport morning and night, then you know that it can take a huge slice of your income. ‘Every autumn we face the same dilemma. If we follow the pleas of our officials, and raise fares - to cope with inflation and the cost of investing in our systems - then we are tightening the squeeze on people who have already seen their disposable income shrink over the last five years. ‘If we are irresponsible, on the other hand, and we fail to replenish the 'fare box', then we risk disaster.’","London Mayor in talks with Treasury over radical - but expensive - plan .

"Claims: The White House allegedly knew the location of James Foley and other hostages in Syria five weeks before a rescue mission was given the go-ahead . The White House allegedly knew the location of James Foley and other hostages in Syria five weeks before the failed rescue mission was given the go-ahead. According to Fox News, officials from the Obama Administration knew where the journalist, who was beheaded by ISIS, and other British and American hostages were being held in May. However the mission to try and extract them was delayed until early July - prompting questions the set back was unnecessary. The source told the station: 'We had a lot of really good information on where they were being held, very specific information.' They added that hostages were only moved between a handful of locations because they felt the city of Raqqa was so secure. The group of British and American hostages were even said to have been held in one location for three weeks. A former military official also told the station that when the team 'finally did go' they felt the intelligence was 'drying up'. Diane Foley, James' mother, has always believed that there was information about her son's location long before the rescue attempt. She has maintained that the effort came too late, but admits it was a problematic mission because it was dangerous. Foley was killed in a graphic propaganda video released in August by the terrorist organization, which calls itself the Islamic State - but new details from his two years in captivity are still emerging. The 40-year-old from Rochester, New Hampshire, was captured not far from the Syrian border with Turkey in 2012 by a small jihadist group which would later swear fealty to ISIS. Scroll down for video . Following his death, White House counterterrorism adviser told the press: 'The U.S. government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence, and when the opportunity presented itself, the president authorized the Department of Defense to move aggressively to recover our citizens. 'Unfortunately, that mission was ultimately not successful because the hostages were not present.' Foley was killed in a graphic propaganda video released in August by the terrorist organization, which calls itself the Islamic State. Questions have been raised as to why the rescue mission was delayed . National Security Council spokesman Bernadette Meehan told Fox on Monday: 'U.S. forces conducted this operation as soon as the President and his national security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations.' Initially dozens of Western captives were held together, but ISIS began to release those whose governments would pay large ransoms for them. Eventually only Britons and Americans - whose governments refuse to pay out - were left, and the regime grew harsher.","White House allegedly knew about hostage's location in Syria in May .

"Gareth Bale’s £80million price tag when he moved from Tottenham to Real Madrid last summer caused plenty of eyebrows to be raised, and now a new report suggests the Spanish giants paid almost £30m more than the Welshmen is currently worth - even after becoming a Champions League winner. Experts at the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory have placed ‘market values’ on top players from around Europe based on a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience. They calculate that Bale, 24, is worth ‘only’ £50.9m at market rates based on what a buyer should reasonably pay for him if he moved this summer. That is £29.8m LESS than Real Madrid paid for him last summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gareth Bale modelling Real Madrid's new strip . Top man: Gareth Bale won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey in his first season at the Bernabeu . Bad buys: Spurs overpaid for both Roberto Soldado (left) and Erik Lamela, says the CIES report . The CIES report says Bale was the ‘worst recruitment’ from a purely financial perspective last season of any player at a club in the top divisions across England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. Radamel Falcao of Monaco represents the next most over-valued player, ‘worth’ £25.6m less than Monaco paid for him. Tottenham’s Erik Lamela, Manchester United’s Marouane Fellaini, Manchester City’s Fernandinho, Chelsea’s Willian and Tottenham’s Roberto Soldado are all in the top 10 of poor value players when considering fees paid and current worth. ‘The comparison between transfer fees paid by clubs to sign new players at the start or during the 2013-14 season and their current market value allows us to assess the best and worst recruitments from a financial perspective,’ the report’s authors say. ‘The highest “negative gap” was recorded for Gareth Bale (minus €37m, or £29.8m). This finding reflects the fact that Real Madrid clearly paid over the odds to convince Tottenham to release the player.’ Out of sorts: Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini (right) also features on the list, coming in at No 5 . Money is no object: Manchester City overpaid more than £10m for Fernandinho, says the report . The authors say that at the other extreme, the German striker Max Kruse, 26, was the best buy of last summer. ‘The highest positive gap between fee paid and value now was observed for Max Kruse,’ they say. ‘Borussia Monchengladbach signed him for a bargain from Freiburg thanks to the existence of a very low buy-out clause. ‘His current market value is eight times greater than the €2m fee paid one year ago.’ They say that Manchester United’s Adnan Januzaj is the highest value player who made a debut in 2013-14 who cost nothing to their current club because they were produced by the club academy. They rate him as worth £10m. Bargain buy: Max Kruse is a steal at 2m euros, says the report . In control: Adnan Januzaj's value is said to be at the £10m mark .

"The owners of the Manhattan building used as Carrie Bradshaw's apartment for the filming of Sex and the City are outraged after Sarah Jessica Parker staged a photo shoot on their stoop without allegedly asking for permission. A constant stream of SATC fans have led the owners of the West Village building to install a metal chain across the steps that reads 'Do NOT go on staircase please'. While some  wannabe Carries have crossed the chain before to take personal pictures at the TV mecca, the homeowners were shocked SJP herself would violate their privacy. Scroll down for video . Not okay: Sarah Jessica Parker allegedly held an unauthorized photo shoot on the stoop of her character Carrie Bradshaw's Sex and the City apartment . What would Carrie do? A source told the New York Post that the owners of 66 Perry Street did not receive a request to hold the photo shoot from SJP (as Carrie Bradshaw on the left) On October 7, the actress posted pictures to Instagram while shooting an advertising campaign for her Nordstrom shoe line. In one of the pictures, she leans over the metal fence to place colorful stilettos on the famous steps. 'It was take your @sjpcollection shoes to work day. #longdayforCarrie #whewwwwthosesteps #runninginheels #taxi!' Parker wrote. The owners of 66 Perry Street did not immediately return MailOnline's calls for comment on Tuesday, but a source told the New York Post: 'The owners are up in arms as they deal with relentless tourists, and SJP has ignored their requests for an explanation on how she could endorse the shoot, even though ""no trespassing"" signs are posted. Fashion shoot: The actress posted pictures to Instagram on October 7, showing her bending over a metal chain that reads 'Do NOT go on staircase please' and placing shoes from her Nordstrom collection on the steps to be photographed . 'The owners are up in arms as they deal with relentless tourists, and SJP has ignored their requests for an explanation on how she could endorse the shoot, even though ""no trespassing"" signs are posted,' a source told the Post . 'SJP used their house during the years of filming, and now won’t acknowledge that she and her company used the steps and facade, this time without permission, to promote her shoe line,' the source said. It's unclear how this recent breach would impact a rumored third Sex and the City movie in the works. Bradshaw's home might not factor since she was living with Mr Big at the end of the second film. Gerald Banu, president of the Perry Street association, confirmed to the Post that the actress did not ask for permission to stage her shoot and that the Sex and the City hysteria has not died out - even the show finished filming more than 10 years ago. 'The only thing I could suggest to SJP is that when they write the next script, please have Carrie move to a new address,' Mr Banu told the Post. A representative for SJP did not return MailOnline's calls or email Tuesday morning. Trespassing: This Facebook user is just one of the many Sex and the City fans the owners of 66 Perry Street have to deal with crossing their fence and walking all the way up to their door for photo shoots .

"An insecure boy has transformed his figure, his confidence and his love life after taking up weightlifting as a young teenager. After a tough breakup Lou Brierley, 21, from North Wales, put all his focus into training  and before he knew it he was competing at a national level - and turning heads. 'I started working out when I was 16 due to a recent end in a relationship; I needed something to keep me busy and occupied... the gym seemed like a good idea,' he says. After a tough break up in 2010 a 16-yr-old Lou Brierley, 21, from North Wales put his focus into training and before he knew it was competing at a national level - and turning heads. Pictured here aged 16 in 2010 before training started (l) and recently, four stone heavier, aged 21 (r) 'Before I started training I thought I was skinny and didn't really like the appearance that looked back at me in the mirror. 'I was a typical gaming geek. I used to eat microwave meals and drink tonnes of Irn Bru with no real feeding pattern - more than likely between a game on the Xbox. 'I was tall, thin and that was about it. I only weighed about 10 stone, so it was time things changed. 'I quickly got the bug and enjoyed working out more than I thought. I saw progress in my body and this spurred me on even more, wanting to be bigger, leaner and stronger. 'My first bodybuilding competition was 2011, when I had just turned 18. I then competed at a higher level in 2012 and qualified for the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation finals. 'After bodybuilding my focus changed from wanting to be the most aesthetically pleasing to being the strongest I could possibly be. 'I hung up my trunks and pursued powerlifting, in which I again qualified to a national level achieving a 210kg squat and a 240kg deadlift. Lou says being in 'competition condition' became good for catching people's attention . Lou is pictured here in Ibiza 2013, one year after he began bodybuilding competitions, aged 19 . 'My biggest focus at the moment is developing my career and my personal training business, however I hope to make a return to both bodybuilding and powerlifting in the next few years.' And it seems his path to fitness has helped his love life, as he's since bagged a girlfriend. 'Dating wise, being in competition condition was always good for attraction and catching peoples attention - but nothing more. My girlfriend of 16 months, Beth Jones, was actually first attracted to me because I was ""ripped"", so I guess you could say it helped! 'Beth is actually training to be a fitness instructor. She is in college and currently trains with me during the week. We met through friends, then we started training together and then our relationship developed further.' Beth says: 'I remember seeing Lou and I was instantly attracted to him. He was tall, dark, handsome and I loved his six pack! 'There are quite a few positives about working out together. We motivate and support each other to reach our goals. Lou is honest with me about what areas I need to work on. I love training with Lou as each session is enjoyable and he fully supports me in everything I want to achieve. 'I am extremely proud of what Lou has achieved, the biggest thing for me is seeing how much he has grown as a person. His maturity and attitude has changed so much and seeing his transformation is amazing for such a young man too. I know there is a lot more to come out of him and I am with him every step of the way.' But Lou says his biggest support when it comes to competitions is his mother. 'Throughout competition prep she was amazing, she helped prep meals, helped me pull through tough times and even tanned/shaved me the night before the competition. I couldn't have done it without her. Lou's girlfriend of 16 months, Beth Jones, was first attracted to him because he was ""ripped"" 'My health has improved massively and so has my quality of life. 'My outlook on nutrition is completely different - I eat to feel and look good so I don't mind taking longer to plan and prepare meals. 'I truly believe the struggles and dark times I faced during competition prep has shaped who I am today. My mentality and my focus have improved dramatically and I am now a very driven goal-orientated person, before which I was lacking focus, clarity and self-belief.' 'In regards to image I have gone from a small 10 stone, up to 15 stone at my biggest but I tend to carry a weight of around 14 stone year round. 'My whole shape has dramatically changed, as well as the way I view myself. I never believed image was important, but in the job I now lead I feel it is a massive part of building the respect of clients. 'I became a brand ambassador for BodyBuilding Warehouse after entering a social media competition and I'm so grateful to my sponsors for their support, encouragement and inspiration. 'With my shift in mind set and focus I am now set on helping other people transform their lifestyles like I did mine. I would like to compete again as both a powerlifter and a bodybuilder, but for now I am primarily focused on growing my business, The Fitness Academy, and helping others. 'My advice for youngsters wanting to follow in my footsteps would be to learn the basics. 'Get good at the basic movements and ensure you are doing them correctly. Research and ask people who have been there and done what you're trying to achieve and then make your own judgement on what you believe. Nutrition wise, keep things simple, don't over complicate things. For training, exactly the same, don't get caught up in these advanced routines for advanced trainees, just keep it simple, and stick to the basics. They will work.' Jack Lovett a personal trainer and expert in teen fitness from Spartan Performance says starting a structured resistance training programme at 16 is perfectly safe 'provided it is done so under qualified guidance'. The fitness expert, who has trained UFC star Davey Grant, fighter Curt Warburton and Newcastle United's Alex Gilliead since he was 14 years old, says: 'I certainly concur that the confidence-boosting qualities experienced by Lou's are not exclusive to him,' 'Every single youth we have trained at Spartan has benefited both in the gym and out of it. I find training to be incredibly empowering. It does not discriminate. Hard work and dedication is rewarded accordingly.' When prepping for a competition Lou trains four times a week split across the muscle groups . The heaviest I've been is 96kg and my last stage weight was 75kg with a body fat of around 7 or 8 per cent. Competition mode . When I'm in prep I train four times a week split across the muscle groups. It would be chest and shoulders, back and traps, arms, and legs, across a four day time period. A typical training split I use when training for competitions include weight and cardio sessions, training two on, one off and cardio every other day for 20 minutes each session. Off season . Now when in 'off season' mode I train three times a week on a push-pull, legs basis with more of an emphasis on recovery between workouts. It is very much based around compound exercises trying to add as much stress to the body as possible. Rep ranges are often kept between five and eight but sometimes I go as high as 12, depending on exercise and body part. Stretching and foam rollering is very important for me as my hips have taken a beating through powerlifting, so I follow an 11 set routine before I train to make sure my hips are fully ready for training. Supplements . My supplement regime is very consistent, on waking I have a multi vitamin, vitamin D3, omega 3 fish oils, 1 scoop of Warrior Greens superfood blend and one scoop of Warrior Reds superfood blend, this covers all health bases and gives my body a prime platform for growing. During training I used PeptoPro which is a fast digesting protein, alongside cyclic dextrin which is a fast digesting carbohydrate and kick starts my recovery before I've even finished my workout. Diet . I eat plenty of chicken cooked in extra virgin olive oil, steak, spinach, kale, sweet potato, peanut butter, porridge, whey and some white rice. I snack on protein bars and popcorn and drink plenty of coffee (perhaps too much). Those are most of my food choices, and I just vary the quantities. My competition diet consists of higher protein, moderate carbs and low fats. Nutrition is key.","Lou Brierley, 21, from North Wales, added four stone of muscle over 3 years .

"U2 frontman Bono revealed today he has suffered from glaucoma for two decades - hence his permanent sunglasses . Many assumed the dark glasses worn by U2 frontman Bono were a fashion statement. But he has revealed the reason he dons shades is because he has suffered from glaucoma for years. The star said he has suffered the eye condition – which if left untreated can cause vision impairment and even blindness - for around two decades. Until now, people put the singer's ever-present sunglasses – which he even wore indoors – were a rock star affectation. But he explained during a recording of tonight's Graham Norton Show for BBC1 that they are to help with his vision problem. Glaucoma can make the eyes more sensitive to light, causing sufferers to use dark glasses to alleviate difficulties. Presenter Mr Norton asked whether the singer ever removes his shades, to which Bono replied: 'This is a good place to explain to people that I've had glaucoma for the last 20 years. 'I have good treatments and I am going to be fine.' He added: 'You're not going to get this out of your head now and you will be saying ""Ah, poor old blind Bono"". Glaucoma is caused by a build-up of pressure in the eyeball when the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly, which can damage the optic nerve. If left untreated, it can lead to loss of peripheral vision and ultimately complete loss of sight. Early diagnosis can mean further sight deterioration can be prevented - with laser treatment, eye drops and surgery used to stop it worsening - but the damage to the optic nerve cannot be undone. Several things increase the risk of developing glaucoma. Age: Glaucoma becomes much more common as we get older. It is uncommon below the age of 40 but this type of glaucoma affects one per cent of people aged over 40. About five per cent of people over the age of 65 have glaucoma . Race: If you are of African origin you are more at risk of glaucoma. It is also more likely to develop at an earlier age and be more severe . Family: you are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma if you have a close relative who has chronic glaucoma . Short sight: If you are very short sighted you have a higher risk of developing chronic glaucoma . Diabetes: If you have diabetes you have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. For the most common type of glaucoma, there are no noticeable symptoms because the condition develops very slowly. People often do not realise their sight is being damaged because the first part of the eye to be affected is the peripheral vision. Vision is lost from the outer rim of the eye, slowly working inwards towards the centre. The Irish band were on the Graham Norton show to promote their new album, Songs Of Innocence. The song was released commercially this week after previously being given away to half a billion iTunes customers, a controversial move which upset some people who said they did not want it automatically added to their music libraries. Speaking about the furore, Bono told Mr Norton: 'We wanted to do something fresh but it seems some people don't believe in Father Christmas. 'All those people who were uninterested in U2 are now mad at U2. As far as we are concerned, it's an improvement.' Bono revealed that the shades he continually wears help alleviate the symptoms of glaucoma. He is pictured here with Apple CEO Tim Cook during the Apple launch last month .","U2's Bono reveals he wears shades because he has had glaucoma .

"Pack up those barbecue sets and dust off your umbrella and wellies - for summer is officially over and autumn has finally arrived. The sizzling temperatures of September are almost at an end, with weather more typical for this time of the year on the way. It was the warmest September since 2006 and the driest since records began, but forecasters say Britain is set for cooler, wetter and windier weather in October. The start of October will see showers and heavy rain in most places, according to the Met Office, and cooler temperatures with possible frost in parts. For the second half of the month, wet and windy weather is forecast with dry and bright interludes. Scroll down for video . A sea of mist hides farm houses and trees in Chollerford, Northumberland, as tempatures dropped to minus two in some low valleys - the start of October will see showers and heavy rain in most places, according to the Met Office, and cooler temperatures with possible frost in parts . The blanket of fog, from Chollerford, in Northumberland, will become more regular as the temperatures drop in October . During October, forecasters predict it will feel much cooler, especially in the wet and windy spells and there is a risk of fog patches, such as this one, developing . The warm September followed on from the eighth wettest August on record and comes in a generally very wet year - this January to August is the wettest such period in the records, mainly as a result of the very wet start to the year and the wettest winter on record. The dry conditions were caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month. But that is set to make way for blustery and wet weather at the beginning of October, as the dominant areas of high pressure sitting over the UK through September finally give way to Atlantic lows. Tony and Marie Newton, both 65, tend to their autumnal garden in Walsall, West Midlands, for two charity open days on October 25 and 26 .

Since retiring two years ago they devote up to eight hours every day to the upkeep of the Four Seasons Garden . Kirk Waite, from the Met Office, said: 'Today will stay dry and fine for most people and will be another fine and quite warm day. 'But a band of rain will gradually move into Northern Ireland and Scotland tonight and will slowly move in a south easterly direction overnight. 'Much of England and Wales will be dry and clear overnight with a patch of mist and fog. 'Once in to tomorrow, the band of rain will edge south and will reach northern England by tomorrow afternoon, where it could turn quite heavy for a time. Because of that there could be potential disruption through the rush hour period. 'But for the south and east of England it will be a dry and warm day with maximum temperatures of 20 degrees. But that will probably be the last of the fine and dry weather for a while because the band of rain continues to work its way southwards in to Saturday. There is a weather warning in place in Scotland today, the north of England, parts of Northern Ireland and Wales tomorrow and Saturday which could cause disruption .

"New York Mets co-owner Jeff Wilpon has denied sacking the club's first ever female vice president because she had a child out of wedlock. In her lawsuit against the Mets, Leigh Castergine says she was fired in August this year after enduring insults and humiliation from Wilpon, the team's Chief Operating Officer. The 33-year-old claims the businessman told senior executives he was 'morally opposed' to her becoming pregnant while unmarried in August 2013, before dismissing her a year later. But now, Wilpon has denied the claims that he sacked Castergine for the suggested reasons, saying he treated his employee 'without regard to her gender, marital status, pregnancy or leave'. Striking back: New York Mets co-owner Jeff Wilpon (right) has denied sacking Leigh Castergine (left) - the club's first ever female vice president and ex-ticket sales executive - for having a child out of wedlock . In court papers filed in federal court in Brooklyn on Friday, Wilpon said he has shown 'long-standing support' for Ivy League-educated Castergine, who worked as the head of the Mets's ticket sales. His lawyer, Jeffrey Kohn, told the New York Post his client - the son of the club's principal owner, Fred Wilpon - terminated the former executive's employment for 'legitimate business reasons.' These included workplace 'issues and conflicts' Castergine had with her immediate supervisors, who did not include Wilpon, he said. Castergine, who was hired in December 2010 as vice president of ticket sales and services, also named Sterling Mets Front Office LLC as a defendant in her lawsuit. She is seeking unspecified damages, as well as action to stop the Mets  from 'future discrimination'. According to the lawsuit, Wilpon 'became fixated on the idea that Castergine would have a child without being married.' Claims: In her lawsuit against the Mets, Leigh Castergine, 33, says she was fired in August this year after enduring insults and humiliation from Wilpon (seen with his father and Mets principal owner, Fred Wilpon) Businesmen: (l-r) Mets Chief Operating Officer Jeff Wilpon, Major League Baseball Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Mets Chairman and CEO Fred Wilpon . He then started humiliating Castergine in front of others by - among other things - pretending to see if she had an engagement ring on her finger, it said. He also allegedly openly stated in a meeting of the team's all-male senior executives that he is `morally opposed' to Castergine 'having this baby without being married'. The lawsuit said Wilpon also told Castergine, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, that she would make more money and get a bigger bonus once she was married. Then, it said, he told her 'something had changed' after the birth of her child and that she was no longer as 'aggressive' as she used to be. According to the New York Post,  Wilpon even warned Castergine's co-workers not to take any interest in her unborn child, who was born in March. 'Do not rub her belly,' the suit says he commanded. 'Don't ask how she's doing. She's not sick, she's pregnant.' After Castergine complained to the team's human resources department, she was fired on August 26, the lawsuit said. In a statement last month, the Mets said: 'We have received and reviewed the complaint. The claims are without merit. 'Our organization maintains strong policies against any and all forms of discrimination.' In the lawsuit, Castergine's lawyers described how the one-time $6-an-hour ticket agent for the Philadelphia 76ers gained experience in more senior jobs with the Philadelphia Flyers, Orlando Magic and the Boston Bruins before joining the Mets organization. The court papers said she introduced major pricing changes, new benefits and a flexible exchange policy for season ticket holders, earning two $50,000 raises, annual six-figure bonuses and a promotion to senior vice president. The Mets' home: Castergine, who was hired in December 2010 as the New York Mets' vice president of ticket sales and servies, also named Sterling Mets Front Office LLC as a defendant in her lawsuit. Above, Citi Field . One industry publication even described her as 'the next female president in the sports industry,' the lawsuit said. But the goodwill soured with the announcement of her pregnancy, the lawsuit said. Her lawyers wrote that she became uneasy even before the announcement, when she attended a meeting of team executives in which one executive described how a female employee in the club's public relations department 'hasn't been the same since she had children' and might need to be moved to a different department. Days later, she revealed her pregnancy and discrimination became apparent soon afterward, the lawsuit said.","Leigh Castergine, 33, worked as head of the New York Mets' ticket sales .

"Cristiano Ronaldo turned to the banks of photographers, stripped off his shirt, clenched his fists, struck a pose like he was the Incredible Hulk, showed off his ripped upper body and I felt like throwing up. Ronaldo had just scored a penalty to make it 4-1 in the Champions League final in Lisbon on Saturday. It wasn’t exactly a crucial wonder goal in the dying seconds to win the game. But he stripped and showed off his muscles because he knew it would be the image most widely used online and in the world’s newspapers. He wanted to create an image for the ‘Decima.’ Ronaldo wanted to be 'La Decima.’ It's all about him! Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late penalty and immediately stripped off in Lisbon on Saturday . Egotism taking hold: Gareth Bale will always be in the shadow of Ronaldo, who demands Real attention . Not a blind bit of difference: Ronaldo's spot kick had little consequence on the Champions League final result . The main man: The Portuguese striker wanted to be the iconic image of the Decima victory . You see, in Ronaldo’s world, it’s all about Ronaldo. And as long as he is at Real Madrid then Real Madrid will always be about Ronaldo. He’s a great player, so you can probably forgive the size of the ego, but Ronaldo’s obsession with himself will have implications, notably for Gareth Bale. While they are both at the Bernabeu, Bale will always be in Ronaldo’s shadow, no matter how well he plays. With CR7 in the team it’s never about the collective. Bale wandered around after the trophy lift bouncing the ball, doing the Rambo thing with a scarf tied to his forehead, but almost a peripheral figure as the celebrations began in earnest. This is the man who cost a world-record fee. This is the man who scored Madrid’s best goal of the season in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. He also scored the goal in extra time that gave Real the lead - a lead they never relinquished. I suspect Bale would publicly deny that he’s upset in any way about Ronaldo poking home a penalty and stealing the glory. But he’s a rare kind of footballer if his ego isn’t at least slightly wounded. Most of us wanted to be first pick in the playground, but few of us had the honour. After being the only pick at Tottenham for a season he’s had to lurk behind Ronaldo hoping someone sees him in his first year in Spain. And on the night when he genuinely emerged from the shadows to claim top dog spot, Ronaldo got naked and sent the Welshman back to the shadows. Right now, with two cups to celebrate in his first season at such a great club, Bale will be happy to let Ronaldo be the star. But if Ronaldo continues to hog the headlines and limelight, I’d be surprised if it doesn’t become a problem at some point for Bale. Especially if like Saturday night, the story shouldn’t be about Ronaldo. That's the one: Bale scored the important second goal for Madrid in extra time as they sealed the win .","Real beat city rivals Atletico in Lisbon on Saturday night .

"A teenage boy faces murder charges for allegedly killing his girlfriend Anne Kasprzak, 15, when he was just 14 years old in 2012. The Draper City Police Department said in a release that the alleged murderer, whose name has not been released, 'is being held at a detention center in Colorado and following extradition proceedings will be transported to the Salt Lake area.' The 17-year-old boy faces a first-degree felony murder charge as well as a second-degree felony obstruction of justice charge, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Victim: The body of 15-year-old Anne Kasprzak, pictured, was found in the Jordan River . Family: Mother Veronica Kasprzak and stepfather James Bratcher were photographed embracing at a news conference about the suspect's arrest Thursday . The police department said in the news release that 'On about March 11th 2012 at about 10:30am, a jogger noticed blood and a shoe on a pedestrian bridge at the Jordan River. The jogger notified police of the suspicious circumstances and emergency services responded.' 'A helicopter searched the immediate area and saw what they believed to a be a human body in the river,' it continued. 'Salt Lake County Search and Rescue responded. Anne's body was recovered from the Jordan River within the Draper city limits. Autopsy results indicated she died from blunt force trauma to the head.' The Salt Lake Tribune reported that a probable cause statement alleges Kasprzak and her boyfriend called each other multiple times the night she went missing. The statement also reportedly says that when police requested his shoes, the boyfriend explained away the blood by saying his girlfriend suffered a nosebleed at a friend's house. Announcement: Draper City Police Chief Bryan Roberts, right, speaks at the podium while Veronica Kasprzak and James Bratcher stand to the side . How did it happen? Anne Kasprzak's boyfriend is accused of killing her in 2012 . According to the newspaper, the statement claims the friend told police the same story about Kasprzak's supposed nosebleed, but later said it was a lie following their discovery the boyfriend texted him about the fake explanation. The statement also reveals Kasprzak's boyfriend admitted to his pal he went to the Jordan River, said not to spread the information and to get rid of his text messages, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. The probable cause statement, obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune, says 'The defendant’s shoes were tested and human blood was located in multiple areas on both shoes. Further testing on the human blood on both shoes yielded a DNA profile which matches the DNA profile of Anne Kasprzak. It also reportedly claims the boy's wastebasket held paper 'with facts about the case, a rough time line, and a line describing a jacket ""she"" was wearing ""that night."" The boy's whereabouts that evening could be pinpointed to show he was near where Kasprzak's body was found, the statement reportedly claims. Though two adult suspects were previously investigated, a story about their alleged kidnapping of Kasprzak turned out to be bogus, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Mother Veronica Kasprzak said at a news conference filmed by Fox 13 about the arrest 'While it feels incomplete to say that it is any sort of relief because while we support the police and the attorneys office and appreciate all of the work they have continued to do, it does not change what happened.'","A teenage boy, now 17, faces murder charges for allegedly killing his girlfriend  when he was 14 years old in 2012 .

It took Murray one hour and 56 minutes to progress with a canny display that drew the errors from the powerful Australian, playing his first match in a Grand Slam second round at the age of 28. Cruise: Andy Murray eased into the third round of the French Open at Roland Garros . Acclaim: The Brit will face German Phillip Kohlschreiber in the third round in Paris . Easy: Murray claimed a 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 win over his Australian opponent on Court 1 . The 27 year-old Scot will now face . Germany’s ultra-solid Philipp Kohlschreiber, the world number 24, who . overcame Denis Istomin in straight sets. That is likely to be . considerably tougher as the German gives little away. Murray . served better than he had done in the first round against Andrey . Golubev, and it was an encouraging sign that he managed to often pull . out an ace or service winner on those occasions early in the match when . the Australian got him into trouble. Playing . someone he gets on well with, the Scot’s mindset was a little scatty in . the first set and there was plenty of chuntering at his bench. Flying start: Murray broke early in all three sets and never looked back having gained his advantage . Pleasant: Murray was on Court 1 in Roland Garros, which is known as the Bullring . Team Murray: Kim Sears and the Wimbledon champion's back-room staff watch the action . The . biggest alarm was when Matosevic forced three break points to pull him . back to 4-4 in the first set, but he lacked the composure. The . only time Matosevic, who when serving  continually found his second . serves to the backhand drilled past him,  broke was when he first served . for the match at 5-2 in the third. This . was not a match that will linger long in the memory but he will have . been pleased to get through the opening two rounds for the loss of one . set. A fine balance between attack and defence will be required when he . tackles the German on Saturday.","Andy Murray broke twice to clinch the first set 6-3 .

'It was really entertaining for visitors too but more importantly it worked well as an enrichment tool which is a vital part of our animal welfare programme.' The term animal enrichment refers to the process of providing stimulation to animals kept in enclosures. Keeping the animals active prevents boredom and encourages natural behaviour. Although such programmes normally consists of branches, foliage and other natural materials, it can include toys and a type of treasure hunt using food hidden in hard to reach places. The innovative entertainment was trialled with the penguins, macaques and squirrel monkeys.

"A fire at the Flight 93 National Memorial on Friday badly burned three administrative buildings, a National Park Service spokesman said. All employees evacuated safely, and no injuries were reported, spokesman Mike Litterst said. He did not immediately know the cause of the fire but said in a statement that initial reports indicated 'extensive damage' to the complex. The affected buildings serve as the park's headquarters and include the superintendent's office, Litterst said. Scroll down for video . Blaze: Smoke rises in the background as firefighters respond to a fire at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters on Friday in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It is not known what started the fire . The flames didn't affect the memorial or construction of the visitors center, which are about 2 miles away on the large property. The memorial in Shanksville marks the spot where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The plane, which was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, went down in a reclaimed strip mine after passengers fought back against its hijackers. All 33 passengers and seven crew members were killed along with the hijackers. A memorial plaza was completed in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks in 2011. Burning: The fire has affected three administrative buildings, which are located about two miles from the Flight 93 Memorial site, officials said . It features a white stone wall with separate panels for each victim, with one name engraved on each. The wall traces the path of the doomed flight. The wall and 40 groves of 40 trees are ways to focus attention on the crash site and the victims' memories. Officials have said they hope construction of the visitors center will be finished by June. That would give park officials three months to install exhibits in time to open for the 14th anniversary of the crash.","Fire broke out in the headquarters of the memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, about 3.15pm Friday .

"Colette Wilson, 48, stole £788,340 from IT solutions company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds . A woman stole more than £750,000 from her employers and used it to fund a luxury lifestyle, splashing out on a horse arena, a Range Rover and £25,000 on her daughter's 16th birthday party. Colette Wilson, 48, from Otley, in West Yorkshire, stole £788,340 from IT solutions company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds to pay for her extravagance. She was jailed for four years at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting theft through falsifying the company's accounts. A court heard how Wilson blew the company's cash on regular beauty treatments, an extension to her home in Pudsey, bought horses costing more than £50,000 and spent £71,000 on a horse arena. Wilson also spent thousands on designer clothing for herself and bought a Range Rover for £40,000 which she later part exchanged for a more expensive model. She also bought a car for her daughter and both enjoyed treatments at various salons. Scroll down for video . David Dixon, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that her lavish living was financed by her dishonesty while employed as company secretary and financial controller for Boxing Orange Limited. She worked for the IT company for eight years in 'complete control of the finances', earning £37,000 a year, but her theft came to light in 2011 when the company was taken over by another firm, Accumuli PLC. An audit revealed that documents had been manipulated to hide her dishonesty. She initially tried to blame others and put the former company directors under suspicion, but enquiries revealed money had been paid into both her and her daughter's accounts. Wilson worked for IT company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds for eight years, but her theft came to light in 2011 when the company was taken over by another firm, Accumuli PLC (pictured) It then emerged she had got the job in the first place in 2003 through the recommendation of a friend as honest and trustworthy, neither that person nor the directors were aware Wilson had previously been to jail for fraud. Mr Dixon told the court in 1997 she received 12 months in prison for dishonestly taking funds belonging to her then employers. When she was arrested by police in 2011 at her home in Pudsey, she claimed to think the money was rightfully hers because she had been one of the top employees. Inquiries into her finances showed a total of £44,000 had been paid to a builder for work on her home and for her daughter's 16th birthday party at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Leeds. Mr Dixon told the court: 'She had also spent £71,000 on a horse area. No expense was spared on the project. She bought horses including one for £20,000. Her total horse related purchases ran to £139,141. 'She also had an extension on her home at the price of £25,000. 'She became a customer at a shop called Rag Doll spending £100,000 on designer clothing and bought a variety of cars including a Range Rover.' Wilson spent £25,000 on her daughter's 16th birthday party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Leeds (pictured) Mr Dixon said Wilson also spent the money on home interiors, cash and foreign currency and trips to salons with her daughter. She also spent  £25,000 on a birthday party for her daughter at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Leeds. Mr Dixon said she had repaid £119,000, but £668,347.50 remained outstanding. However, because she had now been declared bankrupt, no further money could be recovered. He said: 'Her criminal proceeds were used to fund a high lifestyle and seem in part to be because she believed herself more worthy than the company was paying her. This is a clear case of greed.' Gillian Batts, representing Wilson, said she was remorseful and realised she had let people down. She had not felt able to tell her family the details of what she had done. Wilson initially failed to turn up to court today, claiming she couldn't find anyone to look after her dogs, and so a warrant was issued for her arrest. Recorder Tim Gittins told her during sentencing: 'The face is what you gave with one hand you took surreptitiously with the other on a grand scale. 'It's clear from what I've seen from the forensic enquiries that it was spent on high living - nothing more and nothing less. 'You took an obscene amount of money to spent on your daughter's birthday party. No doubt she was delighted at the time but would be horrified to learn of your dishonesty. 'Following your conviction there will be publicity which means you will be shamed with all eyes on your family and friends.' The successful investigation was led by City of London Police, which takes the lead in many of the most high profile fraud cases. Det Insp Heather Dalton said Wilson abused her position of trust and conned some of those closest to her. She said: 'They trusted her completely and she betrayed that. It is amazing she got so far.'","Colette Wilson, 48, from Otley, Yorkshire, stole £788,340 from her employers .

"Goalkeeper Joe Hart insists England will not use the searing heat as an excuse at the World Cup. Roy Hodgson's team take on Italy in their opening game in the city of Manaus, in the Amazon jungle. But training camps in Portugal and Miami will help the squad acclimatise to warmer conditions and Hart said it is up to the players to cope with them.

Moving on: Hart will not be using Manchester City's title win as inspiration in Brazil . 'It's going to be hot out there, we're . just going to have to deal with it,' the Manchester City keeper said in a . question and answer session with fans on the Vauxhall England Football . Facebook page. 'Training in Portugal and Miami will help us prepare. No excuses when we're out there, it's only weather.' Danny Welbeck backed up Hart's opinion, adding: 'Both teams will have to deal with it (the heat).' Hart also claimed he is already over the excitement of City's Barclays Premier League title success and focused fully on the World Cup. Hart helped City clinch their second Premier League crown in three years on the final day of the season. 'The Premier League thing finished last Monday after the (victory) parade,' Hart said. 'It's on to the World Cup now. I'm an England player, part of a really good squad with some great talent, that's what's going to give me belief in the tournament.'

Keeper Fraser Forster said: 'Italy and Uruguay are going to be very tough, but all the games in the group will be hard. With the climate as well it's not straightforward.' The Celtic stopper beat off competition from Norwich's John Ruddy to earn a place in Hodgson's squad - something he won't be forgetting in a hurry. On receiving the news that he'd be heading to Brazil, Forster said: 'It's something special, a once in a lifetime . opportunity. Buzzing: Celtic keeper Forster couldn't wait to tell his friends and family about his World Cup call-up . 'We all got a text before the squad came out. I was sat staring at the . phone. It was a very special moment and it great to tell my friends and family. I'll . remember it forever.' Youngsters Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw also made the Three Lions' 23-man squad and Hart is confident that all three players are ready for the World Cup. He said: 'They've all been picked on merit and . have been playing well for their respective teams. If you're good enough, you're old enough.' The England squad, including injury doubt Phil Jones, will head to Portugal on Monday. What impact will the inclusion of young players in the England squad have? Welbeck: Introducing young players will help give the squad great experience in a few years. Whoever is in the team and around the squad will get massive experience. Is there a country you're most worried about? Hart: Everyone. They've all worked hard to get there. There are no easy games. Which player was your inspiration as a kid? Hart: David Seaman. He was an England legend. Peter Schmeichel was a big personality and won it all. Forster: Schmeichel. He was fantastic for Manchester United. Seaman as well. Welbeck: Ryan Giggs and Thierry Henry.

"Queens Park Rangers have begun preparing for a huge courtroom battle amid fears of a £50m fine next season. On the eve of their Championship play-off final clash against Derby, it can be revealed the Loftus Road club have started seeking legal advice over their breach of the Football League’s Financial Fair Play regulations. In March, the club posted a staggering £65.4m loss for the year ending May 2013. VIDEO Scroll down to hear form Harry Redknapp and Danny Simpson ahead of play-off final . Facing punishment: Tony Fernandes and QPR could be hit with a £50m fine and a transfer embargo . Under the rules, which limit clubs to an £8m loss per season, Rangers will be hit with a transfer embargo should Harry Redknapp's team lose against Steve McClaren’s side at Wembley on Saturday. But more worryingly, under the same guidelines, Rangers could face a fine of up to £50m even if they are promoted this summer. The club will not face sanctions for their financial footing during the 2012-13 season - but will for the current campaign. Rangers do not have to reveal those figures until December - but given they recorded a £65.4m loss, it seems hugely unlikely that they’ll be able to reel in their deficit to the £8m threshold. And it is understood the club have opened dialogue with their lawyers as they plot a way to fight against the prospect of a financially crippling fine. Settling it the Wembley way: Harry Redknapp and QPR face Steve McClaren's Derby in the play-off final . Multi-millionaire businessman Tony Fernandes’ arrival at the club in August 2011 heralded a period of heavy spending at Loftus Road. But the arrival of big money signings such as Loic Remy, Park Ji-sung, Julio Cesar and Junior Hoilett have not resulted in success on the pitch.

"Crime boss Vasile Gheorghe (pictured) and two accomplices ran a fake ID racket in Britain which could have entitled immigrants to millions of pounds in state hand outs . Three Romanians are behind bars today for running a fake ID racket in Britain which could have entitled illegal immigrants to millions of pounds in state hand outs and free healthcare. Crime boss Vasile Gheorghe and two accomplices Valentin Babtan and Andreea Necula exploited EU laws on border controls to offer forged Romanian and Italian identity cards and driving licences for up to £2,000 each to migrants hiding out in the UK. Each fake ID would carry an image of the illegal immigrant, usually with the name and details of unsuspecting Romanian nationals living in Bucharest who would have been legally allowed to move to the UK under the EU's Free Movement of workers programme. The EU ID cards entitling holders to UK benefits and free NHS treatment were sold mainly to illegal Afghans, Iraqis and Iranians who were smuggled into the UK after fleeing their homelands. The three suspects were arrested last March following an undercover investigation during which Gheorghe, 39, handed over some of the ID cards to an investigator bragging: 'Romania is now in Europe and cheques can be cashed with the card. 'The quality is good. It's my job. Somebody with this, they go to Cheque Converters. The cheque was for £2,800. They go with their ID - the fakes - and they take the money.' Home Office immigration officers raided properties in Eccles, Greater Manchester and Preston, Lancashire seizing a bundle of the fake documents and a quantity of cash. At Preston Crown Court, Gheorge, of Eccles, and Babtan, 37, and Necula, 28, both of Preston, pleaded guilty to supplying false documents. Gheorghe was jailed for 14 months whilst Babtan got 12 months and Necula 10 months. Dave Magrath, from Home Office Criminal Investigations, said: 'This case sends a clear message to the gangs involved in this sort of organised criminality - the Home Office crime teams have the skills and resources to track you down. 'Dealing in false documents is a serious offence, whether the motive is to bypass immigration laws, cheat the benefits system or defraud banks. Those who think they can profit from abusing the system should know that they will be caught.' The scam began after border restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria were lifted on January 1, allowing nationals of those EU member states full access to the UK jobs market and limited access to welfare benefits in the UK. Gheorghe and two accomplices Valentin Babtan (left) and Andreea Necula (right) exploited EU laws on border controls to offer forged Romanian and Italian identity cards and driving licences for up to £2,000 each to migrants hiding out in the UK . Gheorghe, Babtan and Necula used the laws to settle legally in the UK but then began dealing fake ID cards on the black market so illegal immigrants could cash in on the UK welfare system and get access to the NHS. Their racket was exposed during an investigation by a Sunday newspaper after investigators posing as unscrupulous businessmen held meetings with gang members based in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The investigators met Necula who was an 'introducer' and were the shown one of the credit card sized ID documents and told each one was created by a contact in Spain. Later the investigators met Gheorghe at a house where they were shown many more bogus cards. He is said to have boasted: 'This is a Romanian card. I make the ID for you for one year. 'I know someone who used this in a bank to cash a cheque. The bank checked the card with a UV and everything was OK. They are checking the name and the picture and it is OK.' Police carried out the raids when the investigators collected the fake ID.","Crime boss Vasile Gheorghe and accomplices Valentin Babtan and Andreea Necula jailed .

"A fiery river of lava . from the Kilauea volcano flowed inevitably towards a village on Hawaii's . Big Island on Monday night, creeping to within just 70 yards of the nearest home. Residents in the destructive, unstoppable path of the lava flow were told to prepare to take what they could and flee their homes as its 5 to 10 yards per hour progress meant it could impact property in Pahoa Village sometime Tuesday. Sympathetic Hawaii County officials, meanwhile, made arrangements that would allow villagers to bear witness to the destruction of their own homes. Watching it burn: A Good Morning America cameraman films the lava flow as it progresses steadily toward the big island community of Pahoa Village on Tuesday, when experts predicted the lava could make first contact with property . Nothing to be done: Officials weren't optimistic about homes being spared Tuesday as they warned residents to flee with what belongings they could. Here, a GMA reporter stands before the red hot lava flow . Ever downward: Pahoa Village lies directing in the path of lava from Kilauea's Pu'u O'o vent and there appeared to be little chance Tuesday of the flow stopping its steady, destructive progress . That accommodation is being made to 'provide for a means of closure,' Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said Monday. 'You can only imagine the frustration as well as...despair they're going through.' Dozens of residents have been told they might have to evacuate as lava from Kilauea heads toward their homes. The flow, which first bubbled out of the continuously . erupting Kilauea on June 27, came to a standstill in late . September but resumed its trudge several weeks ago. It has moved . about 275 yards since Sunday morning. The leading edge of the flow, which scientists said had . narrowed to about 55 yards wide by Monday evening, has already . overrun a cemetery on its path toward Pahoa village, a historic . former sugar plantation consisting of small shops and homes with . a population of about 800 people. 'We're a resilient community, so we'll get through this,' said Tiffany Edwards Hunt, a small business owner and county . council election candidate. 'But as a mom, I'm uneasy, . anxious, and fearful.' Oliveira said . residents whose homes may be razed by the lava will be allowed . into the restricted area to take photos and video for insurance . purposes. Most residents have left or have made arrangements to go somewhere else if necessary. Oliveira said he doesn't anticipate having to issue a mandatory evacuation order. Menacing: GMA anchor Rob Marciano stands in the path of Kilauea's lava. By early Tuesday, the flow's front was fewer than 100 yards from Pahoa Village homes . Unstoppable: The path of lava from Kilauea moved at 5 to 10 yards per hour over the weekend and into Monday, by which point the front was fewer than 100 yards from the nearest home in imperiled Pahoa Village on the big island of Hawaii . Additional dangers: Methane explosions have also occurred near the front of the lava flow, said Janet Babb, a geologist and USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman, likely due to decomposing vegetation which produce pools of the gas under the surface . Path of destruction: Two roads have been closed and the American Red Cross has opened an emergency shelter, Mayor Billy Kenoi's office said.Crews have been building temporary access roads and trying to protect Highway 130, a route traveled by as many as 10,000 cars a day . The couple living in the house closest to the flow have left but have been returning periodically to gather belongings, Oliveira said. 'They are out of the property and awaiting the events to unfold.' Imperiled resident Imelda Raras, said she and her husband are ready to go to a friend's home if officials tell them they should leave. 'We are still praying,' she said. 'I hope our home will be spared.' Two roads have been closed and the American Red Cross has . opened an emergency shelter, Mayor Billy Kenoi's office said.

Methane explosions have also occurred near the front of the . lava flow, said Janet Babb, a geologist and USGS Hawaiian .

The last home destroyed by lava on the Big Island was in . Kalapana in 2012, according to Big Island Civil Defense. SLOW CREEP . Scientists began warning the public about the lava on Aug. 22. At the time, residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the Puna district, toppling trees and knocking out electricity. The lava has advanced and slowed as residents waited and watched. Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has been erupting continuously since 1983. This is not an eruption at the caldera, the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop. Decomposition of vegetation in the lava's path has created methane gas, which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast, Babb said. 'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.' Crater:  Kilauea's volcano Halema'uma'u crater billows into the sky at the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. The volcano has been erupting continuously for 30 years. Its Pu'u O'o fissure is the source of the current dangers in Pahoa Village . WHO IS AT RISK? Initially, the lava seemed headed for the Kaohe Homesteads, a widespread, sparsely populated subdivision in the Puna district. It reached vacant lots in the subdivision before it stalled. It skirted the northeast corner of the subdivision and then headed toward Pahoa. Pahoa has small-town, quaint and historic charm, but it's 'the only town in a commercial sense in lower Puna,' said state Sen. Russell Ruderman, who represents Puna and runs a natural food store in Pahoa. Because the lava could change direction, any community in Puna is at risk. Everyone in the district lives on the volcano. The lush, agricultural district is about a 30-minute drive from the coastal town of Hilo. The lava that crossed Apaa Street is on the other end of the street from the Raras home, but they're bracing for the possibility the lava will spread or change directions. COUNTRY-STYLE LIVING . Why would someone live on an active volcano? Unlike Honolulu, the state's biggest city on the island of Oahu, the Big Island's Puna region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life. Located on the island's southeast side, the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock. Many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems. Residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones. PREPARATIONS . Sporadic suspensions in the lava's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway. Crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from lava heat. Officials worried that if lava crosses Highway 130, it would isolate Puna from the rest of the island. 'Puna will be divided into the north side of the flow and the south side of the flow,' Ruderman said. Raras said they began putting their belongings in storage in September. What they aren't able to take with them, they're photographing for insurance purposes. Unpredictable: No one knows when Kilauea will stop erupting. In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from the volcano, which is one of the world's most active. The last evacuations came in 2011 . HOW LONG WILL THE RISK REMAIN? No one knows if the lava flow will stop, change direction or hit homes. In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from Kilauea. The last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011. One home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course. CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE . Kilauea is home to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. Some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow. They say it's culturally insensitive to interfere with Pele's will. YOUNG VOLCANO . The U.S. Geological Survey says Kilauea is the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island. Officials estimate Kilauea's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago. DON'T CANCEL VACATION PLANS . The lava isn't a reason to cancel a Big Island vacation because it's an isolated event. Officials have warned people to stay away from the area and imposed flight restrictions because of helicopter tours hoping to see lava.","Hawaii County officials made plans Monday to allow Pahoa Village residents to watch their homes burn to 'provide for a means of closure'
The lava flow had come within fewer than 100 yards of homes Tuesday as residents in its fiery path were told to prepare to flee .
The 5-10 yards/hour flow with the town of 800 directly in its path was likely to contact property sometime Tuesday ."

Orient's last two penalties to complete back-to-back promotions. Many call shoot-outs a lottery, but Collin won his seventh in seven attempts, saving at least two in each of them. The . game was nervy, tense and error-strewn in the first half-an-hour until . Orient's young winger Moses Odubajo woke up Wembley with a goal fit for . the occasion.

"GIGGS WAS A JOY TO WATCH BUT HIS PLACE AMONG THE VERY BEST IS UNCERTAIN . BARKLEY, SHAW AND WICKHAM PROVE YOUNG TALENT CAN FLOURISH . Does it make any sense for Aaron Ramsey to stay at Arsenal? It might just be dawning on him now, that while Saturday’s victory was a special day, it’s almost literally nothing compared to this coming Saturday night in Lisbon. That’s the stage on which Ramsey belongs. He’s destined for bigger things than an FA Cup winners’ medal, and a bigger stage than Arsenal can offer him. Mine, all mine: Aaron Ramsey gets his hands on the FA Cup after Arsenal beat Hull City 3-2 at Wembley . Match winner: Ramsey celebrates his extra-time goal which proved decisive for Arsenal . He turns 24 in December, which is the age Gareth Bale is right now and his Wales team-mate will be his inspiration. Bale’s ability made him the star at Tottenham but living with and flourishing alongside the elite at Real Madrid this season has confirmed Bale’s world class talent. He used to be a sizeable carp in a tiny pond at Spurs; Bale is now a killer whale in the Real Madrid ocean. It’s time for Ramsey to move on too, and if Bayern Munich get serious with their interest, it’s a no-brainer. And not just because he should be playing for a stellar club who take the Champions League seriously. He’s served his time at Arsenal. He suffered a career-threatening injury but came back to be the best player in the team. And the truth is Arsenal fans don’t deserve him. High-flyer: Gareth Bale will line up for Real Madrid in the Champions League final with Atletico on Saturday . Jumping for joy: Bale has looked right at home since joining Real as the world's most expensive footballer . Ramsey had to live with vile abuse from a few Gooners, and criticism from a lot of them, when his form wasn’t good. The abuse was so bad Arsene Wenger considered leaving him out of games at the Emirates, something the Arsenal manager reflected openly on as Ramsey hit top form earlier this season. Ramsey needed encouragement and patience from supporters at a time when he was coming back from that leg break. Instead he was booed, told he wasn’t good enough for the team, didn’t deserve a new contract and there was even a death threat aimed at him from one Arsenal fan. Most of those fans will admit they were wrong, or at least applaud the player for turning his form around. But when a player receives a bad leg break coupled with abuse from his own fans, he won’t forget in a hurry. Welsh wizard: Ramsey has enjoyed an exceptional season, finding top form for club and country, and crowned it with Saturday's FA Cup triumph . Rewarded: Arsene Wenger will sign a new contract with Arsenal after delivering their first trophy in nine years . Ramsey owes the Arsenal fans absolutely nothing. And while some may think he owes Arsene Wenger for all the support the Gunners boss gave him during the bad times, they should think again. Ramsey should, but will never be considered the star of this Arsenal line up. Go back to Arsenal's 1-0 defeat by David Moyes’ Manchester United at Old Trafford earlier this season. Despite his brilliant form Ramsey was shifted out wide in that game to accommodate Mesut Ozil. And Arsenal lost. The £42.5m Germany midfielder will always be given star billing, otherwise Wenger risks fuelling the critics’ belief that he can’t handle signing expensive players. Out of sorts: Ramsey misfired and Arsenal lost when Wenger shifted him out side to accommodate Mesut Ozil at Old Trafford . I thought Ramsey was world class against Hull City in the Cup final, but I couldn’t help feeling that when ITV were trumpeting their Champions League final coverage from Lisbon this coming Saturday, the Arsenal midfielder belonged on that stage, rather than doing what Ben Watson did for Wigan last season. If there are Arsenal fans reading this asking, “Why would he want to leave the Emirates?”, they can only squirm when they realise they sound just like the Spurs fans who asked the same question of Bale this time last year. Let’s face facts here: if Ramsey was English he’d be going to the World Cup this summer. There is nothing he can do about that. But he can do something about which club he plays for, so why would he stay at Arsenal if he can go and achieve true greatness elsewhere? And all those Arsenal fans who were laying into him as he was making his way back form injury, have no right to grudge him what he truly deserves.","Ramsey is destined for bigger club than Arsenal .

"New Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been awarded a new pay deal worth an estimated $84.3 million according to documents filed with securities regulators. The pay package includes once-off stock options worth $79.8 million which he cannot receive until 2019. Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in February. The Seattle based company awarded the massive stock option to provide a long-term incentive to remain as head of the technology company. Scroll down for video . New Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, pictured, has been awarded a pay deal worth an estimated $84 million . His pay package includes a once-off stock option worth $79.8 million and basic pay of almost $1 million . According to Reuters, the company's top executives do not have employment contracts with the firm so large stock options are used to encourage loyalty. Two weeks ago Nadella urged women in technology not to ask for pay rises and instead rely on 'karma' to get ahead in the industry. The documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission said Nadella should receive stock worth $59.2 million as long as the company's share price exceeds Standard & Poor's 500 index. He also received $13.5 million to remain at the company while they searched for its next CEO. According to the returns, Nadella's basic salary this year was $918,000 with a cash bonus of $3.6 million. He also received an annual stock award of more than $7 million. Next year, Nadella is set to earn $18 million, with a base salary of $1.2 million and a maximum cash bonus of three times his basic pay. He will also receive shares worth $13.2 million. Nadella was forced to apologise after he appeared at an event designed to promote the role of women in technology companies. However, Nadella, pictured, recently caused controversy when addressing a seminar on women in technology . Satya Nadella was forced to retract his statement that women should rely on karma rather than pay rises . When asked about what a woman who feels uncomfortable asking for a pay rise should do, Nadella replied: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' He said not asking for a raise was 'good karma' and that the boss will realise that the employee should be trusted and given more responsibility. However, he was later forced to retract his statement claiming that he was 'completely wrong', insisting that 'men and women should get equal pay for equal work'.","Satya Nadella was appointed Microsoft's chief executive officer in February .

"A thrill-seeking dad has found a terrifying way to unwind during his holidays - by leaving his family at home for storm chasing trips across America. Consultant engineer Matthew Higgins, 28, has cheated death several times while pursuing tornadoes across the wind-swept Midwest. His dangerous hobby has cost him £10,000 and means wife Tania, 37, is left at home in Berkshire to look after their 20-month-old daughter. Matthew Higgins takes photos while chasing tornadoes, including this image of a super storm cell forming  in South Dakota in June 2013 . The dangerous hobby has cost married father-of-one Matthew £10,000. This image of a gathering storm was captured in Kansas last year . In the past four years he has visited Kansas, Colorado, North and South Dakota and Nebraska, and even escaped death by minutes when one of the largest tornadoes on record hit Oklahoma in May 2013. Matthew has documented his holidays with hundreds of stunning photographs of the storms in action. He said: 'I don't like worrying my family, and I've gotten dirty looks from locals who've lost their homes and think storm chasers are insensitive. 'But I love the buzz you get when you're standing in sight of a tornado. 'I appreciate it's not everyone's idea of fun and most of my family and friends think it's mad but I love watching the full force of Mother Nature. 'It's the best show on earth. 'When people find out what I do for fun they usually think I'm mad. 'But when they see the photographs I've taken, they all say it's amazing and they want to try it!' This stunning photo of a super storm cell forming on the horizon was captured by Matthew in South Dakota in June this year . Matthew escaped death by minutes when one of the largest tornadoes recorded hit Oklahoma in 2013 - but he did capture this image . In the past four years, Matthew has visited Kansas (pictured here), Colorado, North and South Dakota and Nebraska to chase storms . As a child Matthew, from Wokingham, was fascinated by thunderstorms and spent hours staring at the sky as they happened. His fascination with extreme weather continued and his passion grew as he watched more and more documentaries about storms. In 2010 the consultant engineer went on his first ever storm chasing holiday to Kansas with Extreme Tornado Tours, and he has not looked back since. Now, every summer the dad-of-one shuns a traditional family beach holiday and leaves behind his quiet suburban life to set foot in America's Midwest chasing the deadly storms. He has been on more than 20 chasing tours and has seen 26 tornadoes across the States. He has also watched supercells - a thunderstorm characterised by the presence of a deep, persistently rotating updraft - lightning storms and dust clouds. Matthew and Tania Higgins' smashed windscreen which was broken during a tornado-chasing trip in Kansas earlier this year . This  photo of mammatus clouds was captured by Matthew during a storm-chasing trip in South Dakota in June 2014 . Luckily Matthew has escaped injury over the past four years but he said there have been a few close calls. On his most recent tour in May this year Matthew's van was bombarded with baseball-sized hail stones came close to smashing the reinforced windscreen to pieces. 'It was like being in a war zone. We couldn't even drive away because the other windows aren't toughened glass so they wouldn't have protected us,' Matthew said. 'We just had to wait for it to stop and hope the windows lasted or someone could have been killed.' On another tour in Nebraska, the group were watching YouTube videos in the car before noticing a tornado was forming right in front of them. He added: 'We were caught completely off guard but thankfully no one was hurt and we were perfectly positioned to watch it develop from start to finish.' The hobby has cost Matthew (right) £10,000 and means that wife Tania (left) is left alone to look after their 20-month-old daughter . Matthew and Tania Higgins pictured in Norway in 2013. The daring couple have traveled all over mid-west America chasing tornadoes . But Matthew's most dangerous trip was to Oklahoma in May 2013, where he escaped death by minutes after one of the largest tornadoes the country has ever seen hit. The two and a half mile-wide twister raged through Oklahoma City and the surrounding suburbs for forty-five minutes. Matthew said: 'It was terrifying. Thousands were left without homes and twenty-four people were killed, including three storm chasers. 'I realised then that there was a whole other side to chasing that I hadn't really expected. 'We were staying in a hotel with a lot of people who had lost their homes and it was humbling to talk to them about how the storm had affected their lives, but we also got a lot of dirty looks for being storm chasers. 'People think they're insensitive but storm chasers collect a lot of important meteorological data and they're often the first ones to report dangerous weather systems to the authorities so they actually save lives as well.' Matthew is a consultant engineer but the married father-of-one spends his holidays chasing storms like this one in South Dakota . Matthew eventually hopes Tania will join him on one of his trips when their daughter is older. Tania, who goes on her own annual fitness holidays to Turkey, said: 'We're both very independent people. 'I know Matthew's always been interested in weather and he loves photography so it made sense to combine the two. 'I would never stop him from going because I know how much he loves it.' Matthew's storm-chasing hobby is dangerous but it has allowed his to capture stunning images like this one taken this summer .

"UEFA president Michel Platini claims attempts are being made to tarnish his image over his support for Qatar 2022's World Cup bid. Platini has written to the Daily Telegraph following a front page story headlined 'Qatar World Cup 2022: France embroiled in corruption scandal'. The report suggested Platini and former Asian confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam, who is from Qatar, held a secret meeting where the Frenchman was lobbied to support the 2022 World Cup bid. Dispute: UEFA president Michel Platini has rejected claims by the Daily Telegraph about corruption . Platini insists the meetings with Bin Hammam were to try to persuade the UEFA chief to stand for the FIFA presidency - and not connected to Qatar's bid. In his letter, Platini said: 'Unfortunately, I am no longer surprised by the circulation of unfounded rumours which aim at tarnishing my image, especially in such an important time for the future of football.' He added: 'I find it astonishing that conversations with a fellow member of the FIFA executive committee could suddenly be transformed into a matter of state. 'I have obviously met with Mr Mohamed Bin Hammam on many occasions in 2010 as we were both members of the same FIFA executive committee since 2002. 'During those conversations with Mr Bin Hammam, the topic of the discussions was my potential candidature for the FIFA presidency. Mr. Bin Hammam was indeed trying to convince me to become a candidate for the 2011 FIFA presidential elections.' Scandal: It is  alleged that a meeting Platini held with Mohamed Bin Hammam was used to lobby support . Platini is the only FIFA member to have made his votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups public - he voted from Russia and Qatar. In his letter, the UEFA president says: 'Additionally, I wish to reiterate that I am the only member of the FIFA executive committee who publicly stated for which bid I have voted - proof of my full transparency - and that no one ever dictates terms or conditions to me.' Platini has yet to decide whether to run for the FIFA presidency in 2015, but such a move looks unlikely. Bin Hammam did challenge Sepp Blatter for the presidency in 2011 but pulled out on the eve of the election after becoming embroiled in a corruption scandal. He was banned for life by FIFA's ethics committee in 2012 for 'conflicts of interest' while AFC president.

"Mario Balotelli is set to return to the Barclays Premier League next season with Arsenal and Liverpool likely destinations. The AC Milan striker is sick of the racism he suffers in Italy and it is understood the former Manchester City star realises life in England was not so bad. Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid to sign Karim Benzema but will talk to Balotelli’s ‘people’. Liverpool will move in for Balotelli if Luis Suarez is lured away to Real Madrid or Barcelona after the World Cup. Sensational return? Mario Balotelli could be back in the Premier League with Liverpool or Arsenal . Harry Redknapp was straight back into action on Saturday night after he lead QPR into the Premier League. I understand Redknapp wants to lure out-of-contract veterans such as Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole, Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole to Loftus Road next season. In what is set to be Redknapp’s final year as a top-flight manager he feels bringing in older star players - with no fees but big wages - is the best way to stabilise a club which has debts of £117million and keep them in the Premier League. Back in the big time: Harry Redknapp celebrates QPR's promotion to the Premier League . Targets: Veterans Frank Lampard (left) and Ashley Cole are wanted by Redknapp at QPR . It’s a big ask but Redknapp has powers of persuasion. Redknapp hopes to make sure that Loic Remy, on loan at Newcastle in the past season, remains at the club. Chelsea are confident they will complete the signing of Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa next week in a £32million deal. Ashley Cole is wanted by Tottenham. As reported here in January, he has been released by Chelsea. Liverpool are also keen but Cole has told friends he is reluctant to move one of Chelsea’s rivals. That could see the former England left back take a one-year deal at Inter Milan, where he could help Thomas Ince bed down. Ince, out of contract, is in talks with the Italian club for whom his father Paul played from 1995 to 1997. Yaya Toure wants a new £300,000-a-week deal to stay at Manchester City. Toure’s ‘people’ believe he should be on at least the same wages Wayne Rooney at Manchester united, if not more. That is why, they launched a PR campaign last week. City want to retain Toure but my source tells me they won’t be bullied into offering the 31-year-old a new mega deal. Romelu Lukaku, unloved by Jose Mourinho, is 33-1 to be top scorer at World Cup. Celtic are considering offering David Moyes the job as Neil Lennon’s successor. Malky Makay is also on Celtic’s radar after they were turned down by former striker and club legend Henrik Larsson on Saturday night. West Ham are set to make a new offer for Southampton’s Rickie Lambert. The Hammers will try and get Jermain Defoe back from Canadian club Toronto for the first few months of the new season. Mon: Louis van Gaal formally appointed as new Manchester  United manager. It’s then said Ryan Giggs will take over in three years. I say why not . now? Tues: Stories emerge . that Paul Gascoigne is about to open a chain of pubs. I say I’m gutted . there are still people living off Gazza’s fragility. Weds: Yaya Toure doesn’t want a new contract, he just  wants a birthday . cake. And to be loved. If not he is ready to take a pay cut and move to . Barcelona. And the issue has nothing to do with money. Thurs: Barcelona are not interested in Toure . Friday: Toure wants a new contract with Man City. But the situation for a £220,000-a-week player has NOTHING to do with money. It was shocking to see how Mario Balotelli was racially abused by local ‘fans’ at Italy’s pre World Cup training camp in Florence. Sadly it was hardly a surprise. Only a few years ago a prominent Italian sports writer who originated from Bologna explained to me that many Northern Italians still regard anyone south of Rome as an African and, like it or not, Benito Mussolini remains a romantic figure in the eyes of many. Football has become a forum for many ‘Ultras’ in Italy to express their views. Even if, as the recent European and local elections have exposed, there is an upsurge is xenophobia in this country, football has moved along way from the darks days when racism was rife on the terraces and the game has been at the vanguard of breaking down race barriers in this country over the past quarter of a century. Yes, in recent seasons there have been some unsavoury and awkward high-profile incidents but in general the English game is more cosmopolitan and inclusive than in most countries. Yet if White Van Man can return to the political highway then there is no room for complacency, because as John Barnes once told me it’s not necessarily  what people say, it’s what they think when it comes to down to racism. Shocking: Balotelli was racially abused by Italy fans at a pre-World Cup training camp in Florence . And lest we forget that Barnes once had to back heel a banana back into the Goodison Park stands and as recently as the 1990 World Cup finals was, like Balotelli, the target of racist taunts from England followers. Paul Parker, who would emerge as a key player at Italia 90, recalls in his book Tackles like a Ferret a training session in Sardinia. Manager Bobby Robson had opened the doors to let some of the fans who had arrived on the island early but it became an open invitation for a hardcore group of National Front followers to hurl abuse at Barnes and Parker and chant ‘No Surrender’ songs. A year earlier it beggared belief that a group of 20 who did not disguise their allegiance to the NF (now BNP) had travelled all the way to Iceland for an England B match seemingly with the sole purpose of targeting Parker. As he remembers: ‘It was so cold in Reykjavik that two players, Paul Stewart and Tony Dorigo, needed cold showers to WARM up from the effects of hypothermia but it was the abuse I received  from the National Front which made my blood freeze. Proud: Paul Parker (left) represented England with distinction despite at times being abused by his own fans . ‘Why these people had come all the way to Iceland I would never understand. They gave Gazza some stick for being too fat but that was genial enough. ‘In my case it was non-stop anti-black abuse and as I was the only non-white player in the team it was as if they had travelled for the specific purpose of abusing me, such was its intensity and persistence. ‘I just had to get on with the business of playing, pretending it had nothing to do with me.’ In many ways Italia 90 the following year proved a turning point, not only in terms of reviving the English game but ousting the racist bigots. The way things were: John Barnes famously backheels a banana thrown at him at Goodison Park in 1988 . By the time England had reached the semi-finals, the majority of decent fans had drowned out the NF hardcore who were eventually driven out when the authorities  took their actions more seriously. The fact that players such as Barnes and Parker took such pride in wearing the white shirt and Three Lions crest was also a major factor. Lest we forget. Wayne Rooney has, at the age of 28, said this World Cup is his last shot at the international big time. Did he say that when he wangled a new £300,000-a-week four-year deal from Manchester United in January? I once argued that Rooney could be England’s Lionel Messi. But I know why that hasn’t happened. He hasn't kicked on: Wayne Rooney could have been England's Lionel Messi but isn't playing in the right position . Rooney can be England’s best asset in Brazil but he has to be deployed in the right position. Where is that? Starting from the wing. Next week I will explain why – thanks to the great man Dave Sexton (RIP). Why do West Ham seem to think that appointing a 'striker coach’ will solve their problems. How can a 'striker coach' alter the attacking ethos of the manager still wants to play Route One ? The only solution I can think of is an old pal of mine called Mick Harford. Forward thinking: Mick Harford (centre, in the 1988 League Cup final) would be ideal as West Ham's 'striker coach' So Arsene Wenger set to stay at Arsenal and the word is he has £100m to spend on new players. But last year he had a £120m warchest and didn’t really use it . Arsene, time to stop putting the foot on the ball and kick one hard… so push out the boat and buy back Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas. Bring them back: Arsene Wenger should try to re-sign Robin van Persie (left) and Cesc Fabregas for Arsenal . Most . in the media seemed beside themselves last week that a ‘head doctor’, . sorry sports psychologist, is a key member of England’s World Cup squad. It is now written that Dr Steve Peters can give England the edge. Really? His last two clients, Liverpool FC and Ronnie O’Sullivan, both flopped when it came to the crunch.","Former Manchester City star Balotelli wants transfer back to England .

"Immigration opinion: Bill Oddie (pictured on BBC's Springwatch) said he was delighted to have foreign neighbours and wanted a mixed country . Britain should impose a Chinese-style quota on the number of babies people can have rather than curb immigration, Bill Oddie has suggested. The wildlife expert and TV presenter said he was delighted to have foreign neighbours and wanted a mixed country. During a TV debate on immigration yesterday, he added: ‘There should just as likely be a restriction on the number of children that British people have because over-population is what you are talking about here – the big problem.’ Mr Oddie, 73, made his comments on BBC1’s Sunday Morning Live, arguing: ‘So you say these perfectly well-qualified people can’t come in, but the woman down the road has just had her tenth baby. Well I’m sorry, but they are the people that really should be contained. It would make a difference.’ In 1979, China introduced laws banning families from having more than one child. Earlier this year, it eased the rules when the quota was raised to two for some couples. Mr Oddie, who has three daughters from two marriages, was lambasted for his comments. Alp Mehmet, of MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘I’m surprised someone as wise and decent as Bill Oddie is coming up with that sort of nonsense. What he is saying is absurd. ‘He’s right – population levels are increasing – but that is largely driven by immigration, not large British families. The current government has been successful in bringing down the numbers of people entering the country from outside the EU to 1998 levels. ‘We are controlling immigration and we should continue to be aiming in that direction, rather than going down the Chinese route of limiting the number of children people can have.

Earlier this year, it eased the regulations when the quota was raised to two for some couples . Mr Oddie, who was a member of The Goodies comedy trio, claimed he was ‘often ashamed to be British’ ‘We are not that sort of country. Why we are such an attractive country is precisely because we don’t make laws saying you will have this number of children only and no more. ‘Chairman Mao went down that route years ago and I think British people would be horrified at the thought of anyone suggesting we do the same here.’ Earlier in the programme, Mr Oddie, who was a member of The Goodies comedy trio, claimed he was ‘often ashamed to be British’. He said: ‘Historically, we seem to have built up this ridiculous idea that, “Oh, we are British, this is our island and we don’t want anybody else in it”. I personally loathe that kind of chauvinism and I’m happy to say I’m not proud to be British. 'In fact, I’m very often ashamed to be British. We are a terrible race, all the hooliganism and God knows what.

"A teenager claims he was kept as a caged sex slave by the 'three breasted hoaxer' Alisha Hessler. Micheal Squier, 18, said that the model - who claimed to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted - carved her name onto his chest on the first night they met in Tampa, Florida, with a steak knife. The teenager claims Ms Hessler, who also goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, tied him up, flogged him and forced him to sleep in a dog's cage after they met on the internet and bonded over a shared interest in sex fetishes. Scroll down for video . A teenager claims he was kept as a caged sex slave by the 'three breasted hoaxer' Alisha Hessler - who claims to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted . Micheal Squier, 18, said that the model - who claimed to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted - carved her name onto his chest on the first night they met with a steak knife . He told the Sun: 'She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me. I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she has done to me.' Ms Hessler claims to have spent £12,000 on surgery to have a third breast implanted, a procedure which she said was filmed for an MTV programme. But it soon emerged that the whole story had been a hoax, and that the third breast was merely a prostheses, designed to sit between her two natural breasts. She stands by her story that she underwent surgery and that the breast is a genuine implant, and says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman. Mr Squier claims that the pair met four months ago on social media, before he moved into her home last month. But he said he stayed for just two and half weeks before he fled her 'house of horrors' - which he said includes a torture room filled with sex toys, whips and chains. The teenager also said that she tied him to a wooden post outside her home, where she flogged him. He also revealed that the third breast was a prosthetic, and that she removed it in front of him and stuck it on with glue each day. MailOnline has contacted Ms Hessler for comment. She told the Sun that she had kept Mr Squier as a slave, but denied ever having sex with him and said that she had never cut him - adding that he had carved her name on to his chest himself. Ms Hessler claims to have spent £12,000 on surgery to have a third breast implanted, a procedure which she said was filmed for an MTV programme . Mr Squier claims that the pair met four months ago on social media, before he moved into her home last month. But he said he stayed for just two and half weeks before he fled her 'house of horrors' - which he said includes a torture room filled with sex toys, whips and chains . The only pictures of Hessler's third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged. In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs. Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men. While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'. The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.' Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body. However, Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret. She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate. And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done. 'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil earlier said.","Micheal Squier, 18, said the model tied him up and beat him at her home .

"The veil of friendship has been wrenched from the Formula One World Championship. It happened here in sunlit Monaco, when Lewis Hamilton appeared to threaten to drive his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg off the track as revenge for the controversial manner in which the German took pole position. The drama started as Rosberg, who already held the fastest time, pushed hard in his final qualifying lap. Braking from 160mph into the right-hander Mirabeau, he lost control. Rather than taking the corner, he steered his car unscathed into a small run-off area on the left. Behind him, Hamilton was eating up the tarmac. He was on target to snatch pole position from Rosberg. But as he arrived at Mirabeau, Rosberg was reversing on to the track. Yellow caution flags were waved and Hamilton had to abort his attempt. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ride on board with Lewis Hamilton for a lap of the Monaco GP . Fury: Lewis Hamilton was furious with team-mate Nico Rosberg after his controversial crash . Denied: Hamilton was unable to complete his final lap meaning Nico Rosberg got pole position . The question was whether Rosberg had deliberately gone off to ensure pole. Had he done what Michael Schumacher did at the Rascasse corner in 2006, when he blocked Fernando Alonso’s last lap. For that act of cheating, Schumacher was sent to the back of the grid, his reputation tarnished. Hamilton’s body language suggested he thought his team-mate had erred, even though the stewards ultimately ruled that he had not. His face told of sullen indignation as he posed unwillingly for the post-qualifying pictures of the top three. For the record, Daniel Ricciardo was third. Potentially the most incendiary comment Hamilton made was when asked if he would discuss the matter with Rosberg. He said, cryptically: ‘I don’t know if (Ayrton) Senna and (Alain) Prost talked about it, but I quite liked the way Senna dealt with that, so I’ll take a page out of his book.’ He could . have been referring to several incidents, or the whole poisonous . atmosphere among the two great rivals of the 1980s and 1990s, but most . observers thought he was referring to Senna turning his car into Prost . at the start of the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix. A night’s sleep will probably have encouraged him to abandon such notions before he lines up on the grid. Mercedes’s PR functionaries will probably brief that he did not mean any harm to Rosberg at all. Whatever . they say, the dynamics of this title fight have changed irrevocably. The matiness has not lasted to the start of the sixth race of the . 19-round season, and we observers can say hurrah for that. The . disintegration began in earnest earlier this week when Hamilton claimed . he was hungrier than Rosberg because his childhood was poor rather than . gilded like his Monaco-based team-mate. Body language: Hamilton didn't hide his anger with his team-mate very well . Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session . Hamilton was almost monosyllabic in the immediate aftermath of the controversy. Asked what he thought about hearing over the radio that the yellow flags had been waved, he said: ‘Not much really.’ Asked to elaborate, he replied: ‘Not really much. I didn’t really think of anything. The lap was done and that was that.’ Asked if he thought Rosberg had stopped on purpose, he said: ‘Potentially.’ At this point, the paddock returned a split verdict. Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, exonerated Rosberg. Johnny Herbert, a former team-mate of Schumacher, raised a few doubts. Sir Jackie Stewart, the triple world champion, said he hoped Rosberg had not strayed from sportsmanship. Disappointing: Lewis Hamilton could only manage second place, and was denied his fifth consecutive pole . Emotional: Nico Rosberg celebrates after grabbing pole at the Monaco Grand Prix . As everyone chipped in his thoughts, Rosberg’s father Keke, world champion in 1982, stood outside the Mercedes motorhome. He, we recall, had criticised Schumacher as ‘a cheap cheat’ for the Rascasse disgrace. Three-and-a-quarter hours after qualifying ended, the stewards cleared ‘the driver of car six’ after ‘examining video and telemetry data from the team and FIA’. What next? Prost, who could be described as an expert witness on this subject, said only a few days ago: ‘One little problem inside the team, or a little bit outside, and then the feuding could start really very quickly.’ The best hope of Hamilton passing Rosberg is presented at the first corner – if he resists any urge to drive him off. Otherwise, the restrictively thin track will work in Rosberg’s advantage. The scene is set: The sun shines over the race circuit in Monaco . That is but one reason why yesterday was balm to the German. He had been outperformed in most critical moments of the opening races of the season and desperately needed to arrest the slump. In doing so, in these dramatic circumstances, he has also possibly damaged Hamilton’s sometimes brittle psyche. How he will recover today will be intriguing and instructive. Stewart said: ‘I spent my whole life as a professional racing driver trying to take emotion out of it. You cannot afford to be happy or angry. The moment you do, you lose control. You have to be clear headed, cold and focused. I am surprised Lewis reacted the way he did.’ But how will Hamilton react at the first corner today? Eyes on every yacht will be watching.","Hamilton was seething after qualifying following the dramatic late drama .

"Two alleged shooters were arrested this week in the 2009 deaths of a pregnant prostitute featured on HBO's Cathouse TV series and three others. Suspected gang members Russell Hogshooter, 37, and Johnathan Cochran, 35, were caught on Wednesday in Delaware County, Oklahoma. The victims included Brooke Phillips, 22, who had worked for a legal Nevada brothel called Moonlite Bunny Ranch, near Carson City, which was the subject of an HBO series. Brooke Phillips, 22, a prostitute who appeared on an HBO series about a legal brothel was shot and stabbed to death in 2009 while she was pregnant . The other victims were Milagros Barrera, 22, Jennifer Ermey, 25, and 32-year-old Casey Mark Barrientos. Barrientos, a drug dealer, was believed to be the target of the shooting. Each of the victims was repeatedly shot and stabbed before their bodies were set on fire. A friend of Miss Phillips, pictured here, said at the time of her death that she was not involved in drugs and had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. The friend said: 'Brooke never used drugs. She barely even drank. But she did date a drug dealer on and off.' Denny Phillips, 36,  is scheduled to go to trial in the case in April. He's charged with six counts of first-degree murder because Miss Phillips and Miss Barrera were pregnant when they were killed. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Phillips was allegedly a chief in the Indian Brotherhood gang and planned the killings. His former girlfriend said in court last year that he had bragged about the murders. 'He liked to brag. When he was describing the murders, it sounded like bragging,' Kelsey Day testified in February 2013 at a preliminary hearing for Phillips. Milagros Barrera, 22, (pictured left) and Jennifer Ermey, 25, (right) were also shot to death and set on fire during the drug den attack in 2009 . Day, who was dating Phillips when the November 2009 killings occurred, said Phillips had provided details of the victims' deaths that made her believe that he was there. Phillips has pleaded not guilty and if convicted could face a death sentence or life in prison. In 2012, David 'Hooligan' Allen Tyner, 33, pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and received consecutive life prison sentences. Tyner, a member of the Cherokee Nation who had worked as a drug dealer's bodyguard, was arrested soon after the shootings when he was identified by a witness who managed to flee the drug den. The former Marine and cage fighter finally told detectives in the past few weeks that he had not committed the crimes alone,newsok.com reported. Federal Marshalls captured Hogshooter and Cochran on Wednesday. The pair, who are also believed to be in the Indian Brotherhood gang, have not yet been charged. Hogshooter was found with a handgun when he was arrested. Casey Barrientos, a drug dealer, was believed to be the target of the shooting which left four dead including two pregnant women . Investigators allege Barrientos ran a drug and prostitution ring out of a south Oklahoma City house where the victims were killed. Phillips and Tyner allegedly were involved in illegal drug sales with Barrientos and plotted to kill him because they weren't happy with the amount of money they were being paid. In May 2012, Tyner pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to consecutive life prison sentences without the possibility of parole in a plea agreement to avoid a possible death penalty. Michael Mease, a federal inmate serving time on a weapons charge, testified that he befriended Phillips while both were incarcerated at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 2012. Phillips was serving a seven-year sentence on charges related to a shootout in Tulsa in April 2010. 'He told me he was involved in the murders,' Mease testified last year. 'He told me it was over some bad drug business ... he said he wasn't there at the scene, but he was watching closely.' Mease said he notified authorities of Phillips' statements because Phillips showed no remorse for the deaths of the women in the house, while noting that another man who had been inside the home had escaped when the gunfire began. 'That was unexpected, because everyone in the house was supposed to die,' Mease said. He said Phillips told him they were supposed to leave no witnesses.

The two best teams in the league by a distance go at it again in a replay of last year’s epic Finals. Though the teams are largely the same there have been subtle changes that could end up being the deciding factors in this paper-thin contest. This series will be decided by the finest of margins. Each team’s ‘Big 3’ - San Antonio’s Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili and Miami’s LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh - will ultimately decide the series. All six of these players are going to the Hall of Fame one day, while James and Duncan are two of the top 10 (maybe even top five) players of all-time. Fully fit: Dwyane Wade is a lot healthier than he was in last year's finals . For Miami, James remains the best player in the League by some distance, perhaps even the most dominant athlete in any sport. Wade, unlike last year, is back to full fitness and making a huge contribution, while Bosh has recovered from early struggles to find his shooting. Tim Duncan might be 38 but he’s performing better than those 10 years younger. Manu Ginobili ripped the Oklahoma City Thunder apart with his shooting and vision in the Conference Finals, but there is a question mark over Tony Parker’s hamstring. He’ll need to be fully fit for the Spurs to be firing. But if we assume that those six will be at their best then the spark will have to come from somewhere else. This is where Miami held the advantage last year, but that has swung in favour of the Spurs this time round. Shot's off: Ray Allen is not shooting as well as he did in 2013 . The Heat’s reserves, so crucial in their championship win last time, are performing slightly worse than they did, while the Spurs can rely on an improved bench. Ray Allen can still be relied on to make the big shots but he is a non-factor on defence and his shot isn’t finding the mark as often as it did in 2013. Chris Andersen is a huge help off the bench, but he is carrying a niggling thigh injury. Shane Battier has completely lost his shot, and while Rashard Lewis has taken his place to good effect, the Heat miss the shooting of Mike Miller, who departed at the start of the season. Miami’s starters have been logging huge minutes in this year’s play-offs, so the Spurs should look to strike when they are getting their rest. Star in the making: Kawhi Leonard can guard LeBron as well as any player in the NBA . The Spurs’ role players are the best in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard is a star in the making and will do as good a job as anybody in the league in defending LeBron. Danny Green set a Finals record last year with his three-point shooting, while the Spurs can also rely on Boris Diaw, Marco Belinelli and Patty Mills to provide scoring from the bench. The other crucial factor is San Antonio has home court advantage this year, not the Heat. Playing in front of your home crowd in a potential championship decider will make a huge amount of difference. Just like last year this will be one of the best NBA Finals ever and it is almost impossible to separate two extremely evenly matched teams. I think the Spurs will edge it in seven, just because in a series this tight having home court advantage will be huge. But I won’t be going anywhere near a bookies for this one. Role players: The likes of Boris Diaw will have to have an impact off the bench for the Spurs to win . It’s as simple as this: San Antonio should have won last year. The Spurs are better than last season. The Heat are not as good as they were. The way San Antonio have bounced back from their heartbreaking NBA Finals defeat has been nothing short of brilliant. It looked for all money like Tim Duncan had missed his chance for an elusive fifth crown, but his Spurs charge are back, better than ever. All this excellent season for the Spurs needs now is another championship banner hanging at the AT&T Center. Niggle: Tony Parker has been suffering with a slight hamstring injury . The major difference has been the excellent bench led by Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli, who has looked so comfortable in a San Antonio jersey since his switch from Chicago. The Heat are not quite the force they were last year. Of course, they’re still one of the very best in the league and have the No 1 player in the game in LeBron James. If motivation is the issue, then there won’t be a problem. Miami will raise their game for the occasion with the incentive a third title in a row. James will also up things a notch and, with Kevin Durant’s season over, look to prove that he is the best. Key man: Manu Ginobili is much fitter than he was last year and was brilliant against the Oklahoma City Thunder . But, when LeBron is in a lull and the rotations are in full swing, I expect the Spurs’ depth to be too much for the Heat. The teams will share the opening two games, and the Spurs will also snatch a road victory in Miami, leaving the series tied 2-2. After winning game five at home, San Antonio will find themselves in exactly the same position as last season, 3-2 up on the road. This time, there will be no missed rebound, no magic Ray Allen three-pointer to force overtime, and no Heat getting out of jail. San Antonio will show why they had such an excellent road record during the regular-season. Spurs to win in six, and dethrone the back-to-back champions on their home court. Big impact: Chris Bosh re-found his scoring touch against the Indiana Pacers . A chance for revenge versus the opportunity to make more history. That’s what is at stake in this year’s NBA Finals as the San Antonio Spurs take on the Miami Heat. In a repeat of last year’s series showpiece, which Miami won 4-3, expect another equally close and pulsating best-of-seven encounter but this time with a different outcome. The way San Antonio bounced back from their agonising loss to Miami last season has been mightily impressive. Mastermind: Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has created the most beautiful offence in the NBA . The best team in the NBA – this has been proven with their No 1 seed in the Western Conference play-offs following a regular season record of 62-20. In coach Gregg Popovich, they have someone who knows how to win having guided this franchise to five previous NBA Finals appearances. What has been most striking about the Spurs is their ability to score from the bench. In their Western Conference Finals Game 6 clincher at the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Spurs’ replacements scored 51 points in comparison to Oklahoma's five – with the 46-point differential in bench scoring the largest in any game this season. Enforcer: Chris Andersen is a key big man for the Heat but he is struggling with a thigh problem . This reason alone is why the Spurs should be the favourites for the series. For Heat coach Erik Spoelstra he is not only looking at trying to contain the all-star starting talents of Tony Parker and Tim Duncan; but also the threats of Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli who can score three-pointers for fun. Undoubtedly Miami’s 'Big 3' of Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James will play a huge factor in this series but they themselves cannot solely win it for the Heat on their own. Four-time MVP James would dearly love to make the 2014 NBA Finals the year of the “three-peat” and again has been his team’s focal point as they progressed through the Eastern Conference play-offs. Maligned: Heat coach Erik Spoelstra still has critics despite taking the Heat to the finals in four straight years . Home court advantage is also likely to play a factor with San Antonio having won all four of their previous NBA Finals when they’ve held this privilege. However, over the last four years the Heat have played in 15 play-off series and recorded  road wins every time. Expect both sides to secure away triumphs but the Spurs to edge it in seven in front of their own fans at the AT&T Center for a sweet vengeance.","San Antonio Spurs face the Miami Heat in a replay of last year's Finals .

"Rory McIlroy went from flirting with a third consecutive missed cut to a place inside the top 10 in the BMW PGA Championship on Friday. With a swirling wind and intermittent rain making conditions difficult for the early starters, McIlroy covered the front nine of his second round at Wentworth in three over par. That left McIlroy one under for the tournament with the halfway cut projected at that point to fall at level par, but just as he did in the recent Players Championship at Sawgrass, McIlroy rallied strongly on the back nine.

"A portion of a Columbian mammoth skull and tusks have been uncovered in southeastern Idaho, and experts say a rare entire skeleton might be buried there. Experts estimate the mammoth was about 16 years old and lived about 70,000 to 120,000 years ago in what was a savanna-like country populated with large plant-eaters and predators. The skeleton was spotted earlier this month by a fossil hunter working as a volunteer for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation near American Falls Reservoir. It was partially excavated by students and instructors from Idaho State University. Idaho State University geology student Travis Helm brushes and cleans a mammoth skull discovered near American Falls Reservoir near American Falls, Idaho . Idaho State University geology students Casey Dooms, left, and Jeff Castro brush and clean a mammoth skull . But the team had to postpone their work October 18 as the reservoir's water level rose, completing some of their tasks while standing in water. They plan to return next summer when the reservoir drops. 'It gives us a little more time to prepare if this is a complete mammoth, to get the funds together,' said Mary Thompson, Idaho Museum of Natural History collections manager and a university instructor. 'This is going to be substantial to go out and excavate a complete mammoth.' She said more bones and tusks remained in the bank that couldn't immediately be removed. 'There may be a whole mammoth there, so that is rare,' she said. Workers built a barrier to keep the fossil in place while underwater. LIfelike: The Wooly Mammoth are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings . The bones have been taken to the Idaho Museum of Natural history at Idaho State University in Pocatello where they will eventually be put on display . The area, Thompson said, has produced fossils of various extinct species over the decades, ranging from saber-toothed cats, short-nosed bears that were larger than grizzlies, and giant sloths. One of the most often found fossils are from bison latifrons, somewhat similar to modern bison but larger and with giant horns. Their image is part of the museum's logo. 'It's a very important North American Pleistocene site,' Thompson said, naming a time period that runs from 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago. 'We have researchers from all over the world coming here to study the fossils from American Falls.' Besides fossils, there are also tracks of mammoths, large cats, canines and other animals where they crossed then muddy areas eons ago. Thompson said she hopes to have the portions of the mammoth the team managed to get out put on display early next year. 'My crew is mainly students,' she said. 'These are things I can't teach in the classroom or in the lab. It's a very unusual opportunity.' Experts estimate the mammoth lived 70,000 years ago and was about 16 years old when it died .","Volunteer for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation near American Falls Reservoir spotted the partial skeleton in early October .

"In a real life story akin to Kevin Bacon's quest in the 1984 film Footloose, illegal dancing in the street has broken out in a Utah town as residents fight for their right to boogie. Citizens of St George, Utah, took to the streets in a 'dance protest' after clashing with authorities over laws that require a permit to allow dancing in public. Dancing without a permit could result in arrests for inciting a riot using laws that critics say infringe on their constitutional rights. Residents in St George, Utah kick up their heels in a protest at the city's rules that require a permit to dance . Vietnam veteran Larry Verner joined the protest, holding a sign stating: 'I fought for freedom, including the right to dance' Kevin Bacon dances away his frustrations in the 1984 film Footloose, in which his character attempts to overturn town rules that prohibit dancing . The party-pooper law was highlighted last month when the town's annual Monster Mash party was raided by six police officers who informed organizers dancing was prohibited according to the fine print of the event's party permit. Partygoers were instructed via loudspeaker there was to be no dancing. As the other activities continued, officers stayed at the party to ensure no rebellious dancing broke out. Now residents have taken to the streets in a protest - mirroring Kevin Bacon's character in the seminal 1980s film Footloose, in which he successfully overturns a small town's laws using the only power of dance. Jared Keddington, the organizer of the Monster Mash event, said St George was becoming 'notorious' for its rules, ABC4 Utah reported. The town's fight for the right to dance is mirrors that of the Kevin Bacon film Footloose (pictured) 'St George has been notorious for a long time not allowing dancing. 'They told me I had to be very careful how I handle it and when I go in and tell people, because if they dance or they get upset with the cops - I would get charged with a felony and thrown in jail for inciting a riot. 'Because it was being done on private property at Fiesta Fun, to our knowledge and experience, we did not need to have any kind of special event permit.' This week residents addressed the St George City Council, before staging a demonstration on the steps of the city hall. Dozens of people danced to the title track of the Bacon movie, Kenny Loggins' Footloose, as well as the Beastie Boys' (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party) and Men Without Hats' The Safety Dance, theSt. George News reported. Tiffany Barnes told the council their permit laws were 'not right'. 'We have a right to dance. Anyone with common sense can recognize this is a frivolous ordinance,' she said. The law requires anyone hosting a special event must submit for a permit 30 days prior and specify whether or not there will be dancing. Council bosses say this is to ensure organizers have adequate plans in place for things such as parking and traffic.","Residents are angered at town's laws that mirror the 1984 film Footloose .

"Children are often discouraged from playing video games because it can distract them from their school work. But now new research claims gaming could actually improve their performance at school by boosting their language skills and vocabulary. In particular, Swedish scientists found that Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) have the greatest positive effect on learning. Researchers from Sweden studied 76 children aged 10 and 11 (stock image pictured) using questionnaires and a language diary. This was used to list all encounters with the English language outside school. Study found Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) had the greatest impact on vocabulary . The research from the University of Gothenburg and Karlstad University in Sweden studied 76 children aged 10 and 11. Data was collected via questionnaires and a so-called language diary. Researchers from Oxford University found that young people who indulge in short spells of video game playing are very sociable. Those who play for less than an hour a day were also most likely to say they are satisfied with their lives, compared to those who have not played the games. They also appear to have fewer friendship and emotional problems, and report less hyperactivity than the other groups. But young people who spend more than half their daily free time playing electronic games were less well-adjusted. This was used to list all encounters with the English language outside school, such as using the computer and playing digital games. Among other things, the study investigated whether there was any correlation between playing digital games and motivation to learn English, self-assessed English linguistic ability and strategies used to speak English. The results discovered a major difference between the genders when it comes to computer gaming. According to the results, boys spend an average of 11.5 hours a week playing, while girls spend less than half that time, 5.1 hours. Girls instead spend far more time than boys - 11.5 hours compared to eight hours - on language-related activities online, primarily on Facebook. The results also discovered a major difference between the genders when it comes to computer gaming. Boys spend an average of 11.5 hours a week playing, while girls spend less than half that time, 5.1 hours. Stock image pictured . Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) are role-playing computer games in which a large number of players interact with one another in a virtual world. ‘As a player you simply have to be able to understand what's being said, to read English and to interact yourself by both writing and speaking English,’ said Liss Kerstin Sylvén, Associate Professor at the University of Gothenburg, who conducted the study together with Pia Sundqvist, Senior Lecturer in English at Karlstad University. The results from the study underline the results from other studies conducted by both researchers which found regular gamers have a significantly better English vocabulary than others. The importance of coming into contact with English outside school, for example by reading English or, as in this case, by playing computer games, means a lot in terms of young people's English vocabulary. It also has positive effects on what happens at school in the classroom. ‘The subject of English at school and the English that the young people encounter and use in their leisure time are not two separate worlds,’ added Professor Sylvén. The findings were published in the journal ReCall.","Researchers from Sweden studied 76 children aged 10 and 11 .

"A delivery man died today after a tape measure fell 50 stories and hit him in the head after slipping off a workman's belt. Gary Anderson, 58, was bringing drywall to a construction site in Jersey City this morning when the one-pound tape measure plummeted, bounced off construction equipment and struck him. Ambulances rushed to the scene after the accident, which took place around 9am, but an hour later he had died in hospital. Site: The tape measure fell 50 floors from this apartment building, killing Gary Anderson, 58 . Anderson, from Somderdale, New Jersey, an hour and a half south of Jersey City, had a hard hat in his car, but wasn't wearing it, police said. A spokesman for Jersey City's department of public safety said the tape measure fell from the fiftieth floor of an under-construction apartment block on Christopher Columbus drive. As it fell, it ricocheted off construction equipment around 10ft above the ground, and hit Anderson in the head. Seconds before, he had been speaking to another worker, who was inside a pickup truck. A police report listed Anderson as working for Charlotte, North Carolina-based National Gypsum, a company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. A spokesman for the company said he was delivering their product at the time of the accident but was employed by an independent trucking company. Two 50-story residential towers and an attached hotel are being built at the site of the accident.","Gary Anderson, 58, died today in Jersey City after tape measure hit him .

"Jason Orange's departure from Take That has led to hundreds of jokes about him on social media . When Robbie Williams announced he was leaving Take That in 1995, phone lines were set up by the government to deal with suicidal teenage girls. This morning, Jason Orange announced that he was the second member to be leaving the man band. In his statement on the group's website, he claimed that he was proud of the success they had achieved together over the years, but did not want to commit to recording another album. The response from the nation in the last 12 hours has been markedly different to when Robbie left. While the group's many fans posted comments online about their devastation, there were also hundreds of jokes flooding social media. Many Brits used the news to make a gag about Jason's input into the band's music. Others used his surname to make puns on the departure. Radio 1 DJ Greg James led the celebrity comments with the tweet: 'With Jason Orange gone, have Take That lost their appeal?' While another tweeter called @Daveunderwood71 made more of a dig at songwriting and vocal use. He wrote: The other members of Take That thought Jason Orange left at the same time as Robbie Williams. @Dan_Townley said: Can't believe Jason Orange has left Take That, what are they going to do without their backing dancer?

"Nico Rosberg will start on pole position for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after the stewards took no further action for an incident in qualifying that affected Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton. On pole position by just 0.059secs from Hamilton after the opening laps in the final qualifying period, Rosberg locked up on the entry to Mirabeau on his second and final attempt, and was forced to take the escape road. Behind the German, Hamilton was on a quicker lap, but with yellow flags being shown by the marshals due to Rosberg's incident, the championship leader had to abort a lap he has since claimed would have secured him pole. VIDEO Scroll down to ride on-board with Lewis Hamilton around the Monaco circuit . Differing moods: Nico Rosberg puts his thumbs up while Lewis Hamilton storms off after Monaco qualifying . Home win: Rosberg salutes fans and photographers after securing pole . Silence: But Hamilton admitted it was 'ironic' how Rosberg provoked yellow flags after his lock up . The stewards looked to see if . there was any indication Rosberg's apparent error was deliberate, which . in turn scuppered Hamilton's shot at pole. They would have accessed all telemetry and data from Rosberg's car, in . particular with regard to the 28-year-old's braking point compared to . his previous laps during qualifying. The FIA said a study of the data proved Rosberg had done nothing wrong. 'The stewards examined video and telemetry data from the team and FIA and could find no evidence of any offence related to the turn 5 incident,' the statement read. It was reminiscent of the infamous 2006 incident in Monaco when seven-times . champion Michael Schumacher was found guilty by the stewards of . deliberately crashing his Ferrari at La Rascasse. Like . Rosberg, Schumacher was on provisional pole that day, but behind him . championship rival Fernando Alonso in his Renault was quicker and poised . to beat the German, but like Hamilton was forced to abort. It resulted . in Schumacher's times being deleted, and subsequently he was demoted to . the back of the grid. Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session . Frosty: Hamilton was not amused after finishing behind his team-mate while Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo completes the top three in Monte Carlo . The stewards did not find Rosberg guilty of any wrongdoing, and he retained the sixth pole of his career, and . second in a row at Monaco after he pipped Hamilton to top spot on the . grid last year. Whilst . Rosberg was naturally delighted, punching the air as he stepped from . the cockpit of his car, Hamilton had a face like thunder. It is yet more grist to the mill in the team battle that is unfolding . between the pair this season, with just three points separating them in . the championship standings. Explaining the incident from his perspective, Rosberg said: 'No, it was not an ideal way to end qualifying. Pace: Rosberg will start from pole for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after the stewards took no further action . Disappointing: Lewis Hamilton could only manage second place, and was denied his fifth consecutive pole . 'I thought it was over, that the track would ramp up and someone else could beat my time. 'I'm happy it worked out. Pole at home is obviously fantastic. It couldn't be better.' As . for the fact Hamilton was behind and was two tenths of a second quicker . before having to back off, Rosberg added: 'Of course I'm sorry for . Lewis. I didn't know where he was. It's not great.' Hamilton, in response, was terse as he said: 'I don't have an answer to that.' Behind the duo will be the Red Bull pair of Daniel Ricciardo and . four-times champion Sebastian Vettel, finishing three tenths of a second . and half-a-second down respectively on Rosberg. Struggle: Fernando Alonso couldn't generate pace in his Ferrari . Move over, Sebastian: Daniel Ricciardo was quikcer than Red Bull team-mate Vettel in Monaco . Tense: Hamilton looks on as Daniel Ricciardo shakes pole-sitter Rosberg's hand . Then . come the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in fifth and . sixth, with the latter an astonishing 1.4secs off the pace. Toro Rosso's . Jean-Eric Vergne starts seventh ahead of a marvellous effort from . rookies Kevin Magnussen for McLaren and Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso, . with Force India's Sergio Perez 10th. The . stewards, though, face a busy post-qualifying period as there are three . other investigations to be considered, with all those incidents taking . place in the initial 18-minute session. Two . concern a case of impeding, with Perez and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez . involved in one case, with the other involving Kvyat and Pastor . Maldonado in his Lotus. The . final incident came towards the end, with Williams' Felipe Massa . opening the door through Mirabeau for Marcus Ericsson in his Caterham to . drive through. The clumsy Swede, however, had too much power, running into the side of Massa and sending both into the barrier. With . Ericsson already at the back of the grid in 22nd, the stewards need to . look at an alternative penalty as a loss of grid places will be . meaningless. As for . Massa, although his time was good enough to get him into Q2, the . Brazilian was unable to take part due to damage to his car and will . unfortunately start 16th. Ahead . of him will be Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 11th, followed by . Jenson Button, comfortably out-qualified by team-mate Magnussen. Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus line up 13th and 14th, . with the latter followed by team-mate Maldonado and then Massa. The .

"Will Real Madrid retain the Champions League? Gareth Bale wrote his name into European Cup final history on Saturday night as he set Real Madrid on their way to an extra-time victory against Atletico. The Welshman helped the Spanish giants claim their 10th European triumph in his first season with the club following his staggering £86million move from Tottenham last summer. Anyone who doubted Bale's abilities and whether he'd be able to conquer Europe with Real have been proved wrong. The header which saw Real Madrid crowned Champions of Europe once more has repaid the faith shown in him by the Bernabeu hierarchy. Bale has justified that fee. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Real Madrid fans erupt as Bale scores . Man of the moment: Gareth Bale's extra-time header helped Real Madrid win their 10th European Cup . Welsh wonder: Bale with the flag of his home nation as he celebrates Real's victory over rivals Atletico . Living the dream: Bale is congratulated by UEFA president Michel Platini and walks past the trophy with a smile . Winner: Bale smiles and bites his medal (left) after lifting the Champions League trophy (right) Speaking to Sky Sports after one of the . greatest night's of his career so far, Bale said: 'The price tag means . nothing. This is why I came here, to win big competitions and it's paid . off. Lifting the trophy is a feeling you can’t describe.' Question marks were raised over such a huge fee but ask anybody linked with Real Madrid and every one will insist it was money well spent. Madrid went on to win 4-1 courtesy of a Marcelo strike and Ronaldo penalty but it was Bale who set them on their way, heading home at the backpost to nod Carlo Ancelotti's men in front. 'I was thinking do not miss! Literally, do not miss!' said Bale, who luckily kept his calm during such a huge moment. Bale's used to keeping his calm and producing when the stakes are high and the pressure is on. Last season, the No 11 was the match-winner on countless occassions for Spurs in the Premier League. Tottenham's talisman gave defences nightmares and just couldn't stop scoring screamers. Bale made his brilliance look simple, as the world's best players tend to. Heading home: Bale climbs highest at the back post to guide the ball past a helpless Toby Alderweireld (right) Dream duo: The £166m partnership of Cristiano Ronaldo and Bale enjoy Real's victory at the Stadium of Light . Twelve months on, and the 24 year-old was helping Madrid claim their first Champions League win in 12 years. Big games need big players and Bale is certainly a world-class star. Admittedly, Real's deadly duo of Bale and Ronaldo had a quiet night by their standards but duly stepped up when it mattered. Nobody will remember the match as a game when Bale wasn't at his best. They'll simply remember his extra-time goal which helped his side finally achieve La Decima. 'I had a little feeling things were not going my way after missing chances! But I’ve learnt from past experiences to forget chances missed and keep persevering. Thankfully I got the decisive goal which  gave us momentum in the last 10 minutes,' said Bale. Magic moment: Bale screams at the camera with delight and is congratulated by Real legend Zinedine Zidane . Lifting the Champions League trophy in Lisbon, the former Southampton graduate has come along way. After all, Bale was nearly sold by Tottenham after failing to make the desired impact during his first few seasons at White Hart Lane. The feeling of achievement - the sense he was living the dream - was clear to see as Bale walked past the coveted trophy with a beaming smile on his face. The wideman showed his class on Saturday and proved to the football world just why Real Madrid parted with such a vast sum of money in order to secure his services. The man is a match-winner. Lifting the Champions League trophy alongside Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos, Bale now belongs on that platform. Madrid's Prince of Wales has now joined a long illustrious list of Real greats - Puskas, Di Stefano, Raul, Zidane, Ronaldo, Bale.

"A key metric of wealth inequality in the United States has reached levels unknown since the Great Depression, a new study into global finances has found. It was also revealed that almost half of the assets in the world are owned by just 0.7 per cent of the world's population, as the world's economy powers ahead. The new data has raised the specter of a new catastrophic economic failure, of a parallel with the banking crashes of 2008 or the dot-com bubble in 2000. As a sign of wealth concentration, the number of dollar millionaires globally has shot up 164 per cent since 2000 to 34.8million individuals today - with 41 per cent of them living in the United States. Scroll down for video . Danger sign: The ratio of wealth to income in the U.S. - a significant measure of inequality - can be seen peaking in the Great Depression, and approaching the same level again in 2014 . Authors of the report, by investment bank Credit Suisse, described the results as 'a worrying signal' which could lead to a new recession. The report, by three international economic experts, presented data comparing levels of wealth in the country with its disposable income. High levels of wealth - associated with millionaires, company owners and major shareholders - tend to be a sign the rich are doing well. High levels of income, meanwhile, are associated with wage earners and more even gains. The latest figures show that the ratio of wealth and disposable income is now at 6.5. A more normal figure is 4 or 5. Since records began, the figure has only been higher during the period directly following the 1929 Wall St Crash, when it hit around 7.2. Discussing the results, the authors said: 'This is a worrying signal given that abnormally high wealth income ratios have always signaled recession in the past.' It came at a time of unprecedented global productivity - with the U.S. ramping up its wealth total by $12.9trillion in the 2013 calendar year. This is the largest gain on record and more than the entire amount of money lost in the 2008 crash. But the report also showed that, despite gains in wealth practically in every part of the world, the results are still far from equal. Top of the pile: The chat above shows that the world's millionaires - just 35million people - control an enormous share of global wealth - more than 15 times the amount owned by the poorest 3.3billion . It found that the world's millionaires, who make up 0.7 per cent of the world's adults, now control 44 per cent of global assets - some $116trillion. More than 40 per cent of the group - some 35million people - are U.S. citizens. The next-richest 7.9 per cent - 373million people - are in charge of 41.3 per cent of global wealth. That leaves just 14.7 per cent of all wealth on the planet to its other 4.3billion adult inhabitants. The poorest segment of the world population - the 3.28billion with less than $10,000 to their name - have just 2.9 per cent of global wealth between them, while the 1billion richer than they control around 12 per cent of global funds. Wealth per adult: The richest nations, with wealth per adult over $100,000 (£63,000), are found in North America, Western Europe and among the rich Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern countries (in red) Global wealth skyrocketed 8.3 per cent over the past year to a record $263trillion (£165trillion), a report revealed today. But the research by Credit Suisse found the distribution of the riches has become increasingly unequal - with the median wealth plunging 14 per cent since 2007 to $3,641 (£2,289) per adult. Global wealth now stands 20 per cent above the peak before the global financial crisis and 39 per cent above the low seen at the height of the crisis in 2008, according to the Global Wealth Report. Rising: Global wealth now stands 20 per cent above the peak before the global financial crisis and 39 per cent above the low seen at the height of the crisis in 2008, according to the Global Wealth Report . It said: ‘The overall global economy may remain sluggish, but this has not prevented personal wealth from surging ahead during the past year.’ The study of the wealth holdings of 4.7billion adults in more than 200 countries found aggregate household wealth has more than doubled since 2000, when it stood at $117trillion (£74trillion). And in the next five years, wealth is expected to rise by 40 per cent to $369trillion (£231trillion). Today, each adult has an average of $56,000 ($35,000) - an all-time high for average net worth. The decline in the median to $3,641 - the level at which half of the sample is lower and half higher - indicates that inequality, which remained flat or declined from 2000 to 2007, is once again rising. Distribution: Credit Suisse said it expected the number of global millionaires to exceed 53million in 2019, with the number in China expected to nearly double from its 1.18million today . Increasing: China's share of the middle class has doubled since 2000 and now accounts for one third of people in that category . ‘The findings show that inequality has tended to rise since 2008, particularly in developing economies,’ Markus Stierli of the Credit Suisse Research Institute said. The study credits most of the rise in wealth over the past year to North America, which accounts for 34.7 per cent of global household wealth, and Europe, which accounts for 32.4 per cent. Both regions showed hikes of about 11 per cent. In contrast, Latin America saw little change, while China recorded only a small rise of around 3.5 per cent, and India saw its wealth fall 1 per cent. On a country level, Britain, South Korea and Denmark recorded the largest percentage gains, while Ukraine, Argentina and Indonesia saw the largest losses, it said. Switzerland meanwhile maintained the highest average wealth per adult, at $581,000 (£365,000), followed by Australia, Norway, the U.S. and Sweden. Compared: Europe and the North America showed hikes in wealth over the past year of about 11 per cent. In contrast, Latin America saw little change, while China recorded only a small rise of around 3.5 per cent . Split up: The study of the wealth holdings of 4.7billion adults in more than 200 countries found aggregate household wealth has more than doubled since 2000, when it stood at $117trillion (£74trillion) Top of the charts: Switzerland maintained the highest average wealth per adult, at $581,000 (£365,000) Some 128,000 of the world's millionaires have assets of at least $50million (£31million), with nearly half of them living in the U.S. and nearly a quarter in Europe. Credit Suisse said it expected the number of global millionaires to exceed 53million in 2019, with the number in China expected to nearly double from its 1.18million today. Some one billion people meanwhile belong to the global middle class, with wealth ranging from $10,000 (£6,000) to $100,000 (£63,000), the study showed. China's share of the middle class has doubled since 2000 and now accounts for one third of people in that category, it said.

"Taster: Margot Woelk had to taste Adolf Hitler's food before he ate it to ensure it was not poisoned . This is the woman tasked with tasting Adolf Hitler's meals to ensure the Fuhrer's food was not poisoned. For more than two years Margot Woelk risked her life by sampling food prepared for Hitler at his Eastern front HQ dubbed the Wolf's Lair. The now 95-year-old was picked up by the SS in 1942 after being evacuated from Berlin to the East Prussian village of Gross Partsch - in modern-day Poland - where she was set to work tasting fresh produce to be served up to the paranoid Nazi leader. Mrs Woelk was one of 15 women forced to test Hitler's food before it passed his lips at the Rastenburg base. As her fellow Germans were existing on rations, Mrs Woelk feasted on fresh fruit and vegetables, including asparagus, peppers and peas. But the now elderly woman has revealed the fear she felt at sampling the leader's meals during the Second World War, saying: 'We had no choice'. Mrs Woelk's mother-in-law had offered her a place to stay in the countryside when her husband Karl left to join the fighting and a bomb tore the roof from her Berlin apartment, leaving the secretary homeless. But shortly after she arrived she was earmarked by the SS to perform the bizarre role alongside 14 other unwilling female food tasters. Mrs Woelk told the Times: 'Of . course I was afraid. If it [the food] had been poisoned I would not be . here today. We were forced to eat it, we had no choice.' Hitler would only deign to touch his food after all 15 women had sampled it and at least an hour had elapsed, she explained. Scroll down for video . Eating: Hitler with his mistress Eva Braun. Every meal the dictator had was  tasted to make sure he was not poisoned . 'Between 11 and 12 o'clock, we had to . taste the food, and only after all 15 of us had tried it was it driven to the headquarters by the SS,' Mrs Woelk said. 'It was all vegetarian, the most . delicious fresh things, from asparagus to peppers and peas, served with . rice, and salads. It was all arranged on one plate, just as it was . served to him.' Mrs Woelk, who was not required to taste meat or fish as the leader was a vegetarian, had to report every day, but was only used when Hitler's personal train was in the station. She said she had been rounded up by the SS because the Nazi leader wanted only 'good German stock' testing his food. There was always an hour's delay before Hitler tucked into his meal so that any effects of the food on the women could be seen, she said. Mrs Woelk told the Daily Express she and her husband had been 'just two people trying to survive' when the Nazis arrived, and that neither had been party members. Despite coming to feel like a 'laboratory rabbit' Mrs Woelk said she quickly learned 'you didn't argue with the SS'. 'Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself,' said Margot.

From that moment she was confined to a school building and could only see her mother-in-law at weekends watched by the SS. When Hitler abandoned the lair after 800 days in November 1944, a senior officer helped her escape back to Berlin by smuggling her on board Joseph Goebbels' train. She believes the other tasters were shot by the advancing Russians. While she escaped a similar fate, Mrs Woelk told the Daily Express she was forced to endure a devastating ordeal when she was raped by soldiers from the Red Army. In 1946 she was eventually reunited with the husband she had presumed dead, and the couple lived together until Mr Woelk's death in 1990.","Margot Woelk was forced to risk her life tasting food made for Nazi leader .

"The duel between Owen Farrell and Jonny Wilkinson will make Saturday's Heineken Cup final extra special. It is Jonny's last game in Britain before he retires and he is up against the young guy who has taken over the England No 10 shirt he wore for so long. It's a battle capable of capturing everyone's imagination. Flat out for glory: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell leads the charge for European success . In the zone: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell practices his place-kicking on Friday . It's normal to compare and contrast opposition players but these two have many similarities. They faced each other in the semi-finals last year and, if anything, Owen has become more like Jonny since then. Farrell comes across as quite shy off the field, uninterested in the limelight and wanting to focus on improving his game, just like Wilkinson. On the field, both are in their element running the show.  Farrell has learned to control and channel his aggression - just as Jonny has always done - and his greater maturity has improved his game. Defensively, Wilkinson set new standards for his position and Farrell is a hugely committed tackler. He has the same toughness his dad Andy was known for in rugby league and union. Handy: Farrell and mascot Sarrie the Camel get ready for the big match with session in cryotherapy chamber . Fitness boost: Saracens players tackle the big chill in a cryotherapy chamber . Owen wants the ball all the time, more so than Jonny, but still has to learn when not to commit to rucks. We spent a lot of time stopping Wilkinson from getting drawn into the breakdown and Farrell tends to be in there more than he should. He will learn it is not a slight on his toughness to keep out of that  contact area and focus on running the show. He needs to be on his feet, ready to act as first or second receiver. Over the past year Farrell has made a lot more half-breaks,  holding up the ball, using his footwork and putting people into space. He is also scoring more tries. This stems from playing flatter to the line, which means you don't have to be super-fast in order to off-load and score. Jonny is rightly earning huge praise as his career is about to end. At his peak he was the best in his position in the world and I believe Farrell can achieve the same  status. Perhaps we may soon see Wilkinson coaching him as part of the England set-up - now, that could become a great partnership. Final fling: Jonny Wilkinson's playing his last game in Britain . One of the reasons Wilkinson has been so effective for Toulon has been the presence of Matt Giteau. Having a ball-playing inside centre alongside him is key for Jonny and Giteau is one of the few players I've seen who would have pushed hard to make my 2003 England team. He has special qualities, like Will Greenwood and Mike Catt had, which they used to help bring out the best in Jonny. He plays so well next to a 12 who keeps talking to him and has the ability to play at 10, so can step in at first receiver if needed. Giteau fulfils that role at Toulon and that takes pressure off Wilkinson. With both men in the side, Toulon have an ideal left-footer, right-footer combination. Pitch perfect: Jonny Wilkinson in training ahead of the Heineken Cup final . Saracens have Brad Barritt, a top defensive player, at 12. He doesn't offer the same attacking support to Farrell. Defence coaches are happy to have a basher in that position - someone who will make tackles and run hard - but against the best teams you need another ball-player who can pass and kick to the highest standards. As a coach, you know that if you have a genuine 10 standing on either side of a ruck, your team will be a much greater attacking threat than if you just have one man trying to orchestrate everything. I was in France to watch Toulon play Leinster in the quarter-finals and was very impressed. They have so much power married with great skill but they rely a lot on Mathieu Bastareaud for momentum in midfield. I would put him in the same bracket as Manu Tuilagi; he could be one of the world's top players but needs to refine his game. He smashes into people time after time, without looking for the off-load, but he does put  his side on the front foot; then Wilkinson and Giteau line up on either side of the ruck, ready to use the space if they get quick ball. Toulon also have plenty of big, ball-carrying forwards, like Danie Rossouw. They also have a broad skills set. The best example is Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, the Argentina captain in their back row. Like Wilkinson, he has been a huge asset to the club and sets standards on and off the field. I know Toulon coach Bernard Laporte from when I was coaching England and he was in charge of France. He has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby. It is a bit like coaching Real Madrid. If you win a trophy, everyone says that is what should happen, because you have so many amazing players. If it goes wrong, your career could be in tatters. Pressure: Toulon coach Bernard Laporte has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby . Having so many top players at one club requires great management and Bernard deserves credit for creating a positive environment. There is unity and focus among the players, which is not easy to achieve. Some observers have criticised Toulon for using brute force and not creating enough opportunities for runners like Bryan Habana, Drew Mitchell and Delon Armitage. But their approach has been very effective. A lot of French clubs play in a pragmatic, power-based way, but the French haven't lost their creative spark - not when they have brilliant centres such as Wesley Fofana and Gael Fickou. I'd expect them to be in with a real chance by the time the World Cup arrives. Danger: Saracens smashed Clermont Auvergne in the Heineken Cup semi-final . I'm a fan of how Saracens have developed and of the relentless nature of their game. Their chairman, Nigel Wray, sets the tone. He has been around since the game went pro and has  committed time, energy and money to make the club a force. They meet pressure with pressure. There is so much focus on winning turnovers and when they achieve that, they go for the jugular. They play with tempo, attacking intent and an incredible work ethic. All their attributes were displayed in the semi-final last month when they smashed Clermont Auvergne, who I expected to beat them at Twickenham. Chris Ashton is one of Saracens' most potent weapons. Whether or not he is the best winger in England is open to debate but if asked if I would like to coach him, the answer would be a definite 'yes'. Threat: Chris Ashton is one of Saracens' most potent weapons . Ashton is a consistent try-scorer and is very good at tracking the ball but he should work on his tackling and beating defenders on the outside. His speed isn't in question and if afforded space he'll hurt you, but I'd like to see him master the art of deception better so that he can create space for himself. It is a contest between Toulon's big-match, big-name players, who will want to win it for Jonny, and Saracens' work ethic and team spirit. If it was a wet winter night, Toulon would be more vulnerable. Under the  Millennium Stadium roof, I think they will win, just.","Saturday's Heineken Cup final is Jonny's last game in Britain before he retires .

"Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said the presence of British officers would persuade immigrants it was 'impossible to cross the Channel' A French minister has called for Britain send police to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration. Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said the presence of British officers would persuade immigrants it was 'impossible to cross the Channel'. Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months. There are now 2,500 illegal immigrants in the port. Last month the mayor of the ferry port said migrants were attracted to Britain because they saw it as an 'El Dorado' of generous welfare. British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais, it emerged yesterday. The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year. The demand for even more help - including the stationing of UK police in the French port - will cause anger and a demand for the French government to do more. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast Show, Mr Cazeneuve said: 'We had a hard negotiation between the two governments and I have had a lots of rendezvous with my friend Theresa May in order to find a solution concerning this tremendous problem. 'We are both involved in this problem and we have to find common solutions in order to be efficient.' He said he and Mrs May had agreed that, in order to tackle the problem in both countries, more co-operation was needed in 'services and policemen'. Local officials say there are now 2,500 illegal immigrants in Calais, with the majority from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Syria. Numbers have increased by 50 per cent in the past year as people flee from humanitarian crises in northern and eastern Africa and the Middle East. Many are camping or living in squats around the port and there have been clashes on the streets of the town. Last month, France sent 100 extra police officers to the northern French town to join the 350 already there. There are currently no British police there. Mr Cazeneuve said that he and Mrs May had agreed to the installation of new security equipment at the port, and to 'try to work together concerning the security aspects and the humanitarian aspects by financing a number of projects'. 'We are going to finance the humanitarian aspect and the British government is going to help with financing the security aspect of the problem,' he added. When asked if he believed British police should be sent to Calais, Mr Cazeneuve said: 'It would be very useful to have more policemen here, and we try to find a way of being in a common system here concerning police, in order to explain to all the immigrants in Calais that it's impossible to cross the Channel. 'And we'd be very happy if it would be possible to have more co-operation concerning this point.' Illegal immigrants have been waiting in Calais to try to cross the English Channel and work or claim benefits in Britain . Thousands of immigrants, many of them from Africa, try to sneak on board trucks waiting to cross the channel . The UK has said it will contribute £4million a year for three years to a joint intervention fund. The increased security measures are said to include more robust fences and new technology to detect migrants hiding in lorries. During a visit to Calais on Monday, Mr Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January. But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel. Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.' Britain pays more than £8billion a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500. Mayor Bouchart said the migrants were willing to risk death to cross the English Channel . The migrants have been living in make-shift camps near the ferry port in north-eastern France . Campaigners fear that a new planned camp in Calais could quickly turn into a 'ghetto' Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day. The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable. Calais' mayor Natacha Bouchart told MPs last week that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel. She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain. ‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives. ‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. People who have got through call and say, “ … this is El Dorado and we’re staying here”.’","Bernard Cazeneuve says British officers would deter illegal immigrants .

"Manchester United have quashed reports in Spain that they triggered Atletico Madrid defender Miranda's £24million release clause. The 29-year-old centre-half played in the Champions League final extra time defeat against city rivals Real in Lisbon on Saturday. Miranda was a mainstay for Diego Simeone's La Liga champions last season and Barcelona were also interested. Incoming! Manchester United have triggered Miranda's release clause of £24m at Atletico Madrid . Key man: The Brazilian has been important for Diego Simeone during their La Liga title last season . Atletico are attempting to cash in on a player who will be 30 in September. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari didn't pick the big defender in his World Cup squad - a decision that has come as a surprise given Miranda's recent performances. Van Gaal has identified the heart of his . defence as a problem area, particularly after the departures of Rio . Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic has left the squad devoid of numbers. Miranda is enjoying a renaissance on the continent since moving to Vicente Calderon three years ago. What a picture! New boss Louis van Gaal has identified central defence as a problem position at Old Trafford . Target: Manchester United have joined a host of clubs in chasing PSG youngster Adrien Rabiot (right) He did move back to Brazil with Sao Paulo in 2006 after ill-fated one-season spells with Coritiba and Sochaux. United have also continued to keep tabs on Paris Saint-Germain's Adrien Rabiot, who wants to leave the club over a lack of games. The 19-year-old is highly thought of in France and is the source of interest from Premier League clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea. He is one half of the best central defensive partnership in Europe and if Manchester United do manage to land him they will have some player. Think Ricardo Carvalho in the John Terry/Carvalho partnership in Jose Mourinho’s first spell at Chelsea. Diego Godin is Atletico's Terry – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots, sliding into tackles and heading in set-pieces - while alongside him Miranda is the cool head; the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong. You don’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time. Most commentators in Spain believe Miranda has been the best defender in La Liga this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his Atletico team-mate Felipe Luis have been left out of the Brazil squad – all the better for United who will get a player who has rested throughout the summer having put in the season of his career. Six times Lionel Messi faced Miranda this season and the Argentine failed to scored, played out of the game by the 29-year-old who was consistently voted best defender in Brazil before Jorge Mendes helped bring him to Atletico Madrid from Sao Paolo in January 2011. As well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals, giving Atletico the Spanish Cup last season by notching the winner at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid. The fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone’s eye this season extends to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. The World Cup-winning manager enquired over the defender’s international status. Unfortunately for Spain, he had already played full internationals with Brazil and can’t follow Diego Costa in making the switch to Spain.","Atletico Madrid trying to cash in on defender who is 30 in Sepetember .

Talking about another scary moment, Beckham recalled when he found holes in a boat they were travelling in. He said: 'We're going through treacherous waters and I notice there are holes in the boat. 'I had to use a bucket to bail the water out. There was no way I was going to sink.' Very rock and roll: The foursome also posed in front of a small river as they perched on their vintage motorcycles . On the road again: The group looked to be having a great time in clips from the documentary . Beckham . added that he was even more afraid when a snake slithered into his tent . as Micheal Palin joked: 'You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would . have interview it!' David replied: 'Yes I am. I wish the snake had been bigger - but it was bigger than it looks on TV'.

He said: 'Victoria was not convinced . that they wouldn't know who I was, but I was kind of 95 per cent sure that I . wouldn't be recognised by the tribe - and I was right. 'The . fact is, for the last 22 years my every day has been on a schedule and . the fact that I woke up in Rio and we said, 'Let's go to the favelas'. 'We can have lunch when we want and have dinner when we want and kind . of talk about what we wanted to and to meet people that I've never met . before - that was refreshing. 'Obviously as we went along the trip I was being less recognised . and by the end of the trip, when we were with the . tribe, they didn't know who I was, they didn't know what football was, . and it was incredible.'

"Jose Riga has been handed a route straight back into management by Blackpool as the club finalised a deal for the Belgian to become their new boss. The 56-year-old left Charlton Athletic at the end of last season after just two months in charge and has succeeded Paul Ince at Bloomfield Road. Riga held talks with the Seasiders over the weekend and chairman Karl Oyston was impressed enough to offer him the job following months of stagnation without a permanent manager, as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday. Discussions: Jose Riga held talks with Blackpool about the vacant manager's position over the weekend . Riga was heralded for keeping the Addicks in the Championship during his brief spell in charge at the Valley and has further coaching experience with Standard Liege and AC Milan. Former Leeds boss Brian McDermott was also interviewed for the post, while Blackpool performed a U-turn in appointing Brian Flynn last week. The job does represent a massive task for Riga. Under caretaker manager Barry Ferguson the North West side narrowly avoided relegation down into League One in the final weeks of last season and have only six contracted players on their books. Riga is believed to have already drawn up a lengthy list of potential new players as the club look to press ahead before the start of pre-season next month.

Trina chose six models with specific body types so that together, they could mimic the shape and angles of an iconic Ducati motorbike and its rider. Photos of the artistic process show exactly how the models, who were painted in red and black, contorted their bodies to become different parts of the motorcycle. 'It was a giant human jigsaw puzzle. Each person’s natural shape, strength, and athleticism helped to build each part of the motorcycle,' the artist writes on her website.

Camouflage: Two of the 'human canvases' pose in red and black body paint before getting into position . Four make-up artists helped her illustrate the fine details of the bike and its tires. Lana Baumgartner, one of the 'human canvases', said of the experience: 'The motorcycle project from start to finish was the greatest lesson I've learned thus far about the magnitude of human potential in teamwork. 'The experience of transforming a small group of dedicated models into the image of a motorcycle, at one point seemed relatively impossible. The end result is certainly what validates the truth ""anything is possible if you believe.""' Piece together: 'It was a giant human jigsaw puzzle.

"Despite the old adage that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, a recent study suggests that may not actually be the case. New research from Monash University in Melbourne has discovered that holding off on your first meal of the day could help tackle Australia's growing obesity epidemic. Of the thirty-two people involved in the study, all lost weight within the first 12 weeks by fasting from 8pm in the evening until midday the next day,The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Scroll down for video . A new study from Monash University in Melbourne has revealed skipping the first meal of the day may be the key to weight loss . The patients all suffered from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and each participant managed to reduce the circumference of their waist during the initial period - a sign of repairing liver damage. Dr Alex Hodge, who worked on the study, told the publication that similar studies had been carried out on animals in the past, and said the results showed restricting access to food helped prevent animals develop a range of health problems. The Melbourne gastroenteroligist also said the findings could present a new solution to the growing obesity epidemic in Australia. Patients involved in the study saw improved liver function, lowered blood pressure and a range of other health benefits . 'Despite the small numbers of participants in this novel study, there was a significant health benefit from intermittent fasting. 'When the standard care group was changed to intermittent fasting for an additional 12 weeks, they continued to show improvements,' Dr Hodge revealed. The study found that all patients who fasted showed improvements in a number of areas of their health, including blood pressure, insulin resistance and other indicators of liver damage. Fatty liver damage affects more than 5.5 million Australians, while one in three adults are now classified as obese.","New study suggests holding off on breakfast could help people lose weight .

"A knife-wielding man who was shot and killed by a New York City police officer Friday night had previously attacked a regular on Keeping Up With The Kardashians,according to reports. Jonathan Cheban - a friend of the Kardashian sisters who has appeared in numerous episodes of their reality series - was lunged at by a man in May as he left a sushi restaurant in Brooklyn, but a bodyguard managed to thwart the assailant, TMZ reported. The attacker, identified as Denis Volchkin, was armed with a knife at the time. Volchkin was killed by police during a domestic dispute on Friday. Attacked: Former PR director Jonathan Cheban, a regular on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, was attacked outside a Brooklyn sushi restaurant in May. His assailant was reportedly shot dead by police Friday night after officers were called to a domestic dispute between the man and his mother . Officers were initially called to a home in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn around 5:30 p.m. to address a problem between the man and his mother, but he left before officers arrived, police said. They were called to the same home again around 8 p.m., when the mother escorted them inside. The son lunged at the officers with a knife in hand, and an officer shot him once in the torso, police said. His name and age weren't immediately released. However TMZ reported that the son was Denis Volchkin, citing law enforcement sources and Cheban himself. The website also said Volchkin appeared to be on drugs at the time of the attack. Cheban is the former CEO of public relations firm CommandPR. He briefly had his own reality show, The Spin Crowd, which was executive produced by Kim Kardashian, but it was axed after one season. Scene: The shooting occurred at an address in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn around 8pm . Domestic: Police had been called to the home earlier in the afternoon, about 5pm, but the male suspect was not home. They then received another called and returned about 8pm . The confrontation between police and Volchkin came four days after police shot and killed two men — one accidentally — amid another domestic dispute in Brooklyn. In that case, one of the men, Francisco Carvajal, was carrying a knife and had pushed his way into his ex-girlfriend's apartment Monday night, police said. After Carvajal had shown up earlier that evening, she had called another man, Rafael Laureano, for help. As Carvajal used the knife to cut through the door of the bathroom in which the woman had locked herself and her children, officers broke down the front door, and the unarmed Laureano bolted into the apartment, although a sergeant tried to stop him, police spokesman Stephen Davis said Thursday. Carvajal tried to attack Laureano with the knife, and officers repeatedly ordered Carvajal to drop the weapon, police said. But instead, he came at them, and officers fired at least 10 times, killing both men, police said. Nine rounds hit Carvajal; one hit Laureano in the back.","Man shot dead at a home in Brooklyn by police during a domestic dispute about 8pm Friday .

"Brendan Rodgers has vowed to keep making bold decisions even though he accepts too many wrong calls would mean he pays a heavy price. Liverpool’s manager maintains there was nothing defeatist about the controversial team he selected against Real Madrid, insisting there was enough quality - even without Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson - to get a result in the Bernabeu. Rodgers’ decisions have been heavily scrutinised in the last 48 hours but, crucially, not by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners. Chairman Tom Werner is over for Saturday’s game against Chelsea and he met Rodgers on Thursday to discuss how the season has been panning out. Brendan Rodgers looked relaxed in training on Thursday, despite Liverpool's poor start to the season . Rodgers will been keen to get striker Mario Balotelli firing on all cylinders as soon as possible . ‘The owners have been brilliant,’ said Rodgers. ‘The only people who matter to me are the people here at the club, the players and supporters. You become a manager and know the criticism will come. Whether it is deserved or not you take it. ‘Tom spoke to me and straight away they see the courage in playing a different team and younger players and how I have dealt with my situation here. They have always been supportive, great for me.’ There is no suggestion Rodgers is under pressure and the 4,500 Liverpool fans who travelled to Madrid gave him constant and noisy backing; the only burden he feels comes from within, as he continues to look for solutions that will get Liverpool winning consistently. Steven Gerrard take a free-kick during training as Balotelli and Jordan Henderson look on . He understands, though, why there was such a reaction to events in Madrid. Had it backfired and Liverpool ended up losing heavily, the criticism would have been even more intense. That, says Rodgers, is the way of the world for a Liverpool manager. ‘The only thing I showed the other night was the trust I have in the team,’ insisted Rodgers. ‘I never feared that if I play this team we are going to end up losing 7, 8-0 and what would be the consequence of that. ‘I have never gone into a game in my life and felt that we are not going to get a result. But the thinking and the strategy that goes behind it is deep in terms of analysing the opponent. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling in action at their Melwood headquarters on Thursday . 'You have to be bold enough to make the decisions as a manager. ‘That is why you are paid the money you are paid. If you make more wrong ones than right ones you will be out of work. It’s a big risk but for me I’m happy with the decisions I make. 'My players were magnificent. I know there is a little bit of criticism about the selection, but it does a disservice to the players who played.’","Reds boss defends team selection for midweek defeat to Real Madrid .

"A drunken man in East London staggers all over the footpath before clinging onto a railing for dear life in this video as some observers in a nearby house record him in his inebriated state. The man, dressed in a red t-shirt and navy shorts, looks like he is trying to walk somewhere but every time he tries to walk forward he loses his balance and he has to hastily retreat and grab the railing. At the start of  the video the man is having such difficulty walking up the footpath it looks like he is walking on black ice. One of the men who is recording the footage says: 'Oh he's going backwards, oh don't hit your head.' On five occasions the man tries walking forward during the two minute video but each time he reaches a stage where his legs seem to take on a life of their own. The revellers in the nearby house laugh incessantly as the drunken man fails to walk forward time and time again.

And the FA Cup winners are refusing to close the door on a return for Fabregas, who still has a close relationship with manager Wenger.

"It is home to 200 of the most violent and disturbed men in the country, and has housed infamous killers such as the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and poisoner Graham Young. For more than a century the corridors and wards of Broadmoor have remained closed to the public, its practices such as using six guards to open the door for one patient a closely guarded secret. But now Broadmoor has decided to open its doors and reveal the inside of the country's highest security psychiatric hospital. Scroll down for video . Broadmoor is the UK's most secure hospital and has remained hidden from the public for the last 150 years . CCTV cameras cover the 15 wards of the Berkshire hospital to ensure staff and patients are kept safe . Pictures inside the site in Berkshire show long corridors, heavy secure doors and rooms where anything that could be turned into a weapon is removed. Security is high, with bars throughout the hospital's wards and signs warning staff they must wear personal attack alarms at all times. When they are with patients staff are told to wear body cameras. The caution is not without reason. Staff in Broadmoor are attacked on average four times a week, which can involve punching, kicking or in some cases patients fashioning plastic cutlery into knives. A kitchen in Canterbury ward shows patients' artwork on the walls, produced during monitored sessions . A view into a patients bedroom (left) and heavy secure doors, equipped with observation holes for staff (right) Around 30 times a year staff are called to disarm patients while all must have riot training and are equipped with helmets and shields. A control room with a wall covered in screens allows staff to monitor patients and workers in the hospital's 15 wards which are covered with CCTV. Security is high and is essential to safeguard staff as much as patients - most of whom will be on a combination of medication to treat psychiatric disorders. The hospital is secure, with fencing throughout, and signs warning staff to carry personal attack alarms . Broadmoor entrance gate 60 became an iconic feature, the inside of which has remained secret . Dr Amlan Basu, Clinical Director of Broadmoor, said: 'Patients that come here, they will have perpetrated often horrendous crimes but they are also victims and it's very easy to see somebody as either the perpetrator or the victim. It's much more difficult to understand that somebody might be both.' Some  are able to earn money in a tuck shop by making arts and crafts, but security has to be high to ensure any potential weapons are removed. All tools are checked in and out during every session. The inside of the secure hospital has been revealed in an ITV documentary, filmed over a year throughout the hospital. Security is high at Broadmoor Hospital, with zonal fencing, security signs and CCTV covering all the wards . Staff are reminded to take care of security as there are around four attacks every week on hospital workers . Broadmoor hospital has housed some of Britain's most notorious killers from the Victorian era and today . In Cranfield ward, notorious for its violent patients, some patients are so ill that six staff must be used to open a single cell door. The pictures and documentary have provided a rare insight into the hospital for the first time in its 150 year history. Taxpayers pay around £300,000 a year to house each patient, at a cost of £60million, the Sunday Mirror reported. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper (left), Ronnie Kray (centre picture - front), and tea poisoner Graham Young (right) have all been patients at Broadmoor in Berkshire, which houses 200 violent psychiatric patients . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe (left) is pictured with Sir Jimmy Savile (centre) and Frank Bruno at Broadmoor .

Designed by a military engineer, Broadmoor was the first custom-built asylum to house criminals when it was developed in 1863. But it has since been known as a psychiatric hospital. It may eventually be turned into a hotel as a new site is now being built next door. Broadmoor is one of three maximum security psychiatric hospitals in the UK, the others being Ashworth and Rampton.

"A schoolboy was taken out of class for a day - because teachers said his hair was too short. Jack Littlewood, 13, was punished with 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, because of his  short back and sides cut. His furious mother Amanda Brown insists the youngster has thick hair and wears it short to stop it from becoming unruly. Jack Littlewood (pictured), 13, was placed in 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, because of his short back and sides cut, his mother claims . But his short haircut was picked up on and the teenager was placed in a classroom for the day with children who had misbehaved at St Ambrose Barlow RC High School. He was issued with two days of isolation as punishment and a note was sent home explaining why. But the following day he was told to rejoin his classmates because his hair looked more acceptable. His mother has now written to the school to complain. The letter reads: 'It is disgusting he is not getting the education he is entitled to whilst in isolation and I will be taking this matter further should you inflict this punishment on him another day.' She said: 'I can understand if he had a skinhead, tramlines or had it coloured but his haircut is just a normal short back and sides.' The schoolboy's short haircut was picked up on and the teenager was placed in a classroom for the day with children who had misbehaved at St Ambrose Barlow RC High School (pictured) School rules state boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut all over. Jack has a number two clipper cut worn longer on top. Year 9 pupil Jack, who had his haircut last Saturday, arrived at St Ambrose Barlow from St George's High School in September following the closure of the high school in Walkden. Ms Brown says he was never in trouble for his hairstyle at St George's. Headteacher Marie Garside declined to comment on the matter other than to say: 'Parents are aware of the school rules before pupils start in September.' According to government guidelines, every school has a behaviour policy which sets out the conduct for pupils before and after school as well as during the school day. Scools can punish pupils if they behave badly with measures including a routine 'telling-off', a letter home, detention or confiscating something considered inapporpriate for school. But it can also include removing a pupil from a class or group. Parents have the right to complain about a punishment and must first contact the headteacher. If they are not satisfied, they can ask for a copy of the school's complaints procedure.","Jack Littlewood was placed in 'isolation' because his hair was too short .

"Top BBC shows like Doctor Who, Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing face being privatised under new cost-cutting plans at the corporation. Hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of TV programmes currently produced by the BBC will no longer be protected from outside competition under reforms announced by director general Tony Hall today. In return, Lord Hall wants the BBC's in-house production company to be free to make shows directly for other broadcasters, particularly in America, in a bid to generate millions of pounds. Shows like Top Gear are currently made by the BBC's in-house production arm. Under proposals by the corporation's chief Lord Hall, BBC producers will have to compete with private companies . Lord Hall wants more freedom for the BBC's production companies to make shows for American networks in a bid to raise more cash . Half of the shows on the BBC currently have to be made in-house, with a quarter produced by private companies. The remaining quarter of programmes are up for competition between the BBC and outside producers. But the BBC's director general Lord Hall wants private companies to be able to bid to produce all TV programmes. In return he wants the BBC's in-house production arm to be free to make shows for rival networks - particularly in the US. He hopes this will raise vital cash for the BBC to help it cope with the budget squeeze imposed by the Government through the license fee freeze. The BBC insisted its top programmes would not be 'privatised', as all the revenue generated would come back to the BBC and ploughed back into more programming. The 'competition revolution' will be announced by  Lord Hall in a speech today. Ahead of the announcement Lord Hall said: 'I want to nail this notion that somehow we are inefficient with the public’s money. 'This is a something-for-something offer where we want to change and we hope to be allowed to do so.' Implementing the changes would require the agreement of the BBC Trust, communications regulator Ofcom and the Government. Lord Hall is expected to reject calls by rival TV companies for the BBC to privatise all of its production. The BBC chief believes this would squander years of expertise - and would throw away the chance to make millions from selling TV shows abroad. But the BBC will scrap the current quota system under which at least 50 per cent of BBC programmes are made internally, 25 per cent are made by independent private companies - with the remainder open to both. Critics of the BBC claim the quota system is out of date - and that programmes could be made much more cheaply outside. Some of the corporation’s most popular programmes are already made by the private sector, including Sherlock - produced by Hartswood Films - and Question Time, which is made by Mentorn Media. The broadcaster has to find £100 million of savings - and faces further cuts when the BBC comes to renegotiate its royal charter with the Government in 2016. Lord Hall is expected to say: 'If independent producers can take their ideas to any broadcaster around the world, I would want the same for BBC Production.' The chair of Channel 4 today said he would be happy to buy programmes off the BBC. He said: 'If they are good enough and meet our remit, then of course. We already buy programmes from ITV.' But he added that Lord Hall should have done more to reform the way the BBC is funded. He said the licence fee was out-dated and called for the BBC to allow people to pick and choose what they paid for. He said: 'Can you really imagine in 30 years time there will be a licence fee.' Lord Burns said: 'What better way of having more competition than if you want a service you pay for it, if you don’t want it you don’t pay for it. That is a very old-fashioned view of competition.' Lord Hall, the Director-General of BBC, hopes the 'competition revolution' will 'nail' the idea that the Corporation squanders public cash . In May, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said 'everything' would be looked at over how to fund the BBC when its royal charter comes up after the next election. Senior Tories have previously called for the TV license - currently frozen at £145.50 a year - to be scrapped. Mr Javid’s Labour counterpart Harriet Harman has described the licence fee as 'a means to an end' and said alternatives should be considered.","BBC chief Tony Hall wants private companies to compete to make shows .

"A shipping record has emerged showing Moby Dick author Herman Melville signing up for a whaling voyage across the Pacific which would inspire him to write the American classic. Melville, then just 21 years old, is featured on a list of crew members for the Acushnet whaling vessel, which launched from New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1841. The entry includes physical characteristics of the young Melville, who was living in nearby Fairhaven before the launch. Shipping record: Melville's name (highlighted) was entered on the crew's list for a whaling vessel set to sail the Pacific, inspiring the tale of Moby Dick . Detail: Melville, then 21, was listed by name as a crewman for the Acushnet, which launched in January 1841 . Author's voyage: Scholars have attributed many of the features of Moby Dick to Melville's first-hand experience of whaling . The parchment, featured on Slate, records a brown-haired, dark-complexioned man who was around 5ft 9in tall. The record was signed off on New Year's Eve 1840 by Captain Valentine Pease, with the ship's destination listed only as 'The Pacific Ocean'. Melville, whose literary career began in 1946 with the novel Typee, would spend the next four years at sea, travelling from the Atlantic to the South Pacific, stopping in Tahiti and ending up in Hawaii, then an independent kingdom. He then enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a crew-member of the USS United States and was taken back to Boston in October 1844. There she blows! Moby Dick, one of the great American novels, is pictured above in the 1956 film version . Climactic: Pictured is the moment Captain Ahab, played by Gregory Peck, takes his spear to the White Whale . Scholars have noted parallels between Moby Dick, Melville's most famous novel, and his own experiences at sea. As well as the fact that the journey gave him first-hand experience of hunting whales over the open waters, some of his destinations have been seen as inspirations for characters in the book. In the course of his journey he lived among natives on the island of Nukahiva in the South Pacific - to which has been attributed his sympathetic portrayal of Queequeg, a Polynesian harpoonist who joins Ahab in taking on the legendary White Whale. Fantastical: Moby Dick - pictured in a 1999 British cartoon version - was obscure until after Melville's death . The hardships of the seas would also have been foremost in Melville's mind on his long journey - conditions on the Acushnet were severe enough that he deserted 18 months into the proposed four-year journey. His writing career drew heavily on sea-going themes - his first novel, Typee, was an account of living with the Polynesian natives, and proved so popular in his lifetime that it demanded a sequel, Omoo. Moby Dick itself followed in 1851. Though it was acclaimed during his lifetime by many prominent literary figures, it sold poorly during his lifetime, and only became a literary sensation decades later.","Document emerged showing Melville as sailor on the Acushnet in 1840 .

"Hollywood superstar Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton have swapped the usual glamour of the Hollywood Hills and snapped up a little piece of paradise on the Hawksbury River in northern Sydney. It's no surprise the creative pair have opted for a rather unusual location as their new weekend hideaway from the prying eyes of the paparazzi. Word got out in August that the twice-Academy award winning actress and her playwright husband had purchased the stunning three floor wooden property which backs onto beautiful bushland. Scroll down for video . Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton purchased their dream property in August . The three-floor waterfront home is tucked away in the beauty and seclusion of Berowra Waters on Berowra Creek, a tributary of the Hawkesbury River . The home, which the couple purchased for $1,495,000, has stunning river views . Local agent John Moxham told the Sydney Morning Herald 'there's not a lot of bling down here'. Mr Moxham would not reveal the identity of the new occupiers but also told the SMH 'whenever anyone moves here or even if they're just renting, we all know about it very quickly'. With only 150 homes built in the secluded location sources say word was rife in August when the famous pair signed the contracts that a pair of celebrities might be the new residents. The home the Lord of the Rings star Blanchett and Upton have bought has a one bedroom self contained unit on the bottom floor. The second and third floor consist of three bedrooms, living and dining rooms that have spectacular waterfront views with a timber stainless-steel kitchen perfect for entertaining guests.

"A stay-at-home dad in Florida who shot dead two of his children and wounded a third before killing himself was in the midst of a nasty divorce from his wife and had asked a judge for a protective order claiming she was the violent one. David Mohney claimed his wife Cynthia was a violent, abusive alcoholic in court papers filed just two months before he gunned down his children Friday in their quiet, middle-class neighborhood just south of Daytona Beach. He wanted to leave his wife and take the family back to his hometown in South Dakota, police say. However, neighbors said both parents were troubled. In a 911 call before the shooting, a neighbor told a dispatcher that neither parent should have had children because they were 'a little bit selfish and self-centered' and said 'you can't believe either one of them.' Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A father killed two of his children,  14-year-old Savanna (left) and 11-year-old David, and critically injured 9-year-old Lauren before killing himself in their upscale Florida home . Survivor: The wife was at the house of a neighbor trying to get help in their Port Orange, Florida, neighborhood when the shooting occurred while the children were asleep at the home . The slayings occurred as David and Cynthia Mohney were entrenched in a bitter divorce after nearly 25 years of marriage. Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with their children to South Dakota. He had recently finished chiropractic school while she supported the family working as a physician's assistant, making $220,000. Nearly a month after he filed for divorce, the husband sought a protective injunction against his wife June 3. He said in court papers his wife had been drinking heavily and slapping him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia Mohney had recently been treated for substance abuse. After the couple's fight Friday morning, Cynthia Mohney fled to a neighbor's house to get help. In the 911 call, she can be heard crying hysterically, saying 'Oh my god!' repeatedly, as her unidentified neighbor talks to a police dispatcher. When the dispatcher asks if she thinks her husband will harm the children, she said, 'Yes, he will.' The slain children were 11-year-old David Mohney and 14-year-old Savanna Mohney, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. Nine-year-old Lauren Mohney was also was shot and in stable condition at a hospital. Cynthia Mohney wasn't injured. 'If he wants to commit suicide, let him commit suicide. To shoot the children, that's cowardly,' Johnson said at a news conference outside the family's home. Deputies received a call at 5:11am Friday. Arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boy in a bedroom on the first floor. Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him. In court papers, David Mohney said he and his children 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' Pictured: victim Savanna Mohney, 14 . In his divorce filing, David Mohney said his family moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange. He graduated in September 2013, but failed his first time taking the board exam and hoped to try again soon. He said in the court papers that returning to Rapid City, South Dakota, had been his family's plan all along, but his wife had become opposed to it. He said his children also wanted to make the 1,900-mile move to get relief from their allergies and because they found the Midwest region better suited their 'morals and values.' David Mohney said he and his children also 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife. He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction June 3. Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with daughter Savanna (pictured) and her siblings to South Dakota . In that filing, David Mohney cited four instances between April 4 and May 29 in which he said his wife had slapped one or more of their children. He said his wife would hit the children — sometimes several times — for arguing with each other, talking back to her, or for not picking up their toys and clothes when she told them to. 'The ""hits"" described in the examples are loud and hard, beyond corporal punishment,' David Mohney wrote. 'My children were crying, afraid and trying to duck or get away from Cynthia.' However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it. The state's child abuse hotline was notified in June that Cynthia Mohney had a substance abuse problem after an incident at a restaurant. Cynthia Mohney followed through on treatment, according to the Department of Children and Families.","David Mohney shot his three children and then himself in a tragic murder-suicide in Florida, killing his son David and daughter Savanna .

"Mike Betts received the money as boss of Motability Operations . A £1million bonus paid to the boss of a firm providing cars for the disabled should be investigated by Parliament, MPs said today. The payouts to Mike Betts, the chief executive of Motability Operations, could be probed by the Public Accounts Committee over doubts about value for money for taxpayers. Motability Operations leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people. It receives their mobility allowances direct from the Department for Work and Pensions. In the year to September last year Mr Betts was paid a basic salary of £501,900, the Sunday Times reported. He also received a standard performance bonus of £245,850 and a long-term incentive payment of £666,065, based on 'high levels of customer satisfaction, excellent business culture, lease affordability and renewal levels'. There were other unspecified benefits of £24,444. There is particular criticism because Motability Operations relies on income from disabled people who receive government benefits and choose to spend it on the scheme. Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Times: 'It is difficult to justify a pay packet which is many times greater than that of the prime minister for the chief executive of a not-for-profit company providing cars for the disabled.' Labour MP John Mann also objected to the bonus being paid, and called for it to be looked at by the Public Accounts Committee. Motability Operations is owned by Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, and overseen by registered charity Motability. In its annual report, the company boasts that it is guaranteed an income stream with 'minimal credit risk'. Mr Betts, who has been chief executive since 2003, is the highest-paid director. There have been concerns raised about the checks made before leasing or selling vehicles under the Motability scheme, with claims friends and family some claimants were using the vehicles for their own use. Lord Sterling, the chairman and co-founder of the Motability charity, told the newspaper: 'Mike Betts is one of the most able executives I have ever come across. 'He is worth every penny he is paid. He runs Motability Operations with extremely high service levels which provide empathy and support for its disabled customers well beyond the norm.' Motability Operations leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people . Neil Johnson, chairman of Motability Operations, said: 'Mike Betts is an outstanding [chief executive officer] who has succeeded in leading MotabilityOperations over the last decade transforming the culture to achieve consistently high rates of customer satisfaction and value for money. 'The Motability scheme is unique. I and my board believe an exceptional chief executive is required to continue to ensure the business succeeds in achieving the scale and discipline needed to meet the distinctive needs of disabled people.'","Mike Betts received the money as boss of Motability Operations .

"A 15-year-old girl has been caught driving her drunk father home, after police noticed the man was not wearing a seatbelt. The pair were pulled over in the Darwin suburb of Winnellie on Friday, where officers learnt that the drunk father forced his daughter to drive him home. The teenager and her intoxicated father were on their way to Humpty Doo, 40 kilometres from Darwin city. A 15-year-old girl has been caught driving her drunk father home, after police noticed the man was not wearing a seatbelt . Superintendent Rob Burgoyne has condemned the father's actions. 'Getting an underage person to drive is obviously not the way to go,' he said. 'No matter what the situation is and how much experience the young person has it's just not something that you should put someone that young under pressure to do.' Northern Territory Police said the 15-year-old is expected to face court. The incident has prompted Superintendent Burgoyne to remind drivers to be safe over the Christmas period, the ABC reports. 'With the festive season coming up it's something that should be put right out of the mind,' he said. 'If they are a bit over the limit they should either get a sober driver or get a taxi or some form of other transport.'

"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the two best players in world football, but Gareth Bale is the heir to the throne. There is no doubt he can be the best player on the planet in five years’ time. What Bale has achieved in his first  season at Real Madrid is nothing short of sensational. To go to a new club, a new country and an entirely new culture and perform as he has done is remarkable. He was not at his best on Saturday night but big players change games and that’s exactly what he’s done. He scored a wonder goal to win the Copa del Rey last month and made the crucial  breakthrough in extra time in the  Champions League. The heir: Real Madrid star Gareth Bale will become the best player in the world in five years' time . The very best: Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi (right) are considered the finest players in the world . Devastating: Bale and Ronaldo have both been exceptional for Real Madrid this season . He wasted some good chances in  Lisbon but if you want an indicator of the impact he had, just look at Filipe Luis. The Atletico Madrid left back has been excellent but he won’t have run as hard all season. By the end of the game he was on the floor with cramp. That’s what happens when you spend your evening chasing Gareth Bale’s shadow. Explosive pace has always been Bale’s primary weapon, but now he is the  complete player. His raw speed makes him so hard to defend against but it’s his technique at high speed that now sets him apart. The cap fits: Bale has proved he can match Ronaldo's backwards baseball cap look off the pitch . Ripped: Ronaldo celebrates his goal in the Champions League final by tearing off his shirt . Spot the difference: Bale's celebration after netting against Atletico was not dissimilar to Ronaldo's . Technically the best: Ronaldo blasts a rocket shot at goal while in action for Madrid . Almost as good: Bale shows he can use his right foot just as well as his favoured left . On the charge: Bale (left) and Ronaldo (right) carry the attack for Real Madrid with a rampaging run . Match winner: Bale is now the complete power, with excellent technique along with explosive pace . Chasing shadows: Filipe Luis is an excellent defender but he was run ragged by the Welshman . He can play anywhere across the front, score with his left or right foot and with his head. He has a fantastic leap and he showed it by being in the right place at the right time to score against Atletico. The frightening thing is he is still learning the game. Playing alongside and studying Ronaldo, he can only get better. Bale is so strong in the air but imagine if he attacked crosses with the same aggression as  Ronaldo — he could be impossible to stop. I remember seeing him play in the Southampton youth team when I was at the club. Most of the talk then was about a young Theo Walcott, but there was also a dark-haired kid who was a pretty handy left back. Passive: Bale is good in the air but he needs to be more aggressive when he attacks the ball . Flourished: Bale has come a long way since his time as a left back for Southampton . He was very shy but once he came out of his shell it did not take long to realise you were in the presence of somebody special. It was the same at Tottenham when he started to play further forward and was  shredding defences for fun. That shy young left back has transformed into quite a man. Bale now has the world at his feet but he remains that rarest of things: a humble superstar. I’m sure if he wanted to whip his shirt off and celebrate Ronaldo-style he’d look just as good, but that’s not how he is. Welsh dragon: Bale celebrates his goal in the Champions League final with Atletico on Saturday, the header putting his team 2-1 up in extra time . Sensational: Ronaldo looks to the heavens in triumph after Real beat Atletico to win their 10th European Cup . Copycats: Bale celebrates with arms outstretched after scoring at the Estadio da Luz, while Ronaldo (below) went topless for his carbon copy celebration . Trendsetters: Bale and Ronaldo share the same tastes in fashion, especially for the backwards baseball cap . Technique: Ronaldo (above) and Bale (below) generate speed and spin when striking the ball . He is just a lovely kid and is the exception to those who say you need a mean streak to succeed in football. When you watch him play, you can still see the wonder in his eyes as if he’s thinking: ‘Blimey, I’m playing for Real Madrid.’ That is every football fan’s dream but he’s not just playing for Madrid, he’s starring for them. Crowded out: Both Ronaldo (above) and Bale (below) possess the ability to fire off shots even in the busiest of penalty areas . Humble superstar: Bale has now been instrumental in Real Madrid winning two trophies in his debut season . When he made the move last summer, I was full of admiration. Playing for a club like Real is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it takes a lot of courage to move abroad and plenty have failed in the past. Bale’s debut season has been like a fairytale. Ronaldo was 24 when he moved to Madrid and he scored 33 goals in his opening season, 11 more than Bale. But there is one big difference between the two:  Ronaldo won nothing whereas Bale has two trophies to his name. Expectations at Real Madrid are always sky-high, but that is some way to announce yourself. It’s just a shame we are unlikely to see Bale play at his peak in a World Cup because, make no  mistake, he has everything needed to become the best player in the world.","Real Madrid team-mate Ronaldo and Barcelona rival are undoubtedly the two best players in the world, but the Welshman is next in line .

"A man arrested in the killings of two women in a Denver apartment on Wednesday told investigators that he doesn't remember why he allegedly shot his roommate and her friend. The two women shot and killed Wednesday night have been identified as 19-year-old Amanda Anders and her friend, 22-year-old Nancy Worrell. The Denver Medical Examiner says both women were shot multiple times. Jose King was arrested shortly after the shooting by Castle Rock officers doing a welfare check when King's father asked them to check on him after he had an unusual visit from his son. 'I don't remember': Alleged murderer of two women, Jose King, told police that he doesn't remember why 'he shot his roommate and her friend' The Denver Post reported that after the shooting, King allegedly fled to his parents' home in Castle Rock and met with his father. He kept 'apologizing for something that he had done and saying he came to say goodbye,' the affidavit said. King was later discovered by police driving around half-naked in an SUV. That's when he allegedly told police that he had 'done a bad thing tonight.' He also asked police to take him to jail. Police say King had been apologizing and saying goodbye. Roommate: Jose King allegedly killed his roommate Amanda J. Anders after arguing about something he told police that he doesn't remember . Roommate's friend: Nancy Worrell, 22, was at her friend Amanda J. Anders' house the night that she was shot . Anders' father, Steven Anders, said she was independent, living on her own and chasing her dreams. She always wanted to be an artist and was a student at Metro State University. According to her Facebook page, Worrell was a culinary student. King is being held without bond. He was in court for his first advisement Friday morning and will likely be formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder sometime next week. Overwhelmed next-door neighbor Basil Jaddoa told reporters he heard blood curdling screams at King's home and gun shots before going to investigate. He found the women sprawled out dead in the apartment's doorway, laying in a pool of their own  blood, he said. 'There was blood everywhere,' Jaddoa said. Other neighbors told reporters that they were very alarmed and that the incident was unexpected.","Jose King was arrested in connection to the shooting of roommate 19-year-old Amanda Anders and her friend, 22-year-old Nancy Worrell .

"One of the world's most successful music moguls has confessed to turning down a long list of acts who went on to become world-famous superstars. Chris Wright, 69, who founded the Chrysalis media group and signed stars including Blondie and Spandau Ballet, rejected both David Bowie and the Spice Girls at the start of their ultimately highly lucrative careers. He also said no to Dire Straits, The Kinks, the musical Cats, Popstars talent show and 80s synthesiser hero Jean Michel Jarre. Chris Wright, founder of Chrysalis, has spilled the beans on some of his greatest business regrets in his new book . Mr Wright, a former owner of Queen's Park Rangers football club, who sold Chrysalis for £107million in 2010, admitted to his litany of misses in his new autobiography, One Way Or Another, which is published today. Describing one of his 'head in hands moments', Wright told how he pretended to be out when David Bowie pestered him about his Hunky Dory album, which includes seminal hits Changes and Oh You Pretty Things. Wright told the Independent: 'He was in our office in Oxford Street all the time, often pleading with us for money to go and make demos. Our receptionist would ring around and we would all pretend to be out.' He did decide, however, to take a 25 per cent share of the singer's publishing rights. Mr Wright said the Spice Girls rushed into his office miming their future hit Wannabe, and ended up sitting on the chief executive's knee, after which he decided not to raise a £250,000 bid for them on the basis that he believed only one of them could sing and none had any song-writing ability. Rejected: Mr Wright turned down both David Bowie, left, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit musical Cats, right . Mr Wright said he turned down Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats because he wasn't sure he could write a hit without Tim Rice.  Cats is now the second longest-running musical in Broadway history and the fourth longest-running show in the West End, and the music producer acknowledges that his decision ranked as one of his 'very worst'. Another one he particularly regrets was letting the New Zealand TV show Popstars pass him by after deciding that the show, which inspired Pop Idol, was 'garbage'. The mogul said he passed up a chance to sign the Kinks after he dozed off during their show in New Orleans, while he dismissed Dire Straits as 'very good but very, very boring'. But despite all the rejections, he made more good business decisions than bad, and is currently said to be worth more than £70million.

"An extremely rare sculpture that captured the essence of a postwar world is set to fetch at least $100 million in New York next month as the city's art market looks set for another blockbuster season. Alberto Giacometti's Chariot, conceived and cast in 1950, is a five-foot bronze and wood sculpture of an elongated female figure perched on a chariot with two large wheels. It is one of 10 artworks that are slated to land $500 million for Sotheby's and Christie's at the Impressionist and modern art fair on November 4. Blockbuster: Alberto Giacometti's 1951 bronze sculpture Chariot is slated to land $100 million next month . Record: The Swiss artist's Walking Man sold for a record $104 million in 2010 at the height of the recession . Giacometti's masterpiece was seen by many as a symbol of the anxiety felt across the world following the Second World War, balancing between movement and stasis - though the Swiss artist said it was inspired by a 'glistening trolley cart'. And auctioneers at Sotheby's insist they are confident it will match or surpass the world-record Giacometti sale of his Walking Man, which went for $104 million at the height of the recession in 2010. It will go under the hammer alongside Amedeo Modigliani's Tete, which is slated to land $45 million. Modigliani's two-foot-tall sculpture of a woman's head wearing a tribal mask with her hair swept back has never appeared at auction. The Italian artist carved the delicate piece between 1911 and 1912 using a block of limestone scavenged from a construction site in Paris. Meanwhile, Christie's has announced a predicted $130 million sale for Andy Warhol's prints of Marlon Brando and Elvis. The extremely rare sales have excited the market as it appears many see art as a worthwhile investment despite an uncertain economy. In demand: Amedeo Modigliani's limestone carving, Tete, is expected to go for $45 million at the Sotheby's sale . Popular: Andy Warhol's Elvis, which sold for $44m in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis, is on sale again . 'It's beyond belief,' said Suzanne Gyorgy, head of art advisory and finance at New York-based Citigroup Inc.'s Citi Private Bank. She told Bloomberg: 'We are still in the same cycle where tremendous wealth is being generated around the world and people are looking for hard assets like art and real estate.' Last November, a Francis Bacon triptych became the most expensive artwork sold at auction, fetching $142.4 million. But with catalogues yet to be printed - and many artworks still yet to be confirmed - analysts predict similar excitement this fall.","Albert Giacometti's Chariot expected to land $100m with Sotheby's .

"David Luiz is on the brink of joining Paris St Germain in the next 48 hours in a sensational deal that could cost the French superpower close to £50million. Exact terms are still to be thrashed out by the clubs, but the transfer of the 27-year-old Chelsea star will be the world's most expensive for a defender, beating the previous two highest fees - both paid by PSG, for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva.

"A Slacks Creek family who lost 11 relatives - including eight children - in a devastating house fire three years ago are calling for the mandatory installation of a $49 smoke alarm in homes across Australia. Jeremiah Lale lost his wife and five children, while Tau Taufa suffered the loss of his wife, three granddaughters and niece on August 24, 2011, at a Wagensveldt Street home - south of Brisbane. Mr Taufa's daughter, Tracey, was also left behind after the tragic deaths. The victims of the fire were Fusikalau Taufa, Neti-Teukisia Lale, Anamalia Taufu, Jerry Lale, Paul Lale, Ardelle Lee, Lafoa'i Lale, Selamafi Lale, Richard Lale, La'Haina Matauaina and Kahlani Matauaina. Scroll down for video . The 11 victims of the Slacks Creek fire, which included Fusikalau Taufa, Neti-Teukisia Lale, Anamalia Taufu, Jerry Lale, Paul Lale, Ardelle Lee, Lafoa'i Lale, Selamafi Lale, Richard Lale, La'Haina Matauaina and Kahlani Matauaina . The fire started on August 24, 2011 at the Wagensveldt Street home - south of Brisbane . Family members tried to save their relatives from the devastating blaze . And now the trio want authorities to make the installation of photoelectric smoke alarms mandatory in homes instead of ionic ones - which are in place in 90 per cent of Australian households. The Slacks Creek fire started at midnight while Mr Taufa was still awake on August 24, 2011. He told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes he saw a 'mist of smoke' coming from his office. 'I called out to my two son-in-laws to come down and help me,' Mr Taufa said. 'I grabbed the house and tried to put the fire out.' Tau Taufa and his daughter, Tracey, who has called for photoelectric smoke alarms to be mandatory in homes across Australia . The grave sites of the Lales who died three years ago in Australia's deadliest house fire . Mr Taufa's son-in-law, Jeremiah Lale, described the scene as 'very dark' and 'very hot' with smoke so thick he could not see into the house. Mr Lale called out his wife's and children's names to see if they were inside but when there was no answer he jumped out the window, thinking they had made their escapes. 'I tried to come back to the house but the fire was everywhere,' he said. Since his family's death, Mr Lale arrives at the cemetery where they are buried every morning at 6am to sit for several hours at their grave sites. Jeremiah Lale is embraced by a friend or relative on the day he lost his family at Slacks Creek . Here Jeremiah Lale is comforted by friends after collapsing in the street in front of photographs . The Wagensveldt Street scene on August 24, 2011 as friends and family of the victims await news of their loved ones . 'At the cemetery I sitting there and cry and keep talking to them. I tell them: ""I know you can hear me but I can't hear you"",' he said. Tracey Taufa lost her daughter, mother, sister, aunt, two nieces and five cousins that August night. She has pleaded with authorities to make photo-electric smoke alarms a requirement in all homes. 'I want everybody to purchase photo-electric smoke alarms to be installed in every single home and to be made mandatory in Australia and hopefully the world,' Ms Taufa urged people through tears. 'It will save a lot of lives. I just to hope to God nobody goes through what we went through.' Fire safety experts are calling for photoelectric smoke alarms to be made mandatory in households . Northern Territory Assistant Fire Commissioner Grant Hamon (left) and fire safety expert David Isaac (right) say photoelectric smoke alarms are more effective . But Australian Building Codes Board's Neil Savery believes there is not enough evidence to make the change . And fire safety expert David Isaac agrees and has been pushing the cause for nearly a decade. In a fire demonstration on 60 Minutes where a soldering iron is used to simulate a still-burning cigarette setting a couch alight, it takes seven minutes for a photoelectric smoke alarm to detect the smoke. But this is not the case with a ionic one. Even after reporter Karl Stefanovic and Northern Territory Assistant Fire Commissioner Grant Hamon - who was running the demonstration - were evacuated after 15 minutes when fumes became too 'toxic', the ionic smoke alarm remained silent. Photoelectric smoke alarms were made mandatory in NT in November 2011. Mr Hamon said there was enough evidence to persuade emergency service authorities to make the change permanent. He said it was required in every residence in the state, including demountables, caravans, transportables and safari-style tents. Asked whether or not the move had been effective, Mr Hamon said it was 'early days yet but anything to save lives. In a fire simulation on 60 Minutes, photoelectric smoke alarms were more react . David Isaac wants to see this requirement imposed in every state in Australia, saying it would drive down numbers of house fire deaths, which is 50 to 150 people a year. 'Typically people who die in house fires die while they’re asleep from fires that develop from a long-smouldering phase, which could be an electrical fault, could be a cigarette on a couch, could be clothes in a dryer and the dryer has malfunctioned,' Mr Isaac said. 'The time when the occupants need to get the warning [is] before the house fills with smoke.' Ionic alarms were installed inside the home the Lales and Taufas died in, and had been turned off because they had gone off at the wrong times. But Mr Isaac said there was 'no doubt' in his mind that if a photoelectric alarm instead it would not have been disconnected. 'There’s no doubt in my mind if [the Lales and Taufas] had a photoelectric smoke alarm in that home they would not have been disconnected... and would have given precious minutes of advanced notice of a fire,' he said. Mr Isaac said people could prevent a tragedy such as the Slacks Creek fire from happening again by buying a four-pack of photoelectric smoke alarms from the hardware store for $49. But the Australian Building Codes Board - who decided the smoke alarm requirements of homes - are hesitant to make photoelectrics mandatory in households, despite it being so for commercial buildings, including hospitals, shopping centres and hotels. 'It has not been demonstrated to the board’s satisfaction that one performs better in all circumstances than the other,' the board's Neil Savery told 60 Minutes. 'Ultimately if there is an overwhelming body of evidence that that's the case then the board would obviously give that serious consideration but it won't be reflected as mandating necessarily a particular product.'","The Slacks Creek fire happened south of Brisbane on August 24, 2011 .

"The longest strike in Air France history finally ended yesterday - at a cost of some £280m, and 150,000 passengers having their flights cancelled. The horrendous figures heap further humiliation on Francois Hollande’s Socialist government which proved itself powerless to end the industrial action. Pilots and other airline staff have still not resolved their differences with management and are set to withdraw their labour all over again. The longest strike in Air France history finally ended yesterday - at a cost of some £280m . Passengers wait in an airport lounge in the south of Paris, as an Air France plane sits on the runway - 150,000 passengers had their flights cancelled during the strikes . Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister, admitted that the 14-day strike had ‘penalised passengers, the company and the country’s economy’. He said all sides in the dispute needed to ‘regain the confidence of everyone and resume the development of Air France and its subsidiary Transavia.’ The strike centred on Air France’s attempts to introduce their own low-cost subsidiary Transavia - a move which has raised fears about job security. Air France pilots, who in some cases earn more than £200,000 a year, fear the move into the budget market will also threaten their salaries and working hours. Negotiations will continue, but bosses said everything should be back to normal today. The protest saw half of Air France’s fleet grounded, and saw some 110,000 tourists and 30,000 business passengers having their flights cancelled. Many more were delayed. The massive financial loss will ensure that the already fragile company is in the red for the sixth consecutive year. Air France general director Frederic Gagey speaks at a press conference; the company's share price plunged 15 per cent since the stoppage began . The pilots are fighting to avoid being forced to accept less attractive working conditions at Transavia, which serves holiday destinations, and competes with Ryanair and easyJet. A Transavia captain can earn up to £140,000 a year but pilots significantly more flights than one flying for Air France. The French republic holds a 16 percent stake in Air France-KLM, the second-largest European carrier after Germany’s Lufthansa. Air France’s share price plunged nearly 15 percent since the stoppage began and the protest caused huge concern in France, which is currently in deep economic trouble. A joint statement from key industry unions included travel operators warned the strike was ‘catastrophic for the French aviation sector’. The statement reads: ‘In a more than morose economic context, it is compromising a future that is already seriously under threat. While the strike is officially now over, unions have warned that there can be another withdrawal of labour at almost any time.","But pilots and other airline staff still haven't resolved all their differences .

In honor of this year's show, which will mark a milestone in the history of the Fantasy Bra with not one, but two of the designs being modeled on the catwalk by models Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio, FEMAIL takes a look back at all 19 Fantasy Bra designs. The first Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra was designed in 1996 and modeled by Claudia Schiffer on the cover of the brand's Christmas catalogue, however it was never used in the catwalk show, reportedly because of the incredible security risk involved in showcasing such a valuable item. Ironically, the $1million is the cheapest Fantasy Bra ever to have been designed by the brand and pales in comparison to some of the more recent lingerie sets featured in recent years. Although Victoria's Secret continued to design a new Fantasy Bra each year following the success of its original 1996 design, it wasn't until 2001 that the concept was included in the brand's annual catwalk show. Model Heidi Klum, who has had the honor of modeling the Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra on three occasions, was the first Angel to wear one of the designs on the catwalk. The most expensive Fantasy Bra design was valued at $15million and holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive lingerie ever created. It was modeled by Gisele Bündchen in 2000 and was made of red satin decorated with more than 300 carats of Thai rubies. THE FANTASY BRAS AND THEIR MODELS . 1996 The Million Dollar Miracle Bra .

"Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Mario Balotelli, Dejan Lovren, Jordan Henderson and Glen Johnson returned to Liverpool's starting XI . So, was it worth it? In a word, no. Brendan Rodgers erred on the side of caution against Real Madrid on Tuesday, dropping seven players in the Champions League match to focus on qualifying for next year's competition. Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and five other regulars were removed from Liverpool's starting XI at the Bernabeu,  saved from a defeat that seemed inevitable against the European champions. That sacrifice in Madrid was all for the benefit of Jose Mourinho's visit to Anfield on Saturday, but it made little difference as Mario Balotelli and Co looked mediocre against a ruthless Chelsea side. Brendan Rodgers erred on the side of caution against Real Madrid on Tuesday with the Chelsea game in mind . Chelsea beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield to leave Rodgers' side 15 points adrift of the Premier League leaders . 1-0 loss vs Real Madrid at the Bernabeu: . Mignolet, Moreno, Toure, Skrtel, Manquillo, Can, Lucas, Lallana, Allen, Markovic, Borini . 2-1 loss vs Chelsea at Anfield: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Gerrard, Can, Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Balotelli . Win, and Rodgers could have been hailed a tactical genius. Lose, and Liverpool would be 15 points shy of the Barclays Premier League leaders with a quarter of the season gone. In the end, it seems the Liverpool manager all but forfeited a game at the Bernabeu to lose at home against Chelsea four days later. Gerrard, Sterling, Balotelli, Philippe Coutinho, Dejan Lovren, Jordan Henderson and Glen Johnson were those to return to the starting XI. Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League since making his £16million move from AC Milan, and his Match Zone statistics speak volumes. The striker did not manage a shot on or off target, and did not create a single chance or a cross. The former Manchester City striker was, however, caught offside four times as his heat map shows he barely registered a touch in the visitors' box. Rodgers has little option but to stand by his £16m investment while Daniel Sturridge is injured after undergoing calf surgery. Mario Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League since making his £16million move from AC Milan . Balotelli was substituted in the second half for Rickie Lambert as Liverpool lost 2-1 against Chelsea . Balotelli's heat map shows the Liverpool striker barely got near Chelsea's goal on Saturday at Anfield . Kolo Toure, who kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet at the Bernabeu, was dropped in favour of Dejan Lovren against Chelsea. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp felt for those that were held back with the Chelsea match in mind, saying: 'When you grow up, you dream about playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu.' Sterling got to experience that unique feeling for 21 minutes as a second-half substitute on Tuesday night, but the 19-year-old is another going through an unfortunate spell at Liverpool. He has not scored in  12 games for club and country and,  with his only shot of the match on Saturday, could not outwit Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from inside the box. Sterling has struggled to reproduce the spark that terrorised teams in the Premier League last year. He continues to be frustrated following the debate over his fitness during England international duty. At the back, Kolo Toure, a man that  kept Cristiano Ronaldo relatively quiet on the Ballon d'Or winner's own patch, was dropped in favour of Lovren, who failed to keep a lid on Chelsea's Diego Costa with fellow centre-back Martin Skrtel. Liverpool captain Gerrard, whose infamous slip in this fixture last year led Mourinho to insist it 'gave the title to Manchester City', was left frustrated against the boys in blue once more. Raheem Sterling got 21 minutes against Real Madrid but the 19-year-old is another going through a tough spell . Sterling has struggled to reproduce the spark that terrorised teams in the Premier League last season . Sterling had plenty of action down the left but could not take his one chance against Chelsea on Saturday . Gerrard and his regular first-team peers were denied a full outing on one of the biggest stages in football at the Bernabeu, and for what? To register their third defeat in the space of seven days. Liverpool lost against Newcastle United at St James' Park last week and  face Crystal Palace next at Selhurst Park. It is the stadium where they squandered a three-goal lead last year to draw 3-3, which all but confirmed their title death and left the now-departed Luis Suarez in tears. Challenging for the Premier League title is almost certainly out of the question for Rodgers, who must now put all his energy into qualifying for the Champions League once more.

"Strasbourg was in retreat last night over its instruction to Britain to give prisoners the vote as Tories threatened to walk away from the institution. The Council of Europe expressed ‘profound concern and disappointment’ that ministers had ignored its repeated demands to allow convicts to take part in elections. But instead of threatening the UK with legal action, the council booted the issue into the long grass until September 2015 – after Britain’s general election. John Hirst, who served 25 years in jail for murdering his landlady with an axe, says Britain is wrongly denying prisoners a vote in May's general election . MPs said Strasbourg had been spooked by Tory threats to leave the court’s jurisdiction if it continued to ride roughshod over the will of Parliament . They believe the Committee of Ministers, which oversees the court and is in charge of ensuring its verdicts are upheld, is quietly backing down because it does not want to inflame the row further. Tory Dominic Raab said: ‘This just shows Britain can defend its democratic rights in the face of the arbitrary meddling of the Strasbourg court without facing fines, compensation awards or anything more than the mildest diplomatic ruffling of feathers.’ British ministers have repeatedly expressed their anger at the court’s decision in 2005 to give inmates the vote. Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have both made it clear that if the court does not change, the UK must be ready to leave. Tory proposals to reassert the sovereignty of Parliament over the court will be included in the party’s election manifesto. These are likely to be backed by a formal threat to quit. MPs said Strasbourg had been spooked by Tory threats to leave the court’s jurisdiction if it continued to ride roughshod over the will of Parliament . Since ministers began talking tough, Strasbourg’s stance has changed markedly. Last month, the court lifted the threat of a multi-million-pound compensation bandwagon for inmates who have been waiting to vote. It held to its condemnation of the centuries-old British practice, despite the dissenting opinion of two of the judges, who said that the court’s thinking was a mess and that there was nothing wrong with the law in Britain. The prisoner who won the original Euro court ruling was John Hirst, who killed his landlady with an axe in Burghfield, Berkshire, in 1979. Hirst, who served 25 years behind bars, has continued his campaign despite being freed in 2004. But the judges said there would be no compensation payment for any of the ten Scottish prisoners who lodged test cases. They said the satisfaction of knowing the court had upheld their complaint was enough. Tory MPs are likely to point to the change in Strasbourg’s position as evidence of what can be achieved if a European institution takes Britain’s threat to leave seriously. David Cameron is under pressure to make a similar commitment that, if he cannot secure significant reform from Brussels, he is prepared to campaign for a so-called Brexit – or British exit. However, in a sign of mounting tensions within the party, William Hague last night warned fellow Tories to stop saying they would vote to leave the EU. The former party leader urged colleagues not to get ‘distracted’ by banging the drum for leaving but simply concentrate on promising voters a referendum. Mr Cameron has promised an in-out vote on Britain’s membership in 2017 if the Tories win the general election in May. Labour and the Lib Dems do not support a referendum. The Prime Minister has said that if his party wins, he will spend two years negotiating with other European countries to get a better deal for Britain and would then campaign to stay in the EU. But several Tory backbenchers plan to tell constituents they will vote to leave Europe. MP Mark Reckless said this month: ‘My election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the EU.’","Council of Europe says convicts should be allowed to take part in elections .

"Jack Ellis, 20, who had Aspergers and was diabetic, is believed to have died from a self-inflicted overdose at a supported housing flat for vulnerable adults . A tormented young Asperger's sufferer killed himself and lay dead in his flat for up to a week after he was mercilessly taunted and threatened over his sexuality. Jack Ellis, 20, who was also diabetic, is believed to have deliberately overdosed while at his home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. He had been living at a supported housing flat for vulnerable adults and his family say that he was supposed to be regularly monitored. His body was found on March 8 with a suicide note - but the delay in finding him meant tests could not reveal his precise cause of death, an inquest heard. Mr Ellis had been visiting his GP, Cordelia Feuchtwang, with mental health conditions for four years and often saw her once a week while she liaised with his teachers, social worker and other medical teams. In a tense inquest, his distraught mother Helen, 57, accused Dr Feuchtwang of failing her son. She shouted across the court: 'You failed him. All of you people, you failed him.' An emotional Dr Feuchtwang solemnly replied: 'I think at some level we have all failed him. I feel sad about that.' The inquest at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, heard that Mr Ellis was bullied over his sexuality at college, over Facebook and via text. He was left with a bloody and scratched face after he was physically attacked by one thug just six weeks before his death. His mother, flanked by daughters Rebecca Weeks, 39, and Amber Camm, 27, told the inquest: 'She (Dr Feuchtwang) never got together with the people who were involved with him. 'There was no multi-disciplinary hearing. She never went to see where he lived. The social worker, they failed him. They didn't know how long he laid dead in that room.' Dr Feuchtwang, who works at a surgery in Yatton, Somerset, replied: 'It's true he didn't have a multi-disciplinary team all in the same room, but we all spent a lot of time speaking on the phone about Jack. 'I think that looking after Jack for several years, there were many times I contacted the mental health team and had long discussions. 'I was also in contact with his teachers and his social worker.' Mr Ellis, who was a train enthusiast, first visited his doctor in August 2009 when he was 16 to talk about how we was being bullied over his sexuality. He had previously tried to overdose and Dr Feuchtwang and his diabetes nurse had limited his prescriptions to make sure he never had more than a week's supply of medication. She told the inquest he also confided feeling depressed over being sexually assaulted by a man involved in the 'train system' a number of years ago. 'He told me about his sexuality and the fact that he got bullied about it,' the GP added. Mr Ellis's mother, Helen, said that her son had been 'failed by everyone' while speaking at the inquest in Flax Bourton Coroner's Court (above), near Bristol . 'He was quite worried about how he would cope at sixth form and how his temper got him into trouble at school.' Speaking about a meeting in January this year, she added: 'He had just been assaulted. He was being pursued by people on Facebook. People sent him threatening messages, I think on text.' But she said he was 'more positive than normal' during what would become their final appointment in February. Mr Ellis's mother Helen last saw her son on March 3 for lunch, but when he did not reply to texts and calls for five days she visited his flat, run by housing association Curo for vulnerable people. She called an ambulance when she could not rouse him and paramedics discovered Mr Ellis dead in bed next to a stack of papers containing a suicide note. A post mortem revealed he could have been dead for a week. Recording a narrative verdict, senior coroner Maria Voisin said she could not be sure of suicide, but added: 'On the balance of probability, Jack Ellis died due to a self inflicted over dose.' Speaking after the inquest, his sister Rebecca said he was mercilessly bullied over his sexuality and was 'very vulnerable'. She said: 'He was dead in his room for a few days before anyone found him.' 'He was supposed to be in a safe place and nobody noticed he was dead. 'It was supposed to be monitored, with a key worker, but it became quite apparent when the key workers went home at 5pm people were just left alone.' His mother added: 'He was a very loving and caring boy. He had lots of friends. He was failed by everyone.'","Jack Ellis, 20, was living in housing for vulnerable adults in Somerset .

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is being investigated by police over claims he threatened his mother's neighbour for taking pictures of his £240,000 Ferrari. Police were called to a housing estate in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester at 3pm yesterday, when the 24-year-old was reportedly visiting his mother Rose Barwuah. The controversial Italian footballer parked his Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and a number of residents came out to take pictures before going back indoors. Scroll down for video .

Mario Balotelli arriving at Liverpool's Melwood training ground in his red Ferrari on Thursday morning . Balotelli is then said to have come out to remonstrate with one neighbour. The alleged victim told the Manchester Evening News that the former Manchester City striker stooped down to look through her front window before launching into a tirade as she came to the front door of the property. The woman, who asked not to be named, was visiting her own mother at the time and said the footballer left her 'frightened and speechless' by the rant. A  spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are investigating a report of threatening behaviour. Officers will be speaking to all concerned in due course.' The woman said: 'I hadn't even taken any pictures. He came and looked through the front window. He was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright. The alleged incident is said to have taken place on this road in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the 24-year-old was reportedly visiting his mother Rose Barwuah . The woman was visiting her own mother at the time and said the footballer (pictured) left her 'frightened and speechless' by the rant . 'Then when I came to the door he was getting right near me and pointing in my face saying ""you took pictures of my car"" and I kept telling him ""I didn't, I didn't"". 'Then he said, ""if you do anything with them, I'll come back, I'm warning you"", which to me was a direct threat. 'I don't care who he is, I won't be threatened like that by anyone. He's a big guy and it was very frightening.' The woman's mother said: 'When he was at City he'd come round all the time and sit with us, so for him to be so nasty is a shock. 'We used to cook him eggs, bacon and tomato and now he treats us like this. It's not on.' Mario Balotelli is pictured with his ex-fiancee Fanny Neguesha in Miami in July this year . The incident came a day after Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield . Mario Balotelli is pictured right in action during Liverpool's Champion's League game against Real Madrid this week . Other neighbours said that Balotellihad always been friendly towards them while visiting his mother. Brian Robinson, 76, said: 'I've had my photograph taken with him and he's always been pretty good. He likes to have a laugh and a joke with us. 'I guess he could get peeved with people pestering him for autographs. But he's always been OK with me.' Hayley Ashton, 28, saw the striker leaving his mother's house on Thursday. She said: 'I didn't see him arguing with anybody.' Pictures of the car on the road were taken by someone not involved in the incident. Liverpool Football Club said they would not be commenting until all the facts had been established. MailOnline has requested a comment from the footballer's representatives. The incident came a day after Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield - prompting claims he was not fully committed to the team's cause. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted he would ‘deal with’ the £16million signing from AC Milan. He has been caught up in controversy in the past and in October 2013 it was reported that he had to flee his £3million mansion after fireworks were let off in his bathroom. The same month he wore a T-shirt saying 'Why Always Me?' after scoring against Manchester United in response to adverse media attention. Balotelli was born in Sicily to immigrants from Ghana. But his parents gave him up for adoption aged two as he had a life-threatening intestinal condition made worse by their impoverished conditions. She later developed a relationship with her son and moved to Manchester in 2011 to be nearer him. She still lives in the city even though he left Manchester City for AC Milan in 2013 and now plays for Liverpool.","Liverpool's Mario Balotelli quizzed over claims he 'threatened' woman .

In the episode broadcast on VTV3, the contestants were challenged to prepare a meal using live animals, including two kinds of fish and a turtle. Miss Phuong has expressed regret for what happened and says she is embarrassed by the 'very cruel' killing . The MasterChef Vietnam spin-off is now in its second series and the show is broadcast on VTV3 . The boss of the TV channel revealed it had been 'an accident' to show the footage and was 'stupefied' after it was aired. Lai Van Sam said: 'Allowing such a violent scene to air was an accident. Sometimes we have to watch too many programmes a day and only inattention causes us to miss such scenes. 'We stood there stupefied after it was broadcast.' Chef and judge on the show Tuan Hai (far right) defended the beheading saying it was a situation that every chef had to deal with . In July 2014, Masterchef Australia made international headlines when it displayed the Indian flag upside down. In the episode, contestants had to prepare dishes from different national cuisines. But when the Indian flag was revealed from underneath a silver dish-cover the flag was upside down, with the saffron segment at the bottom and the green at the top. In August 2013, it was reported that the UK'S MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace punched a man five times at a dinner he was hosting at the Wood Norton Hotel in Worcestershire for allegedly touching his girlfriend.

But chef Tuan Hai, a judge on the show, said it was a situation every chef had to deal with. 'The image was related to and is part of the story. Dealing with live animals involves situations that every cook must overcome. 'Watching such scenes, viewers can find out more about the candidate’s character.' The MasterChef format, which is franchised around the world, is based on the UK original, but is down to production companies in each country to decide on content. It is in its second series in Vietnam and the controversial episode was broadcast on September 20. The Shine Group, which licences the show worldwide, said: 'We work closely with each licensee of the MasterChef format globally outside of the UK. 'Though what is considered acceptable to eat, and how it is prepared, can vary greatly in different countries' cultures, we strongly discourage tasks which feature the preparation of live animals. 'Unfortunately the production company in Vietnam made us aware of the item only after it had been aired. It was clearly an unacceptable and regrettable incident.'","Khanh Phuong, 21, was filmed punching the belly of a live turtle on the show .
