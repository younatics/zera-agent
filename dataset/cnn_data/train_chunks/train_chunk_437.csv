"The conflict between humans and critically endangered Sumatran elephants in Indonesia has been going on for decades, with the elephants on the losing end of the battle. The villagers and farmers don't kill them for food. They do it to keep their homes and crops safe. The grim result is the killing combined with shrinking elephant habitat contributes to an 80% population loss since the 1930s, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In Riau Province alone, where the highest number of elephants on the island was recorded in the 1980s, the population decreased from 1,342 in 1984 to 201 in 2007. The major contributor to this conflict is the fight over land. Elephant habitat is lowland, non-mountainous, relatively flat landscape below an altitude of 300 meters. That kind of land also makes great farmland, which is why humans have cut down the rainforest and planted crops. Individual small farms may not seem like a big encroachment onto elephant habitat, but when that's combined with the forest loss from large companies cutting down hundreds of hectares of forest for palm oil and pulp and paper plantations, it results in the elephants running out of land.

With a weight of up to 4,000 kg or 8,820 pounds and a height of up to 3.2 meters or 10 feet and 6 inches, these elephants aren't small and they need a lot of land to roam. Even forest blocks of 250 km are too small for a viable elephant population. That means, as the elephant habitat is whittled away, the elephants will inevitably intrude onto villages and farms looking for food. One of their favorite foods is heart of palm, the same heart of palm we eat, which can be found in the center core of an oil palm tree. To get to it, an elephant has to knock the tree down, killing a farmer's valuable crop. Oil palm is one of the most lucrative crops Sumatran farmers can grow. Even one elephant can be a destructive force, knocking down trees and trampling houses in minutes. A 3.2 meter tall, 4,000 kilo animal can be intimidating for any human, no matter how well armed. To make it even scarier, the animals usually look for food at night. A villager or farmer will do anything to stop the elephant from its path of destruction. The most common way of killing the elephants in these areas of Sumatra is poisoning. Villagers and farmers will poison a bit of food and leave it for the elephant. It eliminates a direct confrontation. The local population doesn't want to kill the elephants. They feel as if they have no choice. In fact, some of the locals say they take pride in the Sumatran elephant and consider it part of their national identity. No villager or farmer thinks that killing one elephant threatening his home will wipe out the entire population. Unfortunately, the sad truth is, this killing is wiping out the population. Read more: Indonesia's indigenous villages in flux . NGOs like the Sumatran Elephant Conservation Initiative (SECI) are working to change the way locals interact with elephants. They introduced the Riau province villagers and farmers to alternatives to killing the elephants. The SECI created scare guns that make a loud boom that will scare the elephants away. There are also barriers that will sound an alarm when an elephant trips a wire. SECI has even helped locals install an electric fence that borders Bukit Tigapuluh National Park or Thirty Hills, which is protected land for wildlife. One of the most important elements of these successful projects is the education and cooperation of the local population. These non-lethal alternatives use cheap materials that are easily found in the area, so they catch on quickly. The locals have built lookout stations and formed a group like an elephant community watch that will gather when elephants are nearby so they can scare them away with loud noises and large fires. The SECI programs have been so successful in their efforts to keep the elephants from being killed, they've expanded their operation. Now, they have tagged some of the elephants with radio devices so they can track their movements and organize groups to scare the elephants away even more quickly. These are small victories in a few rural communities around Sumatra, but they can have a big impact. If the killing can be stopped and the cutting of the forest limited, this tiny population of critically endangered Sumatran elephants might have a chance to beat extinction.","The population of Sumatran elephants has decreased by 80% since the 1930s.
In Riau Province alone the population decreased from 1,342 in 1984 to 201 in 2007.
Humans kill the elephants to keep them off valuable farming land.
The destruction of the rainforest means elephants increasingly intrude on villages and farms looking for food."
"Nearly 400,000 people were deported from the United States in the past fiscal year, the largest number in the history of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the government announced Tuesday. The year-end removal numbers ""underscore the administration's focus on removing individuals ... that fall into priority areas"" such as lawbreakers, threats to national security and repeat violators, the agency said in a news release. Overall in fiscal year 2011, immigration officials said, 396,906 individuals were removed. Of these, 216,698, nearly 55%, had been convicted of felonies or misdemeanors. That's an 89 percent increase of criminals from three years ago, the enforcement agency said. ""This includes 1,119 aliens convicted of homicide; 5,848 aliens convicted of sexual offenses; 44,653 aliens convicted of drug related crimes; and 35,927 aliens convicted of driving under the influence,"" it said. The percentage was even higher for some regions. In the sector that covers Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas, about 74% of the 20,450 removals were of people with criminal records, said Gregory Palmore of the agency's Houston office. ""Smart and effective immigration enforcement relies on setting priorities for removal and executing on those priorities,"" said agency Director John Morton. ""These year-end totals indicate that we are making progress, with more convicted criminals, recent border crossers, egregious immigration law violators and immigration fugitives being removed from the country than ever before. Though we still have work to do, this progress is a testament to the hard work and dedication of thousands of ICE agents, officers and attorneys around the country."" The government said 90% of the agency's removals fell into a priority category and more than two-thirds of the other removals in 2011 were either recent border crossers or repeat immigration violators. The American Civil Liberties Union reacted to the announcement by again criticizing the Obama administration's emphasis on deportations. ""All told, this administration has deported nearly 1.2 million people, leaving a wake of devastation in Latino communities across the nation,"" Joanne Lin, ACLU legislative counsel, said in a news release. ""These record-breaking deportation numbers come at a time when illegal immigration rates have plummeted, the undocumented population has decreased substantially and violent crime rates are at their lowest levels in 40 years."" Lin also said the deportations represent ""uncontrolled, unwarranted"" spending of taxpayers' money by the Department of Homeland Security, of which the immigration agency is a part. The department's chief, Secretary Janet Napolitano, last week defended the administration's polices as she gave advance notice that this fiscal year would end with a record number of removals. ""What ... critics will ignore is that while the overall number of individuals removed will exceed prior years, the composition of that number will have fundamentally changed,"" she said in a speech at American University. The Department of Homeland Security more than a month ago announced that the government would review about 300,000 deportation cases pending in federal immigration courts. Lower-priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- would be suspended under the new criteria. That change drew criticism from the other side of the immigration issue, with some people who favor more deportations characterizing it as a back-door amnesty program aimed at skirting the nation's immigration laws. Napolitano said the approach is a common-sense way to tackle immigration problems with limited resources. ""There has never been, nor will there be in these tight fiscal times, sufficient resources to remove all of those unlawfully in the country,"" she said last week. ""That is why it is so important to set clear priorities.""","Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the numbers show a focus on priority groups .

"A settlement was reached Friday with the company at the center of a January chemical leak that contaminated the water supply for 300,000 West Virginians, according to an attorney for the plaintiffs. Freedom Industries Inc. would transfer $2.9 million into a trust fund that will be used ""for the greater good,"" according to Anthony Majestro, one of the attorneys in the class-action lawsuit. ""Things like chemical testing and medical studies,"" said Majestro, who called the trust fund ""a mechanism to answer some of the things that are still unanswered."" On January 9, more than 7,000 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (MCHM) -- a licorice-odored chemical used to clean coal -- leaked into the Elk River from a Freedom storage tank. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in and around Charleston, the state capital, unable to drink or bathe for several days.  A week after the spill, Freedom Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Majestro said the money for the proposed trust fund would come from the $3 million insurance settlement Freedom received for spill-related claims. Under the terms of the agreement, which still have to be approved by a judge, 24 pending lawsuits against Freedom Industries would be settled. These were the suits brought by plaintiffs who were customers of West Virginia American Water and whom either lived in, worked in or owned a business in the affected area between January 9 and January 19, according to Majestro. The settlement does not affect the more than 60 suits that have been brought against other parties such as West Virginia American Water, Eastman Chemical Company, which manufactures MCHM, or against named individuals at Freedom Industries. Majestro -- who was among those affected by the spill -- thinks that a public trust fund is the best way to use the $2.9 million, but he said individuals would have the option to receive a onetime payment instead. With an estimated 300,000 eligible claims, the most any one person could get would be less than $10.","7,000 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal leaked into the Elk River in January .

"Some 8.7 million pounds of meat from a Northern California company have been recalled because they came from ""diseased and unsound"" animals that weren't properly inspected, a federal agency announced Saturday. The recall affecting Rancho Feeding Corporation products -- as detailed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service -- marks a significant expansion of one announced January 13, when just over 40,000 pounds of the company's products were recalled. According to the U.S. agency, Rancho Feeding ""processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection."" ""Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce,"" the FSIS reported. The Petaluma company made the recall. The government agency noted there are no reported illnesses tied to these products, which went to distribution centers and retail establishments in California, Florida, Illinois and Texas. It was not immediately clear which companies got them, or whether they ended up being sold in some form at any markets or restaurants. The FSIS recall notice indicates a ""reasonable probability"" that consumption could result in ""serious, adverse health consequences or death."" Attempts to contact the Rancho Feeding Corporation for comment were unsuccesful Saturday and Sunday. A wide range of products are listed in the recall, including beef carcasses and various parts such as heads, cheeks, lips, livers, feet and tongues in boxes of 20 pounds and bigger. Forty-pound boxes of veal bones and 60-pound boxes of veal trim are included as well. All of these were produced and shipped between January 1, 2013, through January 7, 2014. They all have ""EST. 527"" in the USDA mark of inspection and have a case code number ending in 3 or 4. In the January announcement, the FSIS reported only that the products were being recalled only from January 8, 2014, and that they didn't have a ""full federal inspection.""

"Europe will stage its own ""Olympics"" in 2015, the region's 49 member committees voted on Saturday. The Azerbaijan capital of Baku will host the first European Games, with around 15 sports to be on the program for the event -- which will be held ""in spring or early summer"" according to the European Olympic Committees website. The decision may put it in conflict with other sporting bodies. The International Athletics Federation will stage its world championships in Beijing in August 2015, while the swimming world championships will be held in Russia in July that year. The European Games will come a year ahead of the next Summer Olympics, to be held in Brazil. ""The NOCs of Europe voted the proposal by secret ballot with an overwhelming majority,"" the EOC website reported after day two of the body's 41st general assembly in Rome. ""There are plenty of technical details to decide, but the Assembly has above all shown its will to go ahead and make this sports event, which is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games, a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport. ""The NOCs have received assurance that the event will not cost them a penny, but bring them financial gains."" The idea of a European Games was first mooted three years ago but has been ""in the 'Olympic air' for a long time,"" the EOC said. Baku bidded to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but failed to make the IOC's shortlist as Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo were selected. The vote for the host city will take place next September. ""The Baku delegation illustrated their project, presenting a modern and dynamic city that is practically ready to host this new sports event,"" the EOC said.","Azerbaijan's capital Baku to host the first European Games in 2015 .

"Nature's beauty seems so much closer from the seat of a saddle. Bikes offer a more intimate connection with the people of the places you pass through. No wonder adventure motorcycling has grown massively in the last decade. The 2004 ""Long Way Round"" and 2007's ""Long Way Down"" TV documentary series (both featured Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's round the world rides) helped spark the trend. In 2011, the Motorcycle Industry Council reported that sales of adventure touring bikes were up 14.2% across 12 major brands. There are hundreds of scenic roads worldwide, but the greatest rides are spiced by the thrill of twisties and smooth hardtop where motorcyclists can crank open the throttle.

"(CNN)When it comes to racing the Queen's horses, one man is Her Majesty's knight in shining armor. Ryan Moore is seemingly the British monarch's jockey of choice and no wonder. The consensus is that the Englishman is the best in the business, a view enhanced by his win at the prestigious Melbourne Cup in November. However, he is quick to downplay his regular meetings with Queen Elizabeth II, treating her like he would any other owner. ""It's not really different and it's very easy to ride for her,"" Moore told CNN. ""There's no pressure. She's just very easy going. Riding for her is a great experience."" Asked about the accolade of being the world's most accomplished horseman, Moore brushes it aside. ""I take those sorts of comments with a pinch of salt. I'm just in a position to ride these great horses in these great races and I try to do as well as I can,"" he says. ""I don't know who's number one, it's very hard to say. People will forever debate these sorts of things."" The 31-year-old has won everything from the Epsom Derby to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and ridden to victory all over the globe from Royal Ascot to Japan's Hanshin Racecourse. Moore says he's lazy, that he's lucky, but his peers say otherwise. Brother Jamie is a National Hunt jockey and likes to tell the story of how his brother turned down his first ride at the age of 16. While most youngsters would have jumped at the chance, Moore rejected it because he felt it had no chance of winning. The judgment of a rider labeled ""a perfectionist"" by his brother is clearly good -- he went on to win seven of his first 10 races. He is known to turn up early at a racecourse whatever the event to walk the course. He pores over races on television to learn all he can about upcoming rides or those he is up against. ""You always have to be taking advantage of whatever information you can,"" he says. ""You want to ensure you're not going to get stuck behind a horse that's got no speed when it comes to the key moments in a race. ""Often best-laid plans go out the window,"" he explained. ""You don't get a moment's notice to think but any information you have -- however small -- is helpful so it's always worth doing your homework."" Born into a horse-racing family, dad Gary is a trainer and his three siblings -- two brothers and a sister -- are all jockeys. It's as if he was born to sit in a saddle. Football was the initial passion, the Arsenal fan had trials with Brighton and Hove Albion, who play in English football's second tier. But his once regular kickabouts have been curtailed to the odd game with son Toby in the garden of the family home at Newmarket, the home of English racing. Unsurprisingly, he picks out Alexis Sanchez as the Gunners' star performer but less because of his rush of goals than his ""great work rate,"" an attribute repeatedly leveled at Moore by his peers. Football, though, remains something he gets mere snapshots of as he travels the globe riding the world's best racehorses at the world's best racecourses. Surely, there must be a favorite? ""I don't have a favorite place to ride, I just like to ride good horses. Of my wins I suppose the Arc was the most important one for me because it's a very difficult race to win. ""And as for a favorite horse, it's difficult to pick just one. There are a few I've had more of a history with that stand out but I couldn't pick just one."" Last season alone, Moore celebrated 155 winners across the planet, although celebrated might not quite be the right word. Moore has been criticized by the British media for his surly ways in and out of the saddle, even his father once joked he was a ""miserable bastard."" There are times he has celebrated -- he was all smiles after riding Protectionist to a famous victory in Melbourne -- but more often than not he has entered the winners enclosure with little fanfare. Admittedly it is with good reason: ""Usually my work isn't done for the day and there's another race to come moments later. I like to focus on that while I'm still there and I don't have time to worry about anything else."" Even his son would like him to ooze greater enthusiasm. Toby's own hero being Frankie Dettori, the outgoing jockey with the penchant to jump out of the saddle in celebration of victory. Toby loves Frankie and, for that matter, dad does too, listing him alongside Kieren Fallon and Mick Kinane as the jockeys he aspired to be like. But his idols, ironically, were more of the jump jockey variety, the likes of AP McCoy and Richard Dunwoody despite the fact that Moore only had aspirations to ride on the flat. As a result, while his friends dreamed of growing big, Moore was ever hopeful he would remain small and remembers celebrating the fact he stopped growing at 5ft 7in. That he has achieved so much since the decision aged 17 to forgo his A-levels -- despite opposition from his mother -- sometimes leaves him bemused. ""I didn't think I ever thought what I might achieve or how it might go,"" he says. ""You don't think about those things at 17 or 18, you just do what you're doing. I wasn't thinking about the future. ""And I've never been one to seek the limelight. That's just the way I am. I'm quite a quiet person."" With royal approval and an increasingly impressive CV, the limelight is inevitably on Moore. In Japan, where he rides for two months of the year for example, he is met at airports and train stations by fans wanting photographs and autographs. But its not all glitz and glamor. It is common for him to fly around the world for a solitary race, racing in what is the equivalent of the middle of the night for him before flying straight back home. At least jet lag doesn't have a chance to set in ... Now is a rare quiet period of the year for the quiet man of racing. The next big meeting on the agenda is March's Dubai World Cup. Should Moore be victorious, don't expect him to celebrate.","Ryan Moore is generally regarded as the finest jockey in flat racing in the world currently .

"He tried to warn them. A Palestinian researcher posted a message on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's page last week after he says the site's security team didn't take his warnings about a security flaw seriously. ""First, sorry for breaking your privacy and post(ing) to your wall,"" wrote Khalil Shreateh. ""I (have) no other choice to make after all the reports I sent to (the) Facebook team."" Shreateh, who describes himself as an unemployed security researcher with a degree in information systems, said he found a hole in Facebook's systems that let him post to any user's page, including users not on his Friends list. Such an exploit would be a virtual gold mine for spammers, scam artists and others seeking to take advantage of the site's roughly 1 billion users worldwide. On his blog, Shreateh posted a series of e-mails he said were exchanged between him and Facebook security. After the first one, a Facebook employee responded that the link he attached was bad. Shreateh had included a post -- an Enrique Iglesias video -- he says he posted on the page of a woman who went to college with Zuckerberg. He speculated that Facebook's security team couldn't see it because they weren't on her Friends list. Somebody buy Mark Zuckerberg some clothes . Facebook responded to his second message to say the issue he was reporting was not a bug. His response: ""ok that mean(s) I have no choice other than report this to mark himself on facebook."" Needless to say, that got their attention. Facebook says the flaw was fixed on Thursday. But over the weekend the episode began making headlines on tech blogs. On the Hacker News website, Facebook security team member Matt Jones wrote that the language barrier with Shreateh, who is not a native English speaker, and the volume of reports the site receives were partly to blame for the site's slow response. ""Unfortunately, all he submitted was a link to the post he'd already made (on a real account whose consent he did not have) ... saying that 'the bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users,' "" Jones wrote. ""For background, as a few other commenters have pointed out, we get hundreds of reports every day. Many of our best reports come from people whose English isn't great -- though this can be challenging, it's something we work with just fine and we have paid out over $1 million to hundreds of reporters."" Because he violated Facebook's terms of service by hacking the pages of other users, Shreateh is not eligible to receive a reward under the site's White Hat program designed to find and fix bugs. Shreateh, who says he has been looking for work for two years, lives in the Palestinian city of Yatta, in a region where the unemployment rate is officially 22% and is higher among men in their 20s, like Shreateh. ""I could sell (information about the flaw) on the black (hat) hackers' websites and I could make more money than Facebook could pay me,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""But for me -- I am a good guy. I don't deal with the black (hat) stuff."" In hacker circles, ""white hat"" is a term for people who report exploits they find so they can be fixed, while ""black hat"" often refers to people who hack to take advantage of those exploits. He said he's proud that, as a Palestinian using a five-year-old laptop with broken keys and a broken battery, he had the skills to find a problem with one of the world's biggest websites. But he acknowledged hoping his tip would lead to a reward from Facebook. ""I never asked them, 'I want $4,000 or $5,000',"" he said. ""I didn't deal with them like that ... . (But) I really needed that money."" Security researcher Marc Maiffret launched an online campaign Monday to pay Shreateh the money Facebook denied him and had raised more than $8,800 by early Tuesday. ""Let us all send a message to security researchers across the world and say that we appreciate the efforts they make for the good of everyone,"" Maiffret said on the GoFundMe page. Facebook's Jones acknowledged that the security team should have asked Shreateh for more information. ""I have to admit that I have some sympathy with Facebook on this issue,"" security analyst Graham Cluley wrote on his blog. ""Although he was frustrated by the response from Facebook's security team, Shreateh did the wrong thing by using the flaw to post a message on Mark Zuckerberg's wall."" He would have been better served returning to Facebook's security team with more evidence and further explaining it or, if that didn't work, taking the information to a technology journalist to report, Cluley said.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's personal page was hacked to make a point .

"(CNN)Shame on me. If the reports are true, and somehow the New England Patriots deflated 11 balls in the AFC Championship Game, then shame on me. Screw them, and shame on me. I am 42, and have been a New England Patriots fan for 42 years, plus nine months when you include that prenatal season. (While your mother was listening to Mozart, mine was listening to Gil Santos talk about Jim Plunkett.) In fact, at this point in my life, I essentially do only three things: 1) Anchor at CNN, 2) help raise twin 7-year-old boys and 3) root for Boston sports teams. And if I am being honest, the one I am best at is No. 3. I am a really good Boston sports fan. There are few better. And the Patriots are ruining all my hard work, debasing my skills and tainting the hours upon hours of joy that fandom gave me. This is an existential crisis. How can you root for a cheater? How can you award malfeasance? How can you cheer a con? You can't. At least you shouldn't. I shouldn't cheer for the Patriots. I know that, no matter what my genetic coding says. I am not going to dwell on the specifics of the accusations, or the physics of what advantage you get from deflated footballs. The fact is, if the reports are true, the balls the Patriots used had way too little air in them. Well below what the league allows. Well below what the rules allow. And if they did it deliberately -- and I am struggling to think of any way it could have happened otherwise -- there is a word for that: cheating. They cheated. And how can you root for a cheater? You can't. At least you shouldn't. I know that. For all the Patriots playoff games this year, my sons and I have all donned our No. 12 Tom Brady jerseys. We wore them because Brady is so darn good, so darn handsome and so full of the values of hard work and perseverance that you want your sports icons to embody. Or so we thought. Did he have any knowledge or any involvement in deflating footballs? Oh God, I hope not. But can I guarantee you that he didn't? Nope. Not even close. So how can I wear his jersey for the Super Bowl? I can't. At least I shouldn't. I know that. The worst part of this is, deep down inside, I might have known all this already. The Patriots have a history of pushing the limits. (Do I now really just have to call it cheating?) They were penalized and sanctioned for illegally videotaping an opposing team. I managed to compartmentalize that, buy my kids their Patriots gear and cheer for them anyway, perhaps hoping that it was some kind of anomaly. It doesn't look like it was. Not today. I know football is just a game, and the Patriots demolished the Colts 45-7, and clearly would have beaten them even if they played with a ball made of marshmallow fluff. But that just makes it worse. They didn't need to cheat. Look, no one needs to cheat. It is a choice, and it is the wrong choice. And it is not a choice I want to condone somehow -- tacitly or otherwise -- to my 7-year-old boys. I have spent so much emotional capital and enthusiasm raising them as Patriots fans while living in New York, and now I am beginning to regret it. I fear I have led them down the path to the dark side. Maybe they can still be saved. I can't. Being a sports fan is not a purely rational thing. Do I want the Patriots to lose the Super Bowl? No. I am just not wired that way. But I know I should. And that is why I am ashamed. Angry and ashamed.","Reports the Patriots used deflated balls create existential crisis for John Berman .

"(CNN)Want to get a head start on your teen's reading list -- or find new titles to feed your young adult fiction habit? While many recognize the Newbery and Caldecott awards for the year's best children's books, the seventh annual Morris Award celebrates debut books published in 2014 by promising first-time authors in young adult literature. It puts fresh, diverse choices in front of parents, teachers, librarians and teens, while spotlighting titles that might get lost during heavy publishing seasons, like offerings from small press. Previous winners have included authors like John Corey Whaley for his book ""Where Things Come Back."" But it's not just the winner who benefits -- finalists Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, nominated for their book ""Beautiful Creatures,"" have also become favorites in the young adult fiction community. Their book also became a film in 2013. ""The Morris Award committee wants a distinct voice that takes readers to new places,"" said Chris Shoemaker, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. ""They have exemplary voice, as well as strong world-building and character development."" Here are the five finalists: . ""The Carnival at Bray"" by Jessie Ann Foley . Love, loss and '90s grunge music collide in this story of leaving what you know behind. After 16-year-old Maggie Lynch moves from Chicago to Bray, a small town in Ireland, she experiences her first love and a family tragedy at the same time. Foley, a Chicago Public School teacher, drew on personal experience visiting Bray in 2010 and set the story during the 1990s to include Nirvana as a relatable thread throughout the novel. Teens can relate to the way the characters connect through music, Angie Manfredi, former Morris Award committee member and head of youth services for the Los Alamos County Library System in New Mexico, told CNN. Including Nirvana and the band's late lead singer Kurt Cobain ties in with the theme that nothing can last, creating a ""bittersweet urgency"" in the novel, she said. ""Gabi, a Girl in Pieces"" by Isabel Quintero . In Quintero's semi-autobiographical tale, high school senior Gabi Hernandez tries to figure out her place in her Latino community and her collegiate future. Her eventful senior year is told through lyrical, humorous and brutally honest diary entries about one best friend who is pregnant, another who just came out as gay and a father trying to quit his meth addiction. Quintero, a community college teacher from the Inland Empire of Southern California, wanted to reinforce that young women should feel empowered to make their own life choices, rather than simply live up to societal expectations based on gender or patriarchy: ""There is not just one true experience for everyone -- not as an American, not as a woman, not as a Mexican-American, and I felt like this was a story that needed to be told,"" Quintero told CNN. ""It's a stunning, first-person narrative from this character with a crazy life,"" Teri Lesesne, a professor and former Morris Award committee chairwoman, told CNN. ""She's a good student who doesn't want to fall in love and lose herself. From the realistic voice to the rhythms of her language -- I felt like I knew her."" ""The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender"" by Leslye Walton . Magic and history weave together this multigenerational tale. Ava Lavender is a perfectly normal teenage girl, except for two things: Her family tree is full of doomed love that threatens to repeat itself, and she was born with the wings of a bird. Ava must look to the past in order to navigate her future, especially when she encounters the vastly different ways one can love and be loved at 16. Walton, a teacher and self-described collector of oddities, has always kept a notebook of intriguing moments, facts, scenes and names. Rather than paint a picture of a ""freak"" defined by her oddities, Walton wanted to tell a story that related being odd and strange to being very human. This tale of magic realism is reminiscent of how teenagers visualize their life experiences, Manfredi said. It's a hero's journey that follows a character trying to figure out who she's going to be through poetic storytelling, she added. ""The Scar Boys"" by Len Vlahos . Bullies tied Harbinger Jones to a tree when he was 8 and he was struck by lightning, leaving him scarred for life. As a teen, he makes a friend, forms a punk band and people finally notice him for something other than his scars. When the band goes on tour, his life changes forever. Drawing on his personal experience of dropping out of NYU film school to tour with a punk-pop band called Woofing Cookies, Vlahos connected all of the dots when he came up with the Harbinger character. ""That idea, of a teenage punk band touring America in a dysfunctional van, was a story I always wanted to tell,"" he said. ""The book is really about the complexity of friendships, and the power of music to heal all."" ""You meet that character and you learn about his scars and how he deals with how he looks -- this thought that 'I'll make fun of me before anyone else does,'"" Lesesne said.  She also said that the story's power is rooted in this emotion and how it utilizes music. ""The Story of Owen: Dragon Slayer of Trondheim"" by E.K. Johnston . In this alternate reality, dragons are everywhere and only dragon-slayers can combat them. When his renowned dragon-slayer aunt retires, Owen learns to continue her legacy. The story is narrated by Owen's tutor, the young, musically inclined Siobhan, who soon discovers her destiny as his bard. Johnston, a forensic archaeologist from Seaforth, Ontario, wanted to tell a story about a dragon slayer and a musician ""and make it as Canadian as possible."" ""There is so much wonderful humor here, balanced with a lot of action,"" Lesesne said. ""It's a fresh take on heroism and what it means to be a hero. That book is pulled off so beautifully.""","The Morris Award celebrates debut books by first-time authors in young adult literature .

"(CNN)As families across America prepare to watch the Super Bowl, the safety of the game remains hotly debated in households across the country. After mounting concerns about brain injuries plaguing older players who experienced repeated concussions, the NFL says it is making progress when it comes to keeping current players safe . The league says concussions in regular season games dropped 25% in 2014 from the number in 2013, and concussions caused by helmet-to-helmet hits were down 28% during the same time period, according to a newly released report. But worries about concussions are just part of the reason why some families are having second thoughts about letting their children play football. As we've learned more and more about the dangers of concussions and head injuries in football, including from research on the brains of professional players who died, we have seen a drop in the number of kids playing the game. Participation in Pop Warner youth football leagues dropped 9.5% from 2010 to 2012, according to a report in 2013 by ESPN.com. Concussion concerns may lead to fewer boys playing football . Last year, after three players from three different states died in one week, I asked parents whether they think the sport is too violent and dangerous for their children. On one side are parents like John Furjanic of Chicago, who played football through high school and during college at Yale. He says his 7-year-old daughter will never play football, and if he had a son, he would never let him play either. ""I have had over 10 concussions playing football,"" said Furjanic, who says he was coached by some of the best in the business. ""No coaching technique can result in safety when the point of playing defense is to play with reckless abandon. The kids today call it blowing people up. The game is violent, and people get hurt in violent games."" On the other side are parents like Ben Smith, chief executive officer of Wanderful Media, whose eighth-grader plays football. Smith said he has certainly thought about the risks, but says the training put in place in children's programs during the last few years has given him the confidence to let his son play. That training is part of the Heads Up Football program funded by the NFL. Coaches are educated on how to deal with concussions and how to teach safer ways to tackle, where players are taught to keep their heads up and to lead contact with their shoulders, not their heads. ""Hitting has dramatically changed the game from when I was on the field over 20 years ago,"" Smith said. ""In the end, it comes down to the league, training and coaches. You have to be comfortable that they are putting safety first."" Amanda Rodriguez of Frederick, Maryland, says her 9-year-old is more passionate about football than just about anything else, and her 6-year-old just started playing, as well. She urged her sons' league to adopt the Heads Up Football program and it did. High schools tackle football concussions . ""I think that it's something you can definitely see in how the younger kids are playing versus how the older boys are playing football because it's a whole different way of playing,"" said Rodriguez, a mom of three and host of the blog DudeMom.com. ""So I feel safer knowing that my kids are playing in a league that is doing something proactive about their safety."" Like any parent, Rodriguez says she has her concerns but what helps her is putting the dangers in perspective. ""The risk is there, but the reward is so great, it's a risk that we take and statistically I don't think ... that risk (rivals) things like riding in a car or riding your bike."" Other parents whose children play football pointed to sports such as horseback riding and gymnastics that can also be dangerous for children, but said the dangers of those sports often don't get as much attention as football. ""Because of its inherently violent nature, football is often singled out for scrutiny re: head injuries and head/neck injury deaths,"" said David Hawkins of Ann Arbor, Michigan, whose son plays football. According to a report by the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, deaths in football are ""rare but tragic events,"" with 17 direct and indirect deaths during the 2013 football season out of approximately 1.1 million high school players. 'Smart' football helmet may help detect concussions . Terry Greenwald, a divorced father of three, says his son was only 5 when he started playing ice hockey, another sport known for its concussion issues. His son is 26 now and never suffered a serious injury, but Greenwald thinks back to when his son was a senior in high school and was asked to play football. ""I adamantly said 'No,' "" said Greenwald, who based his decision on the fact that his son had never played the game before. ""It is my opinion that when a child begins playing a sport with injuries like this, they learn proper techniques to protect themselves and how to avoid causing severe injuries to others."" ""I am confident that saying no was the right decision for my son. I would not presume to make that decision for anyone else,"" he said. ""I believe in sports, but I also believe each person needs to consider a lot of factors when choosing which sport to participate in and that a parent's responsibility is to choose wisely when allowing their child to make this decision."" Opinion: Make football safe for our kids . Children's television host Miss Lori, a mother of three, remembers when her son was choosing between basketball and football. Both sports have a connection to her family, she said. Her adopted father played for the Harlem Globetrotters, while her birth father, whom she only met once, played college football and was drafted by a professional team. He died of dementia before he reached 60 and she wonders if his deteriorating condition was related to his participation in football. As her son, who excelled in many sports, was deciding which to focus on, she left the decision to him -- but quietly prayed he'd pass on football. ""Silently I said a prayer to the sports gods above to put basketball first and firmly in his dreams. It worked and I am grateful,"" said the social media specialist and Babble.com contributor. What sport a child may or may not play is an individual parent's decision -- or an individual child's decision. As Amanda Rodriguez told me, if a child is passionate about a sport or an instrument or some other activity, wouldn't a parent want to nurse those passions? And while there is definite debate over whether football has become too dangerous for our children knowing what we know now, it's clear there's agreement on a key way to help keep our kids safe: making sure safety is the top focus. Louise Sattler, a psychologist, educational consultant and mom of two grown children in southern California, said her son played school and regional soccer for years, and suffered one concussion and several other injuries. While opposing coaches always urged him to keep playing, she praised her son's ""astute team coach"" who was always cautious and would send him off the field and to the emergency room. ""As with everything in our lives, including football, soccer and other sports, common sense and safety need to prevail,"" said Sattler, who is also the owner of a business providing sign language instruction. ""The lesson that we care about health and safety far outweighs the game."" Would you or do you let your kids play football?

"(CNN)What if a dachshund and a pit bull got together? That's the way the joke would open, pairing the most unlikely of canine partners -- the short legged, long bodied dachshund with the larger, stronger pit bull. But  Rami is proof that the match has happened. ""It is a true pit bull head on a dachshund body,"" said Dawn Blanton of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Humane Society in south Georgia. A man found the dog, now named Rami, wandering in his backyard. He called the shelter and described him as a ""pit bull with short legs,""  Blanton told CNN affiliate WALB. Local animal control officials confirmed that Rami is a dachshund/pit bull mix. ""Hi! I'm Rami and I'm looking for my forever home. I'm full of energy. I don't like walking on a leash,"" reads a posting on the animal shelter's Facebook page. "" I'm a sweetie pie, and love to run. I don't listen very well, so you'll need to take some time to train me. Because I tend to be a bit hyper, I might not be the best addition to a household with little kids. But I'm sure that all I need is a little lovin."" And with that posting and others, Rami has become a social media sensation. ""We posted a photo of him when he became available. And within a day it went to 1 million hits. And by that night it was up to 2 million. And now it is over 2.4 million hits,"" Blanton said. Humane society workers are taking their time to pick his new owner because they don't want him to become a freak show. ""It will be a pretty tough test for people that are wanting this dog. They're going to have to answer questions, we're going to do follow-up inspections on him,"" said Don Flowers, also of the Humane Society. The Humane Society is hoping Rami's newfound star status will bring attention to other animals on the county's Facebook page -- there are dogs Brutus and Oreo, as well as Loki and Mari the cats, along with others. Rami, who is fully grown at 25 pounds, is neutered. He is expected to be adopted by next week. Man reunites with stolen dog during search for new pet .","Rami has become a social media sensation .

"Washington (CNN)It should have been Mike Pence's strongest moment as Indiana governor -- a chance to showcase his style of executive leadership on the national stage. Instead, the week turned into a calamity of Team Pence's own making. The leaked details of a bizarre proposal to create what sounded like a state government-run news agency sucked all the oxygen out of Indiana's political media, right when Pence was supposed to explain a complicated conservative approach he's taking to expanding Medicaid. Pence immediately backtracked, but the damage was already done. It amounted to a very bad week for Pence at a time when other candidates took clear steps toward 2016 runs for the White House. After two years of complex negotiations, the Indiana governor was poised to claim a major victory. The Republican who'd once made his mark on Capitol Hill lambasting President Barack Obama's health care law had struck a deal with the White House to expand Medicaid, but on the governor's terms. Pence would get to make a series of reforms to the program -- and if it worked, he could tout them nationally as a new conservative model. As opposed to walking tall, Pence suffered a public relations gaffe that upended the news cycle. His communications staff had made plans for a new website dubbed ""Just IN."" As Pence says he understood it, the site would just be a clearing house for press releases and state reports. But an internal memo took the description much further, detailing the roles of a managing editor and an editorial board and indicating the site would publish feature stories and would sometimes break news ahead of independent journalists. The short-term embarrassment hurt Pence, but the longer-term cost could be greater: He lost his chance to explain his Medicaid moves to conservatives who hate everything about Obamacare. Even if Pence can explain the mistake, the stumble has put more distance between him and what already would have been a dark-horse run in a crowded 2016 field. ""If you're going to get into a race, from today moving forward, it would have be to fill a void that exists,"" said Chuck Laudner, an Iowa Republican strategist and the national campaign coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund.  ""There's really no one scrambling for a candidate that expands Medicaid and makes it harder to repeal Obamacare. So it's going to be very tricky."" The notion of a state government-run news agency was harmful enough, earning Pence headlines like ""Pravda on the Plains"" and comparisons to Chinese and North Korean state media. Indiana's Republican House speaker, Brian Bosma, even taunted Pence a bit, joking that he'd ordered Rosetta Stone in Russian and ending an interview by saying: ""Dasvidaniya!"" But there was another big problem: Pence really needed the oxygen those stories sucked up to explain his Medicaid expansion. After all, he was joining New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on the list of potential 2016 candidates who broke ranks with other conservatives who'd rejected Obamacare outright. And while those governors had argued the money was just too much to pass up, Pence's claim was bigger: He'd found the conservative solutions to Medicaid's woes. It's a tough sell to his party's base -- and as soon as Pence announced the expansion, conservatives started piling on. Chase Downham, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity's Indiana director and typically among Pence's biggest allies, said that ""the price of reforming traditional Medicaid should not come at the cost of expanding an already troubled entitlement program."" ""Myopic Republican governors think they can fool conservatives by gaining token concessions on what remains a government-run healthcare program and calling it 'free market reform,'"" wrote the Washington Examiner's Phllip Klein. ""This major betrayal should have consequences if he decides to run as president,"" wrote the Mercatus Center's conservative thinker Veronique De Rugy for the National Review Online. This isn't the first time conservatives who loved Pence-the-congressman have felt double-crossed by Pence-the-governor. Shortly after being elected in 2012, he decided to scrap the state's involvement in Common Core. But the standards his administration proposed to replace them were almost identical. They were more of a rebranding, many conservatives complained -- just slapping a new name onto what Pence himself had called a bad idea. Pence hasn't ruled out a run for president, saying he'll make a decision after Indiana's state legislative session wraps at the end of April -- and he still has his supporters. His pollster, Kellyanne Conway, said that while some candidates might not be able to do much to portray likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as inaccessible, rich and out of touch, someone like Pence could be a ""lesser-known but better foil for a Clinton candidacy than a true clash of the Titans."" Rex Elsass, an Ohio media consultant who's aligned with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for 2016 but worked on Pence's 2012 governor's race, touted Pence as a strong vice presidential choice, too -- saying his 12 years in Congress and four as an executive are the perfect combination. ""He's somebody who speaks to the heart of people, and has a leadership quality and a charisma that would be an incredible asset to anybody who was the nominee,"" Elsass said.","Medicaid policy could have helped Mike Pence build a national brand .
But missteps took attention away from the policy ."
"(CNN)Jim Wyss is not exactly a poster child of Venezuela's openness to foreigners -- but for while, he was one.

"(CNN)Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was placed in a medically induced coma Saturday after being found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family has told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. Brown, 21, ""was not breathing"" when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about 10:25 a.m. inside her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia, said police in the Atlanta suburb. They called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Brown was taken to North Fulton Hospital, where ""she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,"" Holland said Saturday afternoon at a press briefing. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland told CNN. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: ""Her mother died in the very same manner."" It was three years ago February 11 that Brown's mother, renowned singer Whitney Houston, was found dead -- in a bathtub -- in The Beverly Hilton, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash there. An autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned facedown in ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" being contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ""She encourages me and inspires me,"" Houston once said of her daughter. ""When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'Okay. I can do this. I can do this.'"" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was ""overwhelmed,"" family friend Kim Burrell said. ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own,"" which followed life for the family after Houston's death. One of that reality show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon. And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove.""","Bobbi Kristina Brown has been placed in a medically induced coma, a source says .

"(CNN)Anna Jacks checks her baby's forehead over and over again. Is he hot? Does he have a rash?  Is his nose still runny? Her son has been sick before, but this time it's different: Last week Eli was at a Phoenix Children's Hospital clinic with a woman who had the measles, which spreads easily from person to person. Now he's showing signs of the virus, such as runny nose and cough and fatigue. At 10 months old, Eli is too young to get vaccinated and would be especially vulnerable to serious complications of measles, such as deafness and brain damage or even death. But his parents have an even bigger worry. If Eli does have the measles, he could give it to his 3-year-old sister, Maggie, who has leukemia. So far Maggie is feeling fine, but her parents know that with her immune system wiped out by chemotherapy she's even more vulnerable than her brother to complications. ""My biggest fear is that I'll lose my child, or that she'll become deaf,"" Anna Jacks said. ""My family has been through enough with cancer. I don't want her to go through anything else."" Measles cases in California soar . According to Arizona health officials, the woman at the clinic who put the Jacks children in danger was herself infected by members of a family that doesn't vaccinate and got measles during a visit to Disneyland, where the outbreak began more than a month ago. This week, Maggie and Eli's father, Dr. Tim Jacks, wrote a blog post in which he expressed his feelings to this family. ""Towards you, unvaccinating parent, I feel anger and frustration at your choices,"" wrote Jacks, a pediatrician. ""Why would you knowingly expose anyone to your sick unvaccinated child after recently visiting Disneyland? That was a boneheaded move."" ""Your poor choices don't just affect your child,"" he continued. ""They affect my family and many more like us. Please forgive my sarcasm. I am upset and just a little bit scared."" Jacks signed the post ""Papa Bear."" Father asks school district to ban unvaccinated children . The Jacks family asked a CNN crew not to enter their home or meet with Eli. Out of an abundance of caution we also chose not to meet with Maggie or with Tim Jacks, who has limited immunity to measles. We spoke to Anna Jacks in person because blood tests show she has complete immunity to measles. 'No unvaccinated people around my kids' The Jackses don't know the identity of the vaccine refusers who put their children in danger, but Anna Jacks said she knows what she would say to them if she ever met them. ""Your children don't live in a little bubble. They live in a big bubble and my children live inside that big bubble with your children,"" she said. ""If you don't want to vaccinate your children, fine, but don't take them to Disneyland."" But Dr. Jack Wolfson said it's the Jacks family who should keep themselves at home, not him. Wolfson, an Arizona cardiologist, refuses to vaccinate his two young sons. He said the family that didn't vaccinate and endangered the Jacks children did nothing wrong. ""It's not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals in order for [a child like Maggie] to be supposedly healthy,"" he said. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's very likely that her leukemia is from vaccinations in the first place."" ""I'm not going to sacrifice the well-being of my child. My child is pure,"" he added. ""It's not my responsibility to be protecting their child."" CNN asked Wolfson if he could live with himself if his unvaccinated child got another child gravely ill. ""I could live with myself easily,"" he said. ""It's an unfortunate thing that people die, but people die. I'm not going to put my child at risk to save another child."" He blamed the Jacks family for taking Maggie to the clinic for care. ""If a child is so vulnerable like that, they shouldn't be going out into society,"" he said. Anna Jacks said she hopes vaccine refusers get educated and change their minds. In the meantime, she prays that her daughter recovers from leukemia and that both her children avoid getting measles.","Eli Jacks is too young to be vaccinated; his sister has leukemia .

"(CNN)Ohio will delay the executions of seven death row inmates while searching for an adequate supply of drugs that complies with its new execution protocol, the state's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said Friday. That means the state will not carry out any executions in 2015, the agency said in a press release. Ohio said in early January that it will add thiopental sodium, a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999-2011, the department said. Thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used. Ohio decided to stop using the two-drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone. That drug combination was last used in January 2014 on convicted murderer Dennis McGuire. Witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died. The McGuire execution was closely watched because midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, had never been used in a U.S. execution. Ohio, like many states, was forced to find new execution drugs after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. The executions of Ronald R. Phillips, Raymond Tibbetts, Gregory Lott, Warren K. Henness, William Montgomery, Robert Van Hook and Jeffrey A. Wogenstahl were rescheduled, according to the state.","Ohio is changing the drugs used for lethal injections .

"(CNN)They didn't go around the world, but then again it didn't take them close to 80 days. Regardless, it's likely Jules Verne would be very proud of American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev, who broke records crossing the Pacific together in a balloon. The two left Japan in their gas balloon, dubbed Two Eagles, last Sunday. Six days later, they touched down just off western Mexico. ""#TwoEagles has LANDED SAFELY just off the coast of Baja Mexico,"" the team tweeted at 6:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), . This happy ending was historic, albeit not entirely surprising: Less than two hours earlier, a post on the 50-year-old New Mexico pilot's Twitter account said ""#TwoEagles has begun their (descent) and turn toward land."" Later messages, as well as a live flight-tracking online, showed the balloon getting nearer and nearer to the beach. By the time Bradley and Tiukhtyaev hit the ground, they'd made history: having traveled some 6,646 miles (10,696 kilometers) and spending 161 hours and 17 minutes aloft in the air together. Richard Berry -- the mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico, which Bradley calls home -- was in Mexico to greet them and tweeted that the pilots brought the balloon down about two miles offshore, where they were picked up by a fishing boat and brought toward land. ""Success!"" read a tweet from the Balloon Federation of America. ""...Two world records for gas ballooning and the Pacific crossed!"" Others have gone farther and for longer in airborne balloons before (though not the characters in Verne's classic book ""Around the World in 80 Days""), perhaps most famously late tycoon adventurer Steve Fossett. But the others rode balloons that used hot air or some combination of hot air and gas. What makes Two Eagles is different in that there is no heat source such as a propane burner, only gas -- in this case, helium. Pilots control their altitude by releasing some of the gas during the day (when the sun heats up and expands the gas), or throwing off sand or water at night. ""Traditional 'straight gas' balloons are the stuff of legend,"" according to the project's website. ""...Old-fashioned 'gas' balloons, filled with helium and without the benefit of burners, pit man against the elements at a very basic level with just bags of sand and a healthy dash of boldness as the 'fuel.'"" Even before touching down, Two Eagles had already set two major gas ballooning records. One was for how long they were in the air -- passing the previous mark of 137 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds by Double Eagle II on a 1978 transatlantic flight. According to rules set by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the record must be surpassed by 1% in order to qualify as a new record. The Two Eagles reached that point Friday at 10:51 a.m. ET, though technically it could take months before the U.S. National Aeronautic Association reviews and documents it. A day earlier, the balloonists broke a 1981 record for distance traveled by a gas balloon. That previous mark of 5,208 miles (8,382.54 kilometers) was way in the rear-view mirror by the time the voyage ended Saturday. CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Mayor: Two men are safe, picked up by fishing boat .

"(CNN)Just a month into the year, and already the role of extremism in the Islamic faith has been at the center of heated debate. But while the attack on the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris garnered most of the international headlines, another argument has been simmering much closer to home -- one that all of us should be engaged in. Unfortunately, it's also one that many might be tempted to sweep under the rug. Earlier this month, Duke University, in North Carolina, said it would allow the Muslim call to prayer to play via the chapel bell tower's speaker system for the weekly Friday prayer service. Unfortunately, what should have been seen as an inclusive gesture not only sparked controversy, but was met with outright hostility by critics, including some who tried to suggest the move was an attack on liberty and the call to prayer was somehow tied to terrorism. Leading the charge toward this deliberate ignorance was the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of renowned evangelist Billy Graham. The younger Graham used the announcement as another opportunity to attack Islam. Reacting to Duke's decision on Facebook, he wrote: ""As Christianity is being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who doesn't submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this in the name of religious pluralism."" Of course, it is undeniable that some Muslims butcher others in the name of Islam. But there are also Christians who do the same in the name of Christ. And one need not even look as far back as the atrocities committed during the Crusades or the colonization of Africa, which claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands. The Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, for example, specifically cites its Christian faith as inspiration for the group's terrorism. Or what about Anders Breivik, who in 2011 killed 77 people in Norway, after writing a 1,500-page manifesto citing Christian inspiration for his slaughter? And it's not even simply a question of whether Islam or Christianity has inspired more brutality. Many might be surprised to learn that Buddhism, seen by many in the West as a particularly peaceful faith, has seen adherents terrorize Muslims. In Myanmar, the last couple of years have seen hundreds of Muslims killed, and many thousands more displaced, in attacks by extremist Buddhists and monks. By Franklin Graham's logic on Islam, then, all adherents should be judged according to the very worst acts committed in the name of their faith. But it is interesting that it is Islam that seems to be singled out for the most venomous treatment. Sadly, Graham is only one among a host of religious and social representatives who have for years been expending their energy on misleading those who look up to them for guidance. True, following the September 11 attacks, CNN quoted Graham as arguing that ""it was a small group of people who are bent on the destruction of this country, those Islamic fundamentalists that need to be stopped. So I plead with people not to paint in a broad brush, so to speak, the people of the Middle East. They're wonderful people."" But the report goes on to note that he appeared to backtrack from this moderate view, adding that he was quoted just a month later as arguing: ""The god of Islam is not the same God of the Christian or the Judeo-Christian faith. It is a different god, and I believe Islam is a very evil and a very wicked religion."" He was also later quoted by CNN as suggesting ""true Islam"" means being able to ""beat your wife"" and ""murder your children if they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries."" All this suggests that Reverend Graham is either an ignorant man who knows next to nothing about a faith that he holds forth on as if an expert, or (even worse) he intentionally tries to mislead Christians into despising Islam and Muslims. Regardless of whether it is either of these factors, having spent half my life in the deep and concerted study of Islam, I know for certain that Reverend Graham's claims are without merit. Still, if Reverend Graham truly believes he has truth on his side, then he should be willing to engage in a public debate on the question of extremism in Islam. And as someone who has faith in those who follow the Prophet Jesus, whom I love and adore, I would be happy to engage in such a dialogue and exchange of ideas. Whether or not Reverend Graham agrees to this opportunity to dialogue, of course, remains to be seen.","Controversy has swirled around Duke University's call to prayer plan .

"(CNN)Tens of thousands of supporters of Spain's new anti-austerity party filled central Madrid on Saturday, just a week after a like-minded party won national elections in Greece. The new Spanish party, Podemos, aims for a repeat of the Greek scenario in Spain, with some polls already show it ahead of the incumbent Conservatives and the main opposition Socialists for national elections due later this year. Podemos, which means ""we can,"" held its ""March for Change"" at midday, filling the Spanish capital's emblematic Puerta del Sol square and adjacent streets. It's the same place where anti-austerity protests began four years ago during a deep economic crisis, and Podemos is seen partly as an outgrowth of that movement, which leveraged social media to further its message. A leading newspaper, El Pais, reported that Spanish authorities estimated about 100,000 people took part on Saturday, while Podemos put the figure at 300,000. El Pais' own estimate, based on people density along the oft-used protest route, was about 150,000. Whatever the number, it was considered a strong opening shot by Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, which formed only a year ago. He said Saturday's protest would start the countdown on Spain's conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose party has labeled Podemos as a supposedly dangerous choice that can't possibly deliver on its promises. Iglesias was in Athens just before the Greek elections to support Syriza, the anti-austerity party that would go on to win. Syriza's leader, Alex Tsipras, was in Madrid late last year when Podemos officially designated Iglesias as its leader. Both parties, in Greece and Spain, have insisted that there should be fresh negotiations on how to pay the large debts their countries incurred during the economic crisis. The debts and rolling back the austerity measures have been a key focus of both parties. Podemos last year won five seats for Spain in the European Parliament, considered a strong showing for a newcomer. Its first electoral test at home comes in May in Spanish regional and local elections, and then in national elections, due toward the end of the year.","New party, Podemos, aims to emulate anti-austerity party's victory in Greece .

"There are many groups listed by the U.S. State Department as terrorists. But few fit the classic definition -- threatening and inflicting terror on a civilian population -- better than Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. What's more difficult to work out, beyond Boko Haram's hatred for everything modern and secular, is its ideology, structure and affiliations. Boko Haram's modus operandi is all too clear: brutal and indiscriminate killings of both Christians and Muslims in northern Nigeria, the bombings of churches and suicide attacks in the federal capital, Abuja, including the devastating car bombing of the U.N. compound in 2011. Recent attacks in the northeast, mainly in rural areas of Borno state, have left dozens dead. Victims are shot at point-blank range or stabbed and mutilated. Some attacks have lasted hours without any police or military intervention. In the first three months of this year, Amnesty International estimates, Boko Haram was responsible for the deaths of more than 1,500 people. In April, the group added mass abduction to its repertoire with the kidnapping of more than 200 girls ages 16 to 18 from a boarding school in Borno. ""Slavery is allowed in my religion, and I shall capture people and make them slaves,"" Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, declared in a chilling video released in May. It was a message typical of a medieval mindset, reflecting the admiration for the Taliban that inspired his predecessor, Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram and other factions have carried out kidnappings on a smaller scale, targeting Western workers and tourists. Rescue attempts -- by Nigerian security forces and in one instance in concert with UK special forces -- have ended with the deaths of hostages. In one instance last year, Boko Haram allegedly received a substantial ransom (rumored to be in excess of $3 million) for the release of a French family abducted in northern Cameroon. Why would anyone join a group so focused on killing, maiming and kidnapping civilians, one with such an incoherent, apocalyptic but resolutely backward mindset? Boko Haram, whose real name translates as the Sunni Group for Preaching and Jihad, feeds on the poverty and discrimination felt by many young Muslims in northern Nigeria. Shekau persistently recalls perceived persecution of Nigeria's Muslims by Christians, among whom President Goodluck Jonathan is the latest ""oppressor."" A lure for young men . In a region where unemployment is pervasive, the promise of a weapon and plunder has been enticing to hundreds of young men. In a recent report, the International Crisis Group noted that ""most Nigerians are poorer today than they were at independence in 1960 ... and the government is unable to provide security, good roads, water, health and reliable education."" The central government's heavy-handed and frequently untargeted anti-terrorism campaign has radicalized enough young men to sustain Boko Haram. The country's own Human Rights Commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings, torture and rape in its campaign against the group. Jonathan's declaration of a state of emergency a year ago in three northern states failed to halt or even stem the tide of killings. John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria and now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says, ""the security forces have proven remarkably ineffective in securing territory or people within the areas under the state of emergency."" This makes for fertile territory for Boko Haram, with its demand for Sharia law and rejection of all things Western (especially education for girls). It is no coincidence that Nigeria and Pakistan see the most militant attacks on schools and colleges. Among Boko Haram's targets in recent months: a secondary school in Mamudo, where 42 students were killed, and another on an agricultural college near Damaturu in Yobe state, where more than 40 were killed. Boko Haram's outlook and that of the Pakistani Taliban have similarities, even if their origins are very different. Both have thrived in (usually rural) areas where the state's authority is weak, exploiting corruption and sectarian fault lines. Both have also targeted workers involved in trying to eradicate polio. Both recruit from Islamic schools (whose students are called almajiris in northern Nigeria) where memorizing the Quran is the core of the curriculum. The emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities like Maiduguri has driven Boko Haram into the remote northeastern corner of Nigeria, close to the borders with Cameroon and Chad. It has a network of camps in the thick forests of the Sambisa Reserve, which is where at least some of the abducted schoolgirls are likely to have been taken. Boko Haram and al Qaeda . There's no firm evidence as yet that Boko Haram has ambitions beyond Nigeria, though its campaign of terror has spilled into remote parts of Cameroon and it appears to have informal links with militant Islamist groups in Mali and Niger. And for a while in 2012, Shekau sought refuge in Gao in northern Mali, a town then held by the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, after being wounded in a shootout with Nigerian security forces. Shekau has declared his allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. But Boko Haram's structure and ideology are so opaque and its focus so local that al Qaeda's leadership has thus far -- at least publicly -- shunned it. Other factions that have broken with Shekau may have broader ambitions. Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram and its several offshoots, wrote in a recent edition of the Combating Terrorism Center's Sentinel that some leaders ""are uniquely capable of expanding Boko Haram's international connections to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), al-Shabaab"" in Somalia and other militant groups. Zenn, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, says that Mamman Nur, said to have masterminded the bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja, has trained with Al-Shabaab. Another senior figure, Adam Kambar, ""became the leader of an AQIM training camp"" before being killed in 2012. Kambar led the most effective of several factions: Ansaru, whose full name is Vanguards for the Protection of Muslims in Black Africa. The group emerged in 2012 in opposition to Shekau's targeting of Nigerian civilians. Its members are said to have received training with jihadist groups in Algeria, and it appears to have a broader canvas than does Shekau. In January 2013, Ansaru attacked a convoy of Nigerian troops on their way to support the French operation against al Qaeda in Mali. It has also targeted western workers, killing seven engineers in Bauchi early last year. Just who leads Ansaru is a mystery; its videos show only veiled men. But according to the International Crisis Group, the group is now led by Khalid Barnawi, who has close links with al Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb and has profited from its part in the kidnapping business. Yet another faction called itself al Qaeda in the Land Beyond the Sahel, a nod toward al Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb and its ambitions for a broad West African jihadist front. The group's abduction and eventual murder of two foreign construction workers in 2012 bore the hallmarks of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an al Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb leader in Mali who has turned kidnapping into a lucrative business. A more dangerous beast . No one (apart from Boko Haram's leaders) believes the group can overthrow the Nigerian state. It has no presence in the oil-rich south (even if Shekau threatens to attack oil refineries there), and its fighters probably number in the hundreds at most. But it can drain the federal government of resources, damage Nigeria's international reputation and turn swathes of northern Nigeria into no-go zones. (The governor of Borno state admitted it was too dangerous for him to travel to the Sambisa area.) The International Crisis Group says the fractured militant groups in northern Nigeria are ""unlikely ever to be completely suppressed, unless the government wins local hearts and minds by implementing fundamental political reforms to address bad governance, corruption and underdevelopment."" There have been few signs of such an approach -- and its absence may usher in a much worse scenario. Greater cooperation between Boko Haram, Ansaru and other militant factions in the region could create an altogether more dangerous beast, according to Zenn, creating ""a multimillion-dollar ""terrorism economy"" in the southern Sahel that fuels corruption and raises tensions between neighboring countries and the region's Muslims and Christians.""","Boko Haram, blamed in hundreds of deaths, added mass abduction to its repertoire in April .

"(CNN) -- One phone call brought the 41-year-old memory back to George Hopkins instantly, flooding him with the terror of having a .38-caliber pistol jabbed into his face. Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968. ""Hey, they got the guy that hijacked us,"" said the voice on the phone. Hopkins, a former flight engineer, got the call Monday from a friend and former Pan Am pilot, a day after the surrender of Luis Armando Pena Soltren. Pena Soltren is one of the men accused of hijacking Pan Am Flight 281 on November 24, 1968, and taking it to Cuba. The suspect had remained hidden in Cuba for decades, and Hopkins' memories of the ordeal had receded. But it's all coming back now.  Watch Hopkins describe the hijacking » . ""I can still remember very vividly,"" said Hopkins, 71. ""The guy comes to the cockpit and he's got a knife. And he sticks a .38 right in my nose, right between my eyes, and I could tell it was loaded because I see the bullets around the cylinder. He has the stewardess and held her with knifepoint at the base of her skull and he said, 'Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.'"" Hopkins said he felt a burning sensation where the gun was pointed on his face. ""There was no doubt in my mind he would pull the trigger if I'd have done something very foolish,"" he said. Hopkins was in the flight engineer's seat and noticed that the pilot and copilot had not seen the hijacker. He alerted them and said they needed to appease the armed man. Through the open door of the cockpit, he could see two other hijackers holding passengers at bay. With the plane now heading to Cuba, the hijacker lowered his gun. But the armed man was extremely nervous and shaking, Hopkins said. A second hijacker, the apparent ringleader, entered the cockpit and told the crew everything would be fine. ""He said don't worry about it, we've done this before,"" Hopkins said. Then the man asked whether he could bring his wife up to first class. The woman was carrying a baby, Hopkins remembers. At one point, a fighter jet appeared in the distance and followed their plane to Cuba. The hijackers left the plane after it landed, but Cuban authorities held Hopkins and the rest of the crew on board for about six hours before they were allowed to fly back to the United States. On Sunday, 66-year-old hijacking suspect Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the same airport from which Hopkins' flight was commandeered. According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack the flight. Cruz and Castro were sentenced in the 1970s after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in New York. They received 15-year and 12-year sentences, respectively. Figueroa was acquitted in 1969. Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren. ""I never thought I'd repeat this story again,"" Hopkins said. ""I repeated it a lot for the first several years, because it was very traumatic to us. This is the first time I've even said anything about it for five to 10 years. It's been kind of nice. Your mind is able to flush things once in awhile, until something happens and then you recall it.""","George Hopkins was flight engineer on Pan Am flight hijacked to Cuba in 1968 .

Some of you who follow this space will know I have had a somewhat tortured two weeks reconciling my genetic predisposition to be a Patriots fan, with my disdain for breaking the rules. (Some of you probably don't give a crap what I think, and if that is the case, then I am happy to be wasting your time.) I still believe that if the Patriots had air taken out of the footballs intentionally, then it is cheating. Repeat: if they did it, they cheated. And that is bad. Very bad. And cheering for them would fill me with guilt and remorse. (See here.) However, I also believe, that if there is no proof that they did it, then there is simply no justification to penalize them, sanction them, or even criticize them. There really needs to be proof that someone took some sort of affirmative action deflate those footballs. The existence of an underinflated football is not a violation. It is the act of deflating it, or causing it to be deflated that is the infraction (yes, I once applied to law school). We don't have proof. Not yet. Accordingly, until there is proof, I believe every Patriots fan should root like hell for them.  Lose your voice, burst your spleen, strain a hamstring; do whatever you can to get them into the end zone Sunday night. I will wear my Tom Brady jersey with honor and pride. And none of these actions or beliefs is inconsistent. In fact, I think this is the most reasonable, rational, objective position to take. If they cheated, it's bad. Right now, there is no proof they cheated. I know that there are members of Patriots Nation who refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that they cheated.  There are also members of the ""snark lobby,"" who think too much is being made of all this. On the flip side there are Patriots-haters who think that Bill Belichick only lies when he speaks or breathes. And that Tom Brady only achieved anything through subterfuge and favoritism. In my opinion, all of these views are wrong. And I am only glad you have each other to collectively fester in your pool of myopic loathing (hyperbole added in the spirit of competition!). If they cheated, it's bad. Right now, while the NFL continues its investigation, there is no proof they cheated. So go Patriots. Crush the Seahawks with firm balls all above 12.5 PSI. Win big. I am cheering for you 112.5% percent. But after the fact, if it turns out you did cheat in the AFC Championship game? Well, I will feel angry and guilty and you should be punished. That makes sense. And I do too. Probably.","John Berman: Until there is proof they cheated, the Patriots deserve fans' support .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is ordering an independent review of the nation's nuclear force following revelations of misconduct involving officers, the Pentagon said on Thursday. Top leaders of the force plan to meet with Hagel in coming weeks, Defense Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The action follows a recent disclosure that nearly three dozen Air Force officers at a nuclear missile base in Montana were involved in cheating on a proficiency test. That followed a decision by senior military officials to discipline a general with nuclear oversight responsibilities whose personal misbehavior involving alcohol and women on an overseas trip got him into hot water. Kirby said ""clearly, we've got some issues here,"" but added the Pentagon remains confident the U.S. nuclear arsenal is secure. Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force announced 34 officers with the 341st Missile Wing were implicated in the cheating scandal after a drug possession probe that involved two of those officers. Sixteen officers were ultimately found to have actually cheated on the monthly proficiency exam while the rest knew the answers had been shared with others and did not report the violation, the Pentagon said. All those disciplined in the investigation are no longer certified to conduct nuclear operations. There are approximately 190 officers overseeing readiness of nuclear weapons systems in Montana, meaning the scandal has touched nearly 20% of that force. Other scandals include October's news that Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who oversaw nuclear weapons, was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with ""hot women"" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said. There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said. Also in October, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, who also oversaw nuclear weapons forces, was formally relieved of his duties as deputy chief of U.S. Strategic Command, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Navy's chief of information. A military official said his demotion was connected to allegations that he used counterfeit gambling chips at an Iowa casino. In August, the same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection ""after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons,"" the Air Force Global Strike Command said. The 341st Missile Wing operates about 150 of the 450 Minuteman III nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the U.S. force, according to an Air Force statement. A failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal is at risk, global strike commander Lt. Gen. Jim Kowalski said in August. And in April, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers in Minot, North Dakota, of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after they did poorly in an inspection. They were ordered to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs.","Incidents of misconduct prompt call for independent review .

"(CNN)Of the slew of expensive ads streaming into our living rooms courtesy of this Sunday's Super Bowl XLIX, there's one commercial that I hope all 100 million viewers watch carefully. It's only 30 seconds long. The visuals pan the inside of a family's house with a few pictures of kids on the walls. The dialogue is simple. A woman orders pizza from a 911 operator. After a moment of frustration, the dispatcher catches on that this woman is in trouble, and pretending to order pizza from 911 is the only way she can call the police. This commercial, created by the advocacy group No More, is the only TV ad that has ever made me bury my head in my hands and sob. Listening to the woman ask for help reminded me of the two policemen who came to my home 23 years ago when my abusive husband choked me and beat me so severely I thought he would kill me. With the recent controversy over Baltimore Ravens' running back Ray Rice, and San Francisco's Ray McDonald alleged sexual assault of a woman, the NFL badly needs some good PR when it comes to violence against women. The league has not historically taken abuse by players seriously.  According to the USA Today NFL arrest database, there have been 89 family violence arrests of NFL players since January 2000, making domestic violence the worst crime category within the NFL. In the first few weeks of 2015, one NFL player, New Orleans' Junior Galette, was arrested for alleged assault of a woman in his home. He denied the allegation. But the bigger problem isn't going away. The NFL's refusal to understand domestic violence and punish offenders obviously needs to change. Although the league deserves polite applause for using the most-watched sporting event of the year to raise awareness about domestic violence, one powerful ad isn't going to solve the problem. The NFL seems committed to penalizing domestic violence perpetrators through its new Personal Conduct Policy. It has  hired domestic violence advocates such as Cynthia Hogan, one of the original authors of the Congress' 1993 Violence Against Women Act. But there are easy things we can all do to end domestic violence. The first: learn how complex and cold-blooded abuse is. Intimate partner abuse has nothing to do with testosterone, or playing or watching sports. It doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with being male. Relationship abuse is a systematic pattern of psychological and/or physical domination, perpetrated by both men and women at alarming rates across all ethnicities, income levels, educational degrees, religions and nationalities. Relationship violence is one of our society's most common, underreported and underprosecuted felony crimes. Here are a few misconceptions to explode on Super Bowl Sunday (and all other days of the year): . Smart women are never domestic violence victims . Domestic violence occurs in all communities and all countries. Without a doubt, someone from your school, your neighborhood, your church or your workplace is currently being abused. The major risk factor: being young and female; women 18-24 are three times as likely to be abuse victims, and one in four women will be physically abused by an intimate partner at some point in her life -- regardless of her IQ or diploma. If you are being abused, just leave . Abusers often threaten to kill victims if they leave; statistics show that most domestic violence homicides happen after the relationship has ended. Victims often have children, pets, homes, family members and jobs to protect. It takes an average of seven attempts -- often over the span of years -- to escape a domestic violence relationship. Leaving is rarely easy. The abuse stops when you end the relationship . Financial abuse, stalking and battles over children are common post-relationship abuse vehicles to manipulate and harm victims. Many of the 15 million children who witness family violence every year pay the abuse forward; boys who are exposed to violence in their homes are more likely to abuse their own partners and children later in life. Abuse is a women's issue . How can this be true, when millions of boys are victims of family abuse, and over 96% of convicted abuse perpetrators are male? Actor and singer Harry Belafonte said it best: ""Men, who created violence against women, are the ones who should end violence against women."" It will never happen to me . That's what I thought growing up in Washington, DC in a nonviolent family of Harvard graduates. I thought I couldn't possibly be stupid enough to let a man beat me, until my husband, also an Ivy League graduate, choked me five days before our wedding. During our marriage he held a gun to my head, pushed me downstairs, routinely called me ""retard,"" and repeatedly threatened to kill our dog. Abuse can happen to anyone. Although the police had evidence, my husband was not arrested or charged; at the time I had no idea that physical abuse was a crime, and I would have protested that I was a strong, smart woman in love with a troubled man, but not a battered wife. There's nothing I can do to help . Abuse thrives only in silence. Simply by talking about the complex realities of intimate partner violence with your friends, co-workers, and family, you establish yourself as a sympathetic resource for victims in the future. And please, take half a minute on Superbowl Sunday to watch this ad.","Leslie Steiner: There's one ad that we should all watch during Sunday's Super Bowl XLIX .
She says the NFL deserves praise for raising awareness about domestic violence, but one ad won't solve the problem ."
"(CNN)Each year, on average, about 60 people in the United States are reported to have measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, this year is on track to be one of the worst for measles in more than a decade, and health officials say people who refuse to vaccinate their children are behind the increase. The number of cases reported through August 24 is 159 -- the second-highest number of cases since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated from the United States. In 2011, there were 222 cases. As of November, there have been 175 cases reported, according to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden. The elimination declaration means measles no longer spreads year-round in the country, the CDC says. But it is still common throughout the world. Of this year's cases, 172 were import-associated, meaning they were brought into the country from overseas, according to a paper published Thursday in JAMA Pediatrics. The other three were likely directly imported. U.S. measles cases in 2013 may be most in 17 years . Here are 5 things to know about measles: . Measles is caused by a virus . The measles virus normally grows in the cells lining the back of the throat and lungs, according to the CDC. It causes fever, runny nose, cough and a blotchy rash over the entire body. Other symptoms include red, watery eyes, body aches and tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth. A typical case begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and sore throat. Two or three days after symptoms begin, the white spots may appear in the mouth, the CDC says. A red or reddish-brown body rash begins three to five days after symptoms appear. It usually begins at the hairline on the face and spreads downward. A person's fever may spike as high as 104 degrees when the rash appears. Measles can be fatal . About one in 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection; up to one in 20 gets pneumonia; about one out of 1,000 gets encephalitis; and one or two out of 1,000 die, according to the CDC. It can also make a pregnant woman miscarry or give birth prematurely. Measles kills an estimated 164,000 people around the world yearly, and there are an estimated 20 million cases worldwide. More than half of the deaths occur in India, according to federal health officials. Before the measles vaccine was introduced, nearly all children got measles by the time they reached the age of 15. Each year in the United States, about 450 to 500 people died from measles; 48,000 were hospitalized; 7,000 had seizures; and about 1,000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness, according to the CDC. Measles is highly contagious . Measles can be spread from four days before a rash appears to four days afterward. It is so contagious, in fact, the CDC says 90% of people who are not immune and are close to someone with measles will also become infected. The virus spreads through the air when an affected person sneezes or coughs. The droplets get into people's noses or throats through breathing or when someone puts their fingers in their mouth after touching an infected surface. The virus can live on infected surfaces for up to two hours. If you've already had measles, you can't get it again, because your body has built up immunity to the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic. The measles vaccine does not cause autism . The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was licensed in 1971 to protect against all three diseases. Nearly 10 million doses of the MMR vaccine are distributed each year in the United States. The CDC recommends two doses: One at 12-15 months of age and a second at 4-6 years of age. This means that babies are not immune, and can contract the measles from unvaccinated people. In 2010, the medical journal The Lancet retracted a controversial 1998 paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The study had been discredited, and its author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was found to have acted unethically in conducting the research. Wakefield, in a statement at the time, denied wrongdoing. Probe of early autism-vaccine complaints was limited, report says . There is still resistance to MMR and other vaccines . Among those who have been stricken with measles this year, 92% were not vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The largest outbreak was in New York, where 58 people contracted measles in a community where many refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons. The outbreak -- the largest since 1996, according to the CDC -- stemmed from an intentionally unvaccinated 17-year-old who returned to New York from London while infected with measles. Vaccinations in general continue to be a hot topic, with some parents opposed for religious or other reasons. ""Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting infected when they travel internationally,"" the CDC says. ""They can bring measles to the United States and infect others. Unvaccinated people put themselves and others at risk for measles and its serious complications.""

"(CNN)Could Bode Miller's career be over? The US skier, a winner of four world titles alongside Olympic gold at Vancouver 2010, severed a hamstring tendon in a high-speed crash while racing at the World Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado. Miller, 37, hooked his arm around a gate near the bottom of Thursday's super-G course and span awkwardly, slicing a gash through his leg on landing. One of Miller's skis, both of which came off, may have caused the injury. Racing for the first time since undergoing back surgery in November, Miller had displayed characteristic bravery in what was -- up to the crash -- the fastest run of the day. ""He was absolutely sending it top to bottom, putting down a run that inspires Americans, inspires the world,"" said US men's coach Sasha Rearick. Within hours of the crash, surgeons were working to repair Miller's tendon. ""Feeling lucky since things could have been way worse,"" he tweeted. TV analyst Brian Stemmle, a four-time Winter Olympian for Canada, tweeted this graphic image of Miller's leg. Picabo Street, the 1998 Olympic super-G champion, feared the injury may end the legendary skier's career. ""We might have seen the last of Bode,"" Street said, according to the Denver Post. ""I think we've seen Bode Miller race for the last time. You know what? He was putting a beautiful run together and he did it in typical Bode style. ""It's been a beautiful career.""

"(CNN)Two purported ISIS fighters interviewed for a news agency working in ISIS-held territory have given the same reason for the militants' retreat from the Syrian city of Kobani: the constant pummeling by coalition airstrikes. On Monday, Kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to Turkey from ISIS' grip after 112 days of fighting. The efforts of the Kurdish fighters -- known as the YPG, or People's Protection Units -- on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the U.S.-led international coalition against ISIS. And according to the interviews given to ISIS-aligned Amak news agency in Syria, it was those airstrikes that won the battle for Kobani, referred to by the fighters as Ayn Al-Islam. ""Recently, we have withdrawn from Ayn Al-Islam bit by bit, because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers,"" said one of the two fighters, his face covered apart from his eyes. He points to a scene of destruction behind him but vows that ISIS will persist, ""and this is the message we send to Obama."" The second fighter interviewed by Amak stood near a road sign reading Ayn Al-Islam. He said ISIS forces had raided 360 villages around Kobani, from which the people ""ran away like rats."" But the reason behind their withdrawal from the city, he said, ""is that we no longer had places to hold there. We were inside Ayn Al-Islam and we occupied more than 70%, but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing, they destroyed everything."" His horror of the airstrikes was apparent. ""I swear by God, their planes did not leave the air, day and night; they did airstrikes all day and night. They targeted everything. They even attacked motorcycles; they have not left a building standing. But by God willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied."" ISIS is on its heels after the loss of Kobani and an offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga -- armed fighters who protect Iraq's Kurdish region -- around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict. But on Friday, the Sunni extremist group launched an assault on Iraq's oil-rich city of Kirkuk in what may be an attempt to divert Kurdish troops from Mosul. A report by Rudaw, a private website dedicated to presenting news from a Kurdish perspective, said at least 30 ISIS fighters were killed in the assault and 15 captured. Casualties on the other side included Brig. Gen. Shirko Fateh, the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk. ISIS captured 15 employees working at the Khabbaz oilfield southwest of Kirkuk after launching their assault in the area, Brig. Gen. Sarhat Qader, the head of Kirkuk's suburbs and villages police, told CNN on Saturday. A joint operation is underway by his police officers, Peshmerga and Kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield, seized by ISIS militants on Friday, Qader said. Troops have already liberated Al-Assal village, also taken by ISIS on Friday and located next to Khabbaz oil field, he said. Meanwhile, Gen. Hussein Mansour, the head of Peshmerga forces in Jalawla, in Diyala province, was killed in clashes with ISIS in southwestern Kirkuk, Saman Jabari, a senior Kurdish figure and local Peshmerga leader, told CNN on Saturday. Mansour brought his troops from Jalawla, about 100 miles away, to reinforce the Peshmerga in Kirkuk following the ISIS assault, he said. U.S. and coalition aircraft carried out 17 airstrikes in Iraq on Friday, according to a U.S. Central Command statement, 10 of them near Kirkuk and two near Mosul. Both the coalition and the Peshmerga are trying to prevent ISIS from opening a new front in Kirkuk, which ISIS likely hoped would lessen the pressure on Mosul. Additionally, by going on the offensive here, ISIS appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes. If ISIS can be driven back from positions in Kirkuk, it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw Kurdish forces away from the outskirts of Mosul. The Kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering Mosul but want to choke off ISIS supply lines into the city. Another 10 airstrikes were carried out Friday against ISIS targets in Syria, eight of them near Kobani. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group, from October 6 to Monday the fighting for Kobani killed 979 ISIS combatants, 324 YPG fighters and 12 rebels backing the YPG. Thirty-eight more ISIS militants died in attacks using booby-trapped vehicles or bomb belts, and the ISIS shelling of Kobani killed 12 civilians, SOHR said. ""On the other hand, hundreds of (ISIS) militants died during U.S. and Arab allies' airstrikes on the city and its countryside,"" the group said. However, the success of the coalition airstrikes in Kobani will be hard to replicate elsewhere. There are almost no civilians left in the city of Kobani, and most residents left early on when the fighting started, especially in the contested areas close to the front line. This meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward, with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties. The front line was well defined, so it was clear where the ISIS and Kurdish fighters were. A more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target ISIS inside populated areas like Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa in Syria and other cities under ISIS control. Here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians. When coalition airstrikes hit cities in Aleppo, in northern Syria, civilian deaths were reported last year. CNN's Tim Lister and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","ISIS kidnapped 15 oil workers southwest of Kirkuk, local police chief says .

"CIA Director John Brennan has ordered an in-depth review of the intelligence agency's organizational structure, asking the agency to ""take a close and honest look at ourselves."" Citing an ""ever-growing number"" of complex national security challenges as cause for the evaluation, Brennan announced the internal review in a letter to Central Intelligence Agency staff.  The CIA released unclassified portions of the letter on Thursday. The review will come as the CIA adapts to new threats from terror groups like ISIS and the al Qaeda linked Khorasan group have added to agency's terror landscape. Related: U.S. strikes against Khorosan group in Syria . ""I have mentioned several times over the past year that I have become increasingly convinced that the time has come to take a fresh look at how we are organized as an Agency,"" Brennan wrote in the letter dated September 24, 2014. He added that the review will examine the CIA's structure and ""ways of doing business."" Officers leading the review are tasked with looking at ways to integrate the sprawling intelligence agency.  The organization is currently split into four major divisions. The clandestine staff that collects intelligence information, for instance, is separate from the staff analyzing the data collected. ""The need for integration has never been greater,"" Brennan wrote. ""The complex national security issues we face today, and the extent to which those issues cross geographic and functional boundaries, challenge our ability to leverage the entire breadth of capabilities the CIA has to offer."" A proposal to split the agency into subject matter divisions where analysts and clandestine officers work together, as reported by the Washington Post, is not yet formal, according to the CIA. ""Given that the review is still pending, the officers have not yet put forth their findings, conclusions or recommendations,"" said CIA spokesman Dean Boyd.","The CIA director launched an agency-wide review of structure and business practices .

"(CNN)Texas is setting aside Monday to honor Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL marksman depicted in the film ""American Sniper."" Kyle became a legend in military circles due to his 160 confirmed kills and developed a deadly reputation in Iraq, where he served several times. He's considered one of the most lethal snipers in U.S. history. ""I have declared February 2 to be Chris Kyle Day in Texas,"" Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted. ""We honor our military heroes."" During his speech at a Texas veterans event Friday, the governor described Kyle as ""a man who defended his brothers and sisters in arms on and off the battlefield."" A Marine veteran is alleged to have killed Kyle at a Texas gun range in 2013. Thousands mourned him in his home state, lining a 200-mile route to his final resting place in Austin and attending a memorial service at the Cowboys stadium in Dallas. His popularity did not end there. Clint Eastwood's film on Kyle raked in $107 million over its first weekend on wide release this month -- an unprecedented haul for an R-rated drama in the middle of winter. The movie was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. As the movie draws huge crowds to theaters nationwide, Texas is paying tribute to its son. The west Texas native attended Tarleton State University in Stephenville after graduating from high school in 1992. He left college after two years to work as a ranch hand and later joined the Navy in 1999. Actor Bradley Cooper portrayed Kyle in the movie, a depiction the wife of the late sniper described as uncanny.

"When Bob Dylan's self-titled debut LP hit shelves on March 19, 1962, it didn't sound anything like the popular music of the time. It was the height of ""The Twist"" dance craze, and 11 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart had the word ""twist"" in the title, including ""Dear Lady Twist"" by Gary U.S. Bonds, ""Twistin' The Night Away"" by Sam Cooke, ""Hey, Let's Twist"" by Joey Dee and the Starlighters,"" ""Twistin' Postman"" by the Marvelettes and ""Alvin Twist"" by the Chipmunks. (A new California group called the Beach Boys reached a new high of Number 77 that week with their first single, ""Surfin.'"") To most of America, the Kingston Trio were the embodiment of folk music. The clean-cut, sweet-voiced California group hit Number 25 that week with their cover of Pete Seeger's ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone?"" Dylan was also a fan of Seeger's, but he sounded nothing like the Kingston Trio. The 20-year old singer-songwriter from Hibbing, Minnesota had been playing the coffee houses in New York for a little over a year, mostly singing traditional folk songs in a nasal voice that was virtually impossible to imagine hearing on the radio. It was Columbia record executive John Hammond who saw the huge potential in Dylan. The 51-one year old, who famously discovered Billie Holiday and countless other jazz legends, became acquainted with Dylan when he played harmonica at a recording session with folk singer Carolyn Hester. They met during a rehearsal in a Greenwich Village apartment. ""We were all seated around a kitchen table, and John was seated next to Bob,"" Hester recalled to Dylan biographer Howard Sounes in his book ""Down The Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan."" ""Bob starts in on the harmonica and John turns and looks at him and couldn't take his eyes off the great character."" His interest grew when he learned that Dylan wrote his own songs. Right around that time, Dylan opened up for the Greenbriar Boys at Gerde's Folk City and earned a rave review in the New York Times by pop writer Robert Shelton. Hammond didn't need any more convincing; on October 25, 1961, he signed Dylan to a five-year contract. A little more than a month later, they entered the studio together to record Dylan's first album. They cut the whole thing in just six hours (spread across two days) for an estimated $402. ""There was a violent, angry emotion running through me then,"" Dylan said. ""I just played played guitar and harmonica and sang those songs, and that was it. Mr. Hammond asked me if I wanted to sing any of them over again and I said no. I can't see myself singing the same song twice in a row. That's terrible."" Much like his live set at the time, the album consisted mainly of old folk songs, including ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"" by Blind Lemon Jefferson, ""Highway 51"" by Curtis Jones and ""Fixin' to Die"" by Bukka White. It was his rendition of ""The House of The Rising Sun"" that caused him trouble in the tight-knit Greenwich Village folk music community. Dave Van Ronk -- one of Dylan's earliest supporters and a huge presence in the Village -- was famous for his arrangement of the traditional tune. ""Before going in the studio, he asked, 'Hey Dave, mind if I record your version of ""Rising Sun?'"" Van Ronk recalled to Dylan biographer Anthony Scaduto. ""I said, 'Well, Bobby, I'm going into the studio soon and I'd like to record it.' And later he asked me again and I told him I wanted to record it myself, and he said, 'Oops, I already recorded it and I can't do anything about it because Columbia wants it.' For a period of about two months we didn't speak to each other. He never apologizes, and I give him credit for it."" The album did contain two original songs: ""Talkin' New York"" and ""Song to Woody."" The first song recounts Dylan's earliest days in New York when he ""got a harmonica job, begun to play/Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day."" Dylan claims he wrote ""Song to Woody,"" a tribute to his musical hero Woody Guthrie, just weeks after arriving in New York, a trip partially inspired by the fact that Guthrie was living at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey and Dylan wanted to meet him. ""('Song to Woody') was written in New York City in the drugstore on 8th Street,"" he said to Sing Out! magazine in the summer of 1962. ""It was one of them freezing days that I came back from Sid and Bob Gleason's in East Orange, New Jersey...Woody was there that day and it was a February Sunday night...and I just thought about Woody, I wondered about him, thought harder and wondered harder...I wrote this song in five minutes...it's all I got to say."" The album failed to crack the Billboard charts and sold about 5,000 copies that year. Executives around Columbia referred to Dylan as ""Hammond's Folly."" Undeterred, Hammond brought Dylan back into the studio just one month after the album came out to begin work on his second LP. In the five months after the first album was recorded, Dylan had turned his attention towards political causes. He recorded ""The Death of Emmett Till"" and ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" at the first session, and in July of 1962, he returned to Columbia Studio A with a new song called ""Blowin' In The Wind."" It had been a part of his live show for months, and by the next summer, it would completely transform his life.

"Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair will plead guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser in a deal that will see the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped, according to his defense team and CNN affiliate WTVD. Maj. Gen. Clarence Chinn, a commander at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where the court-martial has been taking place, approved Sinclair's offer to plea this weekend, making it a binding document, according to a statement from the defense. Defense attorney Richard Scheff applauded the decision while attacking the Pentagon, which the defense has accused of interfering in the case, and Sinclair's accuser, an Army captain the defense has painted as a jilted lover who was upset that the general wouldn't leave his wife. ""After wasting millions of taxpayer dollars, the Army finally admitted what it's known for many months: General Sinclair is innocent of sexual assault. Two successive prosecutors agreed that these charges should be dropped, as did two successive staff judge advocates,"" Scheff said in a statement. He continued, ""The government understood that if it allowed BG Sinclair's accuser to be cross-examined, she would be caught in a thick web of her own lies. It shouldn't have taken two years for them to come to this conclusion, but they were driven by politics rather than justice."" Scheff concluded his remarks, saying that the ""reputational and financial costs"" Sinclair has suffered because of ""false rape allegations"" should be factored into his sentencing. The testimony of the general's accuser was never fully aired. She testified for several hours March 7, telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex, WTVD reported. She also said the general threatened to kill her and her family, the station reported. She was scheduled to continue her testimony March 10, but Col. James Pohl, the presiding judge in the court-martial, dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged Pentagon interference in the case. At least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior Army official felt the accuser had a credibility issue. While Pohl said there may have been ""undue command influence"" by Pentagon officials, he declined the defense team's request that he drop charges against Sinclair. Pohl instead ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal. Sinclair's attorneys filed a Freedom of Information Act request for all Pentagon e-mail communication including keywords in the Sinclair case, identifying about 10,000 e-mails among a dozen senior Pentagon officials, defense spokesman Josh Zeitz said. The Pentagon was reviewing the communications and would likely release them slowly, Zeitz said Wednesday, but if the two sides reached a plea deal and something pivotal arose in those e-mails, the defense would file another motion to dismiss charges. Zeitz said last week that Sinclair would not plead guilty to sexual assault, threatening the accuser or her family or any charge that would land him on a sex-offender registry. The Sunday statement from the defense team said the plea deal nixed all three charges that would necessitate sex offender status for the general, as well as a charge of defrauding the government and a charge that alleged ""Sinclair 'coerced and compelled' his accuser to remain in their three-year, consensual relationship."" The 27-year Army veteran will instead agree that his failure to end the relationship resulted in his accuser's emotional discomfort and distress, as did his refusal to divorce his wife and marry his accuser, the defense statement said. The general will also plead guilty to mistreating his accuser, which the defense team noted is ""an infraction unique to the Uniform Code of Military Justice."" ""We're left with a collection of lesser charges, most of which aren't criminal in the civilian world,"" Scheff said in his statement. ""Sinclair has admitted to mistakes that are normally a matter between husbands and wives, or employees and HR departments. It's time to put this matter to rest."" Sentencing will begin this week. While it's unclear what penalty Sinclair faces, the government has agreed to a ""quantum"" -- essentially a maximum-penalty cap that won't be revealed to Pohl, according to the defense. Pohl will hand down his sentence, and Sinclair will face the lesser of the two sentences -- either Pohl's or those laid out in the quantum.

"A new Florida law restricts police use of drones within the state's borders. Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed the measure Thursday, saying it will protect the state's residents from ""unwarranted surveillance."" Before local or state law enforcement agencies can use surveillance drones, the Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act requires a judge to approve in nearly all cases. The legislation makes exceptions in cases involving ""imminent danger to life or serious damage to property"" and when ""credible intelligence"" from the federal Department of Homeland Security points to ""a high risk of a terrorist attack."" The bill that state lawmakers passed unanimously earlier this year, Scott said, ""maintains a balance between the need for law enforcement to protect our citizens against credible threats and imminent danger while ensuring that the privacy of Florida families is protected."" The measure was backed by both the American Civil Liberties Union and by conservative Republicans. In Florida, the Miami-Dade Police Department and the Orange County Sheriff's Office each have two drones. Miami-Dade's roughly backpack-size Honeywell T-Hawks have been used only in training exercises so far, Detective Roy Rutland said earlier this year. To some, the idea of an unmanned aircraft hovering over U.S. homes seems like a scenario out of a science fiction novel. But the use of drones has become controversial in recent years as unmanned aerial vehicles have become cheaper and more advanced. The concerns range from moral questions over their use in warfare overseas to worries about their impact on air traffic in the United States. Other states are also weighing measures to restrict domestic drone use, the ACLU said. Last month, drones both dazzled and worried senators at a hearing about their use within the United States. Lawmakers and experts said that new legislation may be needed to protect the privacy and safety of citizens. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, held and studied a small plane weighing just 2 pounds before beginning the hearing. ""I am convinced that the domestic use of drones to conduct surveillance and collect other information will have a broad and significant impact on the everyday lives of millions of Americans,"" he said. The small aircraft can be fitted with lightweight cameras. And Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the panel, said the technology may require lawmakers to develop a new definition of an unreasonable search, which is banned under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. ""The thought of government drones buzzing overhead monitoring the activities of law-abiding citizens,"" he said, ""runs contrary to the notion of what it means to live in a free society.""","Gov.

"Yemen's parliament Sunday called for an end to drone strikes on its territory after a U.S. missile attack mistakenly struck a wedding convoy, killing more than a dozen people. The nearly unanimous but non-binding vote was ""a strong warning"" to both the United States and the government of Yemeni President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi, a Yemeni government official told CNN. ""The Yemeni public is angered by the drone strikes,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to talk to reporters. ""The people's representatives reflected on the tone of the streets."" That anger was further stoked last week after what Yemeni security officials said was a U.S. attack in southwestern Yemen last week. Intelligence reports had identified the targeted convoy as carrying al Qaeda militants, but the passengers were actually members of a wedding party, the officials said. The officials said that 14 people were killed and 22 others wounded, nine critically. U.S. officials declined to comment on the report. The attacks are part of a joint U.S.-Yemeni campaign against al Qaeda, and Yemen's government is unlikely to approve any measure that would limit the use of unmanned aircraft, the government official said. ""Yemen's air force and troops can't carry out missions in remote areas. Drones have had success in targeting small number of militants,"" the official said. The highest-profile target of that campaign was Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesman for the Yemeni-based branch of al Qaeda. Al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011. But the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch reported in October that at least 57 civilians had also been killed by missiles fired from the unmanned aircraft.

"A long-time member of the Tennessee Army National Guard was killed in a shooting Wednesday in Tennessee, a spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. Authorities were questioning a person in connection with the shooting, the bureau's Josh DeVine told reporters gathered at the armory, located between the towns of Linden and Lobelville. DeVine said the person was not under arrest and wouldn't call him a suspect, but also indicated police are not actively looking for anyone else. Maj. Gen Max Haston of the Tennessee National Guard said the man killed had served in the Guard for more than 20 years and was a sergeant first class. He ran the day-to-day logistical operations for the unit. Sheriff Tommy Hickerson said he knew the man who was killed. ""He was a good friend of mine and we're not going to stop until we find out who did this,"" the sheriff said. It was not know if the victim and his assailant knew each other, officials said. Neither the victim nor the man being questioned were identified by name. DeVine said the incident happened inside a building and the gunman fired several times, striking the victim at least once. The armory is about 75 miles southwest of Nashville. N.C. grandfather shoots son, grandson fires back . Deputy's fatal shooting of boy carrying fake rifle ruled lawful .

"There is a dark duality about the Golden Gate Bridge.  Majestic and macabre, the bridge is an architectural wonder that also happens to be a magnet for suicides. It is the most-used suicide spot in the United States, second in the world. ""People come from all over the world to go onto this bridge,"" said Sergeant Kevin Briggs, a retired police officer who used to patrol the Golden Gate. ""Not just to sight-see, but also to take their life."" On Friday, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge Board of Directors unanimously approved $76 million in funding to erect a 20-foot-wide steel net -- extending out from each side of the 1.7-mile  span -- to deter would-be jumpers. The federal government will cover $50 million of the cost; the rest will come from state and local sources. Last year, 46 people died after jumping off the Golden Gate, according to the Bridge Rail Foundation, an organization dedicated to stopping suicides from the bridge. The organization estimates that more than 1,600 people have leapt to their deaths since the bridge opened in 1937. ""Where nets have been erected as suicide barriers they've proven to be 100% effective thus far,"" said Denis Mulligan, CEO and general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District, which presented the proposal to the board. ""Suicidal people have stopped jumping at those locations."" Those locations include the Clifton Suspension Bridge in England and the Duke Ellington Bridge in Washington, where, after barriers were installed, suicide rates went down dramatically. ""Apparently, suicidal individuals don't want to hurt themselves, they want to die,"" said Mulligan. ""So where nets have been erected, people stop jumping."" The decision to move forward with the Golden Gate plan punctuates a contentious fight that has simmered here for decades. On one side of the debate were those who believe a suicide barrier will detract from the bridge's beauty. On the other side were mental health and other advocates, some of whom bore an intimate sense of the potential benefits of such a barrier. One of the barrier proponents is Kevin Berthia. He stood on the precipice of the Golden Gate Bridge on a cold afternoon in March 2005. He was unemployed, drowning in a sea of medical bills, and distraught. ""I was hurting a lot,"" said Berthia. ""I was dealing with a lot of issues, and I felt like I was dealing with them by myself."" Almost as soon as he hopped over the 4-foot barrier (which many argued makes jumping too easy) to the bridge's outer railing, he was approached by Sergeant Briggs. Briggs had been there before. During his 23-year career, he coaxed more than 200 people back from that same railing. Two people he wasn't able to save. ""When someone goes over on the other side of that rail, it's like having a gun to their head, their finger on the trigger, and the hammer pulled back,"" said Briggs, founder of Pivotal Points, a crisis management and suicide prevention organization. ""They're ready to go. The pain is great -- they see no hope."" For more than 90 minutes, Briggs listened while Berthia talked, the biting wind swirling around them. As the minutes passed, Berthia says the burdens he was carrying slowly lifted. Eventually he decided to come back over the barrier. ""I knew things would get 10 times worse when I came back over, but I wanted to give it another shot,"" said Berthia, who says it took another eight years to get help for his mental health problems. Opposition faded . A few years ago, the transportation district invited public comment about installing a suicide barrier, said Mulligan, the transportation district head, and opinion was deeply divided. ""Leave the bridge alone,"" one commenter posted. ""It's not the bridge's fault people choose to commit suicide there."" Another commenter echoed a common perception about how effective a barrier could be: ""Sadly,  desperate people do commit suicide and they will find another means to do it if the GG bridge is not available to them."" An artist's rendering from the proposal shows a horizontal barrier that extends from the deck, beneath the roadway, and doesn't clash with the bridge's unique International Orange hue. Feds boosting mental health access, treatment . Berthia said a suicide net certainly would have discouraged him from considering jumping, that his attraction to the bridge was the ease with which he could perish. Very rarely do people who are stopped from jumping go on to commit suicide, according to a study published in 1978 by Richard Seiden, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. More than 90% of would-be jumpers who were stopped, according to the oft-cited study, were still alive decades later. Berthia and Briggs say the decision to fund a barrier is overdue. ""It should have been there a long time ago,"" said Berthia. ""A lot of lives could have been saved."" Briggs says that the father of a young man who died after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge summed it up potently for him. ""A view or a life? A view or a life?"" said Briggs, paraphrasing the father. Those few words were what he says convinced him that something needed to be done. When asked about advocates' argument that lives have been lost needlessly during the years the transportation group assembled its plan, Mulligan said, ""With the passage of time I think society's values and understanding of suicide has evolved, and so has our board's."" It will be several years before the net is built, said Mulligan. Still, a plan in motion -- even if it takes some time -- is of great solace to advocates. ""(It has been) 77 years of needless deaths and survivor family devastation,"" Kevin Hines, one of the rare people who survived a suicide attempt from the bridge, said before the board's vote. He said the move toward a safety barrier means the community at last is ""placing higher value and worth on people's lives over a piece of bright red iron.""

"A television commercial that prompted complaints for its portrayal of a white woman feeding a young black boy like a dog will not be formally investigated, South Africa's  advertising watchdog has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says it is satisfied the actions of the organization behind the advert, Feed a Child -- which has withdrawn the commercial and published a formal apology -- address complainants' concerns. The first scene from the advertisement shows the woman watching television with the boy lying across her lap. She strokes him like a pet and feeds him popcorn with her fingers. It then portrays the boy bringing her a newspaper as she eats breakfast in bed. She rewards him with a morsel of food. Icing a cake, she lets him lick her fingers and later passes him crumbs as she eats the cake. Finally the advertisement switches to a dining room where the woman is eating dinner, the young boy crouched on the floor below her, looking up. She passes him small portions of food in her fingers -- feeding him like a dog. The commercial then switches to a text message reading: ""The average domestic dog eats better than millions of children,"" before asking for donations to Feed a Child. On its website, Feed a Child says one in 10 children in South Africa suffers from malnutrition and dies within the first 12 months of life. The advert sparked a range of reaction on social media, some complained, including @AlexanderHampel who tweeted: . ""Definitely the wrong way to get a message across. Who approves these ads? Hugely racist. What do you think? feed a child #feedachild,"" While @CurateZar wrote: ""That advert was in such poor taste. Don't think there's a way to go around it. What were trying to achieve? Just wow. #FeedAChild . Meanwhile @MsLeloB wrote: ""People Outraged about the #FeedAChild ad as expected but is it not reality? Use that energy to feed a child not lodge complaints,"" ASA said it had received 12 complaints about the advertisement since Monday. ""The complainants submitted that the commercial is offensive, racist and tasteless. It suggests that white people treat and feed black kids like dogs, which is exceptionally degrading and dehumanizing,"" it said. ""The second complainant argued that the comparison between dog owners and starving children is unfounded and irrelevant. Every dog owner carries the responsibility to feed and care for their dog, just like the state and / or a parent carries the responsibility to care for their children. It is not the responsibility of dog owners to feed other people's children. Suggesting that white people are happy to feed their dogs expensive food, but not to help starving black children is offensive."" ASA said it was ""significant to note"" that Feed a Child had published a formal apology on its website and that its YouTube channel now featured a video of its CEO apologizing and contextualizing the advertisement and its intended commercial message. 'Unreserved apology' The video apology opens with text reading: ""Is this racist? Is this controversial? Is this offensive? Or is it about time ... we all stand together and feed the children of our beautiful country?"" Feed a Child founder and CEO Alza Rautenbach then addresses the camera. ""Like a child, I don't see race or politics -- the only thing that is important to me is to make a difference in a child's life and to make sure that that child is fed on a daily basis,"" she says in her statement. Feed a Child's online statement offers an ""unreserved apology"" to anyone offended or hurt by the commercial. ""We acknowledge the fact that the advert could be seen as insensitive or distasteful and we take heed to the fact that many perceived the advert as racist. This was most certainly not the intention, and again we apologize,"" Feed a Child said. In a statement released earlier, Feed a Child had said: ""The commercial is intentionally emotive to trigger the necessary awareness on this issue to generate engagement and contributions."" Advertising company Ogilvy and Mather, who created the advertisement, also issued an apology, saying it was aware of the ""negative reaction"" it sparked and that it had not intended to cause offense.","An advert showing a white woman feeding a black boy like a dog has run in South Africa .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least 13 people are dead and many workers still missing Saturday evening after a fire broke out inside a factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh -- the latest such deadly blaze in the south Asian nation. Mohammad Salimuzzaman, the officer in charge of the police station in the area of the nation's capital were the fire occurred, said authorities had sent at least 13 bodies to a hospital morgue. Many of the bodies were disfigured and charred beyond recognition. A short time earlier, Dhaka police chief Asaduzzaman Mia told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five-story building. ""The rescuers were still searching for bodies in the debris,"" Mia said. Such factories -- making products for a number of Western retailers -- play a big part in Bangladesh's economy, with ready-made garments alone making up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. The factory that burned Saturday was used to make plastic goods. These buildings haven't always proven to be the safest places to work. There are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in Bangladesh, the most glaring being the spring 2013 collapse of a nine-story building that housed five garment factories. More than 1,100 people died in that blaze. Saturday's fire started on the plastic factor's ground floor and immediately and quickly spread, fueled by flammable chemicals in the building, firefighters said. Authorities didn't say how many people were in the building when this happened, and thus how many remained unaccounted for. Yet some of those escaped -- and there were many -- estimated about 80 or 90 others worked there. Afterward, the scene filled with not only firefighters but several thousand onlookers, some of them trying to track down their still-missing relatives. Firefighters didn't specify exactly what caused the blaze, though they suspected a busted gas cylinder may be to blame. Past factory fires have led to emotional rhetoric from officials, calls for action and, in some cases, criminal charges. Thirteen people were found guilty of gross negligence of safety measures and charged with ""culpable homicide"" after a  November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts that killed at least 117 people and spurred others to jump from the building to escape the flames. Most of those dead in that blaze were women, almost half of them burned so bad that DNA tests were needed to identify them. The building collapse months later in Dhaka was even more appalling and exponentially more deadly. That blaze spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers rights in Bangladesh. The government responded by revampling laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Bangladesh, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","A fire breaks out at a plastics factory in Bangladesh's capital .

"(CNN)At least 30 people, including two children, have been killed in shelling in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, city officials said Saturday, in the latest violence to rock the disputed Donetsk region. Another 102 people were injured, at least 75 of whom needed hospital treatment, and many suffered shrapnel injuries, Mariupol City Council said. Pro-Russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city, Donetsk regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said on his Facebook page. The Interior Ministry said one person was arrested in connection with the attack. Based on preliminary assessments, the shells were fired from Grad rocket systems, a statement from Mariupol City Council said. The statement also said the situation was under control, and urged residents not to panic but to rely on information from official sources only. Monitors with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of Grad and Uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro-Russian rebel group Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned of increased international pressure on Russia. ""We call on Russia to end its support for separatists immediately, close the international border with Ukraine, and withdraw all weapons, fighters and financial backing,"" Kerry said in a statement. The White House says Vice President Biden spoke with Ukraine President Poroshenko on Saturday. They ""expressed grave concern over Russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the September Minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict,"" the White House said. The two leaders vowed to ""ensure that the costs continue to rise on Russia for its aggressive actions against Ukraine."" Thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year and a ceasefire agreed to in September in Minsk, Belarus, crumbled long ago. U.S. officials took to Twitter to condemn the latest violence. ""Today's indiscriminate shelling of Mariupol (is) part of an apparently Russian-backed general offensive in complete violation of Minsk agreements,"" said U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt. ""Russia's escalation continues -- Kremlin's callous disregard for human life (incl Russian soldiers) on full display in Ukraine,"" said Daniel Baer, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met this week in Berlin to discuss a way out of the violence. But despite the talks, violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions shows no sign of abating. Thursday's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians, according to state news reports. But Ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well. That includes 115 attacks in a recent 24-hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more, Ukrinform, the Ukrainian national news agency, reported Friday. The OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine condemned continuing fighting in civilian areas in a statement Saturday and urged both sides to refrain from using force in such areas, including near Donetsk airport. ""Using residential areas as firing positions attracts counter-firing to these areas, further endangering the lives of civilians,"" it said. ""All parties need to take robust and immediate action in order to end the new escalation in fighting and its heavy toll on civilians."" Opinion: Time to rethink Ukraine deal . Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment over the border. In a bid to put pressure on Moscow over Ukraine, the United States and European Union have imposed financial sanctions against Russian interests. Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said ""more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops."" Moscow denies the claims. Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the wave of recent casualties on those giving the order to fire in heavily populated areas, in remarks reported by the state-run Itar-Tass news agency Friday. ""Those who give such criminal orders bear responsibility for this. People doing that should know that there is no other way of resolving such conflicts than peace negotiations and political measures,"" he said. Putin also suggested Ukraine was not interested in finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis and said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. From mid-April 2014 to January 21, the conflict killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, according to the United Nations. ""We fear that the real figure may be considerably higher,""  the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said about the death toll in a report released Friday.

"(CNN) -- Mr. McDonald, . Congratulations on your nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. As a good citizen you have agreed to take on one of the most demanding and important jobs in Washington. As a veteran yourself, you can appreciate how shaken veterans and their families are by the scandals and corruption that has been exposed throughout the VA. I know you will agree that we owe our veterans the best care and we have failed to deliver. Given the scale of the challenge, I hope you will not mind if, as someone who has spent nearly five decades in politics and government and has seen scores of Cabinet secretaries come and go, I share a few thoughts on the position to which you've been nominated. Should the Senate confirm you to this post, you will take command of the VA at the most troubled time in its history. The reports of corruption, incompetence, and corruption to hide incompetence have drawn the nation's outrage and caused your predecessor to resign. How might you succeed at reform where so many others before you have failed? Given your lifetime spent in business, probably you are familiar with W. Edwards Deming's famous ""Red Bead Experiment."" Deming used to carry around a bin full of red beads and white beads mixed together. He would describe to audiences his intention to gather up just the white beads, and then he would blindly plunge a scoop into the bin. To his ostensible frustration, the scoop would always emerge with a mix of both kinds of beads. Feigning disbelief, he would appoint a new person to wield the scoop. Invariably, he or she would fail as well. Then Deming would proceed to the next candidate, and so on. The point of the Deming demonstration was to illustrate that a systems problem couldn't be solved with new people, new slogans and new speeches. When the system is broken, the personalities don't matter. People will fail one after the next until the system is changed. The range and scale of the misconduct at the VA shows that the corruption there, like the doomed attempt to isolate white beads, is not just a problem of personalities but more importantly of systems, and it goes to the very core of the bureaucracy. The VA's Office of Inspector General is investigating at least 70 facilities nationwide for allegations that administrators altered appointment data or used secret waiting lists to make patient wait times appear shorter. When you have that many facilities in trouble simultaneously you are not dealing with a few bad apples, a failure of a few leaders, or a need for better inspections. With that many places simultaneously in trouble, you have a system and a culture that have been corrupted and are collapsing. The agency's own audit found that 70% of VA medical facilities were using improper scheduling practices to hide long wait times by falsifying data. The wait times persist despite (or more likely because of) the fact that VA doctors see fewer than half as many patients as doctors in the private sector. This is a department that has 40% more employees and costs 90% more money than it did in 2006. Operating rooms close at 3 p.m. so the union cleaning staff can leave by 5 p.m. Officials get bonuses no matter what their performance, apparently (though 100% of them were given ""fully successful"" performance reviews or better last year -- a remarkable achievement in light of the agency's widespread mismanagement). It takes 175 days to transfer a veteran's medical records from the Department of Defense to the VA. The DoD and the VA spent $1.3 billion and four years trying to build software to solve this issue before announcing in February that they had given up. Failure this thorough points to a system -- the giant, fossilized bureaucracy -- that is hopelessly broken and must be replaced rather than repaired. Unfortunately, the entrenched bureaucrats, the unions, and the President, along with many others in Congress who are ideologically committed to a failed model of delivering health care, all oppose the systemic changes that could actually work. Mr. McDonald, you are about to become the next guy holding the scoop at the VA. The prison guards of the past might write legislation to give you a bigger scoop, and then they will call the problem solved. Your job, as the new champion of our nation's veterans, will be to focus the public's outrage and to marshal support for real change. Opportunities to force the kind of transformation the VA needs come along once or twice in a generation. It would be a tragic mistake if, after the enormous human pain that led to your appointment, you allowed the moment to pass. What would systemic change look like? It would begin with enforcing the right metrics, with measuring success not by how well the Department serves the bureaucrats but by how well it serves our veterans. This would mean insisting the VA meet the standards our veterans are accustomed to as consumers in every other aspect of their lives -- the world where services work and are increasingly digital, mobile, virtual and personal. The VA is a long way from that today, and to get there it will have to become a radically different agency with many fewer bureaucrats operating under a new set of assumptions. The fight to change the VA will be big. But the ramifications could extend well beyond your single department. The whole federal bureaucracy is broken, swollen into an unrestrained fourth branch of government. If you can harness public support to transform the current VA into a system based on choice, accountability and efficiency, you could be setting the pattern for replacing the entire bureaucratic state with a government for the modern world. It would be a fitting conclusion to a century plagued by bureaucracy if the renewal of American governance were to begin at the VA, a department which exemplified the system's worst tendencies from the start. Charles Forbes, the first person to hold the position to which you have been nominated, stole tens of thousands of dollars from the bureau after World War I, as did many of his cronies. The corruption is not new, but nearly 100 years of it is enough. I hope you will be the secretary with the courage to demand the fundamental change our veterans need. The American people will be with you, even if many in Washington are not. Sincerely, . Newt Gingrich . VA boss plans 'personnel action' this week in wait-list case .

"(CNN) -- We have no comprehension of what is going through the minds of 200 Nigerian girls abducted from their school on April 14. We cannot know their darkest fears or the pain and anguish they have had to endure from the Boko Haram terrorists who took them. We cannot imagine for a second what their families are feeling. But there is one thing we do understand: A rage is gathering worldwide at extremist groups that deny young girls their right to education. And we must take action. Wednesday, July 23, marks a tragic milestone. It is the girls' 100th day in captivity. For an adolescent with plans, dreams and ambitions, 100 days must seem an eternity. But they are not alone. The world has not forgotten these girls. Not in 100 days. Not for one day. On Wednesday, vigils will be staged in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe and the United States. Candlelit demonstrations will be held in African countries from Togo and Tunisia to Tanzania, organized by the Global March Against Child Labour, which fears the girls might be trafficked into slavery. Schoolgirls will take to the streets in Pakistan, led by Baela Raza Jamil of Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi, or ITA, the girls' rights group campaigning for what the Chibok girls have lost -- their right to an education. In India, vigils will be led by Kailash Sakharti and the Bachpan Bachao Andolan group, which rescues children from bonded labor every day, and has common cause with girls who have been taken from their homes. Opinion: 100 days on, Nigerians haunted by girls' kidnapping . Walk Free, the anti-slavery organization led by Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, who has exposed the extent of child slavery in the modern world, is throwing its weight behind the campaign. And across the globe, A World at School's 500 Global Youth Ambassadors led by the U.N. Youth envoy will be marking the events, handing in petitions to embassies and consulates in the world's biggest capitals. An online petition by A World at School calls for the safe return of the girls and all messages of support will be passed to families of the girls and Chibok community leaders. The petition supporting the president of Nigeria in all his military and diplomatic efforts to bring back the girls will also be sent to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon. Coinciding with the July 23 vigil is the deployment, by the Nigerian government, to the Borno area, of helicopters and aircraft with enhanced surveillance capacity and night vision equipment, capable of identifying the captured girls. Around the globe there is an understanding that Nigeria is simply the latest country after the United States with 9/11 in 2001 and Britain with its 7/7 in 2005 to be hit by terrorist outrages -- and that in its hour of need, Nigeria deserves the support of the world community against a terrorist sect that thinks nothing of killing and raping schoolgirls and seeks to deny them the basic right to education. The petition is not just for the rescue of the girls but for the rebuilding of their Chibok school and the creation of safer schools throughout Nigeria, particularly in those areas where girls are not going to school for fear of terrorism. The Safe Schools Initiative, a fund set up to pilot 500 safe schools in northern Nigeria, brings the Nigerian government and Nigerian business leaders together with the international community to ensure that all children are secure when learning. The fund total stands at $23 million. Young people are demonstrating because they see the connection between abductions in Nigeria, the rapes and murders of young girls in India, so-called ""honor killings"" of Pakistan girls who marry against family wishes, genital mutilation of girls in preparation for child marriages across Africa and the ever-present reality that 7 million school age girls are working full time, often in slave labor conditions, many of them trafficked out of their home country when they should be at school. There is a common denominator: Seventy years on, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has failed to take girls' rights seriously. So, girls are taking action to make themselves heard. Incensed by the realization that it could take 100 years for them to have the same right to basic education -- as guaranteed in the declaration -- as boys, girls will lead their liberation struggle. And the new divide across the world will no longer be between the educated and the uneducated but the educated and those demanding to be educated. Slowly but surely, local embryonic civil rights movements are linking up with global leaders: Girls Not Brides, Walk Free and A World at School are now umbrella organizations, pioneering the creation of hundreds of youth ambassadors and part of the emergency coalition to achieve zero child labor, zero child marriage, zero education exclusion and zero discrimination against girls at schools. The Emergency Coalition for Global Education Action, to get 57 million children in school, will be launched in September during U.N. General Assembly week. The coalition will call on the international community to take action. The message every day is loud and it is clear. Girls should be able to study in a classroom, free of fear, and without the need, as they will do on Wednesday, to demonstrate on the streets.","Vigils around the world for Nigerian girls, who have been held captive 100 days .

"Marijuana prohibition laws are slowly going up in smoke. An Alaska citizens' group is pushing to legalize recreational marijuana, which would make it the third state to do so after Colorado and Washington. Driven by growing public support, Campaign to Regulate Marijuana submitted more than 45,000 signatures Wednesday to Alaska election officials. It needs about 30,000 verified signatures to qualify for the August state ballot. ""The proposed initiative will take marijuana sales out of the underground market and put them in legitimate, taxpaying businesses,"" said Tim Hinterberger, one of the initiative's sponsors.  ""Replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of taxation and sensible regulation will bolster Alaska's economy by creating jobs and generating revenue for the state."" The proposal similar to one passed in Colorado legalizes the growing, buying and consumption of marijuana for adults ages 21 or older, CNN affiliate KTUU reported. Alaska law currently allows those with a medicinal marijuana prescription to legally grow up to six plants or have up to one ounce, according to the affiliate. The proposal will not only open doors for recreational use, it provides more options for medicinal marijuana users with limited access, Hinterberger told the affiliate. Colorado pot law called springboard for other states . But marijuana legalization opponents say there are serious health consequences, and argue the drug is often a gateway to harmful, addictive substances. Washington and Colorado legalized recreational marijuana last year, but the latter became the first state to commence sales this month. Sales in Washington have not started yet. In addition to Colorado and Washington, 18 other states and the District of Columbia allow some legal use of marijuana, primarily for medicinal purposes. Pro-recreational marijuana Initiatives are expected in various states in 2016, including Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana and Nevada, according to Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project.

"In a scene out of the Cold War, Cuban President Raul Castro and ailing brother Fidel met with the current leader of the communist island's longtime economic benefactor, the state press reported Saturday. During a daylong visit on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his counterpart signed a slew of agreements expanding cooperation between the two countries. Putin also visited with Fidel Castro at his home outside Havana. Pictures released in Cuban state media showed the men standing and a smiling, with Putin placing his hand on Castro's arm. Castro was sidelined in 2006 by a mystery gastrointestinal illness and no longer holds official duties, but he still regularly greets visiting heads of state. Cuba was the first stop on Putin's Latin American tour, which will take him to Argentina and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the World Cup final game on Sunday. Russia is set to host the next World Cup in 2018. On Saturday, Argentina President Cristina Kirchner tweeted a picture of her shaking hands with Putin. ""Argentina is Russia´s main strategic partner in Latin America, the United Nations and the G20 Group,"" Putin said hours before departing for his trip to Latin America, according to the Telam news agency of Argentina. In an interview with the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, Putin said the ""Latin American nations that struggled for their independence inspire our deepest respect for their autonomy and their right to self-determination."" ""Today, cooperation with the Latin American nations is one of the key orientations and prospects of Russian foreign policy,"" Putin told Prensa Latina. ""Multilateralism in world affairs, respect to international law, strengthening of the central role of the U.N. and sustainable development are the principles that bring us together."" Last week, Russian officials agreed to forgive 90% of the more than $30 billion Cuba still owed Russia. The remaining $3.5 billion would be paid back over a space of 10 years and reinvested in Cuba. ""It's a great sign of the generosity of Russia towards Cuba,"" Raul Castro said in video released of the agreement signing with Putin. The two countries announced they also would cooperate more closely on energy, security and health matters. The head of the Russian oil drilling consortium Rosneft accompanied Putin on the trip, and Cuban officials announced that the firm would help them explore for oil off the island's northern coast. Several international companies have drilled for a massive reserve of oil Cuban officials believe lies about 50 miles off their shores, but so far all have come up dry. Cuba and Russia once enjoyed one of the firmest Cold War alliances, but that special relationship between ended abruptly with the collapse of the Soviet bloc at the start of the 1990s. The loss of supplies from oil-rich Russia along with the end of favorable trade and aid that once propped up Cuba's ailing economy plunged Cuba into an severe economic crisis. In an interview published in the Cuban communist party newspaper Granma on Friday, Putin promised a new era of closer relations with Cuba. ""We are disposed to recover lost possibilities,"" Putin said. Following the crisis in Ukraine, Russian officials said they were looking to establish new naval bases in handful of countries, including Cuba. While Cuban officials have said little about the Russian overtures, they have several times allowed a Russian spy ship to dock and resupply in Havana's port. It remains to be seen how significantly the two countries can aid one another as both Cuba and Russia deal with flagging economies and the impacts of U.S. trade sanctions. ""They are looking at ways to rebuild the relationship but it's not that easy anymore,"" said Marc Frank, author of the book ""Cuban Revelations."" ""Russia is no longer the Soviet Union while Cuba is still a Cuba. It's a communist country while Russia really is not."" According to Granma, Fidel Castro discussed with Putin his research into growing food in tropical and subtropical climates as a way to fight the effects of global warming. Many Cubans said they remembered the relative economic security that the alliance with the Soviet Union brought and welcomed a renewed Russian presence on the island. The child of a Cuban father and Russian mother, Andrei Shevsou in 2013 opened the Havana restaurant Tavariche, which serves Russian food and is filled with mementos of the Soviet era in Cuba. ""One country is cold, the other is hot. We have different food, different ways of thinking,"" he said. ""But we found common ground because [we] lived through historic times together.""

"Catholic bishops ""will be held accountable"" for failing to protect children from sexual abuse, Pope Francis said Monday, his strongest acknowledgment yet of what abuse victims have been saying for decades: that the cover-ups have often been as bad as the crimes. But without strong action to back up those words, such groups are likely to view Francis' comments as little more than lip service. Vatican officials have so far been reluctant to take action against bishops accused of concealing abuse. In a homily given during a private Mass with six victims of church sexual abuse, Francis apologized for the abuse and asked for forgiveness. ""I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members, as well as by abuse victims themselves,"" Francis said in the homily, according to a text of the statement provided by the Vatican. ""This led to even greater suffering on the part of those who were abused and it endangered other minors who were at risk,"" he said. In his homily, Francis said that ""all bishops must carry out their pastoral ministry with the utmost care in order to help foster the protection of minors, and they will be held accountable."" Despite the strong words, a victims advocacy group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said Monday's session failed to advance the cause of preventing molestation by priests, arguing that ""no child on earth is safer today because of this meeting."" ""Let's not mistake this meeting today for real action,"" SNAP President Barbara Blaine told CNN. ""The meeting today will not make children safer."" ""I think that Pope Francis has yet to take strong action that will protect children and he could do that by firing the bishops who have been complicit and who are transferring predators,"" she said. Opinion: Pope's apology on sex abuse still doesn't cut it . Francis has called for ""zero tolerance"" of sexual abuse by clerics, and last week a Vatican tribunal defrocked Polish Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski after finding him guilty of sexual abuse of minors. CNN religion commentator Rev. Edward Beck said that was a sign of change. ""So what people have been calling for with regards to the hierarchy needing to accept responsibility and action be taken against them has already begun to happen,"" he said. Blaine rejected the notion Wesolowski's defrocking was a major shift, saying church officials had covered up for him in the past and have failed to do enough to facilitate his prosecution in the Dominican Republic, where at least some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred. Monday's meeting between Francis and the six victims of church sexual abuse was not the first such meeting between a pontiff and survivors, but it was the first of Francis' papacy. It involved three men and three women from Britain, Ireland and Germany who met privately with Francis for about 30 minutes in his private residence at Casa Santa Marca, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters. The abuse survivors also celebrated Mass with Francis. Lombardi said the victims emerged from the meeting moved by what he described as a ""profound spiritual encounter and dialogue."" ""If you had seen the people coming out of the meeting, it would have been totally, absolutely clear that it was not a publicity stunt,"" Lombardi said, reacting to a statement last month by SNAP calling the meeting ""self-serving."" ""The most important thing the Pope hopes to come out of this occasion, is that the victims themselves felt welcomed and listened to,"" Lombardi said. In his homily, Francis acknowledged that sexual abuse by priests has had profound consequences on victims. ""Many of those who have suffered in this way have also sought relief in the path of addiction,"" he said. ""Others have experienced difficulties in significant relationships, with parents, spouses and children. Suffering in families has been especially grave, since the damage provoked by abuse affects these vital family relationships."" ""Some have even had to deal with the terrible tragedy of the death of a loved one by suicide,"" Francis told the victims. ""The deaths of these so beloved children of God weigh upon the heart and my conscience and that of the whole Church."" Francis became Pope in March 2013. While critics have said he should have met with victims earlier, Francis has said he believes the Church has been unfairly attacked. The Pope asked Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to help organize the meeting. O'Malley is a member of a new commission spearheaded by Francis -- the Commission for the Protection of Minors -- to advise him on ways to help move forward after the Church's sex abuse crisis. One member of the group is a woman who was a sex abuse victim.","""Let's not mistake this meeting today for real action,"" victim's group head says .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN)Twelve people were killed Friday in shelling in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk, an official with the pro-separatist City Council said, as the conflict between the military and pro-Russian separatists escalated in the past week. CNN could not confirm 12 deaths, but its team in Donetsk saw seven bodies after a series of shell blasts near the center of the city. Five bodies, concealed under sheets, could be seen at a spot by the Hotel Europe, where a local billionaire has organized food aid handouts by his staff. One man had died at the wheel of his car. A shell apparently hit near where dozens of people were waiting in line for much needed supplies. Elsewhere, two more bodies could be seen where a trolley bus was hit. Until now the fighting has largely been concentrated on the outskirts of the city, near the airport. But Friday, the blasts moved significantly closer to the city center, where there are no obvious military targets. It's not clear who is responsible for the shelling. In previous instances, each side has blamed the other. What is clear is the mounting civilian death toll, with the ordinary residents of Donetsk being caught up in the fighting. Last Saturday, at least 30 civilians were killed in shelling in the southeastern city of Mariupol, while eight people died when a transit stop in Donetsk was shelled two days earlier. There has been fierce fighting around the town of Debaltseve, northeast of Donetsk, where separatist forces have almost surrounded Ukrainian troops. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki condemned the fighting there in remarks Thursday and pointed the finger firmly at the pro-Russian rebels for any casualties. ""Over the past week, the separatists have fired countless rockets at the city, killing and wounding scores of innocent people, and prompting the Ukrainian government and local NGOs to organize a citywide evacuation,"" she said. ""There can also be no mistake about Russia's role in the escalation of violence, which is causing suffering and death among those Russia has claimed it wants to protect."" The government in Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into Ukraine. Moscow denies the allegation, although it has said some Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine as volunteers. Presenting his annual report Friday at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said 2014 had been a ""black year"" for European security. Russia is following a ""disturbing pattern,"" he said, ""using military force to annex Crimea, destabilize eastern Ukraine and intimidate its neighbors"" in disregard of international law. On Thursday, the European Union Foreign Affairs Council announced it was extending the financial sanctions imposed against Russian and Ukrainian separatist interests until September in response to the mounting violence. It will also decide whether to add more names to the list of those sanctioned when it meets February 9. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said she was pleased the European Union was maintaining a united front on the issue. ""We hope this can help put pressure, in particular on Russia, to take positive steps and prevent negative steps to you've seen in recent days,"" she said. In a statement, the council strongly condemned ""the indiscriminate shelling of the residential areas, especially in Mariupol and the recent escalation of fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine."" It said it was shocked by the high number of casualties, adding: ""It notes evidence of continued and growing support given to the separatists by Russia, which underlines Russia's responsibility."" There are now 900,000 internally displaced people and 600,000 refugees as a result of the conflict, the council said. The EU has already given 95 million euros for humanitarian assistance, it said. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Friday that it was ""disappointed"" by the council's decision on sanctions and accused it of bias in favor of Kiev, saying it was hostage to an ""aggressive minority"" that is opposed to Russia. ""It's time for the European Union to realize the futility of the sanctions standoff that only hurts people and our economies,"" the ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced Monday that Kiev would ask the Hague tribunal to investigate alleged ""crimes against humanity"" in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The conflict broke out last spring after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region and as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. A ceasefire agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, in September crumbled long ago. New talks were supposed to be taking place in Minsk, aimed at finding a political solution to the crisis, but there are conflicting reports as to whether they had been delayed. The new talks were unlikely to happen because representatives for Ukraine's government had not arrived Friday, even though rebel representatives were there, said Eduard Basurin, the self-declared defense minister for the rebel group Donetsk People's Republic. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, according to the United Nations. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Donetsk, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Lucy Pawle contributed to this report.","12 people killed in shelling, says official with pro-separatist City Council .

"For anyone holding out hope of Pluto being reinstated as a major planet, you should probably do as they say in the movie ""Frozen"" and ""let it go."" But here's a new exciting find from the far reaches of our solar system: Astronomers have discovered a dwarf planet that's even farther away than Pluto -- so far, in fact, that its orbit reaches into a new edge of the solar system. The dwarf planet's current name is 2012 VP113, and it is located in a  ""wasteland or badland of the solar system,"" said astronomer Chad Trujillo, head of adaptive optics at Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and co-discoverer of this object. His study was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. ""The big question is, how is this formed? How can you get an object out there?"" he said. ""We really don't know an answer to that yet."" This dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit, Trujillo said. On its elliptical path, the closest it ever comes to the sun is still very far away from the rest of the solar system. Its full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system. ""Nothing that we currently know in the solar system can make objects that are so distant all the time, that never come close to any of the planets,"" Trujillo said. The most distant major planet from the sun is Neptune, orbiting our star at a distance of 30 astronomical units. One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the sun -- about 150 million kilometers, or 93 million miles. Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of small objects, which extends from about 30 to 55 AU, according to NASA. This belt may contain hundreds of thousands of large icy objects and trillions of comets, if not more. Pluto is considered a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. The awkwardly-named 2012 VP113 is much farther from the sun, currently at 83 astronomical units. That puts it at 83 times the distance between our own planet and the sun (The closest point of its orbit is 80 astronomical units). But in terms of average distance from the sun, there is a dwarf planet even farther out: Eris, which Trujillo helped discover. Eris is bigger than Pluto, and has a satellite called Dysnomia. The presence of Eris helped scientists determine that Pluto should not be counted among the major planets. Sedna, a dwarf planet that Trujillo co-discovered as well in 2004, is located in the same distant area, and takes about 10,500 years to orbit the sun. ""Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke,"" said Mike Brown, professor of astronomy at California Institute of Technology, in an e-mail. ""But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed."" This home of Sedna and 2012 VP113 is called the ""inner Oort Cloud."" It may be where some comets come from, Trujillo said. Trujillo's study also suggests that there could be a large planet that no one has seen, way out at 250 astronomical units, affecting the orbits of Sedna and the new dwarf planet. But this is only a theory; the planet has not been detected. Brown, who was not involved in this study, also co-discovered Sedna. ""These unusual objects --  Sedna and this new one -- can tell us about very early in the solar system, when the sun and planets were just forming,"" Brown said. Scientists have not been able to discern what 2012 VP113's composition is, but most would suspect it is icy because of its distance from the sun, Trujillo said. Its color is slightly reddish, and ""not especially unusual compared to Kuiper Belt objects,"" Trujillo said. Trujllio and colleagues estimate that the new dwarf planet is relatively small -- about 450 kilometers (280 miles) in diameter, which less than the driving distance from Philadelphia to Boston. It's probably ball-shaped, he said. So why is this not a major planet such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars? Trujillo explains that a bona fide planet is big enough that other objects in its orbit will be sucked into it gravitationally. A dwarf planet is not big enough to become gravitationally dominant; it's too small to pull in objects in the area of its path. It's possible that this dwarf planet formed very early in our solar system's history, in the region between Jupiter and Saturn, and then got thrown out beyond Pluto. One theory is that, billions of years ago, another star passed by our sun and took material with it out to a distant orbit. As far as we know, it's too cold out where the dwarf planet is to have liquid water, Trujillo said. ""To me, what this discovery really shows is that we are on verge of finally being able to read the story that Sedna is trying to tell us, and that the next few years should bring a flood of new discoveries in this new region of the outer solar system,"" Brown said. 2012 VP113 will be eventually renamed, but Trujillo's website says it's informally called ""Biden"" because of the ""VP"" designation.

"South Sudan's fractious leadership, mass killings and ethnic violence contributed to its No. 1 position on the list of the world's most fragile nations, said Fund For Peace, a Washington-based nonprofit  that compiles the annual list. However, the United States -- which ranked 159 on the overall list of 178 countries, followed by France and the United Kingdom in a subcategory of ""very stable"" countries -- was among the countries that have worsened the most over the past year, a new report says. The index is based on 12 social, economic and political indicators, including demographic pressures, poverty and economic decline, human rights and political impasse. Until this year, the nonprofit referred to it as the list of failed states. Somalia had led the list for six years. Somalia's fall to second place is due to its ""trajectory of improvement,"" despite lawlessness, terrorism and ineffective government, the group said. Other countries in the top 10 are the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Chad, Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti and Pakistan. Syria was not left out: Its yearslong civil war placed it at No. 15. Iran leads in improvement . The list had some surprises as well. Iran led a pack of most-improved nations, with the report saying it had stabilized somewhat ""after recent political and social turmoil."" The most-improved group included a cluster of countries with tense relations with the United States -- ""quite coincidentally,"" according to the report's authors -- including Zimbabwe, Cuba, Bolivia and China. U.S. on list of worsening countries . Some developed nations picked up dubious honors, too. France was listed as the seventh-most-worsened country this year, ""largely as a result of a political and economic malaise,"" the group said. It said the United States tied with Singapore and Thailand for eighth-most-worsened country. The top nation on that list was the Central African Republic, which is deep in a conflict involving widespread atrocities. 'Not exclusive to developing countries' The U.S. made the list for various reasons, including the lack of bipartisanship in Congress and the partial government shutdown last year, the group said. ""The recent worsening of the United States, France, and Singapore also shows us that instability is not exclusive to developing countries,"" the group said. The three nonetheless remain near the bottom of the overall fragility rankings, in a group of nations classified as ""very stable."" South Sudan chaos . South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011, making it the world's youngest nation. But excitement over its independence did not last long. Fighting erupted in December after President Salva Kiir accused Vice President Riek Machar of plotting a coup. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes as forces loyal to both leaders battle it out. The list covers the past year and excludes a handful of countries with inadequate data.

"A car bomb exploded just outside the French Embassy in Tripoli early Tuesday morning, injuring two French security guards and a Libyan girl, officials said. The blast was so powerful it blew the front wall off the embassy. Homes can cars adjacent to the embassy sustained heavy damage, and the windows of nearby buildings in this upscale, largely residential neighborhood were also blown out. During a visit to the area, Deputy Prime Minister Awad Barasi said a 13-year-old girl in a nearby house was injured in the attack and will be taken to Tunisia for treatment. Barasi, who condemned the attack, said he had spoken with the French ambassador to Libya, who assured him he will not leave Tripoli. The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attack. ""In conjunction with the Libyan authorities, our government departments will make every effort to ensure that all light be shed on the circumstances of this heinous act and its perpetrators quickly identified,"" the foreign ministry said. Barasi told CNN it was too early to ""jump into conclusions"" about who might have carried out the attack. A criminal investigation is under way to try to determine who was behind the attack and why. At least four French investigators were at the scene with what appeared to be forensic equipment gathering evidence. They seemed to be leading the investigation and working with Libyan officials from the Criminal Investigations Division. Libya's Interior Minister Ashour Shuail, who visited the site along with the country's justice minister, said one of the two French security guards had undergone a surgery in Tripoli and was now in stable condition. He would not say who the government believes is behind the attack and said the investigation would reveal that. The minister said security will be increased around diplomatic missions in the capital. Responding to questions about lax security, Shuail said no country is immune to this sort of security breach, not even the United States, referencing last week's Boston Marathon bombings. Residents in the area complained about lax security at  the French Embassy. While there has been no claim of responsibility, Libyans at the scene blamed extremist groups. ""We have to admit they exist here in Libya,"" said Mustafa, who was in a nearby house. ""They are small groups, no one likes them or supports them."" Western intelligence officials have said militants linked to al Qaeda had training camps in Libya. After the French military intervention in Mali in January, there were fears militants could strike French interests in the region, including Libya, which has been struggling to impose security across the country since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi. At a news conference, Shuail said he could not link the attack to Mali. He said Libya has to first deal with the widespread weapons in the country. Rami El Obeidi, former intelligence chief during the Libyan revolution, blamed the attack on al Qaeda-linked groups. ""Without a doubt, extremist Jihadi movements aligned to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (are responsible).  Same alliance that's responsible for the attacks on the British, American, and Italian missions in Benghazi, their proven involvement in the Algeria attack, and the logistical support that was given to AQIM elements in Mali,"" El Obeidi said. The French Embassy bombing follows a series of attacks last year that targeted foreign diplomatic missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the eastern city of Benghazi. The attacks are believed to be the work of Islamist extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda. Last September, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. According to El Obeidi, Tuesday's early morning blast was a message to the French government about the capabilities of these groups, rather than a blast that aimed to kill. Residents and embassy staff said the bomb detonated an hour before the area is busy with dozens of Libyans who line up daily to apply for visas. ""This was a political message because the attack was not designed to kill anyone, especially not Libyans, as this would have caused fractures within the extremist movements currently operating inside Libya"" El Obeidi added.","Libyan deputy prime minister: The French ambassador said he will not leave Tripoli .

"The rockets start raining down at her kibbutz usually around late morning. That leaves Adele Raemer precious little time to walk her two dogs and then dash into the shower. Because when those rockets arrive -- triggering air raid sirens that fill the air with short, shrill howls -- she has to be ready to duck and take cover in her indoor bomb shelter. There, all she can do is wait. **** . On the other side of the border, across the security fence in Gaza, Rasha has no safe room to run to. The fighter jets can come any time, day or night. And in this place, one of the most congested on earth, there's a high probability that if a bomb falls nearby, it might destroy her house, too. So, all she can do is pray. **** . This isn't what life was always like for either woman. But ever since the long simmering tension between Israelis and Palestinians flared up this week, rockets and airstrikes have crisscrossed between Gaza and Israel. Neither woman cares for the politics of hate. They just want to live a life of peace and safety. But the new normal has upended everything -- for them and for those around them . Fear for daughter's border wedding . One fence, two fates . Raemer lives in Kibbutz Nirim, a Jewish community in Eshkol, just over a mile and a half from the border with Gaza. The fortified safe room has become the focus of Raemer's life around the clock. ""Everything is ready to make it easy to run (to the safe room),"" she says. She has shoved her coffee table, her carpet, anything that blocks her path off to the side, so she can make it there in seconds. Authorities warn that it takes a rocket just 15 seconds to land after the warning has sounded. ""It's not 15 seconds. It's closer to 10,"" she says. ""Sometimes you hear boom and then you run."" Rasha lives in Khan Yunis. She's afraid to use her real name. She doesn't want her identity published, because she worries someone might misconstrue what she says as political statements, take offense and come after her. Like Raemer, the attacks have consumed her, without her wanting it to. Schools are closed. Shops are abandoned. She sits at home all day. When the power goes out, she sits in the dark, listening to sounds of bombs dropping. ""The sound is very strong,"" she says. Close calls . Raemer is an online trainer. She works a lot from home. So, unlike many others, she doesn't have to step outside much for work, and risk her life every time. But there have been close calls. Since tensions spiked, the kibbutz store has kept minimal hours. It's open for an hour in the morning and one in the afternoon. So Raemer popped by recently to pick up rations. Then she heard something. ""I ran into the refrigerator room,"" she says. There have been others. Four rockets have landed within the borders of Nirim this week. She is also afraid of Hamas digging tunnels underneath the kibbutz and filling them with explosives. Collateral damage . In Khan Yunis, neighbors poring through the ruins of what were homes has become a familiar sight. It happened again on Tuesday when Israeli warplanes flattened a house. It belonged to a member of the militant group Hamas' military wing. And several men were forming a human shield on the roof. Before most strikes, the Israeli military makes warning calls, known as a ""knock on the roof,""  to minimize civilian casualties. But, as cramped as Khan Yunis is, collateral damage is sometimes inevitable. Seven people died in the Tuesday attack, including two boys, ages 10 and 11. ""In that house lived an old man and his wife and his five sons and their wives and their children and they hid,"" said Ahmed, who doesn't live too far from Rasha. ""Any Palestinian is a target."" When she hears about the deaths -- and she hears about them more and more each day -- Rasha is overcome with emotion. ""For the Palestinians, the people of Gaza Strip, all the people,"" she says. It's making everyone around have to get used to dying. Monitoring news . Both she and Raemer obsessively monitor the news. ""I have three TVs in my house,"" Raemer says. ""Sometimes all three are on."" The news these days is depressing, discouraging, dread-inducing. More than 130 rockets fired at Israeli civilians. More than 200 airstrikes in Gaza. More than two dozen Palestinians dead. About 1,000 Israeli reservists called up for military service. And yet, they can't tune it out. Rasha's daughter wanted to get out of the house Tuesday and go to the university. But there were too many explosions outside. So she stayed in, with the TV on. They only have about six hours of spotty electricity a day, so they often fall back on their battery-powered radio to keep up. Jittery nerves . At Nirim, every boom or hiss makes Raemer jump. She thinks she and her neighbors have signs of post-traumatic stress. She fights it with humor, posting instructions online about how to cook in the middle of a rocket attack. ""Cut, cut. Run! Cook, cook. Run!"" she jokes. ""It takes a lot longer to cook your meal that way."" Since Tuesday, most of the rumbling around her has come from outgoing fire -- Israeli fire into Gaza. Those booms and roars come without warning and shake her. It's worse for the children. Tal Tzukan and her husband, Dagan, live in Ohad, a community next door to Nirim. They have two daughters, ages 5 and 2. Every time a door shuts hard or a loud car goes by, they flinch. She tries to keep them busy and takes them to a fortified kindergarten, for summer classes in arts and crafts. When sirens scream while they are on the road, she plucks the children from their Renault sedan, and ducks and covers with them on the ground. Her 5-year-old has caught on to what the sirens mean --  the hissing and crashing sound of rockets, the booms from across the border in Gaza, shaking their windows. So common are the sounds that their parrot has learned to imitate them. From her home, Tzukran can see the bombs bursting over Gaza and fears for parents there. ""It's hard not to think about the same situation with little kids over there,"" she says. Before Tzukran hangs up the phone she says that she still needs to get the most important thing off her chest: Peace. ""This is what we want and need for both sides' sake."" Staying put . It didn't used to be this way. Raemer has lived in Nirim since 1975. She remembers a different time. She used to drive to Gaza in her car. A man from Gaza built her house. ""They are not my enemies,"" she says. ""I have no doubt they want safety for their children."" Raemer is rooted in the kibbutz. Her grown son and daughter also live there and have safe houses in their homes. But after the first rockets fell, they left for central Israel. Raemer could have gone, too, but decided to stay back with her dogs. She interrupts the phone interview. ""There was just a boom. Did you hear it?"" Waiting for the war . Rasha can't leave even if she wants to. The border crossings out of Gaza are closed. ""In all the world, there is nowhere like Gaza,"" she says, ""a big jail for 2 million people."" So, she reads the Koran and waits for the war, which she is certain will come. Another day . When night falls, Raemer hastily brushes her teeth, then hurries to bed in the safe room. The fighting heats up at night, and she feels safer in the fortress than in her bed. In Gaza, sleep doesn't come easy, Rasha says. Children curl up to sleep in their mothers' laps, too scared to fall unconscious lest the bombs drop. When the sun comes up, Raemer will spend her day running for her life. Rasha will spend it, she says, waiting for death. Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point?

"It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. An aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot Haris Suleman and his father, Babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books. The journey, months in the planning, would take the pair on a 26,500-mile odyssey, with 25 stops planned in 15 countries. The aim was to raise funds for a charity in Pakistan that helps poverty-stricken children go to school. Instead, the American teenager is now confirmed dead and his father is missing after their plane crashed into the ocean off American Samoa on Tuesday night. Haris had been due home in Indiana on Saturday, his sister Hiba Suleman told reporters Wednesday. His body has been recovered, she said. But their father, also a pilot, has not been found. ""We're hoping my dad is alive and well, and we're going to keep praying until we have a definitive answer,"" Hiba Suleman said. She told reporters the plane was about 23 miles from the island when it crashed. Her father wouldn't have let Haris take off if the weather was bad, she said. It is unclear why the plane crashed or why the duo took off at night. ""He was doing something that he loved. He was doing something adventurous,"" she said of her brother, who received his pilot's license in June. And he was doing it for a good cause, she added. Read more from CNN affiliate WTHR . 'On my bucket list forever' In an interview with CNN affiliate WISH TV last month, only days before the pair set off, Haris appeared excited as he outlined their itinerary -- which if completed in 30 days in their single-engine plane would have made him the youngest pilot to achieve the feat. He also told how he and his father had received survival training in case of having to ditch their plane in the water. Babar Suleman, asked about the inherent risk involved in such a venture, said he put his faith in sound preparations. ""In all these endeavors, the biggest part of the whole thing is the planning,"" he said. ""While he was training and getting his license, I was busy planning all the different segments, all the different fuel stops, different cruise profiles. I set up all of the plans and he will do all the execution."" The record-breaking attempt, he said, ""has been on my bucket list forever."" Babar Suleman also spoke of the importance of the work done by the Seeds of Learning charity, an Indiana group which supports the work of the Citizens Foundation in Pakistan. The money raised, he said, would help open schools ""for underprivileged children who otherwise would not have a hope of getting an education and may even end up in the wrong hands."" He expanded on his charitable motivation for the trip in his blog, Around the World in 30 Days, explaining how in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States he had come to the conclusion ""that lack of proper education contributed to the events of that day."" The work of the Citizens Foundation to provide education to thousands of impoverished Pakistani children is, he said, ""the noblest of all causes."" The last entry on the blog is posted from Bali, Indonesia. 'Huge heart' The principal of the high school where Haris was a rising senior said the school was deeply saddened by his death. ""Haris' adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by The Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan,"" said Melvin Siefert, principal of Plainfield High School. A soccer coach at the school told the Indianapolis Star that Haris was a great student and a talented player. ""Haris loved to joke a lot,"" David Knueve told the newspaper. ""He just got the team sort of laughing at the right moments."" His sister said Haris planned to be an engineer like his father. The oldest sibling, a brother, was trying to get from London to American Samoa to pick up Haris' body but there were only a few flights, Hiba Suleman said. Emergency beacons . A Coast Guard spokeswoman, Petty Officer Melissa McKenzie, said a plane would aid in the search for Babar Suleman. He and Haris were wearing ""gumby"" suits that could help them survive a water landing, Hiba Suleman said. She said they had taken a course in how to survive a crash in the ocean. They also had life rafts aboard. The next legs of the trip were supposed to cross the Pacific Ocean, with stops in Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) and Hawaii. The plane has yet to be recovered, but emergency beacons were sending out signals. The National Transportation Safety Board said the plane was a Beechcraft Bonanza A36.

"Women's rights groups responded angrily Tuesday to comments by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that women and men are not equal ""because their nature is different."" Eight groups signed a statement condemning his remarks as violating the national constitution and international agreements, saying he aimed to ""denigrate decades of effort by women's movements for gender equality."" Activists planned to hold a march later Tuesday to mark the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Erdogan kicked off the firestorm Monday at a summit hosted by an Istanbul-based women's group, when he said women's ""equality before justice"" was what was key, rather than actual equality. ""Equality is turning the victim into an oppressor by force or vice versa. What women need is to be able to be equivalent, rather than equal, so it is justice. That is what we need,"" he said. ""You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different."" Erdogan also told the event, organized by the Women and Democracy Association, that a woman cannot do every job that a man can do because ""it is against her delicate nature."" Hailing the achievement of motherhood, he cited the needs of pregnant women or nursing mothers as examples of why women could not be equal to men in the workplace. According to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency, Erdogan also insisted his government has always been behind women in their struggle for equal rights and said it would continue to support them. However, in their joint statement, the women's groups said Erdogan was spouting rhetoric he first voiced in 2010 and that he had shown no intention of changing track. They also argued that the rejection of universal equality is an important factor in increased violence against women. ""We ... believe that equality is not a bargaining chip but a democratic and universal right and that we will not give up on striving for equality,"" the statement said. ""We reject the rhetoric which we believe is an effort to take back rights which were attained by women nearly 100 years ago."" Turkey fared badly in the latest World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, coming 120th out of 142 countries in 2013. This made Turkey the lowest-ranking country in the whole of the Europe and Central region, although it had made progress in its overall score and rank since the previous year, the report's authors said.","Women's rights groups are angry over remarks by Turkish President .

"When it comes to mathematics, reading and science, young people in Shanghai are the best in the world, according to a global education survey released Tuesday. In all three subjects, Shanghai students demonstrated knowledge and skills equivalent to at least one additional year of schooling than their peers in countries like the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. The findings are part of the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (or PISA) -- a leading survey of education systems conducted every three years by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of the world's richest economies. More than half a million students, aged 15 and 16, sat a two-hour exam last year as part of the study. The pupils came from 65 countries representing 80% of the global economy. East Asian economies performed best overall, claiming seven of the top 10 places across all three subjects. In math, Shanghai had the highest score with 613 points -- the equivalent of nearly three years of schooling above the average for the 34 OECD member countries of 494, and six years above Peru which ranked last with a score of 368. The city also came top in 2009 rankings. Singapore came second in mathematics with a score of 573, followed by Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Macau. But the math performance of most countries has not improved since the PISA tests were launched more than a decade ago. Around 60% of the 64 countries who participated in previous studies performed at the same level or worse in 2012, and nearly a third of all students scored in the lowest band for the subject. TRY THE PISA TEST YOURSELF . U.S. lags . The United States ranked 36th, performing below the OECD average in mathematics with 481 points, and a score indistinguishable from the average for reading and science. The United Kingdom did slightly better, ranking 26th, equaling the average score for OECD countries in math and reading. The UK performed above average in science with a score of 514. Part of the reason pupils do so well in Shanghai, according to the OECD's deputy director of education, Andreas Schleicher, is that they have the drive and confidence to fulfill their potential. ""In China and Shanghai, you have nine out of 10 students telling you, 'It depends on me. If I invest the effort, my teachers are going to help me to be successful',"" Schleicher told CNN's On China program, which will air later this month. Similarly, in Japan -- which ranked 7th overall -- more than 80% of students disagreed or strongly disagreed that they put off difficult problems, and 68% disagreed or strongly disagreed that they give up easily when confronted with a problem. Hard work . ""Practice and hard work go a long way towards developing each student's potential, but students can only achieve at the highest levels when they believe that they are in control of their success and that they are capable of achieving at high levels,"" the PISA report said. PISA tests students near the end of their compulsory education in areas that are ""essential for full participation in modern society,"" as well as their ability to apply what they have learned in new situations. ""This approach reflects the fact that modern economies reward individuals not for what they know, but for what they can do with what they know,"" the report said. In reading, East Asian economies also topped the league table. Shanghai ranked first, with a score of 570 --  the equivalent of one and a half years more schooling than the OECD average. Hong Kong ranked second, followed by Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Half the countries that took part in previous  assessments saw an improvement in reading comprehension since 2003. Shanghai also topped the list in science, with a score of 580 compared to the average of 501 -- the equivalent of nearly two more years of schooling. In fifth place, Finland was the top performing country outside Asia, behind Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. Data on other Chinese provinces and cities is not yet published by PISA  because not enough regions take part in the tests to be considered representative, a spokesman said.  However,  China as a whole is expected to  be included in the 2015 assessment. Shanghai has been at the forefront of education reforms in the country in recent years. Rote learning? Shanghai's outstanding performance defies preconceptions about China's education system being based on rote learning, according to Schleicher. ""The biggest surprise from Shanghai ... was not that students did well on reproducing subject matter content but that they were very, very good in those higher order skills (that reflect) what you can do with what you know,"" he said. Around one in four Shanghai students performed in the top two reading bands compared to the average with just under one in 10. Jiang Xueqin, deputy principal at the Tsinghua University High School in Beijing, told CNN that Shanghai's education system invests in teaching staff  by offering training and high salaries. ""The teachers are very well-paid, very professional,"" Jiang said. ""The Shanghai government will spend a lot of resources in making sure that each teacher is well trained, has opportunities to go abroad, (and) has opportunities to learn from the best teachers."" Other countries whose performance improved in PISA this year, such as Brazil, Colombia and Poland, have implemented policies to raise the quality of teaching staff by increasing requirements for education licenses, providing incentives for high-achieving students to enter the profession and ongoing on-the-job training, according to the report. Jiang also told CNN that Shanghai's success is a product of a culture that prioritizes academic achievements over other pursuits. ""A lot of it is that the students are engaged in learning. The parents, the students, the community are engaged in making sure their child succeeds,"" he said.","Shanghai ranks first in math, reading and science among 15- and 16-year-olds .
East Asian economies performed better than other regions in all three subjects .
The United States ranks below average for the 65 countries assessed .
Math scores have stalled or deteriorated in most countries ."
"Eleven people were killed Saturday when two vans carrying a polio vaccination team were hit by a roadside bomb in Pakistan's northern Khyber Agency, authorities said. Among the dead was an 8-year-old child; 12 other people were wounded, Khbyer Agency surgeon Dr. Rehman Khan said. Ten of the fatalities were tribal policemen called Khasadars, he said. Though the security forces and militants engaged the attackers in a gun battle, the militants escaped, he said. The child was caught in cross-fire, said Dr. Sameen Jan Shinwari, medical superintendent of Agency Headquarters Hospital in Jamrud. The Khyber Agency is a loosely governed tribal region that borders on Afghanistan. Pakistan's military had resumed operations against suspected Taliban strongholds in Khyber and other nearby agencies, after peace talks with the militant group broke down last month in the wake of attacks by the group. Earlier this week, government airstrikes demolished suspected Pakistani Taliban hideouts in Waziristan and may have killed dozens, the military said. But, after Saturday's attack in Khyber Agency, the Pakistani Taliban announced a month-long cease-fire, the group's spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid, told CNN. A government spokesman said the committee charged with holding talks with the TTP welcomed the announcement as a ""positive development,"" but had received no official cease-fire offer. The government's committee is expected to meet early next week to discuss the development. A militant group, which has connections to the Pakistani Taliban, opposes polio vaccinations, accusing polio workers of pursuing a political agenda. Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants in Pakistan since U.S. intelligence officials used a fake vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad. Since July 2012, at least 22 polio workers have been killed. The polio campaign has a history of controversy in Pakistan. Some mullahs have preached against it, claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves Pakistani children sterile. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continued its campaign of drone strikes. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, remains endemic only in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan.","Among the dead: an 8-year-old child .

"Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe was sworn in for another  term Thursday following disputed elections. After a judge made it official, crowds erupted into cheers and released balloons adorned with colors of the national flag. The ceremony was delayed for days by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai's petition challenging the July 31 election. He withdrew the court case last week, paving the way for the event. Mugabe: Accept my re-election or 'commit suicide' The nation's electoral commission declared Mugabe the winner with 61% against the former prime minister's 34%. Last week, Mugabe told his critics to ""commit suicide"" if they cannot accept his re-election. Mugabe, 89, is Africa's oldest leader and has led  the southern African nation since it got its independence from Britain.  He led the newly-independent Zimbabwe, first as prime minister in 1980, then as president seven years later. Opinion: Why nobody is dancing after Mugabe's win . Five years ago, his party lost to Tsvangirai, who did not get enough votes to avoid a runoff. Opposition party supporters were beaten, tortured and killed, rights groups said, and Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff in protest. The postelection violence left about 200 people dead and thousands injured. Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured the two to form a power-sharing agreement. Mugabe's main opponent became his prime minister, and the squabbles have continued. The fragile power-sharing government ended with this year's election.","Crowds release balloons adorned with colors of the national flag .

"It was the day after Thanksgiving 2012, and Michael Dunn had just left his son's wedding. He'd had two drinks but wasn't buzzed, and he and his girlfriend were in a ""great mood"" -- headed to a nice bed and breakfast in St. Augustine, Florida, where they planned to enjoy a bottle of wine, he told police. A stop at a Jacksonville gas station would flip the happy day on its head. His car doors and windows shut, he was annoyed by the ""heavy bass"" coming from a nearby SUV and asked four teens to turn it down. He heard what might have been a threat, Dunn told police, then saw what might have been a gun. He pulled a 9mm handgun from his glove compartment and fired four times. Then four more times. He picked up his girlfriend as she came out of the convenience store and fled the scene, not realizing one of his eight bullets had killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis, Dunn told police interrogators. The couple continued on to St. Augustine, where they checked into their room and ordered pizza but didn't call police, Dunn said. Opening statements are expected to begin Thursday in Dunn's trial. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in Davis' death and to three counts of attempted first-degree murder for shooting at three teens accompanying Davis. Dunn has told police fear for his safety drove his actions that day. Though jury selection has lasted three days -- after which the judge is expected to order that the jurors be sequestered -- the trial should proceed quickly and shouldn't last past February 14, two days before what would have been Davis' 19th birthday, said John Phillips, an attorney for the family. Dunn's attorney, Cory Strolla, said that as of Tuesday evening he had filed no motion to dismiss the charges based on Florida's stand your ground law, which received national attention during the George Zimmerman trial. ""We are relying on Justifiable Use of Deadly Force as an affirmative defense,"" Strolla said in an e-mail to CNN. Dunn explains shooting . In a police interrogation video filmed the day after the shooting, Dunn tells a police interviewer that the November 23, 2012, incident began when he asked four teens to turn down the music emanating from their Dodge Durango. ""I was polite. I asked them nicely. ... I said, 'Hey, would you guys mind turning that down?' They shut it off, and I was like, 'Thank you,' "" Dunn tells police. One of the passengers became ""agitated,"" Dunn further explains, and someone turned the music back up. Dunn says he wasn't sure if the teens were singing, but he heard someone say, ""Kill him,"" so he rolled down his window and asked if they were talking about him. ""It was like, um, 'Kill that bitch,' "" Dunn says, claiming that he saw one of the Durango's occupants produce what looked like a shotgun and open the vehicle's door. Asked later if he was certain he saw a gun, he replies, ""I saw a barrel come up on the window, like a single-shot shotgun ... It was either a barrel or a stick."" ""I'm sh***ing bricks, but that's when I reached in my glove box, unholstered my pistol ... and so quicker than a flash I had a round chambered in it, and I shot,"" he says, adding that he has owned the 9mm handgun since 1990 and ""always"" keeps it fully loaded in his glove compartment. He initially fired his weapon four times, Dunn tells police, and the Durango began to pull away. ""I was still scared and so I shot four more times ... trying to keep their heads down to not catch any return fire. And that was it,"" he says. His girlfriend exited the convenience store to see what was happening, and Dunn told her, "" 'Get in the car. We have to go.' I didn't feel safe there,"" he recalls during the interrogation. Pizza not police . The couple had plans at a ""fairly expensive"" bed and breakfast in St. Augustine, 40 miles south of Jacksonville, so they drove there and ordered pizza. Dunn didn't call police, he says, because he wanted to go back to his South Patrick Shores home, another 130 miles south of St. Augustine. Dunn ""was waiting till we get around people we know"" to call authorities, and he wanted to ensure ""our dog and everybody were where they needed to be. I did not want to bring a s**tstorm down on them in Jacksonville,"" he tells interrogators. In hindsight, he says, he shouldn't have left the scene, but he was too afraid to stay. ""I went over this a million times, and what I should've done is put the car in reverse"" to escape the confrontation, he says, but ""it was fight or flight. I don't think there was any time for flight at that moment. I was going to get shot."" One of the police interrogators tells Dunn, ""I will be the first to tell you that there are no weapons in that car. I don't know what you saw."" ""Is it possible when they drove off they dumped it?"" Dunn asks. ""They never left the parking lot,"" the officer replies. ""They drove off, circled right back around and came right back to that spot."" Toward the end of the interview, one interrogator tells Dunn, ""There are clear-cut cases where you go, 'Yup, sure did, buddy. You defended yourself. Have a nice day.' "" Adds the other interrogator, ""Let me be the first to tell you, this ain't one of them."" Zimmerman redux? While some observers are drawing parallels between Dunn's trial and the case involving Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman -- not the least of which being that State Attorney Angela Corey is the prosecutor in both -- Zimmerman's former attorney says he doesn't see many similarities outside of the racial factor. Davis was black and Dunn is white. ""George was quite injured, and there were witnesses to suggest that there was an ongoing, physical confrontation and fight. Compare that to the Dunn case, where you have a verbal altercation,"" said attorney Mark O'Mara, a CNN contributor. As for Dunn's claim of self-defense, O'Mara said he feels Dunn will face the burden of answering a key doubt among jurors: ""You were in a car. Put it in drive, get out of there and then call the cops rather than take out a weapon and put eight shots into a car, killing one person."" Jordan's mother, Lucia McBath, said the time since her son's death has been ""the most difficult, challenging year of my life, the most painful year of my life"" -- something she'd wish on no parent -- but she's found some solace using her platform to speak out against gun violence in the nation. ""The gun culture, at this point, I believe is really fueling a lot of fear. Citizens are in fear of one another, fear of people that they don't know, people that don't think like them, look like them, act like them,"" she said in a CNN interview last month. She said she thinks about the Zimmerman case ""all the time"" and she's concerned that Dunn is following Zimmerman's lead in claiming self-defense as an immunity and could ""possibly walk away free."" Dunn's former attorney, Robin Lemonidis, previously told CNN, ""When all the evidence has been flushed out, I believe that it will be extremely clear that Mr. Dunn acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances,"" Lemonidis said. Shooting is no Trayvon Martin case, attorney says .","Michael Dunn says he and girlfriend fled scene of shooting, went to B&B and ordered pizza .

"Authorities warned Tuesday that the man believed to be behind the ambush of two Pennsylvania State Police troopers is ""armed and dangerous"" and may not be finished with targeting law enforcement officials. Eric Matthew Frein is wanted for murder in the first degree in the killing of one trooper and the wounding of another over the weekend, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan told reporters during a news conference. ""He has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,"" Noonan said. ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" An affidavit of probable cause paints a chaotic, bloody scene during the shooting Friday night at the state police barracks in Blooming Grove in northeast Pennsylvania. 'Get him inside' The attack began at about 11:50 p.m. when Cpl. Bryon K. Dickson, who had just finished his shift, left the barracks through the building's front doors. He was shot as he walked toward his vehicle, according to the affidavit. Another police officer walked by the front door and saw Dickson lying on the ground. The officer, a woman, asked him what happened, and Dickson told her had been shot and needed help, the affidavit said. As he was telling the officer what happened, another shot was fired, it said. Dickson, according to the documents, asked the officer to ""get him inside."" Then as another officer, Trooper Alex Douglass, tried to help, he was shot, the documents said. The officers in the building resorted to using a patrol car to drive between the shooter and the building in an effort to rescue Dickson and get him to a hospital, according to the affidavit. Dickson was declared dead at an area hospital. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. Shell casings found . Frein, 31, is a survivalist by hobby who lives in Monroe County, authorities said. Noonan said anyone who might know something about Frein or spot him should first contact authorities. A person walking their dog saw Frein's car submerged in a body of water about two miles from Blooming Grove, the police barracks where the shootings happened Friday. The person dialed 911, and investigators found shell casings inside the vehicle that matched casings found at the scene of the shooting, authorities said. Investigators also discovered Frein's Social Security card along with camouflage face paint, a flashlight, a hooded sweatshirt and military gear inside the car. Police searched Frein's parents' home and found spent shell casings matching the kind used in the shooting, authorities said. Pennsylvania authorities are working with the FBI and others throughout the country to sift through tips that have come in the case, officials said. Friends and relatives who were interviewed by investigators said that Frein had talked about his disdain for law enforcement, according to authorities. ""This was nothing he kept quiet,"" said Noonan, who said he wished those people had spoken up before the shooting of the troopers. With the hunt for the suspected gunman still under way, one school district in the vicinity of the shooting announced it was canceling classes on Wednesday. The administration of the Pocono Mountain School District said the decision was made ""due to safety concerns of our students at bus stops with an armed and dangerous gunman on the loose."" Reward offered . Earlier this week, authorities said they were offering a $75,000 reward for information leading to the suspect or suspects. As of Monday, the trooper who was wounded but survived the shooting had not been interviewed. Douglass was conscious and speaking for the first time Monday since undergoing surgery after the shooting, police said. ""First and foremost is our concern for his health and recovery. So we're letting the doctors do what they need to do, and at an appropriate time that will occur. We expect that to happen in the very near future,"" Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Monday. Cpl. Bryon K.

"It's rare that a defendant is put on trial knowing that whether he wins or loses, chances are he'll still spend his life in prison. That's exactly the scenario Michael Dunn faces, as his second trial in the November 2012 killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis approaches. Jury selection began Monday morning. The retrial will follow and is expected to last about two weeks. Before jury selection began, Davis' parents, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, were outside the Duval County Courthouse, along with Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen killed by a neighborhood watch captain earlier the same year. ""This trial speaks to me because I am that family,"" Fulton said. ""The family that's missing a son. I'm the family that's a victim of senseless gun violence. That's the purpose of me coming here, that's just to stand with the family, to be with the family and to show the support."" About 40 people gathered demanding justice for Jordan Davis as well as other slain African-Americans, including Emmett Till, Rodney Mitchell and Karvas Gamble Jr. Protesters carried signs that said ""Justice 4 Jordan"" and ""Is it OK to murder me because I like loud music?"" A pastor led the group in prayer before Davis' parents entered the courthouse. The gathering promptly dispersed, but not before McBath thanked the crowd for supporting her son. ""We just want to thank the country and thank you all for the wonderful support and prayers that you've given us these last two years. We could not do this without you. We're very grateful for every moment that we've been on your minds and your hearts,"" McBath said. She added, ""Whatever verdict we receive, we will be humble and abide by. But the verdict and the justice that we seek will always and will only come from God."" Defense attorney Waffa Hanania expressed concern to County Court Judge Russell Healey that the rally, which ""appears to be sanctioned by Mr. Davis' family,"" could influence potential jurors. Healey responded that there is ""only so much I can control,"" but conceded that ""it's not helpful to us getting a jury here in Jacksonville."" He said that the court would determine what potential jurors heard and saw when they're questioned. The first trial . Earlier this year, on what would've been Davis' 19th birthday, a Jacksonville, Florida, jury found Dunn guilty on four of five counts in the case. While Dunn said he shot into a Dodge Durango full of teenagers in self-defense, he was convicted on three counts of second-degree attempted murder -- one each for firing at Davis' pals, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson -- and one count of shooting into a vehicle. The attempted murder convictions alone carry a cumulative minimum sentence of 60 years in prison for the 47-year-old Florida man. Opinion: Why prosecutor is retrying 'loud music' murder case . The 12 jurors, however, deadlocked on the final and most serious charge: premeditated first-degree murder. Dunn claimed that after a heated argument over loud music at a Jacksonville gas station, Davis threatened him and Dunn thought he saw Davis produce a gun or lead pipe. Though Davis had a knife in his pocket, police recovered no weapons matching Dunn's description, and his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn never mentioned seeing a weapon. Following the argument, Dunn pulled out a handgun and began firing. He continued firing even as Stornes, the driver, put the Durango in reverse and retreated, witnesses said. Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV. Three of those bullets hit Davis, one piercing his liver, lung and aorta. '... they didn't call 911' After the shooting, neither Dunn nor Rouer called police. They drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine, and once there, defense attorney Cory Strolla said, Dunn took his dog for a walk and Rouer ordered a pizza and movie. ""They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,"" Assistant State Attorney John Guy said during the first trial. ""That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep."" Asked why he never called police, Dunn said, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why."" In the morning, Rouer watched a news report about the shooting and the two then drove another 130 miles home to Satellite Beach where Dunn was apprehended. What happened in the hours after the shooting may play a role in the new murder trial, as prosecutors must prove that Dunn planned to kill Davis. In the first trial, prosecutors alleged that Dunn's actions after the shooting were indicative of his intent, an assertion Dunn's defense attorney denied. Davis' father, Ron Davis, was certainly struck by Dunn's actions after killing his son and expressed satisfaction in February that Dunn would face a lengthy prison bid. ""He is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son, that it was not just another day at the office. My son will never be just another day at the office where (Dunn) can leave the scene and be stoic,"" he told reporters. Awaiting sentencing . Dunn has not yet been sentenced on the original counts. In addition to the 60-year minimum he faces on the attempted murder charges, he could spend another 15 years in prison on the count of shooting into a vehicle. While his new defense attorney, Hanania, hasn't been speaking to media, Strolla has said his client would appeal the original verdict. That may explain why -- even though, pending appeals, Dunn could spend the rest of his life in prison -- prosecutors are preparing for another highly publicized trial on the murder charge. To hear prosecutor Angela Corey tell it, it's about justice. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" she said after the first trial in February. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said he can see how some people might think it defies logic to try the case again, but from Davis' parents' perspective, it makes all the sense in the world. ""If he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail, from a pragmatic standpoint it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case,"" Callan said after the first trial. ""On the other hand if you're the parents of Jordan Davis and you believe, as well you should, that your son's reputation has been besmirched by this self-defense claim, the family (might) want a retrial, and that's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully.""","Jury selection begins in Michael Dunn's retrial on murder charge .

Earlier this year, jury found Dunn guilty of three counts of attempted murder .
However, jury was hung on first-degree murder charge, so prosecutors will try again ."
"Israel is confronting a problem beyond the Hamas rockets screeching overhead -- a threat underfoot. The Israeli military says it is trying to demolish a sophisticated network of tunnels that run through parts of northeast Gaza, under the border and into southern Israel. Hamas has already used the tunnels several times in the past few days to attempt assaults on Israeli soil. The first attack, on July 17, was foiled but prompted Israel to announce a ground incursion into Gaza with the stated aim of taking out the tunnels. Another assault through tunnels s few days later resulted in clashes that killed more than 10 Hamas fighters and four Israeli soldiers. The assault near the town of Sderot appeared to target two communal areas ""where farmers are trying to conduct their daily lives,"" said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. The Hamas fighters were disguised as Israeli soldiers, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The clashes forced area roads to close, residents to shelter in their homes and tied up security forces for hours. The method of attack, in which militants spring out unexpectedly from underground, has struck fear into Israelis living near Gaza. ""Your enemy is about to blast his way into your dining room from below the floor while you are feeding your family. Sounds like a B-rated horror movie, right? This scenario is one real example of a Hamas tunnel discovered just in time by the IDF leading into a kibbutz communal dining hall,"" Benay Browne Katz, a volunteer medic and grandmother who lives in Jaffa, told CNN. 'Lower Gaza' The tunnel network has also been used during combat inside Gaza, the Israeli military says, allowing Hamas fighters to pop up and fire on soldiers or toss grenades before dropping back out of sight. Israeli military officials refer to the underground works as ""Lower Gaza"" and suggest at least some of the war is being waged underground. The tunnels aren't a new phenomenon. Hamas used one in 2006 to capture the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and take him back into Gaza. He was held captive for five years until a deal was struck for his release in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Memories of his capture were revived by a foiled attack over the weekend, in which one Hamas fighter who entered Israel through a tunnel was found to be carrying tranquilizers and handcuffs, according to the Israeli military. 'A whole industry' Israel received a warning of the growing scale and sophistication of the underground threat last year with the discovery of a tunnel that ran from the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza and emerged near the Israeli kibbutz of Ein Hashlosha. Uncovered in October, the tunnel was wired for electricity and communications. It was also high enough for a man to stand, walk or run through. It was long, about 1.7 kilometers (roughly one mile), and deep, at least 18 meters (59 feet). Its interior was fully lined with an estimated 500 tons of concrete. ""We're talking about a whole industry, and not a small group that's organizing it,"" Maj. Gen Shlomo Turgeman, commander of the IDF Southern Command, said at the time. Israel responded by halting supplies of concrete and construction materials into Gaza, tightening an already restrictive blockade. Large network . But the current conflict suggests that tunnel building has continued at a steady clip. The Israeli military says that during its incursion into Gaza, it has so far found scores of different access shafts leading to about 30 tunnels. Some of the entry points were underneath people's houses, officials said, and Israeli military uniforms were stashed inside some of the tunnels. The IDF said it has destroyed about half the known tunnels so far with controlled explosions or heavy earth-moving equipment. The substantial construction of the tunnels, some of which stretch for kilometers, has made them difficult to demolish, Israeli military officials said. ""We're taking action right now to neutralize those tunnels and we'll continue the action as long as necessary,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week. The Israeli military says it believes there are ""tens"" of tunnels still to be found -- and some of the fiercest fighting it has encountered has been around the tunnel entrances, suggesting a strong desire by Hamas to hold onto them and protect them. Smuggling tunnels . Hamas started off using tunnels to burrow under different Gaza border -- the one with Egypt. The aim of those tunnels wasn't to mount attacks, but to ferry goods. The underground routes into Egypt were a way to circumvent the Israeli blockade on Gaza. The Gaza-Egypt tunnels ""are used to bring in food, to bring in gas, livestock, anything else that the Gazans need. And also, according to Israel, are used to resupply Hamas. That is how they get their weapons into Gaza within this blockade,"" said CNN's Paula Hancocks, who visited some of the tunnels in 2009. Despite efforts by both Israel and Egypt to crack down on the smuggling tunnels, they've proved hard to stamp out. ""They've been bombing these tunnels between Gaza and Egypt for years and still they keep popping up,"" Hancocks said. ""They're very, very basic, very dirty, but they are very quick to create."" Israel's current effort to destroy the tunnels into its own territory is taking a heavy toll -- on Gazan civilians and Israeli soldiers. The question is whether the incursion will remove the threat for good.","Hamas has used tunnels to stage attacks in Israel and Gaza, the Israeli military says .

"Malabo, Equatorial Guinea (CNN)In front of me was utter chaos -- angry, screaming fans. But there were scared, scurrying fans, too. Above a helicopter hovered over the Estadio de Malabo, the venue of Thursday's Africa Cup of Nations semifinal between Equatorial Guinea and Ghana. For about 12 hours before the game kicked off, that dark blue and yellow chopper had been pacing the skies around the stadium, as if it had a premonition as to what would happen that night. ""I've never played in front of anything like that and I'd like to say sorry on behalf of my team. It was an odd experience -- one I've never felt before,"" said Equatorial Guinea star Emilio Nsue after his team lost 3-0. The host nation's fans started the match with hopes of Equatorial Guinea making its first ever AFCON final, before they started grumbling when decisions didn't go their way. Meltdown then ensued. Ahead of kick off the mood had been one of optimism. Earlier the country's state owned Television GE had taken calls on its build up show and every one of the 35 callers had predicted a 2-0 win or more for Equatorial Guinea.. That might partly explain why the home fans became so angry. The weird . Ghana's third goal -- scored by captain Andre Ayew -- was the cue for the missile throwing and pelting to intensify. But amid the madness, there was also humanity. ""We shall protect you,"" said Bruno Ekedo, a middle-aged man clad in the red jersey of the Nzalang Nacional, as the home team are affectionately called. ""If they try to come near you we will hit them with this,"" he said with a grunt as he lifted a metal barricade with POLICIA emblazoned on it, before adding that he was disgusted by the ""stupidity of some of the fans."" Equatorial Guinea was the first AFCON host nation to reach the semifinals since Ghana did it in 2008 and perhaps there was a sense that a final appearance on Sunday was preordained. ""But that does not give you the right to beat people who have come to play good football, does it?"" said an exasperated Ekedo, as he tried to call the attention of the police to two men in the crowd shaking their fists and making menacing gestures at the Ghanaian journalists in the press box. Then the smoke bombs and tear gas started flying, with the Ghana Football Association characterizing the scenes as a ""like a war zone."" Going outside . Ekedo wasn't the only local to make it their business to help out. ""There were four guys from the street who just saw my friends and I and decided to help us,"" said Selina Opare, sporting a cut to her left eye from a rock thrown at her group of girls wearing bright Ghana-themed dresses. ""They made us take off our dresses and they gave us their shirts. We wore their Equatorial Guinea jerseys and they walked on the road bare chested so we were able to get back to the Ghana Embassy safely."" While the Ghana FA president Kwesi Nyantakyi called the actions of fans ""barbaric"" and ""uncivilized,"" he also acknowledged the efforts of the ""very few good men who opted to help us."" VIDEO: . See the chopper flying literally above the stands. This one na movie oh! #afcon2015 pic.twitter.com/0NW3XFBNHV . Disappointment and then...hope . Returning to my hotel I found it filled with people from the stadium who couldn't go home because of the chaotic nature of the streets. As I was going back to my room, a familiar face walked in. ""Mi amigo!"" It was Ekedo, who was volunteering to help with the transportation needs of any stranded Ghanaian fans. Equatorial Guinea can expect some unfavorable headlines in the coming days and weeks, but the unheralded helpers show that African football -- and Africa -- is not all that bad.","Thursday's Africa Cup of Nations was overshadowed by violence in the stadium .

"Tour companies evacuated hundreds of vacationers from Kenya after various nations issued travel alerts that warned of a ""high threat"" of terrorist attacks. All-inclusive tour company First Choice and Thomson Airways said they were canceling trips to the coastal area of Mombasa until the end of October. They transported about 200 vacationers to London on Friday morning. By the end of evacuations Friday night, both said they expect all their 400 vacationers to be out. ""As a precautionary measure, we have also taken the decision to repatriate all customers currently on holiday in Kenya, including our air fare passengers back to the UK on Thursday and Friday,"" Thomson said in a statement. A day before the evacuations, the UK Foreign Office advised against nonessential travel to various areas, including  the Mombasa coastal region. It urged tourists with nonessential travel to leave. ""There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping ... from extremists linked to Al-Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in response to Kenya's military intervention in Somalia,"" the UK alert said. The United States also updated its travel warning this week, citing the potential for terrorist attacks in Nairobi and the coastal cities of Mombasa and Diani. Australia also urged its nationals to reconsider travel to those areas. Kenyan authorities described the warnings as ""unfriendly acts"" and said security remains a top priority. ""Issuance of such travel advisories only plays to ... spread fear and panic,"" the Kenyan Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Kenyan military crossed into Somalia in 2011 to battle the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, which it blamed for kidnapping tourists in the coastal region. In retaliation, the terrorist group has launched a spate of attacks, including targeting bustling bus stations with grenades. Last year, militants stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and held shoppers under siege for days. At least 67 people were killed. There are about 5,000 British nationals living along the Kenyan coast, according to the Foreign Office. About 10% of those are in Mombasa and surrounding areas.","About 200 people evacuated so far .

"Boko Haram gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast Nigeria during the weekend. The abductions appear to be the latest in a string of recent kidnappings by Boko Haram that dims hope for the anticipated release of 219 schoolgirls ‎held by the group since April following a controversial ceasefire declared by Nigerian authorities. Holding on to hope for missing girls . Heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen invaded the town of Mafa in Borno state Friday and Saturday and seized 30 boys and girls, local leaders said. The news of the kidnappings was slow to emerge due to lack of telecom service in the region, where most telecom towers have been destroyed in Boko Haram's five-year insurgency against Nigeria's government. ""‎In the past two days Boko Haram insurgents stormed Mafa and abducted 30 boys aged 13 and above and girls aged 11 and above,"" Mafa local government chairman Shettima Maina said. Despite so-called ceasefire, Boko Haram kidnappings continue . ""They took them away to their base in the bush, and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers,"" Maina said. Mallam Ashiekh Mustapha, the local chief of Mafa who confirmed the abductions, said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid. The Nigerian government has said Boko Haram has denied involvement in the kidnappings, but the group has issued no public statement on the issue. Regardless, Boko Haram's near-daily raids have prompted an exodus of residents from Mafa and nearby villages to the Borno state capital of Maiduguri to escape the marauding insurgents, Mustapha said. On Thursday Boko Haram killed 17 people in the nearby village of Ndongo, which they looted and set ablaze, Maina said. ""Many people have fled with their families to Maiduguri for fear of being killed or losing their children to the insurgents,"" Mustapha said. Maina lamented that the military had done nothing to stop the raids despite repeated complaints by local leaders. Last week Boko Haram militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two Christian villages in neighboring Adamawa state, according to residents and community leaders.","Government says Boko Haram denies involvement, but group hasn't commented .

"This may turn into much more than just a political scandal. It may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time, but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the middle of a serious legal stew. And the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the Republican presidential hopeful, as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case Friday. State lawmakers questioned one of Christie's allies on Thursday, a former state official implicated in the scandal. So far, David Wildstein has repeatedly refused to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. What we've learned from document released . The legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation. But the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels, analysts say. As long as Christie was telling the truth at a marathon press conference he held on Thursday, he should be able to step out of the caldron, analysts who spoke with CNN say. For nearly two hours the high-profile governor, who gained national recognition for his response to superstorm Sandy, answered questions from journalists, divulging many details. ""He was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it,"" said CNN analyst Gloria Borger on The Lead with Jake Tapper. But if any of it doesn't jibe with other peoples' stories, information provided in documents or clues that pop up, experts say Christie could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits. One thing is certain.  The legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge is just getting into gear. What happened to begin with? It was September and Christie was full steam into his re-election bid -- which he won two months later.  Wildstein, who Christie appointed to a high position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. It held up motorists trying to make it into Manhattan and caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where the Democratic mayor Mark Sokolich had declined to endorse Christie for re-election. Democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against Sokolich. Hearings ensued, and Wildstein resigned under pressure.  Then came Wednesday's revelation that a top Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied back. He e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were Democratic voters. Christie fired Kelly after the scandal broke. Possible prank, sure, but something to sue over? This was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments, legal analyst Alan Dershowitz told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. It did real damage. ""It was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,"" Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. ""The bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood."" That makes it a legal matter, Dershowitz said. ""The law looks backwards and says: What causes these harms?"" he said. One group of residents from Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, has already filed a class-action civil lawsuit against Christie. They want to be compensated for alleged wages lost, when they arrived late at work. Was a crime committed? A woman died at the time of the mayhem, and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down. Sokolich thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident, saying it put ""folks in absolute danger."" His Democratic colleague, New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, agrees but takes it a step further. He called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman's death. ""Endangering people's lives -- that's not politics. That's why the U.S. attorneys have to get involved,"" he said. U.S. Attorney's Office spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael, said it's ""reviewing"" whether federal laws were violated. But Florence Genova's family doesn't seem to want to press charges. She was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest, and her daughter Vilma Oleri told CNN affiliate WABC that she didn't think the traffic was to blame. ""I really don't think so, no, I really don't. I think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got (to her house),"" she said. But Genova was not alone.  Paramedics red-flagged ""unnecessary delays for emergency services"" to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures. Legal analyst Dershowitz thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against Wildstein, Kelly and anyone else implicated, ""particularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam."" Christie says he didn't know anything about this. How could this get him? If Christie's close associates are prosecuted or convicted, it could lead them to turn on Christie, Dershowitz said. Thursday's press conference was the longest and most candid in Christie's career, New Jersey public radio reporter told Jake Tapper. ""This is absolutely extraordinary,"" he said.  Christie offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing. At the same time, he may have given investigators fodder to work with, but also a lot for Wildstein and Kelly to contradict, should they open up to lawmakers who questioning them. ""They may very well want to save themselves and say, 'Wait a minute; don't believe what the governor said,'"" Dershowitz told Baldwin. Wildstein may have pleaded the Fifth initially, but that's normal in the beginning, Jeffrey Toobin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""You don't want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available."" But things could change. If lawmakers decide to go after Christie, they could offer Wildstein -- or Kelly, if they question her -- immunity. They could decide to save themselves at his expense, Toobin said. Anyone Christie fired may also try to get revenge.","New Jersey state assembly releases 907 pages of documents Friday on lane closure scandal .

"A Spanish judge issued international arrest warrants Monday for China's former President Jiang Zemin and former Prime Minister Li Peng for alleged genocide against the people of Tibet, Spain's National Court in Madrid said. The warrants against them and three other senior Chinese officials are the latest chapter in a long-running lawsuit by pro-Tibetan groups and a dual Tibetan-Spanish citizen who seek international legal action against some Chinese officials. Judge Ismael Moreno issued the arrest warrants for alleged ""genocide, torture and crimes against humanity,"" and ordered them to be sent to Interpol, the international police agency, according to a copy of the order viewed by CNN. The former officials will surely not be arrested in China, but there's a ""medium chance"" of them being arrested if they go abroad, ""depending on the country and its ethics,"" said Alan Cantos, president of the Barcelona-based Tibet Support Committee. Cantos expressed satisfaction with the judge's order, which his group has been pushing with its co-plaintiffs: the House of Tibet Foundation and Thubten Wangchen Sherpa Sherpa, a Tibetan who has lived in Spain for about 20 years and has Spanish citizenship. ""It shows that justice after all works, against all odds. If you let justice work, victims can have retribution,"" Cantos said. The arrest warrants came on the eve of a debate in Spanish parliament, on Tuesday, that reportedly could restrict the use of the universal justice principle in Spanish courts. It holds that if human rights abuses aren't addressed in the country where they occurred, a separate country -- in this case, Spain -- has the right to seek legal action. Spanish courts have applied the principle in trying to seek justice for abuses committed under some former Latin American military regimes, but some foreign governments have complained about Spanish courts meddling in their affairs. Repeated phone calls to the Chinese Embassy in Madrid went unanswered. On Tuesday, Hua Chunying, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, said that Beijing was ""strongly dissatisfied"" and ""firmly opposed to the erroneous acts"" taken by Spanish agencies.","Former President Jiang Zemin, former Prime Minister Li Peng are accused of genocide .

"Somalia's Al-Shabaab rebel movement has tightened its ties to the al Qaeda terror network, with its leader pledging loyalty to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. The Islamist militants control much of southern Somalia and have long been affiliated with al Qaeda. But in an audio message posted on Al-Shabaab's website Thursday, the Somali group's leader, Mukhtar Abu al-Zubair, tells al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri that his followers ""will march with you as loyal soldiers."" Al-Zawahiri took command of al Qaeda after U.S. commandos killed the movement's founder, Osama bin Laden, last May. Al-Zubair addresses al-Zawahiri as ""my dear commander and kind sheikh"" and congratulates him ""for the defeat of the crusaders in Afghanistan and Iraq."" ""On behalf of the soldiers and the commanders in al-Shabaab, we pledge allegiance to you. So lead us to the path of jihad and martyrdom that was drawn by our imam, the martyr Osama."" And in a video message posted on the site, al-Zawahiri hails the move as news ""that will delight the believers and annoy the crusaders."" ""The Arab region is slipping from America's grip,"" he says. The combined messages run nearly 15 minutes. Al-Shabaab is already considered a terrorist movement by the United States. It has been battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government and African Union peacekeepers for the past several years, but has suffered a series of setbacks in recent months. AU and government forces drove Al-Shabaab fighters from the center of the Somali capital  Mogadishu last year, while Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in October to hit back for a rash of kidnappings it blamed on the group. In November, the leaders of Kenya, Somalia and Uganda reaffirmed their commitments to battle Al-Shabaab, and U.S. officials say the group has recruited Somali-Americans to take up arms in their ancestral home.","The news ""will delight the believers and annoy the crusaders,"" al-Zawahiri says .

"President Barack Obama will meet with Pope Francis for the first time on March 27 at the Vatican, the White House announced Tuesday. Obama's visit with the leader of the Roman Catholic Church will be part of a larger European trip that the President will take that month. ""The President looks forward to discussing with Pope Francis their shared commitment to fighting poverty and growing inequality,"" a White House news release said. Obama raised the Pope's stance on inequality in an economic address in December. ""Across the developed world, inequality has increased,"" Obama said. ""Some of you may have seen just last week, the Pope himself spoke about this at eloquent length. 'How can it be,' he wrote, 'that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?' "" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters last week -- after his own visit with the Vatican's secretary of state -- that Obama would soon meet with Francis. But Kerry did not specify when. New Yorker profile shows a weathered Obama five years in . Obama met Francis' predecessor, Benedict XVI, in 2009. That meeting, which took place at the Vatican, was Obama's only meeting with a Pope. Obama will start his trip on March 24 in the Netherlands, where he will attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague and meet with Dutch officials. He then will go to Brussels, Belgium, for a March 26 summit with the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, and also will visit with the NATO secretary general and Belgian officials, the White House said. Additionally, Obama will meet with Italy's Prime Minister and President in Rome. Obama's presidency has been marked by some high-profile clashes with the Catholic Church, including over abortion and contraception. But Francis' approach to world economic issues is widely seen as more in line with Obama's own approach than that of Benedict, who stepped down last year. In an MSNBC interview last year, Obama called Francis an ""extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice."" ""I haven't had a chance to meet him yet,"" Obama said.

"American warplanes pounded extremist Sunni fighters in northern Iraq on Saturday in what officials described as an effort to defend minority Yazidis ""being indiscriminately attacked,"" strikes that came just as President Barack Obama warned of an extended air campaign against the terror group. The series of airstrikes began with a mix of fighter jets and drones that targeted militants firing on Yazidis near the town of Sinjar, where fighters with the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, forced tens of thousands into hiding on nearby Sinjar Mountain. The airstrikes were the first in the Sinjar area since Obama authorized targeted attacks to protect Americans and Iraqi minorities from an ISIS advance threatening the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. News of the latest round of airstrikes came as Obama declined to provide a timetable for U.S. airstrikes and humanitarian aid drops in Iraq. ""I don't think we're going to solve this problem in weeks,"" the President told reporters in televised remarks, while at the same time reiterating a vow that no U.S. combat troops will join the fight. Given that Iraqi security forces still need time to ramp up and Iraqi politicians need space to form to form a more inclusive government to whittle Sunni support for ISIS, ""this is going to be a long-term project,"" Obama said from the White House South Lawn. The airstrikes on Saturday began at about 11:20 a.m. ET, with the targeting of two ISIS armored personnel carriers (APCs) firing on Yazidis, according to a statement released by the U.S. Central Command. Another two rounds of airstrikes were carried out about 20 minutes later after more ISIS vehicles, primarily APCs, moved into the area, the statement said. A fourth round of airstrikes was carried out more than three hours later when U.S. aircraft struck another ISIS armored vehicle, it said. At the same time, health and civil defense officials said U.S. warplanes targeted ISIS fighters near the town of Makhmur, where the group has been launching attacks on the outskirts of Irbil. The Pentagon declined to comment on the claims by Iraqi health and civil defense officials in Mosul, who told CNN the airstrikes killed at least 16 of the fighters. 'Running out of time' Meanwhile, the UK and France has said it will join the United States in humanitarian airdrops for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis on the run ahead of a brutal ISIS advance. On Saturday, the United States carried out another round of airdrops. Three cargo aircraft -- supported by U.S. fighter jets -- dropped 3,804 gallons of fresh drinking water and 16,128 ready-to-eat meals, the military said. But a United Nations official said airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops aren't enough for the estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis, who are trapped on Mount Sinjar and hiding from ISIS fighters who have said they will kill the group. Only about 100 to 150 people a day have been able to be airlifted by Iraqi security forces off the mountain, said Marizio Babille of UNICEF. ""We are running out of time for thousands who can obviously not be reached by these airdrops,"" he said, adding that UNICEF is appealing for the international support to open and secure ""a humanitarian corridor over land."" Dozens, including 60 children, according to UNICEF have died on the mountain where the Yazidis are battling extreme temperatures and a lack of food and water. American planes also have twice dropped food and other supplies to thousands of Yazidis, members of a minority group that fled to a northern Iraqi mountain after ISIS militants overran their town, Obama said Saturday. U.S. aircraft are poised to strike ISIS militants who have surrounded the mountain, Obama said. Any such strikes would support Kurdish forces' efforts to free the Yazidis, he said. The airstrikes have ramped up America's involvement in Iraq where ISIS is seizing control of towns and key infrastructure even as it celebrates its own slaughter along the way. The United States has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS rampage. The USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region. Obama indicated Saturday the United States' interests in targeting ISIS went well beyond protecting U.S. personnel and Iraqi minorities. ""My team has been vigilant ... about foreign fighters and jihadists gathering in Syria and now Iraq, who might potentially launch attacks outside of the region against Western targets and U.S. targets,"" he said. ""So there's going to be a counterterrorism element that we are already preparing for and have been working diligently on for a long time now."" Obama: Iraq's ethnic groups need to unite . Asked Saturday if Obama felt ISIS had been underestimated, the President said the advance of the Sunni Islamic extremists has been ""more rapid"" than intelligence officials and policymakers, both inside and outside Iraq, had predicted. But he said ISIS' advance was made possible in part by the lack of an inclusive and functioning Iraqi government. The government forces, ""when they (were) far away from Baghdad, did not have the incentive or the capacity to hold ground against an aggressive adversary,"" Obama said. To secure their country, Iraqis will need to build an inclusive government, Obama said, in an apparent dig at Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government. Iraq's Sunni minority have bitterly complained of being marginalized and cut out of the political process by al-Maliki's government. The height of that marginalization coincided with months of deadly sectarian fighting throughout the country, and preceded ISIS' rout of Iraqi security forces in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, earlier this year. Michael Rubin, a Middle East analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned Saturday that even if al-Maliki's government would have been more inclusive, ISIS still would have been a problem. ""No matter how magnanimous Maliki could have been in an ideal world, it would have meant nothing to ISIS, many of whose members aren't even Iraqi. Sometimes there's no magic diplomatic formula,"" Rubin, a Pentagon official under former President George W. Bush, told CNN. One unanswered question, according to James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2012, is what the United States would do if the Iraqi government and moderate elements can't muster the political and military capability to take on ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Map: Where is ISIS? Militants using U.S.-made weapons . Even as the airstrikes were under way, there was news that ISIS militants captured Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, just north of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. According to a senior Kurdish official, the militant fighters have been using U.S.-made weapons seized during fighting from the Iraqi army, including M1 Abrams tanks. There had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the Tigris River, with heavy fighting under way between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces, known as Peshmerga. U.S. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad. In other fighting, an Iraqi airstrike killed 45 ISIS fighters and injured 60 Friday in the northern town of Sinjar, the country's state-run National Media Center said. ISIS militants have executed people who don't share their fanatical interpretation of Sunni Islam.  The group posts videos of its savagery to the Internet. One shows a Christian man forced to his knees, surrounded by masked militants, identified in the video as members of ISIS. They force the man at gunpoint to ""convert"" to Islam. Then, the group beheads him. Another shows ISIS militants placing severed heads on spikes to strike terror in the population.","U.S. cargo planes carrying out another airdrop of water and food, the military says .

"North Korea held a huge rally Friday in the center of its capital, Pyongyang, to celebrate the launch of a long-range rocket this week that put a satellite in orbit and provoked international condemnation. A special broadcast on state-run television showed crowds of soldiers and civilians standing in neat ranks, clapping and cheering as officials made congratulatory speeches praising the regime's ruling dynasty. The rocket launch Wednesday took place sooner than many observers expected and was criticized by many countries since it was widely seen as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology that North Korea has been forbidden from using by the United Nations. But state media reported Friday that the satellite is weather-related and will ""gain information on temperatures of sea and land surfaces and atmosphere, humidity and wind and other meteorological data."" Putting the satellite in orbit was a technological breakthrough for the secretive North Korean regime, and a public relations victory for its young leader, Kim Jong Un. North Korea claims the launch was carried out for peaceful purposes. The successful launch was the result of Kim's ""unique will, courage and boldness,"" Jang Chol, head of the State Academy of Sciences, said at the rally Friday, his words echoing out over the assembled masses, many of whom were wearing thick coats as they stood in a snow-dusted square. Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, was also singled out as having made the launch possible through his military-first policy that channeled billions of dollars into the development of missiles and nuclear weapons. More crowds are expected to gather in Pyongyang on Monday, the first anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death. North Korea's achievement of putting an object in orbit, after years of failed attempts, stoked fresh concerns among world leaders about the reclusive state's missile and nuclear programs. Experts do not believe North Korea has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that Pyongyang has now proved it can send long distance. And the United States believes the North Koreans may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. But the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage. Kim Jong Un has ""stressed the need to continue to launch satellites in the future,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in a report Thursday, raising the prospect of more controversial moves in the future. State media also released images of Kim apparently watching the launch unfold. He was shown sitting with a cigarette in his left hand before a large screen that appeared to display the rocket's trajectory. Members of the U.N. Security Council condemned the rocket launch Wednesday, and the United States is pushing for tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. But China, North Korea's main ally and the holder of veto power at the United Nations, has so far taken a cautious stance, urging the Security Council to be ""prudent"" on the issue and ""avoid escalating the situation.""","North Korean state media say satellite is to monitor weather .

"At the dawn of the 20th century, Nikola Tesla wanted to save the world from fuel dependency. Now, an Internet cartoonist wants to save Tesla's last remaining laboratory as a tribute to the futurist inventor. The structure, a 94-by-94-foot building, was the location where Tesla hoped to develop wireless communications and clean, free energy for everyone in the early 1900s. He moved his operation to the Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, New York, in 1902 -- so named because of a 187-foot tower rising from the ground (as well as being sunk 120 feet below it) that was to be one of the great transmitters for his wireless energy dream. The facility was lost a few years later due to debts Tesla racked up, and the huge tower was demolished in 1917. The site would ultimately become a Superfund location because of silver and cadmium toxicity in the ground after a photographic film company used it for nearly 48 years. It has now been cleaned up and is no longer harmful. Tesla died penniless and in debt in 1943. Currently, the building and surrounding land sit idle and are up for sale. Matthew Inman, the creator of Web cartoon ""The Oatmeal,"" is joining forces with a nonprofit group, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, to help preserve the facility as a science center and museum honoring ""the father of the electric age."" 'Fringe' star examines real weird science . ""Tesla is an unsung hero, and there are very few monuments to him in the United States. I feel like that's something we need to fix,"" Inman said. ""I made a comic about Tesla on my site. It got the most 'likes' on Facebook that I've ever seen in my career. Combine (the fact) that I've got this army of Tesla fans and the experience and success with my other fund-raiser, I felt like I was the ideal person to step in to control."" Inman's previous experience with the IndieGoGo crowdfunding site stemmed from a potential lawsuit and his subsequent campaign to raise money for the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society. This current effort, bluntly titled ""Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum,"" exploded after it was launched, raising more than $750,000 within five days. It had topped $792,000 as of Tuesday morning. The goal was to raise enough money to buy the property and begin efforts to restore the facility. The asking price is $1.6 million, and Inman's goal of $850,000 would be matched by a New York state grant for the same amount, raising a total of $1.7 million. Inman said he was shocked by how much, and how quickly, people have donated to save Tesla's lab. ""What I expected to happen was we'd raise 20 or 30 grand and trickle over for the next six weeks. I didn't expect to average $27,000 per hour (in the first few days),"" he said. ""That was insane."" Inman used the power of social media and drew from his 700,000 fans on Facebook, 300,000 followers on Twitter and over 1 million followers on Google+ to get his campaign rolling. He's also asked the General Electric Company, co-founded by Tesla rival Thomas Edison, to contribute, and received a ""modest amount"" from Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors. The site quickly sold out of donation perks, items people could receive for their gift. So the campaign created new perks, using Tesla's love of the number 3 in the amount. ""Tesla, for the past year or two on the Internet, has risen as a cult hero to geek people,"" Inman said. ""I think a lot of people are donating, not to say how noble they are, but are willing to support him."" Wardenclyffe was the last official laboratory where Tesla worked. Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, said he moved into offices in New York City later, but Wardenclyffe was his final experimental location. That fact, along with his efforts to develop green energy, is why the site holds special significance. ""Tesla viewed the Earth as a generator of electricity. He believed that each of the planets resonates,"" Alcorn explained. ""If you could tap into that resonance, you would be able to tap into the energy that is in the Earth and you could bounce it off the ionosphere to any other place on the globe."" Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog . Designed by Stanford White, a pre-eminent architect at the time, the square brick building was originally split down the middle, creating two large rectangular rooms for experiments. The tall tower and the overturned bowl at the top loomed over the countryside, and started out as a transmitter of messages while Tesla turned his thoughts and creativity toward global energy. ""Tesla foresaw the wireless transmissions we do with our cell phones and our laptops,"" Alcorn said. ""He said there would come a day when people would send pictures, messages, words from one place to another without wires."" The inventor convinced banker and philanthropist J.P. Morgan of how beneficial such wireless communication would be to business and received financial backing for his project. But after Guglielmo Marconi sent his radio signal across the Atlantic in 1901, Morgan pulled his funding. Eventually, the property was lost in 1915 -- to pay off a debt to George Boldt of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel -- before Tesla could realize his dream of free electricity for everyone. The U.S. government destroyed the tower in 1917, fearing German spies were using it to send messages during World War I. The property changed hands a couple more times and is currently owned by Agfa-Gevaert, a technology company based in Belgium. The company put the property up for sale in 2009 and got an offer from a potential buyer who wanted to develop the land. That created a sense of urgency for Alcorn's group, which has been working for nearly 17 years to preserve it. ""When we heard that, and there was a letter of interest with a price involved, all of that made us a little bit wary and concerned because someone could come along and purchase this property before we had an opportunity to make an offer, "" she said. ""But we didn't have the money to make an offer."" She said her group made a plea on the Internet to the people involved, which attracted the attention of Inman. He reached out to Alcorn to offer his online influence and experience to the effort. Alcorn said the money raised by the IndieGoGo campaign would just purchase the property and facility, not finance the cleanup or restoration of the building into a museum. If the group is  successful in its bid, she expects it will be a couple of years before the museum opens, while additional funding and exhibits are arranged. Comments: Edison overrated?

"(CNN)Gov. Chris Christie will meet with Prime Minister David Cameron when the New Jersey Republican heads to the United Kingdom for a trade mission this week, a trip that will give Christie a chance to strengthen his foreign policy credentials as he prepares for a potential presidential run. Christie's three-day tour -- his third international trip since September -- starts Sunday with a Premier League game between Arsenal and Aston Villa. Later in the trip he meets with Cameron in London as well as with members of the Prime Minister's Cabinet and U.S. Ambassador Matthew Barzun. ""There is no other country that has such a strong connection to ours in terms of history, economy and culture,"" Christie said on a call with reporters before the trip. ""And, so, we want to continue to make the most of that relationship."" Christie traveled to Mexico in September and to Canada in December, placing a heavy emphasis on energy policy while visiting the United States' neighbors. With the United Kingdom as New Jersey's third-largest trade partner -- more than $7 billion annually -- the governor is leading a delegation of New Jersey business leaders to meet with representatives in the life sciences industry, including pharmaceutical and biotech companies. He also will visit Hope House, a drug addiction treatment facility that's backed by members of the royal family. Britain's Prince Harry teamed up with Christie in 2013 to tour recovery efforts after Superstorm Sandy severely damaged the Jersey Shore. Along with sharpening his foreign policy chops, the trip gives Christie a chance to prove that he's able to tone down his ""Jersey Guy"" persona. When he was in Mexico last September, reporters noticed the governor was acting more guarded and restrained than his normal self. In an interview with the The New York Times, he acknowledged that he can be ""flamboyant"" at times. ""But it doesn't mean that's the way I am all of the time,"" he added. ""You know, I have more than one club in the bag, and I've demonstrated that over time,"" he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who's also laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, will travel to the United Kingdom a week after Christie.","Gov.

"(CNN)A winter storm dumping snow and disrupting travel in the central United States is headed toward the Northeast. The storm put the metropolitan Chicago area's more than 9 million people under a blizzard warning Sunday, and another 65 million people are under a winter storm warning across 18 states. More than 2,000 U.S. flights were canceled Sunday, many of them in and out of Chicago, according to Flightaware.com, an online flight-tracking service. Already for Monday, more than 1,000 flights have been scratched. Chicago could get as much as 15 inches of snow from the storm system, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. ""The streets will stay plowed and passable so people will be safe and secure,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised at a news conference Sunday.  More than 350 pieces of equipment, including plows and salt spreaders, fanned out across the city, officials said. Still, Chicago Public Schools canceled classes for Monday, according to its Twitter page. Up to a foot of snow was forecast in parts of Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. The storm will move east and affect major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Boston on Monday, Guy said. ""New York City could see a wintry mix of precipitation just in time for the morning commute with a possibility of sleet and ice,"" and Boston will ""get another round of wintery weather with new snow accumulations from 10 to 12 inches,"" he said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a severe weather warning and hazardous travel advisory for Monday. ""The biggest threat in this case would be ice. We would expect a lot of icing on our roads and sidewalks -- up to a quarter inch of ice in some places, and a lot of that would happen in the early morning hours, so we'd want people to be very, very cautious tomorrow,"" he told reporters. Slippery driving conditions could start as early as Sunday night. ""For anyone leaving Super Bowl parties, you're going to have to be ready to be careful at that point,"" said de Blasio. ""I want to urge people to think ahead."" CNN's Kimberly Hutcherson, Joe Sutton, and meteorologist Derek Van Dam contributed to this report.","Chicago Public Schools cancel classes for Monday .

"(CNN)He ventured to Syria to tell the stories of lives torn apart by war. But in doing so, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto suffered his own gruesome fate -- apparently becoming the latest foreigner to be decapitated by ISIS. A newly distributed video from ISIS appears to show the beheaded body of Goto. It came one week after a video surfaced showing him holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow Japanese captive, Haruna Yukawa. Just like ISIS' previous beheading videos, the 67-second footage released Saturday was issued by the terror group's media wing, Al Furqan Media. The video cannot be authenticated by CNN. And now, Japan finds itself more deeply embroiled in the global fight against ISIS. ""We are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism, and we denounce it in the strongest terms,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, according to broadcaster NHK. ""To the terrorists, we will never, never forgive them for this act."" The members of the United Nations Security Council said in a statement that they strongly condemned Goto's ""heinous and cowardly murder,"" adding that those responsible should be held accountable. ""This crime is, yet again, a tragic reminder of the increasing dangers journalists and others face every day in Syria. It also once again demonstrates the brutality of (ISIS), which is responsible for thousands of abuses against the Syrian and Iraqi people,"" the Security Council said. U.S. President Barack Obama said the United States stands in solidarity with Japan ""in denouncing this barbaric act."" ""We applaud Japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the Middle East and globally, including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region,"" Obama said in a statement. Unlike the United States, Britain and other allies, Japan is not involved in the military campaign against ISIS. But Japan has been providing humanitarian aid in the Middle East as ISIS continues its bloody quest to solidify an Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria. And Japan's efforts to provide humanitarian aid won't stop, one top official said Sunday. ""We would like to expand our support for refugees,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. ""We are surely going to have necessary support in terms of not yielding to terrorism."" 'Let the nightmare for Japan begin' The ISIS video opens with a black slate that reads, ""A Message to Japan."" It then shows a kneeling Goto . The man known as ""Jihadi John"" is standing behind him. The terrorist speaks in English while holding a knife in his left hand. ""Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found,"" the man says. ""So let the nightmare for Japan begin."" The video cuts to black as the militant puts the knife to Goto's throat. It then shows the apparent result of the decapitation. It's not clear who conducted the apparent killing. The knife-wielding masked man with a London accent has been nicknamed ""Jihadi John."" He has appeared in at least six videos with hostages and has overseen the beheadings of other captives. The race to save Goto's life . Goto, 47, left Japan last fall, when his younger daughter was 3 weeks old. His wife, Rinko, first heard from his captors December 2. On January 20, an ISIS video posted to social media showed Goto and Yukawa dressed in orange, kneeling in front of a masked man dressed in black. In that video, the ISIS militant issued a $200 million ransom demand to the Japanese government  in order to free the Japanese men within 72 hours. That's the same amount of money Abe recently pledged for those ""contending"" with ISIS. Days later, a new message surfaced featuring what appeared to be the corpse of Yukawa. And Goto would also be killed, the new message claimed, unless Jordan freed prisoner and convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi. Suga said Japan tried hard to save both Yukawa and Goto. ""Since the beginning of the incident, we have been trying to use all kind of means and to do our best to save their lives by using our diplomatic route, as much as possible,"" Suga said Sunday. When asked whether Japan negotiated over the ransom, Suga said no. Jordan also said it did everything it could to free Goto in cooperation with Japan, government spokesman Mohammed Al-Momani told Jordan's official Petra news agency Sunday. But that country is still grappling with its own hostage situation. Jordanian pilot's fate unclear . Among its web of threats, ISIS said it would kill Jordanian military pilot captured in Syria if Jordan doesn't release convicted terrorist al-Rishawi. But pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh's fate remains unclear. He was not mentioned in the latest video featuring Goto. Jordan will continue trying to secure the release of the pilot, Al-Momani told Petra on Sunday. But he said officials are still seeking ""proof of life"" evidence that al-Kasasbeh is alive. No answers . Goto, a veteran journalist, had said he felt compelled to document the stories of war, even if it meant going to some of the most dangerous places in the world. ""Syrian people (have been) suffering for three years and a half. It's enough,"" he said in a video shot in October. ""So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."" In a statement posted on the website of Goto's media company, his family thanked those who had ""prayed for his safe return"" and said they were ""deeply saddened"" by his death. Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, said her son wanted to help create a world free of wars. ""I'm shedding tears of sorrow, I just can't think of any words to say,"" she said, according to NHK. ""But I don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred."" Rinko praised her husband's work in a statement released Sunday. ""While feeling a great personal loss, I remain extremely proud of my husband, who reported the plight of people in conflict areas like Iraq, Somalia and Syria,"" she said. ""It was his passion to highlight the effects on ordinary people, especially through the eyes of children, and to inform the rest of us of the tragedies of war."" But now, she must raise the couple's two girls without their father. The 2-year-old daughter has been asking when her dad will come home.

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's decision to step down from his advisory role at British bank Barclays at the end of the year became the latest indication he's gearing up to jump into the presidential race — and underscored one of the main liabilities he could face if he does run. The move, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes just days after he announced on Facebook plans to ""actively explore"" a presidential bid. Testing the waters early, Bush's supporters say, will give him the opportunity to gauge his support and tackle some of the more controversial aspects of his tenure in public office and the private sector. While Bush is seen as a top GOP establishment pick for the party's nomination, he's expected to face a fierce fight from the conservative wing of his party if he jumps in the race, particularly on immigration, thanks to his previous support for a pathway to citizenship, and Common Core educational standards. But his record on economic issues and his private-sector experience is certain to spark criticism as well, from both his left and right flanks. Already he's drawn scrutiny over his business career, with a recent Bloomberg report examining his work in private equity and investment banking and declaring, ""Jeb Bush has a Mitt Romney problem."" Bush aides and allies insist his business career won't be a problem if he runs. ""He's very comfortable with his conduct, with his businesses and how he has spent his time since he's been governor,"" Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush family friend and GOP strategist, told CNN earlier this week. But Bush's ties to Barclays point to another potentially prickly issue for him — his support for the 2008 Wall Street bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which initially authorized $700 billion in loans from the U.S. government to the banking sector. From September through December of 2008, Barclays benefitted from $8.5 billion in taxpayer dollars that were used to bail out failing insurance giant AIG, according to a 2009 report in Politico. A spokeswoman for the governor said, however, he didn't join the firm until March 20, 2009. But years later, during a 2012 hearing on Capitol Hill, Bush endorsed the bailout. ""For a short-term solution to a problem that had global implication, I think that was probably the right thing to do,"" he said. Other potential presidential contenders are on record supporting TARP, including Rep. Paul Ryan, who voted for it, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who signed a letter urging Congress to pass ""an economic recovery package,"" though he later said the letter wasn't an explicit endorsement of TARP itself. RELATED: Jeb Bush's record on taxes . And in 2012, Perry called TARP the ""single biggest act of theft in American history."" Sen. Rand Paul, another potential presidential primary opponent, wrote in his book that TARP ""represented everything that was wrong with Washington,"" because of how it was passed. Perry's scramble to clarify his position on the issue underscores how politically unpalatable it's been with the GOP base. Conservative backlash over TARP and the health care reform law contributed to the 2010 Tea Party wave, and the Wall Street bailout remains a potent issue on both the far-right and far-left flanks of the major parties. Bush's comments, and his role with the bank as it emerged from the financial crisis — as well as his work for investment bank Lehman Brothers, which he left after it collapsed in 2008 — could be fertile ground for Republican opponents looking for avenues of attack against him.","Jeb Bush supported the federal Wall Street bailout .
He also worked for Barclays, which eventually benefited from $8.5 billion in taxpayer money from the bailout .

"Cairo (CNN)Egypt's highest court has accepted the appeal of three jailed journalists who work for Al Jazeera and granted them a retrial, the journalists' lawyers said Thursday. Peter Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were convicted in June of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and Mohamed to 10 years. The Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political group, was banned in Egypt and labeled a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsy's ouster in 2013. He was Egypt's first democratically elected leader after the Arab Spring uprising. TV cameras were not allowed in Thursday's hearing in the Court of Cassation, and the incarcerated journalists were also absent from the courtroom. The men's families were disappointed at the outcome. They had hoped the court would throw out the case and release them or at least free them on bail pending retrial, but they remain behind bars. The retrial date has not yet been set. ""This was not good as we hoped for,"" Lois Greste, mother of Australian journalist Peter Greste, told reporters at the court. Journalist's letter from Cairo cell . 'I believe in his innocence' Lawyers for the three defendants asked the court for their release but told reporters that the chances were slim. Fahmy's lawyers asked for his deportation to Canada -- he is Egyptian-Canadian -- taking advantage of a new law allowing a president to deport defendants. The judge overseeing the retrial will decide on their release, said Amr El-Deeb, a lawyer for Peter Greste and Mohamed. Greste's brothers, Mike and Andrew Greste, expressed mixed feelings about the court's decision. ""It's a step in the right direction. Obviously, it's a little disappointing that we didn't get the most positive outcome, but on reflection, it's certainly the next best result for us,"" Mike Greste told CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia. But Greste's family hopes Egypt's government will make use of other legal avenues to free his brother Peter sooner. ""Following instruction from Peter and the family, Peter's Egyptian lawyer lodged an application with the Egyptian Attorney General's office to have Peter deported, pursuant to a presidential decree that was issued in November,"" Andrew Greste said. ""We believe there is now a window of opportunity for the Egyptian president to exercise his presidential power under the decree,"" he Greste said. Fahmy's fiancee, Marwa Omara, said they planned to marry despite his incarceration. ""We will hold our wedding vows inside the prison,"" she said. ""I believe it's a message to the whole world that Mohamed is innocent, and I believe in his innocence. And it is a personal message to him that I love him and I know that he is innocent."" Fahmy's brother, Adel Fahmy, said the whole family had shared in the journalist's ordeal. ""It's the epitome of injustice what happened,"" he said. ""He lost a year and more now of his life. We are suffering as a family severely for my brother, as all the families are for their loved ones. And I can't describe in words what we've been through this year."" 'Unjustly in jail' In a statement issued after the ruling, Al Jazeera urged Egyptian authorities to move swiftly to a retrial. Lawyers point out that the appeal process from this point could take another 12 to 18 months, the broadcaster said. ""Baher, Peter and Mohamed have been unjustly in jail for over a year now,"" an Al Jazeera spokesman said. ""The Egyptian authorities have a simple choice -- free these men quickly, or continue to string this out, all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world. They should choose the former."" There has been wide international condemnation of Egypt's prosecution of the three journalists, who deny wrongdoing. The United States, Australia and European Union have all called for the men to be freed, as have rights groups including Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Press Institute. Flawed trial . The appeal was accepted because of procedural errors in the trial that led to the conviction. The men had appeared in a special court created to handle terrorism cases, which may, in retrospect, be considered illegal. Prosecutors are now expected to present the same case in a new court. The three journalists have been imprisoned in Cairo since December 2013 on charges that included conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security. They have steadfastly denied the charges, as has Al Jazeera, and the prosecution put forward no evidence to support the allegations. Prosecutors were criticized for presenting evidence that was purportedly made up or irrelevant to the case, like videos of Greste's old news reports from other countries. Amnesty International has said that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the tiny but oil-rich Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was declared a terrorist organization just days before the Al Jazeera journalists were arrested at the Cairo hotel where they were working. With Saudi mediation, however, there has been a recent improvement in Egyptian-Qatari relations. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met with a Qatari envoy in December, and the meeting was followed by Al Jazeera's decision to suspend its Egyptian Mubasher Masr channel. This channel is already banned by an Egyptian court and was at the center of the journalists' trial, even though they work for the network's English-language channel. Omara, Fahmy's fiancee, welcomed the apparent improvement in the two countries' relations. ""I hope the reconciliation between Egypt and Qatar can lead to a better outcome,"" she said. ""It's very hard for us to feel that they will stay for a year in prison. It's very tough. They did nothing."" Journalist Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

"(CNN) -- It's early in the morning of a grand prix weekend, but Formula One's kitchens are already sizzling with activity. Inside Red Bull Racing's roof-top kitchen, four chefs are chopping, stirring and flipping spitting pans in perfect unison. ""I'm normally at the track between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. on the busiest days of the race weekend,"" the team's executive chef Sandro Gamsjager tells CNN as he peers out from the steam. At Williams headquarters, the UK team's chefs are taking a breather after serving up their popular English breakfast. A traditional fry-up of bacon, eggs and all the trimmings is dished out to the ravenous British media before every Friday practice session. Motorsport's extensive traveling circus is not likely to go hungry in Hungary, which hosts round 11 of the championship on Sunday. ""In a race weekend we go through more than 500 eggs, 15 kilos of butter and 10 liters of olive oil,"" chef Adam Dixon tells CNN as he does the maths. F1 races on its stomach but, like most things in the elite division, fueling the sport is complicated. The chefs are spinning plates as they cater for three tiers of hungry mouths -- the race drivers, the teams and VIP guests. ""There are different levels of food service: the drivers; downstairs is the buffet for the team; and on the first floor it's like a really high quality, a la carte restaurant."" adds Gamsjager, who also oversees the menu for Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso. First to be fed are the drivers, who as toned athletes munch on a more carefully controlled menu. ""Like everyone they have a diet of protein, carbohydrate and healthy fats,"" Carlos Corell, the physio for Sauber reserve Giedo Van Der Garde, tells CNN. ""The only difference is the proportion of each they need compared to someone who sits at a desk all day. ""The races are mentally and physically demanding so they do need more carbohydrates, for example. ""Each driver's physique, the track and weather all make a difference to the number of calories burned during a race but at the 2013 British Grand Prix, for example, Giedo burned 1,175 calories."" Drivers' dietary needs . Like so much in F1, timing is everything. ""The only important thing for the drivers' food is that it is on time,"" says Gamsjager, who prepares the food for Red Bull's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. ""They have a strict plan which we get in the middle of the week. Normally they eat one and a half hours before they get in the car. ""They eat the same thing every week -- it's basically chicken, vegetables and pasta. Sebastian and Daniel might eat red meat on Sunday after the race."" Dixon, who cooks up Williams driver Felipe Massa's meals, reveals: ""Felipe is very set. On Friday he'll have chicken salad with tomato and maybe a little mozzarella after first practice. ""Maybe he'll have some pasta with fresh tomato sauce after second practice. Interactive: Take a trip around the Hungaroring . ""He has the same on Saturday and then on Sunday a little bit of pasta, tomatoes, olive oil and Parmesan before the race. He eats very lightly when he's driving but he eats when he feels it's right."" Across the other side of the Williams kitchen, chef Jon Smee is spicing up the menu for Valtteri Bottas. ""He has the same thing every day, which is wild rice with vegetables and tuna -- but he likes it spicy,"" Smee reveals. ""He also has a side salad with a chilli vinaigrette. ""Valtteri has cut down on the flapjack this year -- he's not eating it now because he's trying to keep slim."" Perhaps the Finn's chilli diet and decision to cut out cakes has helped him climb onto the podium twice this season for a resurgent Williams team -- but not all drivers are so conscientious. ""I had one whose diet was penne arrabiata and a Mars bar every day,"" laughs Dixon. Lean machine . It's not just F1's drivers who are chowing down on healthy food. In an intensely competitive sport, each team looks to gain a competitive advantage any way they can, and that means its staff must be leaner. Pit crews who are now capable of changing tires in under three seconds rely on exercise regimes and carefully managed diets. ""I've been doing this for 16 or 17 years and when I first started everyone was out to have a good time,"" Dixon explains. ""Now there's a real push to be physically fitter and to base food around healthy eating. It's noticeable up and down the paddock. ""We're looking at leaner cuts of meat and fish, we're not serving fried food and the vegetables are steamed."" Serving up healthy grub is only one prerequisite for F1's chefs -- quantity is just as important as quality. ""We make 2,000-2,500 meals from Wednesday to Sunday,"" Gamsjager calculates. ""The ingredient we use the most? Well, we do eat a lot of pasta."" Team staff tend to chow down on the ground floor of the motor homes -- or if the car needs an MOT, a takeaway sandwich satiates rumbling tummies. The top table . On the upper tier of the plush motor homes of the Red Bull, Mercedes, McLaren and Williams teams, F1's top tables are reserved for VIP guests, including local dignitaries, celebrities, business partners and sponsors. This is a chance for the paddock chefs to demonstrate their culinary prowess. The menus tantalize the tastebuds with beef cheeks and shallot and horse radish confit, crab cakes with sauce vierge and frozen coffee parfait. ""This is my little baby here,"" says Gamsjager, proudly surveying his bijou Red Bull restaurant at the top of the motor home. ""To do a little bit of fine dining, I love this, I need this. ""I love to do variations, to make old things a bit newer,"" adds the Austrian, who has won awards in his homeland for his cooking capabilities. The only problem with fine dining across 19 countries is that sometimes it's hard to find exactly the right ingredients. ""If you go to Hungary and try to find micro herbs, it becomes a bit more difficult,"" explains Dixon with a smile. Gamsjager agrees, citing India as a hard place to get healthy food. ""They have different thinking about those things, but all the other countries have very good products,"" he says. ""For the overseas races, I always start two or three months before, and I send them an order list for the main things -- dairy, cheese and things like this -- and then when we arrive I drive around searching for where I can get fresh meat and fish, and I buy them by myself."" Michelin man . With such complex catering demands, it's no wonder that F1's kitchens are filled to the brim with highly-trained chefs -- Mercedes even has a former UK Masterchef contestant among its ranks. The chefs insist there is no rivalry bubbling away between them -- though most also say they serve the best food. But arguably at the top of the table is a team which boasts a chef with two Michelin stars. Perhaps fittingly, the restaurant rating system was created by a company that was one of F1's tire suppliers until the end of 2006. Michael Caines, who earned his prestigious stars at Gidleigh Park in Devon, has been working in partnership with the Williams team since 2011. But are Massa and Bottas served up Michelin-star-quality food on the road? ""Michelin stars credit the quality of the food and the work you do but we can't pretend we're bringing that to a pop-up restaurant -- and ultimately that's what (the Williams motor home) is,"" Caines, a lifelong F1 fan, tells CNN. ""What we do try to do is to bring inspirational cooking to F1 with the quality of flavor, service, the ingredients and presentation."" All the chefs agree, however, that the most important ingredient when it comes to fueling F1's global circuit is a taste of home. ""We try to make everybody feel at home,"" says Gamsjager. ""When I see the car running and then the team come in and have good food, I think it helps."" Dixon agrees: ""When you spend a lot of your time away from home traveling, the team really look to us to provide home-cooked food. ""There is something special about this job. You're not just a chef.""","F1's hungry mouths are fed by skilled chefs who serve up to 2,500 meals per race .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN)It was news Lois Greste hoped to hear for more than a year. ""I sort of dreamed about it quietly, not daring to think about it too much,"" she said Monday, grinning as she described her relief at learning her son was released from prison and safely out of Egypt. Australian Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste had been behind bars since December 2013. On Sunday, family members learned he was finally free. ""I'm ecstatic, you know, I just can't say how happy I am about it all,"" his mother said. ""I'm very excited and pleased, and thank goodness this is all over."" But as they thanked government officials, journalists and supporters around the world for helping push for his freedom, the Greste family also told reporters at a press briefing in Australia on Monday that there's more to be done. ""On a more somber note, we also -- and I know Peter sincerely wanted me to mention this point -- we want to acknowledge that Peter's two other colleagues are still there,"" Andrew Greste said. ""They also deserve to be freed. Peter won't rest until they're released from prison, and we hope that will follow in the very near future."" Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, fellow Al Jazeera journalists, remain behind bars. All three were convicted of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood, but have maintained their innocence. Al Jazeera demanded their release, as did a chorus of many other international journalists. Egypt's highest court recently accepted the appeal of the three journalists and granted them a retrial. On Sunday morning, Greste's family started to hear rumors that something might happen, then checked with their contacts. It seemed like it could be true. ""But Egypt is a very uncertain and unpredictable place, and until he was on that plane, anything could have happened. ... He wasn't out of there until he was out of there,"" Andrew Greste said. Now Peter Greste is in Cyprus, ""gathering his thoughts,"" his brother said. ""He's safe, healthy and very, very happy to be on his way home."" After his release, family members said he enjoyed a meal of beer and pork. Now, his family members say they're giving him time to figure out where he'll go -- and what he'll do -- next. ""He needs that space to start with,"" Lois Greste said, ""but we're sure he's going to be fine."" Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Greste had been released ""unconditionally,"" but will need some time to adjust to life outside prison. ""He was somewhat bewildered. He was only given short notice by Egyptian authorities that he was to be released unconditionally. We moved as fast as we could to collect him from the prison and escort him to the airport and make arrangements for his immediate departure,"" she said ""He will make his way home, in his own time. I think he wants a little bit of rest and recreation, but he also wants to be reunited with his family and friends as soon as possible."" Greste left Egypt around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) Sunday, Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesman Hany Abdel Latif said. But one of Greste's lawyers suggested there could be more legal issues ahead for Greste. ""According to Egyptian law, this is considered an extradition,"" lawyer Amr Eldib, said. ""Peter must be tried in Australia and authorities there must determine if he is guilty or not."" Al Anstey, the managing director of Al Jazeera English, said he spoke with Greste earlier Sunday. The journalist "" sounded strong."" ""He sounded immensely relieved -- perhaps not celebratory but immensely relieved,"" Anstey told CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Anstey sought to keep attention on Fahmy and Mohamed. ""It's very unclear what's happening to Baher and what's happening for Mohamed,"" he said. ""But we just need to bring this injustice to an end and to get them out."" At the time of their arrest in December 2013, Egypt was mired in political turmoil surrounding the removal, by coup, of President Mohamed Morsy in his Muslim Brotherhood-backed government. After Morsy was ousted, the longstanding political party was declared a terrorist organization by the military, which had staged the coup. Greste described in a January 2014 letter how he and his colleagues were detained, saying that interior ministry officials burst into a hotel room that he and Fahmy were using. Officials rushed Baher Mohamed's home, he said. ""I am nervous as I write this,"" the letter read. ""I am in my cold prison cell after my first official exercise session -- four glorious hours in the grass yard behind our block and I don't want that right to be snatched away."" ""That is why I have sought, until now, to fight my imprisonment quietly from within, to make the authorities understand that this is all a terrible mistake, that I've been caught in the middle of a political struggle that is not my own,"" he wrote. ""But after two weeks in prison it is now clear that this is a dangerous decision. It validates an attack not just on me and my two colleagues but on freedom of speech across Egypt."" Read the letter Greste wrote while in prison . Amnesty International and other observers have long held that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt is the sixth leading jailer of journalists in the world, according to a census the non-partisan Committee to Protect Journalists took in December 2014. The jailing and sentencing of the Al Jazeera journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world. A campaign led by Al Jazeera declared that ""Journalism is not a crime."" For Egypt, Al Jazeera prisoners were PR disaser amid bigger problems . Many tweeted under the hashtag #freeajstaff and journalists, including CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who held up a sign with the campaign on her show. On Sunday, CPJ called on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to ""pardon and release Greste's Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, and the other journalists still behind bars for doing their work."" Human Rights Watch did the same. Al Sisi issued a law last November giving him the power to deport foreign defendants. It brought hope to two of the Al Jazeera defendants' families, but stoked concerns for others. Greste is Australian. Fahmy, who used to work for CNN, has dual nationality, with Egyptian-Canadian citizenship. Mohamed is Egyptian. Some worried that the case would lose its international appeal if Greste and Fahmy were released, leaving the Egyptian defendant behind bars. Jihan Rashed, Baher Mohamed's wife, told CNN that she couldn't believe Greste has been released. Why him and not her Egyptian husband? ""Because they were all three in the same case, I don't know (how) only one got released. I don't know why they released him (Greste) now after a year. What's special about this timing?"" she demanded. ""Are the foreigners more important in our country? We used to hear that the three would be pardoned, but does this mean that only foreigners will be released?"" Rashed is worried but optimistic because she's confident that Greste will tell the world that their imprisonment is unjust, she said. ""No one will be silent. We won't be silent,"" she said. ""Peter won't be silent."" Rashed said that releasing Greste proves that the case isn't about terrorism as the Egyptian government claimed, but about targeting journalists. ""(Mohamed) was doing his job,"" she said. ""He was relaying news, saying what the Muslim Brotherhood said and what the government said. Do I need to explain what a journalist should do?"" Fahmy's mother, Wafa Abdel Hamid Bassiouni, appealed to Al Sisi in a statement that an Egyptian news outlet published Sunday, telling the President that her son is ill with Hepatitis C and an injured shoulder. ""As a mother and an Egyptian citizen I appeal to you, Mr. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, to pardon my son... It hurts me to see his health deteriorating while I have little access to him,"" she wrote. ""My father and uncles have served in the highest ranks of the police force and the military. They have spent their lives defending Egypt... It breaks my heart that the son of a patriotic family like ours has been wrongfully framed as a terrorist in a trial that produced no evidence to (support) the accusations."" Read her full letter .

"Hong Kong (CNN)They carried bright yellow umbrellas, chanting ""I want true democracy,"" as they festively made their way through Hong Kong's streets. For the first time in more than a month, demonstrators peacefully took to the roads, many said, to make their voices heard and let their government and the world know that their fight for universal suffrage continues. Joshua Wong, 18, one of the student leaders of the movement, was one familiar face in the crowd. ""This rally is to let people know the umbrella movement is not over,"" Wong said, referencing the iconic symbol chosen by the demonstrators when they occupied the streets of Hong Kong for two-and-a-half months late last year. The turnout, though, fell far short of expectations, even for organizers. While the group behind the march -- the Civil Human Rights Front -- had forecast 50,000 people to join, they estimated only 13,000 took part in the procession.  A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Police Force put that number at just 8,800. While admitting some disappointment, Daisy Chan with the Civil Human Rights Front was still upbeat, saying the march had achieved its main goal: to remind the Hong Kong government that the reform proposal currently on the table for the 2017 election doesn't go far enough. ""In the coming days, I think people will try to give more political pressure, not only through demonstration, but civil disobedience, in order to fight for true democracy,"" Chan said. Dennis Yip, a 19-year-old student who joined the march, called it ""half successful"" because new groups had joined.  Some of them planned to meet after the rally to brainstorm the next steps, said Joshua Wong and other students. But it's unclear where this movement, which drew over 100,000 protesters at its peak in 2014, goes from here, without a clear leader or strategy to achieve its aims. As Hong Kong works through the process of how its top leader will be elected in 2017, the government has asked for feedback during a two-month period of public consultations. But Hong Kong's leaders, including Chief Executive CY Leung, have made it clear that there are limits: reform must be within the framework outlined by Beijing. That framework has Hong Kong's next leader being directly elected for the first time, but notes that the candidates for the ballot will be screened by a nominating committee. The government responded to Sunday's protest march with a statement on its website:  ""The (government) calls on all sectors of the community to adopt an accommodating, rational and pragmatic approach, as well as an inclusive attitude to express views, to forge consensus so that 5 million eligible voters can elect the Chief Executive by universal suffrage through 'one person, one vote' in 2017."" One bright yellow sign held high by marchers along the route had a different interpretation: ""Democracy Bottom Line.  Do Not Cross,"" it read. Since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed as a Special Administrative Region of China under the concept of ""one country, two systems.""

"Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire appeared to gasp and convulse for roughly 10 minutes before he died Thursday by lethal injection using a new combination of drugs, reporters who witnessed it said. McGuire was convicted in 1994 of the rape and murder of 22-year-old Joy Stewart, who was seven months pregnant. Her relatives were at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville to witness his death, according to tweets from television reporter Sheila Gray. McGuire's ""children and daughter-in-law were crying and visibly upset,"" Gray tweeted. She said McGuire, before the drugs took effect, thanked Stewart's family for a letter he apparently received. ""To my children, I'm sorry. I love you. I'm going to heaven and I'll see you there when you come,"" McGuire reportedly said, according to CNN affiliate WDTN. Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson said that the whole execution process took 24 minutes, and that McGuire appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes. ""He gasped deeply. It was kind of a rattling, guttural sound. There was kind of a snorting through his nose. A couple of times, he definitely appeared to be choking,"" WDTN quoted Johnson as saying. The convicted murderer was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. ET. The execution generated controversy because, like many states, Ohio has been forced to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. According to Ohio's corrections department, the state used a combination of the drugs midazolam, a sedative; and the painkiller hydromorphone. Both the length of time it took for McGuire to die and his gasping are not typical for an execution, said Howard Nearman, an anesthesiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. ""Why it took 24 minutes, I really can't tell you,"" he said. ""It just makes you wonder -- what was given? What was the timing, and what were the doses?"" In an opinion piece written for CNN this week, a law professor noted that McGuire's attorneys argued he would ""suffocate to death in agony and terror."" ""The state disagrees. But the truth is that no one knows exactly how McGuire will die, how long it will take or what he will experience in the process,"" wrote Elisabeth A. Semel, clinic professor of law and director of the Death Penalty Clinic at U.C. Berkeley School of Law. Speaking on behalf of McGuire's legal team, attorney Allen Bohnert called on the governor to impose a moratorium on future executions because of what took place Thursday. ""At this point, it is entirely premature to consider this execution protocol to be anything other than a failed, agonizing experiment,"" he said in a statement. ""The people of the State of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in all of our names. Ohio, like its citizens, must follow the law. The state has failed."" CNN's Sonny Hostin said that McGuire's execution will likely spark debate over whether how inmates react to the use of the drugs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. ""Whenever there's a change in the lethal injection process clearly it's subject to legal proceedings and perhaps we will see those,"" Hostin said. Ohio ran out of pentobarbital, which is a narcotic and sedative barbiturate, in September, according to JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In response to that shortage, the department amended its execution policy to allow for the use of midazolam and hydromorphone. Stewart's body was discovered by hikers near a creek in southwestern Ohio in February of 1989. Her throat was cut and she had been sodomized. Death penalty states scramble for lethal injection drugs . There are currently 138 men and one woman on death row in Ohio. The state was set to execute death row inmate Ron Phillips using the new drug combination last year, but Gov. John Kasich granted the convicted killer a stay of execution pending a review of a possible organ donation to his family members. Death penalty in the U.S. gradually declining .

"After a joyous welcome from the gathered faithful, Pope Francis celebrated Mass on Saturday at a stadium in Jordan on the first leg of a Holy Land trip intended to promote a message of unity. His trip has been billed as a ""pilgrimage for prayer,"" with its roots in faith, not politics. But in a region where religion and politics are so closely intertwined, his every remark will take on an added significance. The Holy Land trip, also taking in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, is the first for Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era. Everything to know about Pope Francis . Thousands of believers packed the International Stadium in Amman for the Mass in what is a majority Muslim nation with a significant Christian community. Many cheered and waved as the Pope arrived. In his homily, Francis spoke of the need for tolerance and diversity, and urged everyone to put aside grievances and divisions. ""The mission of the Holy Spirit is to beget harmony ... and to create peace in different situations and between different people,"" he said. ""Let us ask the Spirit to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and sisters so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political thinking, language, culture and religion."" Christian refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian territories were among those present, and 1,400 children received their First Communion at the Mass. Small groups of cheering supporters earlier lined the road, waving flags and chanting ""Long live the Pope"" as Francis' motorcade left the airport in Amman at the start of his three-day visit to the region. The Pope's first stop was at al-Husseini Royal Palace in Amman, where he met with Jordan's King Abdullah II. In televised remarks after that meeting, Francis paid tribute to Jordan's efforts to promote interfaith tolerance and to the welcome that the small nation has given to Palestinian refugees and, more recently, those fleeing war-torn Syria. Francis said it was ""necessary and urgent"" that a peaceful solution was found to the crisis in Syria. He also called for a ""right solution with regard to the situation between Israel and the Palestinians."" Middle East peace talks recently stalled despite high-profile efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to push them forward. ""I grasp this opportunity to renew my esteem and respect for the Muslim community and show my appreciation for the work carried out by his Majesty the King, which is promoting further understanding between peoples of different faith and communities of different faith,"" Francis said. His visit marks the 50th anniversary of the landmark meeting between Pope Paul VI and the then-spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Athenagoras, in Jerusalem. Landmark meeting . While in Jordan, Francis will greet some of the 600,000 Syrians that have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011 as well as refugees from Iraq. He will also visit the River Jordan, where many Christians believe Jesus was baptized. Accompanying Francis on his trip are Rabbi Abraham Skorka, who co-wrote a book with the pontiff, and Sheikh Omar Abboud, who leads Argentina's Muslim community. The religion of the Pope's traveling companions, both of whom hail from his home country, Argentina, is no coincidence. ""It's highly symbolic, of course,"" said the Rev. Thomas Rosica, a consultant to the Vatican press office. ""But it also sends a pragmatic message to Muslims, Christians and Jews that it's possible to work together -- not as a system of checks and balances but as friends."" In Bethlehem, Frances will greet children from refugee camps, celebrate Mass in Manger Square, lunch with Palestinian families and visit the site of Jesus' birth. The Pope is expected to call for a Palestinian state, which has long been Vatican policy. And in Jerusalem, the pontiff will meet the city's grand mufti and chief rabbis, visit the Western Wall and Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust, and lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl. He will also celebrate Mass at the site of the Last Supper. Francis will meet with the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in Bethlehem, and with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres while in Jerusalem.

"New York (CNN)An art enthusiast paid $5,212 in 2013 at a London auction for a painting of an 19th-century English landscape. That price was well above Christie's auction house estimated value of $760 to $1,200. This week, however, the painting's price jumped dramatically -- 1,000 times its previous value -- at a Sotheby's auction in New York. It sold Wednesday for $5.2 million. The discrepancy in the value of ""Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows"" is due to a difference of opinion by art experts at the rival auction houses. Christie's analyzed the painting in 2013 and declared that it was the work of a follower of John Constable -- not a creation of the famed English Romantic landscape artist himself. But Sotheby's claimed it was an original Constable made in preparation for another work owned by the Tate gallery in London. The auction house valued the painting at between $2 million and $3 million. Anne Lyles, former 18th and 19th century British art curator at the Tate, wrote in catalog for the Sotheby's auction that ""the present work by Constable was heavily retouched with a dark and opaque pigments which probably dated to the late 19th or early 20th century, in a misguided attempt to 'finish' the painting."" Lyles wrote that this was the reason why Christie's ""overlooked"" its authenticity in 2013. ""The retouchings on the present painting were readily soluble in the course of its recent cleaning, and Constable's original and brilliant conception has been once again revealed,"" Lyles wrote. Christie's, however, said that experts disagree about the painting's authenticity. ""We are aware that Sotheby's have sold this work as by Constable,"" the auction house said in a statement. ""We took the view at the time of our sale in 2013 that it was by a 'follower of.' We understand that there is no clear consensus of expertise on the new attribution."" Mystery masterpiece a Rembrandt . Lyles wrote that the painting recently sold was one of five preliminary oil sketches, precursors to ""perhaps the greatest of his late masterpieces,"" a work that goes by the same name. According to Sotheby's, it is believed the sketch was possibly sold by the artist in 1837 for 6 pounds -- or about $9 today. John Constable (1776-1837) was famous for his landscapes of the English countryside, particularly scenes of his native Suffolk. In 2012, the Constable painting ""The Lock"" became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold, fetching £22.4m ($34.8 million) at an auction at Christie's in London.

"More than 150 soldiers in Bangladesh were sentenced to death Tuesday for murder, rape and arson during a 2009 mutiny. ""The convicts will be hanged by the neck until death,"" ruled Mohammad Akhteruzzaman, a senior judge at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Court, in pronouncing the sentences for the 152 paramilitary border guards. Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed in the mutiny at the headquarters of Bangladesh's border guards in Dhaka in February 2009. Investigators initially brought charges against 850 people, including 23 civilians, but the final judgment was against 846 people.  Four suspects died in custody. The accused troopers were indicted on charges of murder, rape, arson, looting weapons and conspiracy. ""We had long been waiting for the verdict and it has cleansed the image of the force stained by the massacre,"" said Maj. Gen. Aziz Ahmed, who now leads the border guards. Several thousand armed soldiers of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) unit took control of their own headquarters in the capital for two days and massacred scores of people, including officers of the Bangladesh Army who were stationed with the BDR. The civilians in the case include a former lawmaker from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, and an Awami League leader, Torab Ali. State prosecutor Mosharrof Hossain Kazal told CNN that 161 people, including Pintu and Ali, were sentenced to life in prison. A total of 262 people were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three years to 10 years and 271 were acquitted of the charges against them. ""We may appeal against those who were acquitted,"" Kazal said. Shamim Sardar, an attorney for one of those sentenced Tuesday, told reporters justice had not been done and vowed to appeal to a higher court. The mutiny erupted less than two months after the present Awami League government -- led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina --  came to power in January 2009 in a landslide victory. According to the charges, the border guards took up weapons, killed the officers, and held the families of the officers hostage in the staff apartments inside the headquarters compound. The dead also included the then-chief of the border guards, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, and his wife. The soldiers demanded better pay and perks, as well as the withdrawal of all army officers from the forces. The government later renamed the BDR the Border Guards of Bangladesh.  The prime responsibility of the force, which works under the ministry of home affairs, is to guard the country's 4,000-kilometer (2,485-mile) border with India and Myanmar.","Some defense attorneys plan to appeal the sentences .

"Washington (CNN)Several post-Romney 2016 dynamics on the GOP side, plus two big debates with complications for congressional Republicans filled our Super Bowl Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. 1. MITT BOWS OUT, AND JEB MOVES IN . With Mitt Romney now officially out of the 2016 GOP nomination chase, New Hampshire becomes a more wide-open race, and the Jeb Bush camp is hoping to make fast inroads. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times notes with a crowded field, Iowa's vote likely will be splintered and the state is known for its strong evangelical base. South Carolina, stop three on the calendar, could be influenced by the possible candidacy of home state senator Lindsey Graham. Romney would have been the early New Hampshire favorite. But now? ""I'm told that immediately after Mitt made his move on Friday, the Jeb folks started to figure out how they can get two key operatives in that state, Jim Merrill and Tom Rath, both old New Hampshire pros, both of whom were Mitt guys who had stayed loyal to Mitt but are now free agency,"" said Martin. 2. COMING SOON: A PARADE OF LONGER THAN LONG SHOTS . Watch New Hampshire over the next couple weeks and you might come to the conclusion it is easier to count the Republicans NOT considering a 2016 presidential run. On tap to visit soon: former GOP Govs. George Pataki of New York, Jim Gilmore of Virginia and Bob Ehrlich of Maryland. Also, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton and former high tech CEO Carly Fiorina have New Hampshire travel plans. All of them are longer than long shots, should they run. But former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is due back, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, too. Team Christie views New Hampshire as critical -- and hopes the lack of a competitive Democratic race could help his case. In New Hampshire, independents can vote in either primary, and Team Christie thinks more of them might be inclined to cast their votes for a GOP candidate. 3. RAND HITS THE ROAD . Rand Paul was the most active GOP contender early on, and Politico's Mike Allen reports the freshman Kentucky senator has a busy travel schedule ahead as he tries to build his support -- and not always in predictable ways. ""We're told that Rand Paul is going to travel every weekend, going forward-- he's not going to do many cattle calls,"" said Allen. ""Everybody else was in Iowa last weekend, he's in Iowa next weekend, because he can draw a crowd on his own."" ""And something that he's doing, as he travels the country, is meeting with physicians -- thinking about a way to bring in some people who are not necessarily politically active who can give, who can talk about among the community, so he's talking to the fellow doctors as he goes around."" But Paul is also including some GOP stops that are a bit more predictable: ""He's back to red meat next weekend in Iowa,"" said Allen.  ""He's doing a liberty event and his big rally is audit the Fed.  That's about the reddest meat that you can get."" 4. GROUNDHOG DAY: BUT FOR SOME IN GOP, THIS OBAMACARE VOTE IS DIFFERENT . House Republicans are planning to vote yet again on legislation that would repeal Obamacare, keeping a 2014 promise to voters even though they have no prayer of getting President Barack Obama to sign on. But for some GOPers, NPR's Juana Summers says, the calculations are a little different because the law has been in effect for a few years now -- and access to health care is expanding even in Red America. ""This time, a lot of Republicans in this new Congress, many of them freshmen who are from conservative states, particularly in the South, are going to have to actually vote for something that's now in play, but is actually giving people in their districts -- whose votes that they're going to need -- health insurance,"" said Summers. ""This could put some Republicans, who in two more years will have to run again, in really, really tricky place, especially if they have core constituents who are benefiting."" 5. BEST WAY TO CAVE? GOP LOOKS TO ESCAPE BORDER FUNDING FIGHT . Republicans won big in 2014, and came to Washington full of energy to start 2015. So one might find it hard to believe the party's theme for the looming Department of Homeland Security spending fight might be best described as searching for the best way -- and time -- for the GOP establishment to cave. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast laid out the calculations: ""And whether that means letting it go off the cliff or what -- whether it means letting it go off the cliff and then coming back... They all kind of think they're going to cave, they just have to find the best way to do it.""","Jeb Bush's post-Romney New Hampshire calculations .

"(CNN)The U.S. Navy is getting ready to ""swarm"" its adversaries. The Office of Naval Research over the weekend released video of tests conducted in August that showed five ""drone"" boats swarming a vessel that posed a threat to a Navy ship. ""The U.S. Navy is unleashing a new era in advanced ship protection,"" the service says in the video. Controlled by what the Navy calls Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing (CARACaS), a sensor and software kit that is transferable among small vessels, a fleet of more than a dozen small unmanned boats cruise along the James River in Virginia, setting up a protective screen on a Navy research ship. When a threatening vessel is detected, five boats break off to confront it. ""If I was the actual target it would be pretty intimidating to see five boats rushing at me,"" Sam Calabrese, pilot of the ""bad guy"" vessel, said in the Navy video. One developer likened the robot boats to ""guard dogs"" that could swim around a warship and detect threats before they come within striking range. And like dogs, the robot boats actually think for themselves, with their software choosing the best route for each boat to confront a threatening vessel. The drone boats could be armed to fire on adversaries, but fire control would come from a sailor on an accompanying warship. The system also allows the Navy to save money because no special boats have to be built to deploy it. The boats used in the August demonstration came from inventory now carried on Navy warships, the Navy video said. ""Any boat can be fitted with a kit that allows it to operate autonomously and together swarm on any threat,"" the video says. The CARACaS software was originally designed for NASA's Mars rovers, the Navy video says, and adapted for use by small boats. The Navy released the video just a week before the 14th anniversary of the terrorist attack on the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors. The Cole was attack by a small boat packed with explosives which blew a 40-foot-by-60-foot hole in the side of the destroyer when detonated. It's the kind of attack Navy officials think a swarm of unmanned surface vessels, or USVs, could prevent without putting any sailors in harm's way. ""While the attack on Cole was not the only motivation for developing autonomous swarm capability, it certainly is front and center in our minds, and hearts,"" Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder, chief of naval research, said in a statement. ""If Cole had been supported by autonomous USVs, they could have stopped that attack long before it got close to our brave men and women on board."" The Navy release says swarmboat capabilities could also play a role in protecting U.S. ports. The U.S. Coast Guard was part of the tests the Navy carried out in August. With the success of the August tests, the system could soon be in use within the Navy's fleet. ""We believe we will be able to deliver this to the fleet for operational testing within one year,"" Peter Vietti, spokesman for the Office of Naval Research, said Monday.","Small, unmanned boats could act as ""guard dogs"" for Navy warships .

"The body of former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat will be exhumed Tuesday and samples taken to be tested for poisoning as part of an inquiry into his 2004 death, an official said Saturday. Forensic experts from France, Switzerland and Russia will each take their own samples for independent analysis, said Tawfiq Tirawi, head of the Palestinian investigation committee. The tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah will then be closed back up on the same day, Tirawi told a news conference in Ramallah. Arafat will be reburied with a military ceremony, he said. The occasion is likely to be an emotional one for many Palestinians who view Arafat as a symbol of resistance. Tuesday ""will be one of the most difficult days of my life because of many personal, national and symbolic considerations,"" said Tirawi.  ""But I consider it a painful necessity.  This is necessary to reach the truth in the death of President Yasser Arafat."" Palestinian officials hope the tests will clear up questions over whether Arafat's death eight years ago was the result of poisoning by the radioactive element polonium. The Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank, says it is convinced Israel is behind any poisoning of Arafat. Israel has declined to comment on the allegation. French authorities opened a murder inquiry into Arafat's death this year after high levels of the radioactive substance were found on some of his personal belongings by a Swiss doctor. Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, said his researchers had found high levels of toxic polonium-210 after testing Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the distinctive black-and-white headscarf he often wore. The discovery prompted his widow, Suha Arafat, to lodge a formal legal complaint for murder. Arafat's widow wants body exhumed after test for radioactivity . She told CNN she wanted her late husband's body exhumed ""to make sure 100% of the existence of polonium."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation of Arafat's body from his mausoleum, which is in the Palestinian presidential compound in Ramallah. The use of polonium-210 as a poison hit the headlines in 2006, when it was used to kill Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. In a deathbed statement from a London hospital Litvinenko blamed Russia's President Vladimir Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied.","Former PLO leader Yasser Arafat will be exhumed Tuesday .

"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree banning foreign same-sex couples -- as well as single people from countries where same-sex marriages are legal -- from adopting Russian children. Though there was no official ban until now, foreigners' attempts to adopt Russian children before the decree generally would be unsuccessful if a prospective adoptive parent was thought to be gay, international adoption agencies based in Russia have said. Same-sex marriage is illegal in Russia. The decree was signed Monday and published on a government website Thursday. It went into effect Wednesday, state-funded television network Russia Today reported, but CNN couldn't immediately confirm that. The portion affecting singles appears to stem from concerns Russian lawmakers have publicly expressed that single prospective adoptive parents could turn out to be gay and enter a same-sex marriage in their home countries. The ban would appear to affect citizens in the more than a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriage. The move comes about a year after Russian lawmakers passed a bill banning adoptions to the United States. The move was widely seen as retaliation for a law the United States passed in 2012 on human rights abusers in Russia. Protests of policies leading up to Olympics . It also comes amid criticism of the country's anti-gay policies leading up to the Winter Olympic Games, which Russia is now hosting in Sochi. Russia's parliament passed what's known as the gay propaganda law in June. The legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. The law was widely criticized by Western leaders who called it archaic and discriminatory. Human rights activists said Russia was unworthy of hosting the Olympics because of it. U.S. President Barack Obama stepped into the fray, saying at a White House news conference in August that ""nobody's more offended than me"" by anti-gay legislation ""you've been seeing in Russia."" And Web search giant Google weighed in on the controversy with a rainbow Olympic-themed logo on its home page the day the Games started. Before the Games, Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to downplay fears that gay visitors would be discriminated against during the Olympics. Putin said Russia, unlike some other countries, does not criminalize homosexual relationships. ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" he said on a visit to Sochi weeks before the Games. ""That's why you can feel safe and free here,"" he added, ""but please leave our children in peace.""

"The parents of Sarah Jones, a crew member killed while filming musician Gregg Allman's biopic ""Midnight Rider,"" filed a wrongful death lawsuit Wednesday. Jones, a 27-year-old camera assistant, was killed by an oncoming train during production. Among the defendants are the production company, the company that operates the train tracks, and various individuals, including the film's director, executive producers, location manager and director of photography. The suit was filed in Chatham County, Georgia, which includes Savannah. ""Each of the Midnight Riders Defendants had knowledge, actual or constructive, that the scene filmed on February 20 was to take place on active railroad tracks, without permission from CSX, and each Midnight Rider Defendant knew of the danger presented by filming under those circumstances,"" the complaint reads. ""Despite this knowledge, and as set forth above, the Midnight Rider Defendants breached their duties to conduct the February 20 filming in a safe and legal manner, and each Midnight Rider Defendant is independently liable to Plaintiffs for Sarah's death and resulting damages."" Jones' death rocked the film community. Crew members from various countries shared photo tributes, holding clapboards with messages of remembrance for Jones. Images were shared on a Facebook group Slates for Sarah. Jones' primary job on set was to operate the slate at the beginning of each take.

"Kano, Nigeria  (CNN)Boko Haram failed attempts to seize the key Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Sunday, the militants' second attack there in a week. Islamist extremists tried to enter Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, during a predawn attack after the army fought them off last week. Gunfire raged for hours outside the city, residents said. ""Fighting has been going on since 3 a.m. as Boko Haram battles soldiers and vigilantes,"" said Mahmud Kyari, who lives in Maiduguri. ""Explosions and gunfire are all we hear."" The militants launched bomb and gun attacks from three points outside the city, but met stiff resistance from troops and vigilantes, residents said. Government officials said fighter jets were pounding the insurgents. ""Boko Haram gunmen have been routed and are on the run,"" said Sadiq Balarabe, another resident. Soldiers repelled attacks in Maiduguri on January 25, but the extremists seized the nearby town of Monguno and its military barracks. Monguno is 135 kilometers (85 miles) from Maiduguri. Both cities are near the Chad and Cameroon borders, which would give the militants an entry point into those countries. Monguno and its military post had served as a buffer to keep the militants away from Maiduguri. Its fall left Maiduguri vulnerable to capture by the militants. Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima said young people from the state joined the military and vigilantes in the fight to repel Boko Haram. The youths ""sacrificed their lives and moved to frontlines to support our gallant armed forces in a patriotic battle to defend the soul of Borno state and its people from being seized by determined insurgents,"" he said in a statement. ""I am confident that as a people, we can overcome the threat of insurgents,"" Shettima said. ""Borno is our land, we cannot and we must not allow anyone push us out of our land."" The governor said he is not asking citizens to take justice into their own hands, but to register and get training to support the military. The latest attacks come as Nigeria prepares for elections February 14. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in the nation last month to call for peaceful voting. In neighboring Yobe state, a suicide blast Sunday outside the home of a prominent politician killed seven people and injured several others, a police officer and witnesses said. Sabo Garbu, a candidate of Nigeria's ruling Peoples Democratic Party, was not injured in the explosion. It occurred while he was holding a meeting with his campaign team at his home in Potiskum town. ""We were outside the house when a bus pulled over and an unkempt man‎ was pushed out,"" said Tijjani Mamman, who was among a crowd of supporters outside the home at the time of the blast. ""The bus drove off and before anybody realized what was happening , the man exploded."" Though one has claimed responsibility for Sunday's blast, Boko Haram has carried out a spate of suicide attacks in Potiskum in recent weeks. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. CNN's Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria.

"(CNN)A winter storm ramping up in the Great Plains put the metropolitan Chicago area's more than 9 million people under a blizzard warning Sunday, and another 65 million people are under a winter storm warning across 18 states.  The storm has the Northeast in its sights next. Chicago could get as much as 15 inches of snow from the storm system, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. ""The streets will stay plowed and passable so people will be safe and secure,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised at a news conference Sunday.  More than 350 pieces of equipment, including plows and salt spreaders, fanned out across the city, officials said. Up to a foot of snow was forecast in parts of Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.  Multiple winter storm warnings are in place from eastern Nebraska and South Dakota to the Plains.

"Pope Francis extended an invitation Sunday to the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to travel to the Vatican for a ""peace initiative,"" after earlier calling for a two-state solution to the intractable conflict. The pontiff's remarks came at the end of an outdoor Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square on the second day of his three-day trip to the Middle East. ""In this, the birthplace of the Prince of Peace, I wish to invite you, President Mahmoud Abbas, together with Israeli President Shimon Peres, to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace,"" Francis said. ""I offer my home in the Vatican as a place for this encounter of prayer."" He added, ""Building peace is difficult, but living without peace is a constant torment. The men and women of these lands, and of the entire world, all of them, ask us to bring before God their fervent hopes for peace."" The Palestinian side has accepted the invitation and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will go to the Vatican, a Palestinian Legislative Council member, Hanan Ashrawi, told CNN. The Israeli President's office said that he welcomed the invitation. ""President Peres has always supported, and will continue to support, any attempts to progress the cause of peace,"" his office said. Pope Francis then traveled on to Tel Aviv, where in remarks on the airport tarmac to Peres and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he again issued an invitation to pray for peace at the Vatican. He also reiterated the Vatican's support for Israel's right to exist in peace and security. The next stop on his historic trip was Jerusalem. Two states . Earlier, speaking alongside Abbas in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Francis called for the recognition of a Palestinian state -- but he made the same demand on behalf of the state of Israel. He urged ""the acknowledgment by all of the right of two states to exist and to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders."" The Pope called on all sides to pursue a path to peace together and not take unilateral actions to disrupt it. ""I can only express my profound hope that all will refrain from initiatives and actions which contradict the stated desire to reach a true agreement, and that peace will be pursued with tireless determination and tenacity,"" he said. Middle East peace talks recently stalled despite high-profile efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to push them forward. The government of Israel has objected to unilateral initiatives by Palestinians to seek international recognition as a state, and Palestinians have objected to Israeli initiatives to expand settlements on the West Bank. Protecting Christians . In his remarks in Bethlehem, Francis called on Abbas to protect the religious rights of Palestinian Catholics. The Vatican has expressed concern over the emigration of Palestinian Christians. The pontiff also took a stand for the poor, suffering under tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. ""Even in the absence of violence, the climate of instability and a lack of mutual understanding have produced insecurity, the violation of rights, isolation and the flight of entire communities, conflicts, shortages and sufferings of every sort,"" he said. After meeting with Abbas, Francis cruised in the Popemobile through a crowd of hundreds of Catholic faithful and onlookers gathered in Manger Square as they awaited the papal Mass. Priests and the faithful swayed to religious music, while many waved red, green, black and white Palestinian flags and others yellow and white Vatican flags. The Pope hopped off the Popemobile to shake hands with people in the crowd. In a symbolically charged moment, he also stopped the vehicle to cross over to the separation barrier erected by Israel, its surface daubed with graffiti including the words ""Free Palestine!"" There, arm outstretched, he touched the concrete wall, his head apparently bowed in prayer. Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestine National Initiative, told CNN, ""The Pope did not only put his hand on a concrete wall. He put his hand on occupation. He put his hand on (an) apartheid system, on a system of separation, and discrimination, and oppression."" Refugee children make appeal . Francis also met with a group of Palestinian refugee children while in the West Bank. As they entered, the children held up signs about the occupation of Palestinian territories, typed in Arabic, Italian and English. ""Muslims and Christians live under the occupation,"" read one. Another said, ""I have never been to the sea!"" in an apparent reference to the restrictions on movement under which Palestinians live. After the children sang and presented him with gifts, the Pope responded in his native tongue, Spanish, to say he had heard their message. ""Never let the past determine your lives,"" he said. ""Violence is not overcome by violence. Violence is overcome by peace."" While in Jerusalem, Francis will meet with Bartholomew, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. His visit to the region commemorates the 50th anniversary of the landmark meeting between Pope Paul VI and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians at the time, Patriarch Athenagoras, in Jerusalem. The pope will also meet the city's grand mufti and chief rabbis, visit the Western Wall and Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust, and lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl. The Holy Land visit is the first for Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era. 'Urgent' solution needed to Syrian crisis . On the first day of his trip, Francis also gave a message of unity as he celebrated Mass at a stadium in Amman, Jordan -- a majority Muslim nation with a significant Christian community. In his homily, Francis spoke of the need for tolerance and diversity and urged everyone to put aside grievances and divisions. ""The mission of the Holy Spirit is to beget harmony ... and to create peace in different situations and between different people,"" he said. ""Let us ask the Spirit to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and sisters so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political thinking, language, culture and religion."" Christian refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian territories were among those present, and 1,400 children received their First Communion at the Mass. The Pope's trip to the Holy Land has been billed as a ""pilgrimage for prayer,"" with its roots in faith, not politics. But in a region where religion and politics are so closely intertwined, his every remark takes on an added significance. The pontiff is traveling with two friends -- a rabbi, Abraham Skorka, and a Muslim, Sheikh Omar Abboud, who leads Argentina's Muslim community. The Vatican has said their presence is symbolic of his call for unity. The Pope's first stop was at al-Husseini Royal Palace in Amman, where he met with Jordan's King Abdullah II. In televised remarks after that meeting, Francis paid tribute to Jordan's efforts to promote interfaith tolerance and to the welcome that the small nation has given to Palestinian refugees and, more recently, those fleeing war-torn Syria. Francis said it was ""necessary and urgent"" that a peaceful solution is found to the crisis in Syria. While in Jordan, Francis met some of the 600,000 Syrians who have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011, as well as refugees from Iraq. He also visited the River Jordan, where many Christians believe Jesus was baptized. Everything to know about Pope Francis .

"(CNN)Nearly five months ago, President Obama spoke to the nation from the White House and declared: ""Our objective is clear. We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL (also known as ISIS) through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy."" Since then, the United States has provided advisers to the Iraqi military in its fight with ISIS and has bombed ISIS positions. But in an interview with CNN last week, outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel raised the prospect that the United States might need to expand its involvement. This week, ISIS has again dominated headlines and TV news coverage around the world with the release of a video allegedly showing Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh being burned alive after being captured by the group. This followed shortly after the apparent killing of two Japanese hostages. All of which raises the question: How is ISIS doing as it confronts the U.S.-led military campaign against it in both Iraq and Syria? And should the United States get more actively involved on the front lines of the fight, at least in Iraq, where the government is pushing for greater American involvement in its fight against ISIS? U.S. officials assert the coalition has killed more than 6,000 ISIS fighters since the start of the campaign. That's a significant loss when you consider that ISIS currently has a core force of 9,000 to 18,000 fighters, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. U.S. officials also estimate that ISIS can also draw on manpower from other militant groups to bulk up to a force of around 30,000. Gen, Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command who oversees the campaign against ISIS, said last week that as a result of the campaign of airstrikes the group is developing a ""manpower issue."" Balanced against this, however, is the fact ISIS continues to recruit at a fast clip. In October, U.S. officials estimated that there were around 1,000 recruits joining ISIS per month from overseas. Underlining the importance of that steady flow of ISIS recruits, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, said last week that since the Syrian war began over three years ago, ""more than 19,000 foreign fighters from 90 different countries have traveled to Syria and Iraq."" So if the CENTCOM campaign is killing around 1,200 ISIS fighters a month and yet ISIS continues -- at least for the moment -- to recruit an estimated 1,000 fighters from overseas a month, the campaign against them has succeeded only to a modest degree. Hagel told CNN's Barbara Starr last week it might be necessary to send noncombat American troops to help Iraqi troops on the front lines to fight ISIS. ""We have to look at all the options, and I think it may require a forward deployment of some of our troops -- not doing the fighting, not doing the combat work that we did at one time for six years in Iraq and we did for many, many years in Afghanistan, but to help airstrike precision (locate targets),"" he told Starr. Indeed, the introduction of American forward air controllers to call in precise U.S. airstrikes and of U.S. Special Forces embedded with Iraqi units on the front lines will ultimately be necessary if the goal of American policy is to defeat ISIS, rather than simply playing for a draw with the group, which is, de facto, the current Obama administration policy. On Friday, ISIS launched a surprise attack on Kirkuk in northern Iraq, the largely Kurdish city that is a key to Iraq's oil production. The attack appears to be a strategic decision meant to draw Kurdish fighters away from Mosul, ISIS's overall base in Iraq. ISIS has controlled Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, since June, but in the past month, Kurdish forces have closed in around it. Kurdish authorities said last week that they've cut a key supply line to ISIS in Mosul and have taken back some 300 square miles of land around the city from the group. Beyond the Mosul area, ISIS has lost ground in Iraq elsewhere. The  Iraqi army pushed the group out of Diyala province, an important region close to Baghdad as well as more than 1,000 square miles in the Sinjar region in eastern Iraq. Further, a number of ISIS's leaders have been killed in U.S. airstrikes. And in Syria last week, ISIS lost control of Kobani, a small town on the Syrian-Turkish border where many of the US-led airstrikes have been concentrated. But overall, ISIS is maintaining its ground in Syria in spite of those airstrikes. At least one-third of Syria is under ISIS's control. A number of estimates suggest that ISIS controls a population of around 8 million people in Iraq and Syria. ISIS calls itself the Islamic State and while this may seem a tad pretentious it makes more sense when you realize the group presently lords over a population around the size of the population of Switzerland. Militants gain new allies despite setbacks . At the same time, ISIS's influence keeps growing around the Muslim world. In the past six months, ISIS has drawn into its fold some dozen militant groups from Algeria to Pakistan. These affiliates aren't wasting any time in carrying out attacks in the name of ISIS. On January 27, gunmen claiming to be affiliated with ISIS attacked the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, which is favored by government officials and foreigners. They killed 10 people after storming into the lobby and firing guns at hotel guests. Five of the victims were foreigners, one an American. Two days later, at least 32 people were killed in a series of attacks on soldiers and police in Sinai in eastern Egypt. The terrorist group known as the Province of Sinai has claimed responsibility for the attacks and had pledged allegiance to ISIS in November. ISIS has recently claimed even more recruits, as it moved into new territory in Yemen, competing there with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). A Yemeni official who spoke to CNN in January said that the AQAP cadre still significantly outnumbers those in ISIS, but the move into Yemen is significant for the group as it a country where al Qaeda has maintained a presence for more than a decade. Similarly, in Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand, a cell of more than 300 fighters loyal to ISIS is led by a former Taliban commander, Mullah Abdul Rauf Khadim. Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting. The perks they get in return for waving the black flag of ISIS include affiliation with the fastest-growing terrorist group on the planet and a bustling propaganda machine with a strong social media network. From Afghanistan to Libya, militant groups who once would have looked to al Qaeda for guidance now look to ISIS. The best way to begin to reverse this is to cripple ISIS in Iraq, where the group has shown itself to be the most adept terrorist group of the modern era, taking control of cities like Mosul, whose population numbers 1.5 million people. Urban warfare is the hardest kind of warfare and it's hard to imagine that the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces will successfully pull off retaking Mosul on their own. Winning Mosul back from ISIS will be much more likely if the there are American air controllers calling in close air support strikes against ISIS positions and U.S. Special Forces working side by side with Iraqi units. Of course, there are risks associated with this. U.S. troops may be killed or injured, but there are also risks associated with the fact that the longer ISIS controls vast swaths of the Middle East, more and more foreign fighters will pour in from Western countries for training with the group and some will seek to bring their skills home to attack the West.","Bergen: Five months after Obama pledged to destroy ISIS, it still controls large territory and attracts support.
He says Chuck Hagel may be right, that U.S. military may need to be near front lines ."
"A small group of masked protesters stormed Hong Kong's government headquarters in the early hours of Wednesday, using metal barricades and hurling concrete slabs to smash through a glass door. Other protesters charged police lines, leading to police to respond with pepper spray and batons. In a statement, the government denounced the acts of the protesters, referring to them repeatedly as ""violent radicals."" It said six people were arrested, and vowed ""further arrests would be made."" The break-in was an uncharacteristically aggressive action by protesters in a movement that has frequently been praised for its politeness. In the previous seven weeks of demonstrations, not a single window of any building had been broken. Pro-democracy legislator Fernando Cheung, who tried to physically stop the protesters, said it was a ""major setback for the movement."" ""I threw myself in front of them, I told them this would only hurt the movement, that this whole campaign is about demanding genuine democracy which has nothing to do with breaking into Legislative Council,"" he told CNN. ""I understand they wanted to scale up the action, but they didn't understand that that would only destroy the campaign."" Occupy Central for Love and Peace, the group that originated the idea for occupying downtown Hong Kong, now nicknamed the ""Umbrella Movement"" said it ""strongly condemned"" the attack on the complex. ""We urge participants of the Umbrella Movement to remember our original intention, to persist in non-violent resistance,"" it said in an emailed statement. Student leaders, who didn't take part in the incident, blamed poor communication between protesters. ""The act last night didn't coordinate well... even the occupiers disagree with the act,"" Hong Kong Federation of Students leader Alex Chow told CNN. Some members of Hong Kong's popular online forums, frustrated by the protracted stalemate, put out calls for protesters to storm the government building late Tuesday night. The incident came after a section of the main protest site was cleared Tuesday morning following a court injunction that allowed bailiffs to remove barricades outside one office tower. Hong Kong's Legislative Council said it would reschedule its meetings and canceled public tours for the day.

"Atlanta (CNN)Whitney Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is on a ventilator and in intensive care, after she was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family said. Brown, 21, was placed in a medically induced coma and the status of her brain function won't be known until the sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. ""It is going to be a waiting game,"" said the source. Brown ""was not breathing"" when a man identified as her husband found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell, Georgia. He called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. The spokeswoman said when Brown was found, she was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" In scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ""ECHO-level response"" -- urgent and life threatening -- with ""possible cardiac arrest."" ""Twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub, facedown.  PD's (police department's) en route."" Brown was taken to a local hospital, where ""she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,"" Holland said Saturday. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland said. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: ""Her mother died in the very same manner."" Three years ago, Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton on February 11, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash. An autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned facedown in ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ""She encourages me and inspires me,"" Houston once said of her daughter. ""When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'OK. I can do this. I can do this.'"" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Bobby Brown requested privacy in a statement issued Sunday by his lawyer, who said that Brown was at the hospital with his daughter. ""Please allow for my family to deal with this matter and give my daughter the love and support she needs at this time,"" Bobby Brown said. Mother and daughter performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was ""overwhelmed,"" family friend Kim Burrell said. ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own,"" which followed her life after Houston's death. One of that reality show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon. And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove."" ""(Houston) made me promise several times to look after Krissy ... and, Mom, I will never ever, ever break that promise,"" Gordon told the entertainment show ""Extra"" afterward, saying Houston ""just treated me like she gave birth to me."" It was unclear whether Gordon came home Saturday morning to find his wife in the bathtub or had been in another part of the house overnight, Holland said. Police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house, but that's standard procedure, she said. Concern for Brown surged again after news broke. Music director Michael Bearden sent along ""healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend."" Songwriter Diane Warren tweeted, ""I hope Bobbi Kristina gets the help she needs."" ""Poor thing,"" Warren wrote. ""Almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her.""

"(CNN)Morocco has been banned from the 2017 and 2019 Africa Cup of Nations tournaments after it decided not to host the 2015 edition amid fears over the Ebola crisis. The country's football federation has also been fined $1 million and ordered to pay $9.1 million ""for damages caused to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and partners."" Its officials had called for the tournament to be delayed as concerns over the potential spread of the virus grew, and then declined to host it when that delay was not granted. That led to the CAF banning it from taking part in the 2015 event after Equatorial Guinea had stepped in as host nation -- and African football's governing body has now imposed further, sweeping sanctions. In November, only two months before the tournament was due to be played, Morocco's Sports Minister Mohamed Ouzzine informed CAF that the North African country would continue to ask for a postponement of at least six months. Although there had been no diagnosed case of Ebola in Morocco, officials said the call for a postponement was ""dictated by health reasons of the most dangerous kind, linked to the serious risk of the spread of the deadly Ebola pandemic."" The government believed thousands of traveling fans from West Africa posed a potential health hazard, although CAF countered by saying it believed less than 1,000 would travel from that region worst affected by the illness. In a statement, the CAF executive committee said it ""took action on the refusal of Morocco to host this competition as scheduled and agreed."" The statement added: ""Morocco had based its request to postpone the tournament on allegations ""of the highest health risk."" Morocco cited the outbreak of the Ebola virus as a case of force majeure in justifying its request for postponement, citing in particular the risk of contamination of its population because of anticipated fans' flows. ""The executive committee considered that, contrary to what the Royal Moroccan Football Federation cited, force majeure cannot be accepted for the benefit of the federation."" Meanwhile, the CAF has fined Equatorial Guinea $100,000 (£65,000) after crowd trouble marred Thursday's Cup of Nations semifinal defeat to Ghana. The governing body also imposed a suspended punishment, ruling that the tournament hosts would have to play a match behind closed doors if there was any repeat of the problems at this weekend's third-place playoff against DR Congo. It said Equatorial Guinea must pay for the treatment of the 36 fans injured in the clashes, which broke out during the closing stages of Ghana's 3-0 win at the Estadio de Malabo in Equatorial Guinea. Officials stopped the game after 82 minutes, with Ghana fans having gathered behind one goal as they attempted to get away from missiles being hurled by Equatorial Guinea supporters. With Ghana leading 3-0 through goals from Jordan Ayew, Wakasu Mubarak and Andre Ayew, the players were told to stand in the middle of the pitch as they awaited a decision on whether the game could continue. A police helicopter hovered over the stadium before it was eventually decided that the match would be completed, and Ghana went on to seal their place in Sunday's final against Ivory Coast. Trouble had threatened to boil over earlier on, with missiles thrown at Ghana players as they headed down the tunnel at half-time and the atmosphere in the stands souring as several decisions went against the home team. A CAFstatement said its disciplinary panel had imposed the fine for ""aggressive behavior and being repeat offenders"" after supporters had thrown missiles at Tunisia players following Equatorial Guinea's dramatic victory in the AFCON last eight. ""At least 36 people injured were identified by the medical teams present at the stadium following the incidents that marred the game,"" the statement said. ""All the injured were supported and attended to on site. A total of 14 were transferred to hospital units for further investigations, with one case requiring close monitoring.""","Country opted not to host 2015 edition amid fears over Ebola crisis .

"Investigators thought Jose Martinez may have had something to do with the shooting of an Alabama man, found dead by hunters on a forest's edge. Little did they know. The 52-year-old Californian confessed to pulling the trigger in that March killing, the Lawrence County, Alabama, Sheriff's Office announced Thursday. He didn't stop there: Martinez also admitted killing more than 30 men in all, much like he did Jose Ruiz. ""Killing people doesn't seem to affect him,"" sheriff's Capt. Tim McWhorder said. As of Thursday, authorities had identified 13 violent deaths linked to Martinez since his admission. At least 10 of those occurred in California, according to McWhorder. He's also been tied -- by a DNA match to a cigarette butt found inside a victim's truck -- to a 2006 double homicide in Ocala, Florida, the Marion County, Florida, Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday. Martinez explained that his record of violence has to do with his job as an enforcer for Mexican drug cartels. A U.S. citizen, he'd be called when someone hadn't lived up to their obligations. As he told investigators, ""I'm the guy that pays you a visit if you don't pay."" Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . The killing of Jose Ruiz, though, was personal, authorities say. As McWhorder explained, the two had entered into ""some type of business arrangement"" in Alabama, where Ruiz lived in Decatur and Martinez had family. While working together, Ruiz bad-mouthed the girlfriend of another man, Jamie Romero, calling her names and ""a bad woman."" Apparently, he didn't know that Romero's girlfriend was also Martinez's daughter. That happened in January. Stewing on it for two months, Martinez returned to Alabama having ""made up his mind he was going to kill him,"" McWhorder said. That's what authorities now believe happened. All three men -- Ruiz, Romero and Martinez -- drove in Romero's truck to the outskirts of Bankhead National Forest. Ruiz didn't make it out alive. Authorities found evidence linking Romero to the death and arrested him a few days later. Romero said that earlier on the day of Ruiz's death, he'd been with Martinez. When investigators questioned him, Martinez admitted he'd been with Romero that day but denied having anything to do with that killing, according to the Lawrence County Sheriff's Office. As rumors swirled, and the investigation went forward, authorities came to believe Martinez had lied. An arrest warrant was issued for him, and he was picked up in Yuma, Arizona, just over the border from Mexico, where McWhorder said he'd been visiting family. The sheriff's captain said authorities now believe ""that Romero may not have known that the murder was going to take place."" On June 3, Martinez was brought back to Alabama and charged with felony murder in Ruiz's death. That's where he was Wednesday, in Lawrence County Jail, after a judge ordered him held without bail. More charges, and more answers, may be coming as authorities probe his possible connection to more killings from coast to coast.

"CIA Director John Brennan apologized to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday and admitted the agency spied on computers used by its staffers who prepared an investigation of the controversial post 9/11 CIA interrogation and detention program. The episode was the subject of an unusual, public dispute between the panel and the spy agency over access to classified information. The CIA had accused the committee staffers of getting access to internal agency documents and of improperly handling classified material. The Justice Department looked into it at the request of the CIA and decided there wasn't enough evidence of a crime to warrant further investigation. IG weighs in . But the CIA's inspector general, a watchdog, found that some agency employees ""acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding"" reached between the intelligence panel and the CIA in 2009 regarding access to information, the CIA said in a statement. ""The director subsequently informed the (committee) chairman and vice chairman of the findings and apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the (inspector general's) report,"" the statement said. ""The director is committed to correcting any shortcomings related to this matter"" and is commissioning an Accountability Board to be chaired by former Indiana Democratic senator and Intelligence Committee member Evan Bayh, the CIA said. ""This board will review the (inspector general's) report, conduct interviews as needed, and provide the director with recommendations that, depending on its findings, could include potential disciplinary measures and/or steps to address systemic issues."" the CIA added. The intelligence panel report could be released to the public as soon as next week, congressional sources from each party said this week. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican of Georgia and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he was disappointed by the whole thing. ""Obviously this is a very serious situation and these are serious violations. The individuals who breached the (committee) computer, I think, are going to have to be dealt with, I think, very harshly by the CIA,"" he said. ""But it's in the director's hands."" Report to be released . The document is a nearly 700-page summary of the full 6,800-page report that was approved a year and a half ago by the committee, which was sharply divided along party lines. Senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the CIA's treatment of terrorism suspects saying it amounted to torture, something CIA officials have denied. It also finds that harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future attacks as many in intelligence community have claimed. The documents that prompted the dispute related to an internal review by former CIA Director Leon Panetta and, according to the agency, were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee for its investigation of the program. The documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee, according to the CIA. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said Senate staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error, and that they corroborated some of the committee's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with. She said committee staff routinely sees such documents and didn't violate any classified restrictions.","CIA Director John Brennan apologized for incident involving intelligence panel .

"(CNN)There's only one way to start an interview with Joan Fontcuberta. Why, I ask him, should I believe a word he says? ""I like that question,"" says the pre-eminent Spanish conceptual artist, when we meet in the café at London's Science Museum. ""I believe that doubting is the first step to rational knowledge. Not doubting implies submission, which is dangerous."" If truth be told, there are more reasons to doubt Fontcuberta than anyone else. After all, this is the man who has pranked, dodged and bamboozled his way to the top of the art world. Fake files . In 1987, in an exhibition called Fauna, he pretended that he had stumbled across the hidden archives of a German zoologist called Dr Peter Ameisenhaufen, which contained samples of animals previously unknown to science. Ten years later, he convinced the world that a Russian cosmonaut had been lost in space in 1967, and the disappearance covered up. The hoax fooled Spanish TV, which reported it as fact before realizing that the cosmonaut's name, Ivan Istochnikov, was a Russian translation of the artist's own name. And at the age of 59, the diminutive, bearded Fontcuberta has lost none of his enthusiasm for ""playing with conceptions of authority"". Last month he pretended to ""curate"" an exhibition in Paris called the Trepat Collection, which mixed genuine photographs from the Forties and Fifties with his own pastiche, passing it all off as a single archive. From now to November, the Science Museum -- that bastion of empiricism -- is hosting a major retrospective exhibition of Fontcuberta's work, entitled Stranger than Fiction. It starts with taxidermy, including a squirrel with a snake's tail and a winged goat; moves on to photographs of ""constellations"" that are actually specks of dust on a car windscreen; and ends with pictures of the artist himself performing ""miracles"", such as levitation, in the garb of a Christian monk. The exhibition is visually arresting, subversively humorous, and infernally clever. It is also deeply unsettling. So what is it about Fontcuberta that makes him so intent on fooling the world? Explosive moment . ""When I was 13, I was experimenting in chemistry and I blew up my hand,"" he says, sipping espresso. ""I was interested in testing things, and was building rockets with gunpowder. Pyrotechnical stuff. It was wonderful, very effective. But one Sunday my parents were away traveling, and I was alone with my cousin. ""And I blew up my hand. ""Psychologically, this was very strong. It changed my whole life. I started hiding my hand so people didn't see my problem, which produced very complex human relationships. Life became about multiple truths."" Because of his damaged hand, he continues, he was excluded from military service, giving him ""time to play with photography"". As he couldn't handle the camera quickly, photojournalism was out. So he became a ""meditative photographic artist"". He shows me the stump of his left index finger. I am skeptical. He has told other journalists that he lost his finger while building a ""homemade bomb"". Is he taking me for a ride -- or them? (Or has this interview made me paranoid?) ""Well, you could consider it a bomb,"" he says. ""Half and half. I used to make explosive artifacts and throw them out of the window. I also did underwater explosives with sodium. I made miniature submarines and ships, and blew them up with mines."" The world of Joan Fontcuberta is strange indeed. Propaganda machine . Bombs and rockets aside, it was the political climate in which he came of age that informed Fontcuberta's career. Prior to 1975, Franco ruled Spain as a dictatorship. The climate of repression and the ubiquity of propaganda in Fontcuberta's childhood led him to a preoccupation with challenging authority in all its forms. ""Franco is no longer the enemy, but to me he was just one particular historical manifestation of authoritarianism,"" he says. ""I struggle against every type of authority, in religion, science, politics, and art. I don't believe in hierarchies."" Does that make him a Socialist? ""I am a bizarre combination of socialism with anarchy thrown in,"" he says. ""But I'm also a pragmatist. I recognize that a representative democracy is necessary. But it has risks, and we must keep paying attention to the system. That's why I call myself an anarchist. I'm trying to fix the problems of authoritarianism that might occur in a representative democracy."" An irreverent eye . He illustrates this by citing photography. Documentary photojournalism, he says, is valuable as an ""eye in the distance"", showing people things to which they otherwise would never be exposed. His role is that of the ""oculist"", ensuring that the eye remains accurate by questioning the veracity of what it shows us. Religion is a favorite target. Although he was brought up a Catholic, as a teenager he experimented with Zen and other alternative religions, before becoming a committed agnostic. ""The reason I often joke about religious belief is that it brings us to dogma, and to me dogma is stupidity,"" he says. ""I don't agree with faith. I think we should keep a questioning mind."" So what next for Fontcuberta? ""I have lots of ideas and not enough time,"" he says. ""People often get angry with me, and accuse me of being a liar. But I never lie. I just create ambiguities and encourage people to question things."" He sighs, and drains his coffee. ""My mother is always warning me that one day I will finish in jail. But I have more trust in humanity than that."" Joan Fontcuberta: Stranger than Fiction is showing at the Science Museum, London, from 23 July -- 9 November 2014 . Touch it, you know you want to.

"A friend of the man who inspired the viral ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" died this weekend in a diving accident. An off-duty lifeguard happened to be nearby and recovered Corey Griffin, 27, from the bottom of the harbor, police in Nantucket, Massachusetts, said in a statement. He was transported to an area hospital and was pronounced dead early Saturday morning. The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. According to CNN affiliate WCVB, Griffin died within hours of raising $100,000 for an ALS charity. ""Helping out was nothing new for Griff. He held his own event for me back in 2012, just a few months after diagnosis. He worked his butt off these last few weeks for ALS. We texted everyday, planning and scheming ways to raise funds and plan events,"" Pete Frates posted on his Facebook account. Frates, a former baseball player at Boston College, has been living with ALS since 2012. He floated the idea of the challenge and his former teammates, as well as other Boston-area athletes, took him up on it. It was noticed and covered by local media and that attention, along with the social Web's viral nature, launched it onto a much larger stage. Athletes, celebrities and politicians, as well as everyday folks, have gotten in on the act. The idea is simple: dump a bucket of ice cold water over your head, then challenge a friend, or friends, to either do the same or donate money to the ALS Association. And it's making a difference. The ALS Association reports that it received $13.3 million in donations from July 29 to August 17, compared to $1.7 million during the same time last year.

"(CNN)A deadly storm that brought Chicago its snowiest February day on record is now delivering more winter weather to the Northeast. Boston declared a snow emergency and banned on-street parking amid predictions of up to 14 inches of snow in parts of Massachusetts. New Yorkers were told to be prepared for roads and sidewalks to turn icy as temperatures plummet. Back in the Midwest, scores of schools closed as Chicago coped with the effects of more than 18 inches of snow. Many roads remained snow-covered early Monday, the National Weather Service said. ""We don't have this much snow in Alaska right now,"" CNN affiliate WLS quoted Chicago visitors Emma Marks and Daniel Dobbs as saying. The city got as much snow Sunday as it had in all of January, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. In Omaha, Nebraska, wet, heavy snow tested even heavy-duty snow blowers, CNN affiliate KETV reported. ""It kept coming and coming and coming,"" the station quoted Frank Halpine of Omaha as saying. Authorities say at least 10 people have died as a result of the storm, including one in Michigan, two in New York, two in Wisconsin and one in Pennsylvania. The other four deaths were described in detail. In Weymouth, Massachusetts, on Monday, a 57-year old pedestrian died after she was struck by a snowplow, according to Norfolk district attorney spokesman David Traub. The accident occurred at a condominium complex, and the incident is under investigation. Two people died in car accidents in Nebraska as a result of slippery roads Sunday. The deaths occurred in Saunders and Lancaster counties, authorities said. In Ohio, Toledo police Officer Michael Greenwood died while shoveling snow at home Sunday, a police spokesman said. In the Northeast, winter storm warnings covered parts of several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. Flights were canceled, schools closed and traffic snarled in the region. Boston was expecting as much as a foot of snow. Schools were closed Monday and Tuesday, and officials urged residents to use public transportation to get to work if they had to go out at all. As of early Monday afternoon, nearly 10 inches had already fallen, setting a new seven-day snowfall record with 34.2 inches. The storm led Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to postpone a celebratory parade for the New England Patriots, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday night. The parade, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, will now happen on Wednesday, he said in a statement. In New York, little additional accumulation was expected. But rainy, slushy conditions were expected to turn icy when temperatures fall Monday afternoon, according to CNN meteorologists. ""We would expect a lot of icing on our roads and sidewalks -- up to a quarter-inch of ice in some places, and a lot of that would happen in the early morning hours,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned. Pennsylvania groundhog Punxsutawney Phil didn't have to suffer the snow, but still forecast six more weeks of winter at his annual Groundhog Day appearance. Legend has it that if Phil sees his shadow,  there will be six more weeks of winter weather. If he doesn't, there will be an early spring. Nan Moore, who was visiting Punxsutawney to witness the prediction, correctly predicted the rodent's forecast. ""He's going to see his shadow,"" she said. ""We're going to get more winter."" Airlines did not wait for a groundhog's prediction to plan. More than 3,700 Monday flights were canceled, according to Flightaware.com. United, Delta, American, Virgin America, U.S. Airways, Southwest, Spirit and JetBlue all issued waivers that allow travelers to change flights without a penalty. The air travel headache started over the weekend, with thousands of  flights canceled Sunday, many of them in and out of Chicago. In preparation for the storm, Amtrak said it plans to adjust its schedule based on the weather. ""With extreme conditions expected in some areas during the next 24 to 36 hours, crews are actively monitoring the latest forecasts and planning for the possibility that service adjustments may be necessary,"" it said Sunday. There may be changes to Acela Express and Northeast Regional services, Amtrak said. It urged Monday travelers to monitor schedules. ""We will re-evaluate service as conditions warrant,"" the rail service said. Along with Boston and Chicago, the cities of Detroit, Omaha, and the Ohio cities of Akron, Toledo and Cleveland canceled public school Monday, but New York City schools will remain open. CNN's Joe Sutton and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Authorities say at least 10 people have died because of the storm .

"""Big Bang Theory"" fans can breathe a sigh of relief. According to Deadline, the stars of the hit CBS series have agreed to hefty pay increases for the new season. Quoting unnamed sources, the publication reports that Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco have secured three-year deals for ""$1 million per episode for the 72 episodes the show is slated to produce in Seasons 8-10."" According to reports, the trio will also have an increased stake in the show's backend profits. It's been said that the trio previously received more than $300,000 per episode. The Hollywood Reporter confirmed the deal in its story and said co-stars Kunal Nayyar  and Simon Helberg were still in negotiations, but expected to sign a deal soon. Warner Bros. Television told CNN that ""we aren't commenting on the speculation at this time."" Earlier, the company confirmed that ""ongoing contract negotiations"" had caused production on ""The Big Bang Theory's"" eighth season to be postponed. Production had been scheduled to begin July 30 and on  Tuesday the company released a statement saying ""Production on season 8 of 'The Big Bang Theory' will begin Wednesday, August 6, with contract negotiations now having been concluded."" Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company. The new deals would put Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco in the same territory as the former cast of ""Friends,"" who also negotiated for pay raises at the height of their show's popularity. The popular series was renewed in March. Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, who also appear on the show, are reported to have received raises in September.

"Were the missiles that shot down two Ukrainian military planes on Wednesday fired from the Russian side of the border? That's a possibility that U.S. intelligence analysts are investigating, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday. Pro-Russian rebels quickly claimed credit for downing the military planes. And Ukrainian officials claimed the missiles that hit them might have been fired from inside Russia. One thing is clear: Tensions in volatile eastern Ukraine seem to be ratcheting up, less than a week after a missile brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 there. Some of the 12,000-15,000 Russian troops near the eastern Ukraine border have broken up into smaller groups and moved within five miles or less of the border, and some are even positioned right at the border, according to two U.S. officials. The movement gives the Russian troops the ability to fire surface-to-air missiles, rockets and artillery from inside Russia at Ukrainian positions without having to acknowledge their own presence, the U.S. officials said. At the same time, the Russians are continuing to reinforce and ship additional weapons into Ukraine ""while the world's attention is on MH17,"" one U.S. official told CNN. There is also intelligence indicating some rebels have left Ukraine and gone across the border into hiding inside Russia. But the officials said it's not known if any of those people were associated with the shoot-down of MH17. ""What we know is that, incredibly, even after the shootdown of the Malaysia Airlines flight, Russia has persisted in a pattern of destabilization against Ukraine. It's continued to send fighters and heavy weapons, tanks and missile launchers across the Ukrainian border,"" said Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. If it's confirmed that the missiles that brought down the Ukrainian military planes came from the Russian side of the border, Pyatt told CNN, it would be an ""outrageous, continued escalation of the crisis by Russia even after the SA-11 (Russian-made missile system) brought down an airplane, leading to the death of nearly 300 innocent people."" In response to reports that Russia continues to arm rebels in Ukraine, the White House is now looking at expanding sanctions on Moscow. Just last week, President Obama announced the U.S. would impose new sanctions on specific targets in Russia's critical energy, banking, and defense industries. But Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters gathered at the White House that the United States might go even further. ""We're continuing to develop our own set of options. The fact is that Russia continues to arm separatists. And so we think there needs to be continuing ratcheting up,"" Rhodes told reporters. Putin under pressure . It's unclear whether Wednesday's shootdown was the work of pro-Russian rebels inside Ukraine, or Russian forces themselves -- and whether Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about or approved the operation. For months, Putin has accused NATO of building its forces in the region to threaten Russia. ""The scale of the training and preparedness is also increasing,"" Putin said recently. ""It is important to prepare our defenses on schedule."" As calls mount from the United States and other Western countries for more stringent sanctions against Russia, Putin took a more conciliatory tone in his most recent public statement. ""There are calls for us to influence the militants,"" he said earlier this week. ""We will do everything in our power."" Jill Dougherty, a Russia expert and CNN's former Moscow bureau chief, said Putin is facing enormous pressure both from the international community and domestically. Business elites are pushing to avoid more sanctions, and Russian nationalists want the country to be tougher on Ukraine. ""You can almost see it, his balancing, he does this when he talks,"" Dougherty said. ""He is a judo expert. And he is prepared, he's ready to parry, thrust and protect Russia from what he expects are going to be the threats."" Ukraine: Pilots ejected after planes were hit . An air defense system shot down the Ukrainian jets Wednesday after the pilots completed a task in Dmytrivka, a village in Ukraine's Donetsk region near the border with Russia, the Ukrainian military's press office said. The jets' pilots ejected from the planes after they were hit, the military said. Information on their condition wasn't immediately available. Sergei Kavtaradze, an aide to rebel leader Alexander Borodai, the Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told CNN that the two jets had been shot down by rebel fighters using a shoulder-fired missile system. But Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said preliminary information suggested the missiles might have been launched from inside Russia. The planes were flying at an altitude of 5,200 meters (17,000 feet) when they were hit, he said. News of the jets' downing Wednesday comes six days after the deadly crash of the civilian passenger plane Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have previously accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down several military aircraft. In the week leading up to the July 17 crash of MH17, Ukrainian officials said an Antonov An-26 transport plane and a Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet had been brought down. The Ukrainian military said the missile that struck the Su-25 had been fired from Russian territory. The latest reported shootdown highlights the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions between the rebels and Ukrainian security forces. A CNN team on the ground in Donetsk was turned away by rebel fighters at the entrance to the town of Snizhne, near Dmytrivka. The militants said they had orders not to allow people to travel farther because of fighting. A jet could be heard passing periodically very high overhead, while on the ground, ambulances rushed past, as did a convoy of rebel fighters in civilian vans and cars. Claim and counterclaim . The first caskets carrying remains of the crash victims arrived in the Netherlands on Wednesday, where they were met by family members, Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima and other dignitaries. About two-thirds of the 298 victims were Dutch. As the solemn tribute continued, accusations did not stop. Meanwhile, the finger-pointing continues over who was responsible for bringing down Flight MH17, a Boeing 777. U.S. officials say pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down that plane, but they say they now believe it's likely the rebels didn't know it was a commercial airliner, U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday. However, Vitaly Nayda, Ukraine's director of informational security, told CNN's Kyung Lah that the person who shot down the flight was ""absolutely"" a Russian. ""A Russian-trained, well-equipped, well-educated officer ... pushed that button deliberately,"" he said. Moscow has denied claims that it pulled the trigger. And Russian Army Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov suggested a Ukrainian jet fighter may have shot the plane down. Ukraine's government rejects that claim.","Observers say Putin is under pressure at home and abroad .

"Pope Francis has accepted the invitation of Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput to attend the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia next year, Catholic News Service reported Friday. It would be the popular pontiff's first visit to the United States as Pope. The news service, the official publication of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Chaput made the announcement Thursday before giving his homily during the opening Mass of the Tekakwitha Conference in Fargo, North Dakota. ""Pope Francis has told me that he is coming,"" said the archbishop as he invited his fellow Native Americans to the celebration being held in Philadelphia on September 22-27, 2015. Francis has received invitations to visit other places in the United States as well, which he is considering, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told Catholic News Service. Those invitations include New York, the United Nations and Washington. In a statement, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said official confirmation from the Vatican for the trip will likely be given about six months before the World Meeting of Families. ""Archbishop Chaput has frequently shared his confidence in Pope Francis' attendance at the World Meeting and his personal conversations with the Holy Father are the foundation for that confidence,"" the archdiocese said. ""While Archbishop Chaput's comments do not serve as official confirmation, they do serve to bolster our sincere hope that Philadelphia will welcome Pope Francis next September,"" the archdiocese added. The Vatican, which does not typically confirm papal trips until several months before their scheduled date, said the Pope has ""indicated his willingness"" to visit Philadelphia but has not made ""concrete plans"" yet. ""Keep in mind that we are still one year away from the Philadelphia meeting,"" Lombardi said in a statement on Friday. A visit by Francis, the first Pope from Latin America, would resonate with the nation's growing Latin American population. ""The Hispanic population is growing in the United States, and with the vast majority being Catholic, having the first Pope from Latin America come to visit will be very exciting,"" said Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois. Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, said a U.S. visit by the Argentinian Pope would be symbolically powerful for Latinos -- many of whom have slipped away from the Catholic Church for evangelical sects. ""Latino Catholics have probably seen themselves less reflected in the hierarchy than their numbers might mirror,"" Suro told CNN. ""There are more Latino bishops now than a few years ago, but the American hierarchy still reflects the old Catholic Church dominated by the Irish and, to a certain extent, Italians and other people of European origins,"" he said. ""Having a Latin American pope who is going to be speaking native Spanish to Latinos in the United States will be the first time they see themselves reflected so powerfully in the church hierarchy."" The U.N. General Assembly generally meets in September, leading to speculation that Francis might combine the Philadelphia trip with a stop in New York to address the United Nations.

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry is scheduled to be in court on Friday, but he won't be there. Instead, he'll be testing the waters for a possible presidential run. Three days after being fingerprinted and having his mug shot taken following his indictment, Perry will begin a series of visits to critical presidential nominating states - a strong indication that the Texas Republican won't let felony charges get in the way of his political ambition. ""The governor is not required to appear on Friday and will maintain his previously scheduled events,"" said Perry spokesman Lucy Nashed. Perry heads to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state, on Friday for a six-stop tour. On his itinerary is a Manchester event hosted by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity as well as a state GOP rally in Stratham. He'll be in South Carolina, the first-in-the-South primary state, the following week where he'll take in a big football game between his alma mater, Texas A&M, and the University of South Carolina. Perry defiant at courthouse . Then Perry continues his tour of appealing to key conservatives when he joins other potential presidential contenders, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, at an AFP summit in Dallas. His aggressive travel schedule comes as Perry enters the final stretch of his third full term in Austin. Perry isn't running for re-election, and it's widely expected he'll continue laying groundwork for a possible second run for president once he leaves his perch in January. Perry was indicted last week on counts alleging coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. The charges relate to his handling of a political controversy involving a county prosecutor. The case centers on Perry's veto in June 2013 of $7.5 million approved by the Legislature to fund a public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat. He wanted her out, following a drunk-driving arrest. She refused to leave. ""I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing that the actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right,"" Perry told reporters. Perry and his team of lawyers are framing the indictment as a political attack, and they've been successful in drawing up support from Republicans. Even David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, called the charges ""pretty sketchy."" Dante Scala, political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said Perry may get a bit of a boost from the attention as he hits the road. But she argued that the Texas Republican still has a lot of work to do to repair damage from his last presidential bid. ""Conservatives might be willing to say he's a victim of partisan politics, but that doesn't mean he's a much better candidate than they already thought,"" Scala said. ""That was the problem before his indictment and it's the problem after his indictment."" There's no frontrunner in the 2016 GOP primary, with no potential candidates polling above 20% in recent surveys. A McClatchy/Marist poll conducted this month before the indictment showed that 7% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents backed Perry. None of the 10 candidates asked about in the poll surpassed the 13% mark, and 23% of respondents were undecided.","Rick Perry won't be in court Friday for his indictment .

"After three years of avoiding it, President Barack Obama finds himself being pushed toward military action in Syria. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey both made clear that defeating Islamic State jihadists' rampage through northern Iraq would require going after them in neighboring Syria. ""That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border,"" Dempsey told reporters Thursday. On Friday, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the administration was looking beyond the current airstrikes within Iraq's borders. ""If we see plotting against Americans, see a threat to the United States emanating from anywhere, we stand ready to take action against that threat,"" Rhodes told reporters. The United States is already gathering intelligence on the locations of ISIS leadership and troops in Syria, two U.S. officials said. Separately, U.S. officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in Iraq and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside Syria against ISIS targets. ISIS savagery . The ISIS fighters are helping Obama make his case with their savagery, which includes mass killings, abductions and other atrocities, such as the video-taped beheading of captured American journalist James Foley. Brother: 'More ... could have been done' to save James Foley . But the President, who has declined to arm rebels fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, faces a policy change certain to embolden critics in both parties of his reticence back then. Obama had avoided what he called reckless interventions of the past, particularly the Iraq War, launched by his predecessor. Critics could argue that Obama's decision to previously keep out of the Syrian conflict contributed to ISIS' growth. His former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has distanced herself from him on Syria strategy during his first term as she prepares for a possible presidential run in 2016. Legal barrier evaporated . The Obama administration has acknowledged sending U.S. forces into Syria earlier this year in a failed attempt to free Foley. That established a precedent of acting in Syria to protect U.S. citizens and interests, superseding any legal considerations such as being asked by the host government to enter, argued Frederic Hof, Obama's former point man on Syria. ""There's a pretty good possibility that we and/or some kind of multinational effort will engage in hitting ISIS targets inside Syria,"" he said. Iraq escalation . Obama already escalated U.S. military involvement in Iraq to combat ISIS less than three years after ending a lengthy war there. In June, he sent military advisers to work with Iraqi and Kurdish forces against the lightning ISIS sweep through the north. Earlier this month, the President authorized limited airstrikes on ISIS targets and sent additional advisers to Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and minority groups threatened by the Sunni extremists. Hagel emphasized the ISIS threat on Thursday. ""They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded,"" he told reporters. ""This is beyond anything that we've seen."" Broad-based approach . Hagel and Dempsey also said that defeating ISIS requires a broad-based approach that includes forging an international coalition and better governance in Iraq and Syria to build public opposition to the extremists. ""Political reform will make it harder for (ISIS) to exploit sectarian divisions,"" Hagel said. The United States and other powers will shore up Iraq at the same time. The United States should build a coalition against ISIS that includes regional countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Jordan that can contribute air power -- much of it provided by America, Hof said. ""All agree at some level or another that ISIS presents a threat,"" he noted. Risky move . U.S. bombs exploding in Syria also would allow Islamic extremists to argue that America remains an imperialist bully. That could play into ISIS' hands. ""You have an adversary that is so proud of its accomplishments and so driven by its ideology that they want to appear on the world stage as our peer,"" said Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official. Strikes could boost their fund raising and recruiting. At the same time, Mudd says, if the United States wants to really hurt ISIS, it has to strike at its base -- which is Syria. But that also could empower al-Assad, who has long dismissed the uprising against his leadership as a fight against terrorists, Hof said. Until now, al-Assad has allowed ISIS to grow in Syria because it joins his government in fighting the anti-government forces. However, ISIS fighters have taken over rebel-held territory and even some government-held areas, causing al-Assad to launch airstrikes against them in some places. Al-Assad's strategy . ""This is basically two criminal gangs who often in effect collaborate but now have a difference over real money over who controls oil fields and the like,"" Hof said of the relationship between al-Assad and ISIS. Wiping out the Syrian opposition would leave only ISIS and al-Assad, who would then position himself to the West as the lesser of two evils and an ally in fighting the jihadists, Hof said. American public opinion . Intervention abroad has become unpopular with many Americans, weary from long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama ""needs to reassure people that this effort does not presage boots on the ground or some kind of repeat of the Iraq experience,"" Hof said. Rhodes called Obama ""very deliberate toward the use of force."" ""The American people also understand that there's some threats that have to be dealt with,"" he said. Who is the ISIS? Where are they?","The U.S. is gathering intel on the locations of ISIS leadership in Syria, officials say .

"Moscow (CNN)More than 1 million historic documents have been destroyed in a fire at one of Russia's largest public libraries, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The Russian emergency situations ministry says 147 firefighters struggled for 25 hours over the weekend to put out the blaze in the main library of the Institute for Research Information on Social Sciences in Moscow. The fire, which ripped through the library Friday evening, destroyed 2,000 square meters (about 2,400 square yards) of the building and caused part of the roof to collapse, according to an official statement. The Russian emergency situations ministry said the fire was particularly hard to put out because of the high temperatures, narrow passageways and the risk of the building falling down. Moscow's emergency ministry said the temperature inside the rubble of the library remains high and that there is still a threat that the building could collapse. Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the fire, which destroyed 15% of all the documents in the library, reminded him of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. ""It's a major loss for science. This is the largest collection of its kind in the world, probably equivalent to the Library of Congress,"" Fortov told the agency. ""It contains material that you can't find anywhere else and all the social science institutions use this library. What has happened here is reminiscent of Chernobyl."" The institute's director, Yuri Pivovarov, told  Tass that he fears the building cannot be restored. Founded in 1918, the library is the biggest social science research center in Russia. Before the fire, it held around 14 million documents in ancient and modern Eastern European languages, including works dating to the 16th century. The emergency situations ministry said it is not yet clear what started the fire, but investigators are looking into whether a short circuit was to blame. A source at Moscow's Interior Ministry told the Russian news agency Tass that the fire spread so quickly because it was not reported quickly enough. No one was in the building but guards at the time of the fire.","Fire reportedly destroys 15% of all documents at one of Russia's largest public libraries .

When fighters from ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, stormed Sinjar over the weekend, the Yazidi minority who call the area home fled into the nearby mountains in fear of their lives. Some of them didn't make it. ""We heard sounds of mortars and in the morning they (Islamic militants) entered Sinjar,"" Zahra Jardo, a Yazidi woman who escaped the violence, told Reuters. ""So we fled to the mountains, and those who stayed there are now suffering from thirst. They have no water. They also took girls and raped them. They said that Yazidis have to be converted to Islam."" The Yazidis, descendants of Kurds who follow an ancient pre-Islamic religion, have only bad options: continue to hide in the Sinjar Mountains and die of thirst, or come down from the mountains and be massacred by the radical Sunni militants who are forcing Islam or death on the communities they overtake as they sweep across Syria and Iraq. Map: Where is ISIS? Dozens of children have already died from dehydration. Women have been taken as slaves, and hundreds of men have been slaughtered. Now many observers fear full-blown genocide if the Yazidis' pleas for help aren't answered soon. Opinion: What chance to Yazidis have against group too brutal for al Qaeda? The only Iraqi lawmaker who represents the Yazidis broke down this week as she described the plight of her people in an Iraqi parliamentary session. ""There is a collective attempt to exterminate the Yazidi people. ... Let's put our political differences aside and work together as human beings,"" Vian Dakhil pleaded to her colleagues through tears. ""In the name of humanity, come to our rescue, come to our rescue."" But that rescue is nowhere in sight, at least for now. Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga, are battling to retake the town of Sinjar from ISIS, but they're being stretched almost to the breaking point by a second ISIS offensive to the east that has driven 200,000 Iraqis from their homes in a mere 48 hours. They fled in anything with wheels, thousands of trucks and cars tearing through the northern Iraqi desert toward the gates of the Kurdish capital of Irbil. The city has been a refuge of safety during the decade-long war that has ripped the country apart. Now that ISIS militants have captured Kurdish towns just 35 miles away, no one is sure how long things will stay that way. Iraqi Yazidi lawmaker: 'Hundreds of my people are being slaughtered' Everyone arriving in Irbil told the same story. Peshmerga soldiers -- badly outgunned by ISIS fighters equipped with American weapons and armored vehicles stolen from Iraq's army -- withdrew from their towns and villages amid the onslaught, and families had just minutes to pack and leave their homes. ""I'm too scared,"" a visibly shaken 22-year-old university student named Andros told CNN's Ivan Watson in Irbil. ""There were a f**king thousand cars, and my father drove a car for six hours -- three hours in the dust and three hours on the road. When we were in the dust, we couldn't see anything, just cars running away. We didn't know where we were going. ""Those people are not people, they're monsters. They're not even monsters; monsters are better. I don't think we can ever go home. It's finished."" Andros and his family are now sleeping in what amounts to a construction site on the outskirts of Irbil. Children mill around their grim new residence, and clotheslines ring the gray, concrete columns inside the unfinished building where hundreds of displaced Iraqi Christians have taken shelter. Opinion: ISIS: Stop it from committing genocide . Across the street from the unfinished building, refugees pack St. Joseph's Church. Mothers comfort young children as elderly women curl up on the floor and in the chapel's pews. Outside, people look for pockets of shade to protect them from the 100-degree heat. An estimated 100,000 Christians have poured into Irbil in two days. The Christians whom CNN's Watson spoke to say they are ready to leave Iraq for good. There's no future for them here, they said, and they don't think they'll ever be able to go home again. ""They took our homes, our money, everything,"" Andros said. Local officials are trying to make sure everyone has food and water, but they're overwhelmed on all fronts. The United States and Britain have pledged additional humanitarian support, and the United Nations said it was preparing a humanitarian corridor to allow Iraqis to flee the chaos in the north. The Kurdish leadership had promised an alarmed public that the Peshmerga would be able to protect Irbil from the militants nearing the city's gates, while at the same time begging the United States to intervene militarily against ISIS. On Friday, with extremist Sunni fighters less than an hour's drive from Irbil, the Kurds got their wish: U.S. fighter jets pounded ISIS artillery positions outside Irbil. Will anyone stop ISIS?

"(CNN)As Japan mourns following the apparent beheading of its journalist by ISIS, thousands of miles away, an anxious Jordan awaits the fate of its pilot. Japanese journalist Kenji Goto went to Syria to tell the stories of lives torn apart by war. He apparently became the latest foreigner killed by ISIS after a video distributed Saturday appears to show his beheaded body. A week earlier, another video had shown Goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow Japanese captive, Haruna Yukawa, apparently beheaded by  ISIS militants as well. Jordan and Japan got caught in the militants' bloody crosshairs last month, when ISIS threatened to kill the two Japanese hostages unless Japan's government paid a ransom of $200 million. Japan balked. The militants revised their offer: Jordan should release female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi. Jordan countered with an offer demanding the release of Muath al-Kassasbeh, a Jordanian military pilot captured in Syria, in exchange for the suicide bomber. The militants have not said if that's a consideration. ISIS said it would kill him if Jordan didn't release al-Rishawi, a convicted terrorist. Despite the counteroffers, the pilot's fate remains unclear, and Jordan says repeated demands for the militants to prove the pilot is still alive have not yielded any results. ISIS militants seized al-Kassasbeh was after his jet crashed  in Syria in December. The 27-year-old holds the rank of lieutenant. Militants say they captured him after he ejected from his crashing F-16 during U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de facto capital, Raqqa. Jordan's role in the coalition is not popular in the nation, adding to the pressure for authorities to secure his release. World leaders condemned ISIS over the weekend as news of the latest apparent beheading spread. ""We are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism, and we denounce it in the strongest terms,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. ""To the terrorists, we will never, never forgive them for this act."" President Barack Obama described it as a ""barbaric act"" and said the United States stands in solidarity with Japan. Unlike the United States, Britain and other allies, Japan is not involved in the military campaign against ISIS. But Japan has been providing humanitarian aid in the Middle East as ISIS continues its bloody quest to solidify an Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria. And Japan said its efforts to provide humanitarian aid won't stop. ""We would like to expand our support for refugees,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. ""We are surely going to have necessary support in terms of not yielding to terrorism."" Goto, 47, left Japan last fall, when his younger daughter was 3 weeks old. His wife, Rinko, first heard from his captors on December 2. On January 20, an ISIS video posted to social media showed Goto and Yukawa dressed in orange, kneeling in front of a masked man dressed in black. In that video, the ISIS militant issued a $200 million ransom demand to Japan  in order to free the two men within 72 hours. That's the same amount of money Abe recently pledged for those ""contending"" with ISIS. Days later, a new message surfaced featuring what appeared to be the corpse of Yukawa. And Goto would also be killed, the new message claimed, unless Jordan freed al-Rishawi. The militants carried out their threat Saturday. Days after the video was released, an outraged Japan is mourning the two men whose deaths will plunge it deeper into the global fight against ISIS. The pilot's fate, on the other hand, remains unclear. He was not mentioned in the latest video showing  Goto's apparent beheading. Jordan will continue trying to secure his release, government spokesman Mohammed Al-Momani told the Petra news agency. Until then, the wait continues. Two nations, forever linked by the fate of their sons. CNN's Holly Yan and Steve Almasy  contributed to this report.","Jordan says it is still trying to free a pilot held captive by ISIS .

"(CNN)Indian authorities in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh have made a grisly find in one of their police stations: dozens of human body parts. Contract workers made the discovery in the city of Unnao, around 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lucknow. While cleaning a disused part of a city police station late last week, the workers chanced upon sacks filled with human remains in a room that had been locked for a long time. Until 2008, the room was used as a mortuary, where bodies were kept before funerals, Ram Kishan Yadav, an additional superintendent of police for Unnao District, told CNN. In mid-2008, he said, the mortuary was shifted to an area hospital. ""These body parts were to be shifted to the district hospital mortuary, but we don't know how they have since been kept here in the police station,"" he said. ""An investigation is still ongoing."" Foul play is not suspected, officials say, but they are not sure why the bodies were not disposed of properly. In Hinduism and some other Indian faiths, funerals are usually conducted by cremation. Officials say the bodies are likely to be at least 20 years old. Another police official said that DNA testing would be conducted on the remains. Opposition lawmakers have called for an in-depth investigation. Bharatiya Janata Party state legislator Pankaj Gupta told the Hindustan Times that his party ""will take up the issue with the chief minister and organize a movement on this issue."" The discovery comes two weeks after around 80 skeletons and decayed bodies surfaced in the Ganges, India's holiest river, in the district.","Workers discovered dozens of body parts in a disused room in a police station in northern India .

"A rung on the long ladder to Mars broke Friday, when a rocket test in Texas ended in a midair ball of fire. Debris from the unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 Reusable (F9R) rocket, which self-destructed less than 20 seconds after launch, rained down from the flames onto an open field outside of McGregor. A hitch turned up during launch, and the ""flight termination system automatically terminated the mission,"" SpaceX said in a statement. ""There were no injuries or near-injuries."" But it was a vivid firework for bystanders parked on a nearby country road -- and for their cellphone cameras. CNN affiliate KWTX reported the explosion on Friday and posted video. SpaceX said it will look at flight data to determine what went wrong with the three-engine version of the rocket. All about the landing . It's not how it flies up but how it comes down that makes the F9R a steppingstone to a Mars mission. The rocket has a landing gear -- four legs that stick out like an insect's. So did its even shorter predecessor, which bore the name Grasshopper. Until now, American space rockets have never been designed to return in the same fashion or form as they departed. The bulk of the rocket was jettisoned into the ocean, or discarded in low orbit to fall back through Earth's cosmic incinerator, or left in the eternal void. Whatever you wanted to keep -- solid boosters, capsules, astronauts -- had to be lowered with chutes or glide in on a shuttle. Not so the F9R. All of it, in one piece, slowly backs down to the pad it took off from, using its booster engines, and sets down gingerly on its feet. That makes it reusable, a characteristic useful for a future mission to Mars -- if anyone plans to return home from there, that is. Mars, here we come . A trip to the Red Planet is the visionary call of the space industry. Mars One, a Dutch nonprofit, already is taking applications for one-way space pioneers who would spend the rest of their lives on a permanent Martian settlement. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has a similar ambition: He foresees the human colonization of Mars and other planets as the next step in human evolution, according to the company's website. There is also a less sexy but more immediate advantage to reusable rockets: They save tons of money. SpaceX's large Falcon 9 rockets cost about $54 million each, the company says. That's roughly the price tag of a smaller pre-owned passenger jet in good shape. But a jet flies multiple times. Making rockets reusable would cut space flight costs enormously, SpaceX says. That competitive edge could come in handy really soon. SpaceX and three other firms -- Boeing, Blue Origin and the Sierra Nevada Corp. -- are racing to develop a ""safe, reliable and cost-effective"" means of transporting crew to low-Earth orbit, according a statement from NASA this week. The space agency plans to award, this month or next, ""one or more contracts"" for commercial transport to and from the International Space Station. Mars hopefuls ponder life without families, favorite foods . A short-hopper . F9R rockets don't rumble the earth with the kind of thunder that the space shuttles or Saturn V rockets once did, and the F9R is relatively small, comprising only one stage. It's a sawed-off version of its parent, the Falcon 9, the first rocket from a commercial company to fly to the International Space Station, according to SpaceX. Nine rocket engines fire up to boost the Falcon 9 into Earth's orbit. Just three propel the F9R, which has only flown to an altitude of 1,000 meters (3,280 feet). That's less than twice the height of New York's One World Trade Center -- a trivial feat for a rocket -- but coming back down from there in one piece is not. Rocket science is, well, rocket science, even for small rockets sometimes, and failures in various stages of space missions happen regularly. In mid-May, a Russian satellite launch went sour when the rocket veered off path, causing an emergency system to cut off propulsion. The rocket had traveled 100 miles high and reportedly burned up in the atmosphere on its way back down. It was at least the fourth failure by a Proton-M rocket, a legendary workhorse of the Russian space program. As Musk tweeted after F9R's self-detonation: . ""Rockets are tricky ..."" Opinion: Why I signed up for a one-way trip to Mars .","The rocket self-destructed as a safety measure .

"(CNN)Sometimes, people pretend to die. That's pretty much the basic idea behind ""Still Lives,"" a thought-provoking series of portraits by photographer Eliot Dudik. These images reveal a whole new perspective on America's Civil War re-enactors. But they also aim to spark conversations about two things that touch us all: life and death. For generations, enthusiasts and history buffs have been spending their weekends re-staging historic clashes of the War Between the States, pretending to lose their lives on the battlefield. Dudik uses his camera to study these faces while they fake death. Some have their eyes closed. Some, open. Some looking away, others looking directly at us. The subject is unsettling. But because we know they're really alive, it's somehow captivating. ""I think there's a shifting back and forth between life and death as you look at them,"" Dudik said. ""When there's this oddness and this shifting, I think it holds our attention a little longer, which hopefully brings us into each of our own individual conversations about what life and death means and what war means to us as individuals."" Admittedly, the concept is a heavy one. To make it more approachable, Dudik injected a bit of humor. He started collecting reasons why re-enactors choose to live or die during their performances. After ""dying"" on battlefields 148 times, longtime re-enactor Ed ""Doc"" Keith told Dudik he has decided to quit dying. Now, Dudik said, Keith ""leaves the dying to the young."" ""That statement really stuck with me,"" Dudik said. And it propelled him to jump feet first into the project. Another re-enactor told Dudik at historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that ""he doesn't die very often because he's one of the few that are actually in shape and can make it all the way across the battlefield."" A third re-enactor said he dies ""almost every time because he finds it more realistic,"" Dudik said. ""Another guy told me he doesn't die in the high grass because he has allergies."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. 2015 marks 150 years since the war's end. The death toll totaled nearly 500,000 Union and Confederate soldiers, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Dudik's project helped him understand and respect the solemn reasons behind the re-enactments. ""Still Lives"" was inspired by its sister project, ""Broken Land,"" which focuses on landscapes linked to the Civil War. ""I've always been fascinated by war in general since I was little -- not so much in a romantic way -- but more in a frightening way,"" Dudik said. ""It's always kind of scared the crap out of me, basically."" The dramatic rift the nation felt in the 1860s reminds him of today's political landscape. ""I feel like the country is basically paralyzed by the divide in politics,"" Dudik said. When it comes to equipment, this guy leans totally old school. Dudik shot the project entirely on film, using what photographers call a view camera, which has a basic design dating back to the 19th century. Projects can become more collaborative with a view camera, Dudik said. During the ""Still Lives"" portrait shoots, he enjoyed explaining to the re-enactors how the camera works and its long exposure time. Dudik photographed each re-enactor as they laid on a suspended platform, giving the impression they were hovering above the ground. Dudik then climbed up a ladder to access his camera, which was aimed down toward the re-enactor. Once underneath the camera's ""dark cloth,"" he opened the shutter and captured an image. ""I personally don't enjoy digital photography that much,"" Dudik said. ""I don't have anything against it. I think it works marvelously for lots of applications. But for me, I'm pretty devoted to film for ... the way I work with it ... and the way it looks."" Dudik, 32, spent most of his first 16 years growing up on a sheep farm in central Pennsylvania before moving with his family to Maryland. His interest in taking pictures eventually led to college degrees in South Carolina  and Georgia. He has been published several times and last year he won the PhotoNOLA Review Prize. Lately, Dudik admits life has become a little crazy, as he juggles teaching at Virginia's College of William and Mary while helping create the school's first formal photography program. ""Teaching and being intimately involved in an academic art department is a great inspiration and motivation and it provides an incredible collaborative community,"" Dudik said. ""And I'm very thankful for that."" Eliot Dudik is a photographer and professor at the College of William and Mary.

"(CNN)As Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste was flying to freedom Sunday after 400 days in jail, the man in charge of Egypt was making a long speech lamenting his country's many problems. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi touched on the desperate state of the economy, the deadly jihadist insurrection in Sinai, the role of religion in politics and human rights. Amid this litany of woes, the jailing of Greste, who is Australian, and two other Al Jazeera journalists in Egypt had become an embarrassment for a government whose human rights record was already receiving plenty of adverse attention. In July, soon after their sentences were handed down to an international outcry, President al-Sisi acknowledged the case had been a PR disaster for Egypt. He told local journalists the trial had been ""very negative"" for the country's reputation. ""I wished they had been deported immediately after their arrest instead of being put on trial,"" he said. Greste was arrested at the end of 2013 along with Al Jazeera Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed. They were accused of disseminating ""false information"" and belonging to a ""terrorist organization."" After a four-month trial, Greste and Fahmy received seven-year sentences; Mohammed got 10 years. As of Monday, Fahmy and Mohamed were still behind bars. The case against them was part of a heavy-handed campaign against anyone who had anything to do with members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was decreed a ""terrorist organization"" soon after al-Sisi and the military seized power. That campaign was supported by almost hysterical media coverage of the ""threat within."" Human rights groups say thousands of Brotherhood members are in jail awaiting trial; nearly 200 more have been sentenced to death. Throughout the proceedings against the Al Jazeera journalists, the Egyptian government -- from al-Sisi downwards -- insisted it had no part in the judicial process. Few observers took that at face value. Many thought the trio were pawns in a confrontation between al-Sisi and the emirate of Qatar, which funds Al Jazeera. The charges even suggested as much, accusing the trio of broadcasting scenes ""through the Qatari Jazeera channel to assist the [Muslim Brotherhood] terrorist group in achieving its purposes of influencing international public opinion."" Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also alluded to the political complexion of the case when the three men were sentenced, saying: ""Al Jazeera is not the favorite news channel in Egypt.  So my fear is that Peter Greste was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Throughout the Middle East --- from Syria to Gaza to Libya -- Qatar has funded and supported groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood since the Arab Spring erupted four years ago. Among Qatar's allies was the leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, who became President in June 2012 but was ousted by al-Sisi a year later. Egypt's traditional allies were openly appalled by the sentences against the three. The White House lambasted ""the prosecution of journalists for reporting information that does not coincide with the government of Egypt's narrative."" But the journalists' trial (several others were charged in absentia) was part of a pattern. Human Rights Watch said the prosecution ""coming after the prosecution of protesters and academics, shows how fast the space for dissent in Egypt is evaporating."" One of many examples: Amr Hamzawy, an academic and former member of parliament, was charged with ""insulting the judiciary after a tweet claiming the conviction of 43 employees of pro-democracy organizations demonstrated the ""politicization"" of the judiciary. He is yet to be tried. It was a draconian campaign that seemed tone-deaf toward governments that had long enjoyed good relations with Egypt, and which -- in the case of the United States -- provided billions in military aid. And as harrowing as the experience of the three Al Jazeera journalists has been, others have suffered worse fates, according to human rights groups. After al-Sisi was elected President, Human Rights Watch urged him to investigate ""the police and army killings of more than 1,400 demonstrators over the past 12 months and the mounting allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees."" Egyptian officials might argue that the Al Jazeera case was one component of a broader strategy to get Qatar to mend its ways -- and that it worked. In the wake of the military takeover in Egypt, Qatar had become a sanctuary for Egyptian Brotherhood leaders. But in recent months, the Qataris have quietly distanced themselves from prominent Brotherhood figures. Several left Qatar in September, although the Qataris insisted they had not been expelled. Weeks later, al-Sisi issued a decree allowing Egypt to repatriate foreign prisoners, which is exactly what has happened to Greste. Fahmy holds both Canadian and Egyptian citizenship, so the same procedure seems likely in his case, but Baher Mohamed is Egyptian and his fate remains unclear. Which brings us back the speech al-Sisi was making Sunday as Greste was being deported. It came two days after the jihadist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis -- an affiliate of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- carried out its most audacious attack yet on security outposts in the Sinai desert, killing at least 30 people. Acknowledging the threat from Islamist militancy, al-Sisi spoke of a ""dangerous mass that has for the past 30 to 40 years been spreading extremist thought and doesn't want to understand that God had created us different"" (code for the Muslim Brotherhood.) Al-Sisi announced that ""east of the [Suez] Canal is now a single military command under the leadership of General Osama Rushdi to fight terrorism."" But it's the second time in four months he has promised the Egyptian people that he will combat extremism in Sinai. He also addressed the shooting death in Cairo last week of political activist Shaima Sabbagh, while casting himself as father of the nation. ""Shaima was the daughter of Egypt and all the daughters and sons of Egypt are my children,"" al-Sisi said, promising an investigation. Activists claim Sabbagh was shot by police during protests to mark the fourth anniversary of the 2011 uprising, in which more than 20 people were killed. Anti-government protests have become more frequent despite the best efforts of the security forces. On the parlous state of the Egyptian economy and its public finances, al-Sisi was equally forthright, thanking Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for their financial support, estimated at $11 billion in the year to July 2014. ""If it was not for your support, Egypt would not have survived until now,"" he said. But he also admitted the government was still strapped for cash. ""Egypt does not have 150 billion Egyptian pounds (about $20 billion) to spend on its people."" Simply put, amid this dire outlook, the Al Jazeera case became an irritant that al-Sisi's government could do without. As President al-Sisi himself made clear, the war on the Muslim Brotherhood will continue to be pursued remorselessly. But his opponents at home and many international observers see a broader and unremitting campaign against dissent of any sort. CNN's Ali Younes contributed to this report.","President al-Sisi acknowledged Al Jazeera case had been PR disaster for Egypt .

"Sydney (CNN)He's an embattled prime minister and he doesn't deny it. So when Australia's Tony Abbott faced journalists and his colleagues to deliver a highly anticipated speech in Canberra on Monday, he fessed up and begged for time. Seen as tricky, mean and unwilling to keep his promises, the Australian leader has been under pressure recently to resign. To stem the criticism, Abbott offered a few olive branches: more consultation with his colleagues, more control over foreigners buying in to the property market in Australia's major cities and a crackdown on Islamic groups sympathetic to ISIS. Throughout, however, he made it clear he was staying put. Since his election in September 2013, Abbott has accumulated more critics than supporters. A litany of broken promises and a stalled budget have left his achievements looking parlous. He had promised there would be no cuts to health, education and pensions, nor the national broadcasters, ABC and the SBS. All have since faced reduced funding. His first budget has been hijacked by minor party objections and horse-trading. Many measures remain stuck in the Senate, the upper house of the Australian parliament. He's managed to keep one of his central promises: to dump a carbon tax introduced by Julia Gillard, the predecessor he maligned for breaking promises. And his government can be fairly said to have stopped the boatloads of asylum seekers making their way to Australia from Indonesian ports. This was achieved after several years, during which up to 1,000 people died on the journey. However, even that achievement has come at a cost to his personal reputation. Sending asylum seekers to Australian-run camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru has ended in riots and one death. When he honored Prince Philip, the husband of the Queen of England, with a knighthood, the fuse of national anger ignited. He is appearing to be a tin-eared leader, out of touch with ordinary Australians. Queenslanders took the opportunity to slap down his conservative allies by throwing them out of office in a statewide election last weekend. Talk had begun, worsening after the Queensland poll, that Abbott would be dumped if he refused to resign. Half stump speech, half stock-taking on the government's achievements, his public appearance at the National Press Club is unlikely to placate his most ardent critics, who now include many conservative commentators. Poll after poll reveals the extent of his unpopularity. A Fairfax/Ipsos poll taken in late January shows the government would lose the next election by a landslide, based on current figures. Abbott's personal approval rating has nosedived too. The two cabinet ministers most often talked about as likely to challenge him for the top job have pledged loyalty, albeit in muted tones. Abbott didn't deny he had sought an assurance of loyalty from his deputy, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. ""I accept this is a government which has gone through a difficult patch. All governments go through difficult patches,"" he said. ""This will be a test of character. Now, politicians pass the test when they do what is best for the long term, not when they give in to short term fear and make a difficult situation worse. ""As for Julie, she's a friend of mine. Julie is my deputy. She's been a terrific deputy and a terrific minister. I believe I have her support and I certainly look forward to continuing to have that."" On his other rival, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, there was silence. Turnbull is a popular figure and the preferred conservative leader for those who vote for the opposition, the Australian Labor Party. However, Turnbull's pro-climate change, pro-same sex marriage stance makes him a difficult alternative for his own party to accept as leader. For the moment, Turnbull is toeing the line and publicly stating he supports his leader. Given the frenzy of anger and disappointment unleashed against  Abbott over the past week, and the anticipation attached to Monday's appearance, it was clear the prime minister would never be able to achieve the bar set for him. In the end, he did all that he could do. He begged his colleagues to stick with him and warned Australians that, if they followed Queensland (and before it Victoria, which also recently turfed out a conservative government), they'd face the re-introduction of a carbon tax. Wiping it from the statute books, he says, has saved the average Australian household $500 a year. It might sound glib to assert that $500 a year is all that stands between Tony Abbott, Prime Minister and Tony Abbott, washed up politician. But given his nemesis Turnbull has long advocated action on climate change, it's truer than it sounds.","Facing criticism from all sides, Australian leader Tony Abbott begs for more time .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the span of a few months, has gone from saying she is not thinking about running for president to telling an audience in Mexico on Friday that she will make her presidential decision around the first of 2015.

""Obviously, I'm thinking about it, but I have not made a decision yet,"" Clinton said during an event for Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's foundation. She added that she has a ""unique vantage point and set of experiences about what makes the United States operate well and what doesn't and what a president can do and should be doing.""

Ahead of the 2014 midterms, Clinton has agreed to do events for a host of Democratic committees and groups and even did a robocall ad for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lieutenant governor candidate Kathy Hochul. ""I'm calling to urge you to vote for Andrew Cuomo for governor and his running mate, Kathy Hochul, for lieutenant governor in Tuesday's Democratic primary,"" Clinton, herself a former New York senator, says in the call.

Clinton's endorsement goes against the more progressive Zephyr Teachout, who is challenging Cuomo in the Democratic primary slated next week.

"(CNN)(CNN) -- An accused killer was captured Monday at a bus station more than 250 miles from where police say he killed five people, including two teens, in a rural Georgia town. Thomas Jesse Lee, 26, surrendered to police in Tupelo, Mississippi, without any resistance, authorities said. Lee had been on the run since Saturday from LaGrange, Georgia, where he is accused of killing his wife, her parents, a family member and a friend. ""It makes us feel very good he's in custody,"" said Stewart Smith, the spokesman for the Troup County Sheriff's Office in Georgia. ""This was a crime where there were five murders. We've never had anything like that around here. For us to have him in custody that quick is a great relief to us and the family."" His arrest came after a bizarre, almost surreal turn of events. Authorities said Lee attended a church service at Crossroads Baptist Church in a small town near Tupelo on Sunday. According to authorities, Lee got along with members of the congregation and they chipped in to purchase him a bus ticket to Opelika, Alabama. Smith said the bus wasn't set to leave until Monday morning. The church members didn't know the 6-foot, 3-inch man with red hair and a matching beard was sought in gruesome murders two states away.  It was sometime Monday morning, Smith said, when the pastor saw a news report and realized the man his church helped was wanted in the killings. The pastor called local authorities, and Tupelo police found Lee still at the bus stop. ""I believe he did identify himself as Jesse Lee,"" Smith said. The killings had shaken the community of Lagrange, with some residents fearful Lee might return, Smith said. Police found the bodies of William Burtron, 69, Sheila Burtron, 68, Christie Lee, 33, Bailey Burtron, 16, and Iiaonna Green, 18, late Saturday night at a home in the Water's Edge subdivision of LaGrange,  about 70 miles southwest of Atlanta near the Alabama border, CNN affiliate WSB reported. Deputies forced their way into the home after receiving a call that one of the victims hadn't been to work in days, the station reported. The suspect was married to Christie Lee. Four of the five victims had been shot, and each of them was found in a different room of the house, WSB reported. No gun was found in the home. Smith said it was not immediately clear how Lee got to Mississippi. Authorities believe he may have ditched his olive green Mazda Tribute, but have yet to find the vehicle.","Thomas Jesse Lee, 26, captured in Mississippi .

"There are photos of bodies with limbs torn from their sockets and others showing people with their eyes gouged out -- even shots of people being crucified. But with crises in the Middle East and eastern Ukraine, does the world still care about Syria, one of the deadliest conflicts in history? The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 1,600 deaths in just 10 days in July and more than 115,000 people killed since the beginning of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime in March 2011. A spokesman for the United Nations secretary-general said officials have had issues getting reliable numbers but may have updated figures this month. ""The U.N. may stop crunching the numbers, but the people who are being killed still count,"" said Oubai Shahbandar, senior adviser to a Washington-based Syrian opposition coalition. There are reports of militants crucifying people in public and images smuggled out of Syria that appear to show them raising their victims' severed heads on poles. Those gut-wrenching photos come from a man known only as ""Caesar,"" who testified before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 31. Caesar described himself as a Syrian military defector tasked by al-Assad's regime with taking photos of killed detainees. He said he smuggled about 50,000 photos of those bodies out of the war-torn country. The White House said the images of brutalized bodies were ""suggestive of torture and killing on an industrial scale by the Assad regime."" Committee Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, and ranking Democrat Rep. Eliot Engel of New York said they were floored by the photos. ""We want to look away. But we must not,"" Engel said. ""We will never forget the Syrian people,"" Royce said. But advocates argue that we've already forgotten. Shahbandar said that if the international community doesn't pay attention to what is happening in Syria, it is letting both al-Assad's regime and the Islamic State -- formerly known as ISIS -- get away with crimes against humanity. The Islamic State has taken over several cities as it seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria. ""There is a real concern that the daily slaughter being perpetuated by the Assad regime has suddenly become accepted by the international community as the new normal,"" Shahbandar said. The conflict continues to spread throughout the country, threatening to spill over its borders. On July 28, a fuel depot in Tripoli, the capitol of Libya, was set ablaze during fighting between two rebel groups. The fire continued to burn out of control aafter firefighters were forced to abandon attempts to extinguish the blaze as conflict over the nearby airport intensified. Sunday, at least eight Lebanese soldiers were killed and an additional 20 were wounded amid clashes with insurgents who crossed the border from Syria into Lebanon, according to Lebanon's official National News Agency. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in July that Americans need to take the threat of the Islamic State seriously, voicing concerns that the group's impact could reach the West. How did so many in the international community let the nearly 3½-year struggle in Syria slip from the front of their minds? Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute journalism school says it could be because there's a lot going on in the world right now. ""There are half a dozen big international stories going at the same time,"" Tompkins said. ""The biggest are what's going on with Hamas and Israel, then you've got airplanes being shot out of the sky in Ukraine. The Syria story has been going on and on and on."" But just because a story is forgotten does not mean it's less important, Tompkins argued. This disappointed one of the U.N.'s own groups, an internal commission headed up by Paulo Pinheiro that has been looking into human rights violations in Syria. ""What we are insisting is that if accountability is not dealt in this conflict, this is disrespect for the victims, for the civilian population that are paying the brunt of this conflict,"" Pinheiro said. In May, the U.N. Security Council vetoed a referral to the International Criminal Court, which could have been a first step in bringing those responsible for human rights violations in Syria to justice. Attention is slowly starting to shift back to Syria. After Pinheiro's group's testimony last week, the Security Council condemned getting oil from ""terrorist groups"" from Syria and Iraq and said it believed that money from these sales fueled the strengthening of the Islamic State. The Security Council also authorized shipment of humanitarian aid into Syria without its government's approval. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced last week that the United States is giving an additional $378 million to help bolster aid for Syrians. Tompkins said that seeing people like Caesar come forward with pictures to put a face on the suffering has helped bring the story back to life. ""A story without photographs is a story that gets lost,"" Tompkins said. ""As long as there is an image to keep that narrative moving, you stay on the front page.""

"Two American missionaries infected with the deadly Ebola virus were given an experimental drug. Shortly after, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were flown separately from Liberia to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital -- the first human patients with Ebola to ever come to the United States. Writebol was released from the hospital Tuesday. On Thursday morning, Brantly walked out of that same hospital with no signs of the virus in his system, doctors say. Their recoveries seem to offer hope for those fighting the largest Ebola outbreak in known history. More than 2,400 people have been infected by the virus, according to the World Health Organization, and it's killed more than half. But ZMapp is not an approved treatment for Ebola; in fact, no approved, proven treatment exists. So governments, aid organizations and scientists around the globe are racing to find a way to stop the virus. Here are answers to questions about Ebola patients and treatments for the disease. 1. Are Brantly and Writebol cured? Mostly. For Ebola patients to leave isolation, two blood tests had to come back negative for the Ebola virus. So their bodily fluids, like blood, sweat and feces, are no longer infectious. ""Nancy is free of the virus, but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition,"" Writebol's husband, David Writebol, said in a statement. Some doctors believe the virus can remain in vaginal fluid and semen for up to several months, according to WHO. Dr. Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease specialist at Emory, said there is no evidence Ebola has ever been transmitted this way, but the risk was discussed with both patients. 2. Are they now immune to Ebola? Doctors believe surviving Ebola leaves you immune to future infection. Scientists have found that people who survive Ebola have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future, and possibly against other strains as well. But, as you can imagine, they haven't tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again. There are four Ebola strains known to infect humans; the Zaire ebolavirus causing the current outbreak is the most common. 3. Who else has been given ZMapp? The Ebola drug was flown to Spain to give to a priest named Miguel Pajares, who had contracted the virus in Liberia. Pajares died on August 12. It's unclear if he was given the drug before he died. ZMapp appears to be helping three Liberian health care workers who were given the experimental drug. They have shown ""very positive signs of recovery,"" the Liberian Ministry of Health said earlier this week. Medical professionals treating the workers have called their progress ""remarkable."" 4. Who makes the drug? The drug was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., which is based in San Diego. The company was founded in 2003 ""to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense,"" according to its website. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction, to develop an Ebola treatment for several years. 5. How does ZMapp work? Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign, or harmful, cells. A monoclonal antibody is similar, except it's engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell, according to the Mayo Clinic, mimicking your immune system's natural response. Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions. Sources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a three-mouse monoclonal antibody, meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus, and then the antibodies generated within the mice's blood were harvested to create the medicine. However, the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants. ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro provided limited quantities of this kind of the drug to Emory, according to company spokesman David Howard. 6. Did doctors know it would work in humans? No. The drug had shown promise in primates, but even in those experiments, just eight monkeys received the treatment. In any case, the human immune system can react differently than primates', which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use. These cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems. 7. Are there other Ebola treatments out there? Several experimental drugs are in development, but none has been effective in humans. The market for these drugs is small -- Ebola is a rare disease, almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies. In March, the NIH awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight Ebola. On Wednesday, Wellcome Trust and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development announced money for Ebola research will be made available from a $10.8 million initiative. 8. Will ZMapp or these other drugs be given to more Ebola patients? An ethics panel convened by the World Health Organization concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one, but that doesn't mean it will happen. Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult, Doctors Without Borders says. Experimental drugs typically are not mass-produced, and tracking the success of such a drug, if used, would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce. In an opinion article published in the journal Nature this week, epidemiologist Oliver Brady says up to 30,000 people in West Africa would have so far required treatment in this outbreak if it was available. 9. What about an Ebola vaccine? For the record, ""vaccine"" and ""treatment"" are not interchangeable terms. A vaccine is given to prevent infection, whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms. There are several Ebola vaccines in development. The Canadian government has donated between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO. The drug, called VSV-EBOV, is Canadian-made and owned, having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory. It's never been tested on humans ""but has shown promise in animal research,"" the agency says. We don't know if the vaccine has been given to anyone on the ground. The NIH says a safety trial of an Ebola vaccine will start as early as September.","American patients infected with Ebola are being released from the hospital .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Simone Battle, an ""X Factor"" finalist and G.R.L. singer, was found dead Friday in a Los Angeles home, a coroner's spokesman said. She was 25. A cause of death is not yet known, according to Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. David Smith. An autopsy has been scheduled for the weekend, he said. Battle's body was discovered in her West Hollywood apartment Friday morning, Smith said. No other details have been made public. The singer was a finalist in the talent competition for Fox Television's ""The X Factor"" in the 2011 season. She was a member of the girl singing group G.R.L., which performed last month on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" The G.R.L. Twitter account posted this message: ""Words cannot express the depth of our loss. Simone's incredible talent was only surpassed by the size of her heart."" Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin created G.R.L. as the ""next generation"" of her original group last year. The group collaborated with Pitbull on the song ""Wild Wild Love,"" which rose to 30 on Billboard's Hot 100 this year. Pitbull tweeted his condolences Saturday: ""My heart and prayers go out to @GRLSimone: @grl and her family. RIP Dios la bendiga."" G.R.L.'s latest single was ""Ugly Heart,"" released in June, according to Billboard. Battle had said that Whitney Houston ""inspired my dream to be a singer,"" according to the group's official biography on the RCA Records website. She grew up in Los Angeles, singing in a church choir, studying ballet and tap, modeling and acting in television commercials before working an internship with a company associated with the Black Eyed Peas. She studied music and songwriting at the University of Southern California before competing on ""The X Factor,"" where she reached the top 16.

"""It's even worse than I'd feared,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday of the Ebola outbreak rampaging through West Africa. ""Every day this outbreak goes on, it increases the risk for another export to another country. ""The sooner the world comes together to help Liberia and West Africans, the safer we will all be."" Frieden spoke to CNN's Nima Elbagir in Monrovia, Liberia, where fear and anger over the largest Ebola outbreak on record has grown as health officials put up quarantines around some of the capital city's poorest areas. More than 2,600 people have been infected by Ebola in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the outbreak began in December, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly 1,500 have died. Health care workers at risk . A CDC staff member was recently flown home to the United States on a private charter after spending time in close proximity with another health care worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone. The CDC worker is reportedly healthy and has shown no symptoms of the deadly virus. He or she is simply rotating back to the United States as previously scheduled, according to the CDC. It is CDC policy that people who have been exposed to Ebola and are traveling long distances do so on a private plane in the three weeks after exposure to lower the risk of spreading the infection. ""We think it's the right thing to do, to bring them home,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said. ""They want to come home. Their tour of duty was up, and we've made it crystal clear that if they go over there and have something like this happen and want to go home, we're going to bring them home."" The staff member will be monitored for 21 days -- the longest known incubation period -- for Ebola symptoms, but he or she currently ""poses no Ebola-related risk to friends, family, co-workers, or the public,"" the CDC said in a statement. Inside the Ebola outbreak with the CDC . The other health care worker, who tested positive for Ebola, has been flown to Germany to recover, Skinner said. The World Health Organization said Monday that 120 health care workers have died in the Ebola outbreak, and twice that number have been infected. Public health experts say several factors are to blame, including a shortage of protective gear and improper use of the gear they do have. The fact that the disease has killed so many people working to care for infected patients is making it increasingly hard to combat the virus in West Africa, WHO said. ""It depletes one of the most vital assets during the control of any outbreak. WHO estimates that in the three hardest-hit countries, only one to two doctors are available to treat 100,000 people, and these doctors are heavily concentrated in urban areas."" Another outbreak . On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health for the Democratic Republic of Congo notified WHO of another possible Ebola outbreak. Health officials say a woman in the Central African country became ill with symptoms of Ebola after butchering a bush animal that had been given to her by her husband. She died on August 11. Since then health care workers, relatives and other individuals who came in contact with her body have developed symptoms and died. Between July 28 and August 18, a total of 24 suspected cases of an unidentified hemorrhagic fever, including 13 deaths, have been identified, WHO said. Samples have been sent to laboratories to confirm that these illnesses are being caused by the Ebola virus and to identify the strain. As none of the people involved has been to the four countries affected by the other Ebola epidemic, health officials believe this to be a separate outbreak. The Democratic Republic of Congo has seen six smaller Ebola outbreaks since the 1970s, according to the CDC. Your questions about Ebola answered .

"Rep. Tom Cotton has a 2-point advantage over Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in a new CNN/ORC International poll of the political knife fight for the U.S. Senate seat in Arkansas. Cotton's 49%-47% edge over the incumbent falls well within the survey's 4.5% margin of error, essentially making this race, which will help determine who controls the Senate, a dead heat two months before Election Day. There is no sugarcoating the bitterness between the two candidates in this high-profile contest. Pryor's campaign released an ad accusing the Republican Cotton of voting against legislation that would help prepare the U.S. for a pandemic situation such as the Ebola virus, while Cotton has charged that Pryor is soft on illegal immigration. Election Center: Key 2014 Senate races . The poll shows that each candidate is winning his party's traditional political voting blocs, except Cotton appears strong with a key subset of the national Democratic Party's most faithful supporters -- a data point that is likely to raise a red flag among party elders and strategists. While Pryor holds an 8-point advantage over Cotton with likely women voters overall, Cotton is favored by likely voters among white women by 11 points. Losing a key constituency to an opponent by such a large margin could be devastating. ""The bad news is that he seems to have opened up a new way to lose to Republicans by losing badly with white women,"" said a Democratic operative who knows Pryor but is not working on his race. ""The good news is that is a segment of the electorate that tends to break Democratic, and he has time to close that gap. If he does, he wins."" Democrats boost Begich in Alaska after controversial ad . For Cotton, one of his biggest weaknesses is with people who make under $50,000 -- not unexpected when you look at traditional political voting bloc alliances. Pryor has a 9-point lead over Cotton with this group. The recent decision to include a measure on the November ballot that would increase the minimum wage in Arkansas from $6.25 to $8.50 by 2017 may help the incumbent by turning out more Democratic base voters, who often sit out midterm elections. ""The hope in Democratic circles is that those lower-income voters will turn out to vote themselves a raise, and while they are in the voting booth, they will wind up casting a ballot for Pryor as well,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. When it was announced that the measure would be on the ballot, Pryor issued a statement calling it a ""common sense proposal to put more money in the pockets of hardworking families across Arkansas."" Much like other critical Senate Democratic re-election bids, President Barack Obama is seen as a drag, not a plus, for Pryor in November. Obama's approval rating in Arkansas is just 33%, while 60% of registered voters disapprove of how he is handling his job. While Pryor voted for health care reform, he has opposed the President on other issues in the Senate and has not embraced him on the campaign trail. Senate election in Kentucky is marquee race . For some Republicans, though, it is puzzling that Cotton doesn't have a bigger lead over Pryor. While Pryor is among the centrists in his party and is the son of a former governor, if you look at the most recent voting trends, they would seem to clearly favor the Republican. Cases in point: Mitt Romney beat Obama by 24 points in 2012, and four years earlier, John McCain carried the state by 20 points. In 2010, Pryor's then-Democratic colleague, Sen. Blanche Lincoln, lost her seat to GOP Rep. John Boozman by 21 points. Beyond the favorable GOP voting trends, Cotton has a resume that jumps off the page. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, is Harvard educated and hails from a longtime Arkansas family. Yet, there is a thought among some Republicans that Cotton has failed to connect personally with voters. ""It is often said that people vote with their wallet, but it also is true that people decide based off of whom they would rather sit down and have a beer with,"" said a veteran GOP congressional and campaign operative. ""Likability matters. Mark Pryor is a likable guy. Tom Cotton's got to turn on the charm in the closing weeks."" In the so-called middle, Cotton is winning independent voters by 20 points, but it is unclear how nonpartisan these voters may be. A closer look at the data suggests that these voters appear to be more conservative-leaning than liberal-leaning. Inside Politics forecast: GOP jitters in Kansas . ""In some states, tea party supporters in recent years have tended to describe themselves as independents rather than Republicans since they don't feel comfortable with the GOP as it is currently structured,"" Holland said. ""It's unclear if this is true in Arkansas, but one piece of evidence to support it is that more than half of self-described independents say they are conservative and only eight percent call themselves liberal."" In the end, the winner of this race will be the person who turns out more of its supporters, while at the same time convincing crossover voters to support their campaign. The poll shows that Pryor has an edge in this category as 9% of Republicans said they are backing or leaning towards voting for him, while 5% of Democrats said they are backing or leaning toward Cotton. As for the overall electorate, 71% of likely voters said they have made up their minds, leaving about 24% who are open to changing their minds. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,010 adults in Arkansas, including 523 likely voters, by telephone between August 28 and September 2. The sampling error for results for likely voters is +/-4.5 percentage points. Friday's poll was the second CNN/ORC International Poll of a Senate battleground state this week that shows the Republican candidate with a slight edge. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell holds a 4-point advantage over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.

"By the time the tear gas started to clear in Ferguson, Missouri, at least 212 people had been arrested over nearly two weeks of clashes with police. A lot has been said about the fact that just a handful of them were actually from Ferguson. But there's more to the story. A close look at the official arrest logs of the St. Louis County police, which CNN obtained Friday, shows that while some people did travel to Ferguson to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer, a majority of the people arrested live in the St. Louis area. More than half of them were charged with a relatively minor offense: refusing to disperse when asked by police. Read the arrest log (PDF) Ferguson is a small suburban town, just 21,000 people packed into six square miles flush against St. Louis International Airport. The unrest started when unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death August 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Anger over the shooting, and the Ferguson police department's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot Brown, set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters. The worst violence came nine days after the shooting: on Monday into the wee hours of Tuesday. Police responded in militarized fashion, firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd and confiscating firearms, Molotov cocktails and, reportedly, water bottles filled with urine. There was sporadic looting. Where is Officer Darren Wilson? The force of the police response has been sharply criticized. But the finger-pointing went both ways. Some officials in Ferguson blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble. A deeper dive into the arrest logs and a search of social media and online news accounts show some self-avowed ""communists"" and others who could be considered ""agitators.""  But the vast majority of arrestees who gave out-of-town addresses were college students, peaceniks, legal advisers and journalists. The logs compiled by the St. Louis County police cover August 10 through 22 and list 212 arrests in Ferguson. They can't tell the full story, since they do not include arrests made by Ferguson police. They do not identify the arrestees by age or race. No incident reports are attached to provide details. Ferguson residents say police have a 'power trip problem' But the numbers do tell this simple story: 130 people were charged with refusal to disperse, 18 or so with burglary -- which may or may not be related to looting -- and nine with disorderly conduct. A handful of people were charged with resisting arrest and two people were charged with careless driving. And, 20 people appear to have made a serious tactical error by joining the crowd in Ferguson: They were picked up on existing arrest or fugitive warrants. Seven of the people arrested were journalists trying to cover the story. The list does not include reporters from the Washington Post and Huffington Post, who were arrested in the early days of the protests. It does include a Getty photographer who was arrested, along with several international journalists and representatives from online media sites. An eighth was a college senior, a journalism major photographing the protests for a newspaper in Cincinnati. Thursday night saw an eerie quiet descend, and the number of arrests dropped sharply; only eight were reported. Out of the glare, under the noise, other voices tell of a town called Ferguson .

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo continued to purge the top ranks of the nation's military Friday, removing the armed forces' commander. Lugo fired the commanders of the country's army, air force and navy on Wednesday. The armed forces commander, Rear Adm. Cibar Benitez Caceres, had been the only top official to survive Wednesday's dismissals. Lugo has given no reason for the firings, publicly denying rumors of a coup plot. Benitez Caceres will be replaced as armed forces chief by Brig. Gen. Juan Oscar Velazquez Castillo, the president's executive order said. The handover ceremony was scheduled to take place Friday afternoon. The military held a ceremony Thursday for the new army, navy and air force commanders. Lugo did not attend. Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was installed as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro took over the top post at the air force and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas, at the navy. Benitez had said at Thursday's swearing-in ceremony that other changes would be coming in the lower ranks, but denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. Some opposition politicians said Friday that Lugo, a leftist, is trying to install military commanders more in tune with his political and ideological leanings. Opposition Sen. Enrique Gonzalez Quintana was quoted in the Neike.com digital newspaper as saying Lugo has an agenda similar to that of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged in 1989 from Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year dictatorship. There were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. Friday's military shakeup is the fourth since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year, bringing an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay. But the goodwill did not last long. In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. Three women have accused him of fathering a child. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. Oppositions lawmakers, who say Lugo also has been ineffective in battling the nation's crime wave, are trying to impeach him.","Paraguay's president revamping military commands .

"(CNN)Craigslist reports about 80 million ads on its site each month, so even if you haven't met a stranger to buy or sell something online, chances are you know someone who has. The overwhelming majority of transactions go smoothly, but the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals on occasion. A couple from Georgia was traveling to a Craigslist transaction last month when they left their suburban Atlanta home in hopes of buying a 1966 Ford Mustang. They did everything right -- they went together, and they told their family they were going to the transaction. Yet the bodies of Elrey ""Bud"" Runion, and his wife, June, were found January 26, police said. A South Georgia man has been charged with murder in their deaths. In a separate incident Friday, two men in Georgia met a seller to purchase a dog. The seller drew a gun on them in an attempted robbery, but one of the buyers was carrying a handgun and fatally shot the seller, police said. The investigation is ongoing. The recent incidents should remind those engaged in this type of online commerce that it pays to be vigilant. So what can you do to make sure you don't fall prey to ne'er-do-wells next time you respond to an online ad? Philip Holloway is a law enforcement adviser and defense attorney with some tips on things you should remember when buying and selling goods online: . 10. Don't reveal personal information .

"U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces take control of Mosul Dam on Monday, fighting back ISIS militants who had seized the dam, President Obama told reporters. The stakes were huge for the millions of Iraqis who live downstream from the dam, the largest in the country. ""If that dam was breached it could have proven catastrophic, with floods that would have threatened the lives of thousands of civilians and endangered our embassy compound in Baghdad,"" the President said. The dam has been the center of an intense battle in northern Iraq between the Islamic extremists and Kurdish forces that had been  fighting to retake it since Saturday with U.S. air support. ""The U.S. military used fighters, bombers, attack and unmanned aircraft to conduct 35 strikes, "" said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. ""We destroyed over 90 targets including a range of vehicles, equipment and fighting positions,"" he said. Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Pentagon said. ""This operation demonstrates that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are capable of working together and taking the fight to ISIS,""  Obama said. ""If they continue to do so, they will have the strong support of the United States of America."" Taking the fight to ISIS . U.S. airstrikes may not be enough to do the job of ridding Iraq of ISIS forces, said retired  Col. Cedric Leighton, a former Air Force intelligence officer. ""At the core of the mission is to get rid of ISIS,"" he said.  ""The U.S. cannot have a Middle East in which ISIS exists,"" he said. The brutal attacks of ISIS militants as they took control of towns and villages in northern Iraq forced hundreds of thousands of  people to flee. ""ISIS tells people to pay or convert,"" said one Christian man who fled ISIS forces. A Christian village near Mosul Dam is almost deserted. Some of its residents fled just in time to a monastery in the mountains. ""We were afraid, terrified they'd call us infidels,"" a Christian woman there told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh.  ""My Muslim friend told me to just leave."" Now she said she hopes ISIS fighters won't reach the monastery. The U.S. strategy in fighting ISIS is ""to take out Isis' leadership, to degrade their operational capabilities, to cut off their financing sources,""  U.S State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday. On several ISIS websites, the group posted a message Monday threatening that ""America will disappear from the map soon on the hands of knights of al-Khilafa,""  a reference to the caliphate ISIS claims it wants to recapture. Water in war . When ISIS militants seized the dam this month, many feared it could be used as a weapon. Built in the early 1980s under former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, the dam sits on the Tigris River about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the city of Mosul. It serves as a key source of electricity, irrigation and flood protection. ISIS has a track record of attacking its enemies with water. This year, its fighters opened the gates on the Falluja Dam in central Iraq after seizing it in an effort to stop an Iraqi military advance. The water from the dam flooded a number of villages. ""ISIS has already used other smaller dams to gain control of territory, to pressure Sunnis to support them and to punish the Shiites,"" Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum, told CNN this month. The 3.2-kilometer-long Mosul Dam holds back as much as 12.5 million cubic meters of water, according to Engineering News-Record, a construction industry website. If the structure were to give way, it would unleash a wall of water tens of feet tall that would race down the Tigris toward Mosul and its 1.7 million inhabitants. It would also bring flooding to major cities farther downstream, including Baghdad. 'Very poor foundation' But even if the militant group doesn't try to destroy the dam, concerns remain about its sturdiness. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report in 2006 said that what made the dam especially dangerous was the risk of internal erosion of its foundations. The structure is built on layers of soil that dissolve or erode in water. The Army Corps said the dam was ""constructed on a very poor foundation"" that wasn't designed for the conditions. Seepage has plagued the structure since the reservoir behind it was filled, according to a U.S. government report in 2007, and sinkholes have appeared near the structure, suggesting problems beneath the surface. During the American military occupation of Iraq, U.S. authorities spent tens of millions of dollars on short-term repairs on the dam. But with the immense structure now in the midst of a conflict zone, it remains unclear if it will get the maintenance it needs anytime soon.","U.S. airstrikes destroy 90 targets in Mosul dam fight, Pentagon says .

"Pope Francis called for a cease-fire in the Middle East before Sunday's Angelus prayer and said his meeting in June with the presidents of Israel and the Palestinian Authority was not a waste of time. ""I exhort to all the interested parties and to all of those who have political responsibility at the local and international level to not give up the prayer, nor any effort to cease any hostility and reach the desired peace for the good of all,"" the Pope said, according to a CNN translation. He spoke in Italian, from the window of his apartment above St. Peter's Square. In June, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres committed themselves to the quest for peace during a visit to the Vatican. It was the first time the Pope had hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict. ""Someone could think that such a meeting took place in vain. Instead no, because prayer helps us in not letting evil win nor resigning ourselves to violence and hatred take over dialogue and reconciliation,"" the pontiff said Sunday. The Angelus is a traditional prayer given Sundays at noon following a short sermon from the Pope. Hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militants escalated this month after the killing of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen. Neither Hamas nor Israel appears to be backing down. Since Monday, scores of people in Gaza have been killed, the Gaza Health Ministry has said.

"Hillary Clinton is heading to Iowa as the politician that most Democrats would choose as their 2016 presidential nominee. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa said they would support Hillary Clinton if the 2016 caucuses were held today. That number far outpaces the 15% that would opt for Vice President Joe Biden, 7% who would choose Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 5% who would pick Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton will be visiting Iowa for the first time in six years on Sunday when she headlines the last Harkin Steak Fry. Biden, likewise, will be in the state Wednesday to speak at a liberal Catholic event in Des Moines. Although Clinton tops Biden with men and women, there is a noticeable gender split between the two politicians. Sixty-three percent of women favor Clinton, compared with Biden's 10%. With men, however, Biden is drawing 21% support -- a number more than twice his support among women. Hillary Clinton to decide on 2016 around end of year . On the Republican side, Mike Huckabee nearly laps the field with 21% of all registered Republicans contacted in the poll saying they would support the former Arkansas governor if the 2016 Iowa caucuses were held today. Paul Ryan is second with 12%, and there is a cadre of politicians -- including Sen. Rand Paul, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- with support in the single digits. Huckabee and Ryan are getting similar support with men -- 15% and 16%, respectively -- but it is with women that the former Arkansas governor jumps ahead of the congressman. Twenty-seven percent of registered Republican women polled said they would pick Huckabee, compared with 8% who choose Ryan. As the first-in-the-nation caucus state, Iowa is critically important to presidential hopefuls and can make or break a campaign. With almost two years until the 2016 presidential election and a little over a year before the Iowa caucuses, most Republicans and Democrats polled have openly admitted that they are toying with the idea of running for president. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 8-10, with 1,013 Iowa adults -- 608 likely voters -- questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- I worked as a CIA operations officer and station chief during the Cold War years. In the gray world of espionage, there was a clear distinction, at least in my mind, between the CIA and our opponents: They tortured their prisoners, we did not. The CIA's main opponent was the Soviet Union's KGB, whose headquarters on Lubyanka Square in Moscow was notorious for torture. In those days, I believed that the greatest thing going for me as an intelligence officer was the fact that I was an American. Now, as the Senate Intelligence Committee prepares to make public some of the findings of its investigation into CIA torture after 9/11, let's hope we can start a much needed public reckoning over a tragic mistake that has undermined the very principles I and many others felt we stood for. Our resorting to torture after 9/11 has cost us dearly -- we can no longer assert that we do not torture our enemies, leaving us in a much weaker position when urging our allies or our opponents to eschew such tactics. Now any American, civilian or military, who falls into the hands of our fundamentalist enemies is in even greater danger of being tortured or killed. Advocates of allowing for the use of torture (or what they prefer to describe as enhanced interrogation techniques) assert that since we haven't suffered a major attack since 9/11, that torture must somehow have played a part in preventing one. Even President Barack Obama, in his admission that unnamed officials ""tortured some folks"" in extremely dangerous times after 9/11, seemed only apologetic, not outraged. Indeed, he appeared to urge understanding for the torturers' failings. Meanwhile, there is profound reluctance on the part of CIA to reveal its own evaluation of the efficacy of its use of torture, as this might risk disclosing the torturers' identities -- and those of the people who put them to work. (The CIA's extraordinary admission that it has essentially spied on the Senate Intelligence Committee by hacking into computers of committee staff members is merely another stark example of its reluctance to come completely clean about what it has been doing). It is difficult not to conclude that such reluctance is largely based on the fact that very little of value was learned -- in line with what is reported to be the conclusion of the Intelligence Committee. This is all the more frustrating because during my tours in wartime Vietnam in the early 1970s, and as station chief in Seoul, South Korea, I worked hard and effectively against the use of torture. But it would be almost impossible for me to take such positions today. So what do we do now? In addition to public release of the Intelligence Committee report, the CIA should be compelled to make public, with the fewest possible redactions, its detailed internal evaluation of what, if anything, torture achieved, what it failed to do and what its use has cost us. Based on an examination of that report, and with input from experts in the field, a new Executive Order should be crafted and considered that bans torture by any U.S. governmental organization, while also naming techniques, such as water boarding, that are specifically forbidden. The basic issue is this: Are we a country that stands by its traditional standards and values through thick or thin, or are we a country that says ""We cannot cope with this situation, so let's turn to torture?"" For those who assert that America is weaker than it once was, I would say in response that our lapse into the use of torture simply lends credence to such accusations. Of course, accountability can be a bitter pill to swallow. But if we are to move away from this debilitating tendency to resort to torture when the road ahead looks tough, then accountability must start with those that have brought us to where we are today -- it is essential that they face up to the consequences and costs of their decisions. Maybe then America can lead by example on an issue where we have needlessly sacrificed the high ground.

"Several top members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been asked to leave Qatar, an Egyptian leader of the group said Sunday. The apparent sudden push from Qatar comes amid longstanding pressure against the Brotherhood in the region, which began with its ouster from authority in Egypt several years ago. ""We appreciate the great role of the state of Qatar in supporting the Egyptian people in their revolution against the military junta, and well understand the circumstances faced by the region,"" said Dr. Amr Darrag, a leading member of Freedom and Justice Party, said in a statement online. The Freedom and Justice Party is the banned political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The members were ""asked by authorities to move their residence outside the state of Qatar,"" the statement said. Egyptian court dissolves Muslim Brotherhood's political party . ""In order to avoid causing any embarrassment for the State of Qatar, which we found to be a very welcoming and supportive host, some symbols of the Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing ... have now honored that request,"" Darrag said.

Last year, Egypt's then-military chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and now its President, overthrew Mohamed Morsy, who was part of the Muslim Brotherhood.

"I've always wanted to go to Prague, having often heard that it was a magical place of extraordinary architecture and history (especially since it mostly escaped bombing during World War II).  Finally, in the week leading up to Labor Day, with visions of castles dancing in our heads, my girlfriend Donna Dennison and I flew in to begin our central European adventure. We had only one fear: We're vegans. Would we find anything to eat that contained absolutely no animal products, or would we be reduced to subsisting on doughy rolls and plain salads? I'm happy to report that Prague not only surpassed my imagination with its stunning vistas, medieval bridges and palatial grandeur, it turns out to be chock full of fabulous vegan and vegetarian restaurants. In fact, Central Europe in general is a hotbed of vegetarianism. Who knew? Don't fear the vegan! It turns out that Happy Cow knew. I have long used the Happy Cow app in the U.S. to find vegan restaurants. But I had low expectations when I clicked on the app in Prague, seeking the closest vegan or vegetarian restaurants. My assumptions were way off. It turns out Prague is a mecca of compassionate living with well over a dozen choices popping up: either vegan, vegetarian or veg-friendly. Within a 10-minute cobblestone-laden stroll from the historic Charles Bridge, which dates to the 14th century and overlooks the Vltava River, we were delighted to encounter LoVeg, an ironic name given that we climbed three flights of candlelit stairs to get to it. It was worth the hike for the delicious vegan burger made of red beets, chickpeas, tempeh and gherkin. The staff is clearly in it for the cause of compassion, hence their motto: ""We give food a higher meaning."" We liked it so much we came back again and tried the baked beetroot carpaccio. Next stop: Cesky Krumlov, a storybook medieval city whose historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage site and sits about halfway between Prague and Vienna. Surely, I thought, there's no way we'll find vegan options in this place. Wrong again! This was actually the site of one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants: Laibon. Sitting on sturdy wooden tables in an open terrace on the banks of the river, we stared up at the famed castle that was started in the 13th century but expanded over time to embrace not just Gothic but Renaissance and Baroque styles. Meanwhile, we nibbled on a vegan sampler for two that included Indian, Mexican and traditional European flavors. 6 veggie burgers so good you won't miss the meat . Our waiter was fluent in several languages, and we even bantered in Spanish for a while. It was a magical blending of cultures and centuries at the crossroads of time and taste. For a pick-me-up during sightseeing, we sampled the addictive potato swirls sold by a street vendor -- something akin to a medieval order of fries. For the piece de resistance, it was off to Vienna. Would the home of Mozart and Freud have some compassion in its high culture stew? Ja naturlich! In fact, there were so many vegan options, we hit Eis Greissler, an ice cream store that features several vegan flavors, for a cone of mindblowing vegan chocolate ice cream even before hitting our main meal! Good thing we were walking at least 5 miles a day. Then, we discovered Makro 1 nestled in a small courtyard just a short walk from the historic St. Stephen's Cathedral in the heart of Vienna. The few outdoor tables were taken, but everyone seated at them generously invited us to join them. When we asked for a menu, a friendly lady in an apron pointed to the chalkboard, and we realized that there was a single offering of the day. So we each ordered the macrobiotic plate that featured sweet sauteed pumpkin, delicious quinoa, lentils and salad. It really felt like we were having a meal with a local family. We chatted with the others about Veganz, the new vegan supermarket chain sweeping Europe. It made me realize, being vegan is like being a member of a compassionate club where you can find a haven with your fellows anywhere in the world. All of our vegan adventures were memorable. But the one that will always stand out was our lunch at the sumptuous Tian, a white glove vegetarian restaurant near Vienna's renowned Belvedere Palace. Using our Gogobot app to find a spot out of the rain, we had no idea we were stepping into the fanciest vegetarian experience of our lives. I'm talking palate cleansers, hand towels and a suggestion to allow at least an hour and a half for the full experience. What a treat: vegan caviar served up in vintage tins, followed by mouth-watering combinations of carefully sculpted vegetables. Finally, our dessert featured perhaps the most succulent brownie I've ever tasted. Donna had strawberry dumplings that were almost too beautiful to eat. Almost. We devoured every last bite. On our last day, before tackling the massive and astounding Schonbrunn Palace and its sweeping gardens, we filled up at Deli Bluem, which offered a buffet of hearty plant-based dishes from red lentils with millet, apples, spinach and radicchio to eggplant with pomegranate, pine nuts and basil. Finally, for a last dessert before heading back to low-calorie reality, we hit a small shop on a Vienna side street called Easy Going Bakery. We wanted to find that classic, light Viennese puff pastry, and we did in the form of mini-cupcakes. Our vegan adventure added so much flavor and excitement to our trip. It got us off the beaten path and into the nooks and crannies where real people live. We got a real taste of what life in Central Europe is really like.","Central Europe might not seem like a hotbed of vegan options, but it is .

"Dr. Rick Sacra and Dr. Kent Brantly were both infected with Ebola while working in Liberia with the aid organization Serving in Mission. Both were evacuated back to the United States for care. But the two doctors also have another thing in common: They have the same blood type. That little fact could be life-saving for Sacra. Brantly, who tested negative for the deadly virus after several weeks of treatment, recently flew to Nebraska where Sacra is in isolation and donated his blood. Doctors treated Sacra with this plasma on at least two occasions. Doctors believe Brantly has antibodies that Sacra lacks, but his immune system needs to help him fight the deadly virus. ""They are so similar it didn't surprise me that they were the same blood type,"" said his Sacra's spouse, Debbie Sacra. Sacra's doctors at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha said their patient is improving every day. ""We were down to the last shot and it worked out great,"" Dr. Phil Smith said at a press conference Thursday about finding a blood match. ""We were hoping to jump start his immunity."" At this point, doctors don't feel like Sacra will relapse, but they've been cautious about predicting success. Doctors in Africa told them there is typically a ""honeymoon period"" for patients after which they often get dramatically worse. Sacra, however, has gotten better daily.  Dr. Angela Hewlett said his condition has been moved up to ""good"" from ""stable."" In addition to the blood transfusion, doctors are giving Sacra aggressive supportive care to help his immune system fight the virus, including electrolytes and IV fluids. The Nebraska doctors have also given Sacra an experimental drug that they will not name.  He has received it every day, and his doctors say they believe it is helping. The American patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta -- Brantly and Nancy Writebol -- were given an experimental drug called ZMapp, which was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. The drug had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys, but had not been given to humans until doctors tried it in the Emory patients.  Doctors there credit the drug with playing a role in their patients' successful recoveries, but the company has said there are no more doses of the drug available. Ebola treatment: Does drug offer hope? It's possible Sacra has received another experimental drug that's in production called TKM-Ebola. Nebraska doctors think the current treatment has helped Sacra's condition significantly. The first day, Smith said, was ""pretty rocky.""  Sacra's spouse said he had to be sedated on the flight over. On the second day of treatment he was already showing signs of improvement, even with some ""abnormalities in his organ systems."" On the third day Smith told his colleagues that he liked ""the way this is going."" His doctors still want Sacra to eat more. Debbie Sacra said he is still weak. On Wednesday the hospital put an exercise bike in his room that he rode for 10 minutes before tiring out. Sacra used to ride 15 to 35 miles in one day, at least a few times a week. Because doctors still know so little about how to defeat the Ebola virus, Smith said Sacra, as a physician, has been a particularly helpful patient.  He has been able to give detailed reports about his symptoms. Debbie Sacra said the CDC has told her that they are still trying to find out how her husband got sick in the first place. He was in Liberia treating patients in an obstetrics clinic in Monrovia, not working directly with Ebola patients.  The CDC believe it happened during an emergency at the hospital, Sacra said. So far, no one else at Sacra's clinic has gotten sick. Sacra has done missionary health work for the past 25 years.  He had flown to Monrovia in August after learning his colleagues from SIM had gotten sick. Sacra worried Ebola would cause a ""domino effect"" on the already vulnerable Liberian health care system and that people with common ailments wouldn't get help. When Sacra arrived in Monrovia, that's exactly what he found.  His spouse said there wasn't a single pair of latex gloves to buy in the entire city. Without protective equipment, medical clinics shut down. She says Sacra drove from hardware store to hardware store looking for boots to protect his staff. When he was finally able to open the clinic, for some it was too late. She says dozens of pregnant women who needed Cesarean sections turned up at the clinic after having failed to find help anywhere else in the city. By the time these women arrived at Sacra's clinic ""only the mothers' lives could be saved."" Thankful for the support, but also a little embarrassed by the all the attention, Sacra and his spouse asked that Americans remember people are struggling with Ebola in Africa too. ""He wants you to share his burden for the people of Liberia and West Africa,"" Debbie Sacra said. ""Every day and every week that we don't do what we can to stop Ebola in West Africa, we are risking the possibility that it will not stay in West Africa.""","American Ebola patient in Nebraska treated with other survivor's blood .

"Darren Wilson was just one of 53 officers in a small-town police department until his encounter with an 18-year-old August 9 on a street in Ferguson, Missouri. ""He was a gentle, quiet man,"" Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Friday, referring to Wilson. ""He was a distinguished officer. He was a gentleman. ... He is, he has been, an excellent officer."" Authorities, citing death threats, had until Friday refused to release Wilson's name after he fatally shot Michael Brown. A resident of the St. Louis area, Wilson, 28, has been staying at a secure location since the shooting. It was not known whether Wilson -- an officer for six years, including four in Ferguson -- had been placed on modified assignment. Jackson told reporters the officer had faced no disciplinary action during his time on the job. Wilson lives in a neighborhood of modest homes about 20 miles from Ferguson. Neighbors, who seemed angry and worried about the sudden attention on their quiet community, were reluctant to talk about Wilson. Several said the officer left his home days ago. Brown was African-American; Wilson is white. One of Wilson's friends, Jake Shepard, said he couldn't imagine the officer killing somebody. ""I can say -- without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements -- that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,"" Shepard said. ""I am 100% positive of that because I could never imagine him even in that situation -- taking someone's life, let alone taking someone's life with malicious intent. He's just the last person on Earth that you would think to do something like that. It's just shocking. Shepard said Wilson ""has a huge heart"" and cares about people. ""He's kind of quiet when you first meet him,"" Shepard said. ""He stays quiet, he's shy. But he would give the shirt off his back for anybody."" The disclosure of the officer's identity was overshadowed by new details from the police implicating Brown as a suspect in a convenience-store robbery that was reported shortly before the shooting. Family: 'Beyond outraged'; Police chief: Officer is 'devastated' The claim was immediately greeted with skepticism and anger from some in the community who have accused Ferguson police of attempting a coverup by not releasing details earlier of the shooting or the name of the officer involved. Attorneys for Brown's family released a statement Friday saying they were ""beyond outraged"" over the timing of the robbery allegation, and accused the police of blaming the victim. ""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up,"" the statement said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told reporters, ""I think the focal point here remains to figure how and why Michael Brown was killed."" New head of Ferguson security: 'How would I feel?' The Ferguson police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was devastated by what had happened. Jackson described the officer as well-mannered and respectful. ""This is his community,"" Jackson said. ""He never wanted any of this to happen."" Read the police documents . Jackson told reporters Friday afternoon that Wilson didn't stop the young man because he was suspected in the recent robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic."" Jackson said the reported ""robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and Michael Brown."" The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area of the shooting after leaving a report of a sick person when he spotted Brown. Brown was named in the documents as the suspect in a robbery of a $50 box of cigars. The suspect roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, according to the documents. A police officer who responded to the robbery said he identified Brown as the robbery suspect by comparing surveillance images of the incident to the body of the slain teen. The images, showing a large man grabbing a smaller man by his shirt, were included with the documents released Friday. Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting and protests . The documents said four to six shots were fired. Authorities previously had not mentioned reports of a robbery in the area. Long-simmering tensions between residents, police . Police have said Brown, who was days away from starting college, according to his family, was killed in a struggle for the officer's gun. No one has disputed that Brown was unarmed, but witnesses said he was shot as he tried to distance himself and raised his hands into the air. Earlier this week, the shooting sparked protests and isolated looting incidents, and Ferguson police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Dozens of people were arrested. Residents complained about long-simmering tensions between the mostly African-American community and predominantly white police force. Two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black. The police chief is white. Only three African-Americans are on the 53-person police force. The mayor also is white, and so are five of the six city council members. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting .","Officer's friend: ""He's the last person on Earth you would think to do something like that""

"As the European Union continues its expansion into Eastern Europe and the Balkans, Serbia's Prime Minister says he is ""certain"" his country will be the bloc's next member. Ivica Dacic told CNN: ""We would like Serbia to become a member of the European Union as quickly as possible."" Serbia is aiming to become the third country from former Yugoslavia to join Europe's political and economic union, following in the footsteps of Slovenia and neighbor Croatia, who joined earlier this year. But Dacic believes Serbia does not have ""a lot of time to wait"" as its economy has suffered ""great consequences"" following the breakup of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Read more: Croatia looks to oil and gas fields in Adriatic Sea . ""The rate of unemployment is the biggest problem,"" Dacic said, referring to Serbia's 25% unemployment rate, which sits below only Spain and Greece in the EU.

Serbia, which has a lower minimum wage than China, is also struggling to cope with an exodus of skilled workers, as the country's young leave in search of work abroad. The phenomenon has left the country heavily reliant on remittance income. Read more: Croatia PM: We need Italy to recover .

Peter Stano, a spokesman for European Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule, told CNN that the speed of accession depends ""solely"" on Serbia. He said: ""Serbia has already met the political and economic criteria needed to become candidate status and to start the negotiations."" James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans expert and author of 'Kosovo: The Path to Contested Statehood in the Balkans' estimates that the process will take eight to ten years. He told CNN: ""It might well be the case that Montenegro, which has already started EU accession talks, is going to be the next one to join... getting Montenegro ready for membership is likely to be easier."" Serbia also faces questions over Kosovo, after it declared independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognize the declaration, and the European Union is trying to encourage talks between the two sides. Dacic said: ""We have always made it clear that we cannot and will not try to bring our problems to the EU with us. This is another reason why we are conducting this open dialogue in order to normalize the relationship and solve our problems before accession."" Kosovo was plunged into war in the late 1990s, pitting Kosovo Albanian insurgents against Serb security forces and Belgrade-backed Kosovo Serb paramilitaries. William Bartlett, author of 'Europe's Troubled Region,' believes EU membership for Serbia will help ease some of the political tensions with Kosovo. He said: ""By reducing political tensions, you are reducing country risk for investors and that will have a positive knock on effect for the economy.""","In 2012, the Serbian economy posted negative growth of 1.7%, according to Eurostat estimates .

"Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence? Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an ""invasion"" of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east. While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there's little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels -- and that's saying something, given the volatility over the past many months. The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid. That admission didn't end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through. All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn't accompanying them due to the ""volatile security situation"" -- a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies -- including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States -- see this convoy as perhaps Moscow's most glaring, egregious move yet. ""We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross,"" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service. Right now, Ukraine isn't planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians. To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine's government -- not his -- that's being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine. Putin expressed ""serious concern"" to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine's ""continued (military) escalation,"" according to the Kremlin. He further criticized what he characterized as ""Kiev's blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid"" into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act. ""Further delay would have been unacceptable,"" a Kremlin statement said. U.S. official warns Russia on convoys . The international community hardly embraced Putin's version of events. The British ambassador to the United Nations said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. The diplomat, Mark Lyall Grant, made no doubt about his own country's views on the convoy's entrance into Ukraine. ""It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter,"" Lyall Grant told reporters. ""It has nothing to do with humanitarianism."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the the ""so-called humanitarian convoy ... can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel."" ""The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists,"" Rasmussen said in a statement. Merkel talked not only with Putin -- during which she voiced her ""grave concern"" -- but also with U.S. President Barack Obama. The two leaders agreed that Ukraine ""has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing"" of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, purportedly by pro-Russian rebels, the White House said. The pair concurred, too, that the convoy ""is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty"" and called for the stop ""of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine."" Other U.S. officials laid into Russia publicly. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that Moscow has been told in ""very, very clear (terms) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy, to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way."" ""Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately,"" Kirby told reporters. ""Failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation."" This view was seconded by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who deemed the convoy -- which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely -- ""as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty."" The more Moscow does such things that stir instability in Ukraine, the more it will pay, according to Rhodes. ""If (Russia does) not remove the convoys, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them,"" Rhodes said. U.S. official: Up to 18,000 Russian troops on border . It's not just the Russian vehicles that crossed into Ukraine that are causing consternation. So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border. There were up to 18,000 such ""combat-ready"" troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information. The official described the units as being in a ""fully combat-capable offensive posture."" A second U.S. official said that many of the units were positioned at ""crossroads and towns"" two to 10 miles from the border. ""They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open,"" the official said. ""They aren't even hiding it."" The second official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine. Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery. The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April. The dead include Mykola Zelenec, Lithuania's honor consul in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been ""kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists."" Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels -- including militarily -- in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine's military. Russia has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self-determination, saying that Kiev is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians -- including many ethnic Russians. Even if the Russian military doesn't explicitly march into Ukraine, there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won't be one of them. He told reporters that Russia received ""official acceptance by Kiev authorities"" for the convoy, and that Moscow is staying in touch with Ukrainian officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid.

"(CNN)Put yourself in the shoes (and seventh-century black robes) of ISIS' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the mysterious boss of the terror group that is striking fear into the hearts of leaders around the world. In the past couple of years you've managed to avoid drone attacks and survive civil wars, unify militant groups in two different countries under your banner, raise an army of jihadis from across the globe, and seize a chunk of land stretching from northern Syria to central Iraq. Your newly-declared ""Islamic State"" is the size of Pennsylvania, so how do you govern it? You compartmentalize. New data from the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) has revealed that ISIS is putting governing structures in place to rule the territories the group conquers once the dust settles on the battlefield. The research shows how ISIS has gone from being a purely military force to building a system that can provide basic services, such as making sure that gas and food are available, to its new citizens. From the cabinet and the governors to the financial and legislative bodies, ISIS' bureaucratic hierarchy looks a lot like those of some of the Western countries whose values it rejects -- if you take away the democracy and add in a council to consider who should be beheaded. Baghdadi, his Cabinet advisers and his two key deputies comprise the executive branch of the government, known as ""Al Imara."" The two deputies -- Abu Ali al-Anbari and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein -- oversee Syria and Iraq, respectively. ISIS has probably split the governance of the ""Islamic State"" into Syrian and Iraqi branches simply to make it easier to run, according to Jasmine Opperman, TRAC's Southern Africa Director. ""They see the caliphate as one state, yet there are two different governments,"" Opperman told CNN. ""I believe this split is purely administrative at this time. They don't want to be seen as downplaying the caliphate, but to make it easier to govern they were forced to make a separation between Syria and Iraq."" The two deputies deliver orders to the governors in charge of the various sub-states in Syria and Iraq under ISIS control, who then instruct local councils on how to implement the executive branch's decrees on everything from media relations and recruiting to policing and financial matters. The Shura council -- which reports directly to the executive branch -- is the caliphate's religious monitor, appointed to make sure that all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law. The recent murders of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview, according to Opperman. ""Let's say a significant execution is going to take place, something that will get ISIS on the front page of the newspaper,"" Opperman said. ""It cannot be done without Shura council approval."" The Shura council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law, according to Opperman. ""The Shura council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,"" she told CNN. ""It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence."" Baghdadi -- who was once imprisoned by U.S. forces in Iraq -- seems to have incorporated the American military's own counter-insurgency mantra of ""Clear and Hold"" to win territory, establish control over the area, then get the locals to help govern it. As time goes on, ISIS is evolving into a government whose political decision-making cannot be separated from its military capabilities, according to Opperman. ""It's two sides of the same coin,"" she said. ""We've seen the military side, with the war cabinet that directs brigades. But now on the other side we're seeing how ISIS wants to govern. The two processes inform one another.""

"Chelsea Clinton is waiting to find out the gender of her baby because, as she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria, ""there are so few mysteries in life... in which any answer is a happy one."" Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, announced in April they were expecting their first child. But no other details were given -- such as the due date or the gender of the baby. Recently, when any member of the Clinton family was asked about the sex of the child, they have said they don't know because the couple wants to be surprised.

"Scientists are normally a pretty measured bunch. But in recent months, they've been resorting to some unusual language to get our attention. One top climatologist recently tweeted: ""If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd."" When scientists start swearing in public, it is time for everyone to start worrying. It's not just the scientists that are raising the alarm. This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history. If they weren't listening before, our leaders should tune in now. The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time it's no longer an environmental issue, it's an everybody issue. And time is short. The world is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic feedback loops and tipping points in the climate system, which could see the support system of life itself irrecoverably disrupted. From the release of gigantic amounts of arctic methane gas, to the rapid carbon acidification of our oceans, to apocalyptic flooding, the continued warming of our planet is the greatest challenge our species has faced. The stakes seem too gargantuan to grasp, but it's this leap in consciousness that's required for our survival. Our civilization is built on a fragile, delicately interdependent, and unsustainable relationship with the natural world. We can't afford to underestimate the massive footprint that humans have on this planet. One quarter of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere came from our industries. Our oceans are acidifying 10 times faster than at any point in earth's history. We are stretching the limits of this world. But none of this is grounds for despair. The solution to the nightmare of runaway climate change is crystal clear, and beautiful. We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation. This goal is entirely achievable. Already, 22% of the world's electricity comes from clean energy and the sector is growing fast -- we just need to put our foot on the accelerator. 'I'm on the front lines of this crisis' Getting to 100% clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies, profits and influence are all at stake. But this change is possible - we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels. In May, Denmark published a plan to get to 100% clean by 2050, at a cost of less than 20 Euros per Dane per year.   Countries as diverse as Norway and Uruguay are already nearly at 100% clean. Even China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on Earth. The question is not whether we will make this breakthrough, but whether we do so before it is too late. The clock is ticking, the increase in temperature rising steadily towards the 2 degrees Celsius mark - the red line that both scientists and governments have said poses unacceptable risk of the unthinkable. And that is why the People's Climate March is so critical. There is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking. The street is how we close that gap, because politicians will move faster when people move them. Most large-scale social change has been spurred by movements, from ending slavery to giving women the right to vote. Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements we've ever seen. On Sunday, that movement will step forward. A new cast of characters in an unprecedentedly broad coalition and cross section of society will take to the street. Climate change has gone beyond environmentalism, it's now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security. It's about the survival of everything we love. The UN Climate summit happening two days after the march is an opportunity to build momentum, no more. The Paris summit next year is when we'll need our leaders to sign a new global agreement. If we learned one thing from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, it's that one global summit will never be a panacea. But the thud of peoples boots marching across the planet together with 130 leaders meeting to discuss a collective response to this crisis heralds a fresh momentum for the road ahead. Even before the mobilization has happened, political leaders are responding to it. Some are even joining the march. In the final analysis, the question is whether we human beings are capable of being wise, farsighted, and unified enough to pass this test of survival. Many civilizations have fallen to the consequences of outstripping their environments. But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life. One way or another, we may be the last civilization. For the sake of our children and their children, we must find the hope, wisdom and unity to save it.

"(CNN) -- It's no secret that the Obama administration has been routinely using the war budget as a safety valve to pay for equipment and operations that have nothing to do with fighting wars. But as the President continues to expand U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria, it is important that this practice of using war funding to pay for unrelated items be brought to an end. The alternative -- allowing the Pentagon to use budgetary sleight of hand to evade the spending caps contained in current law -- is simply unacceptable. The levels of overfunding of the war budget -- known in Pentagon-ese as the Overseas Contingency Operations account -- have been astonishing. Independent analyses by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and the Project on Government Oversight suggest that there may be $20 to $30 billion in non-war-related expenditures in the $80 billion-plus OCO account in the 2014 budget alone. Two recent examples underscore how much excess funding has been sloshing around in the war budget. For a start, there is the fact that there is apparently enough money in the OCO account to pay for short-to-medium term expenses of the Obama administration's new war in Iraq and Syria. Yet every dollar in that account should have been justified based on the war in Afghanistan. This raises the question of what this money would have been spent on had the U.S. not become involved in countering ISIS. Second, there is talk of using the fund to buy eight additional F-35 fighter planes that won't even be ready for combat for a year or two. The next big budget battle will come with the Obama administration's proposal for Pentagon spending for FY 2016, which will be submitted to Congress next year. Independent experts have reportedly suggested that the Obama administration may ask for $15 to $20 billion in OCO spending for Iraq and Syria alone, plus whatever they assert is necessary to continue transitioning the U.S. mission in Afghanistan from direct combat against the Taliban to continued training of Afghan security forces. Congress should scrutinize this budget to make sure that every dime can be justified as having a specific connection to a current conflict, rather than a vaguely worded purpose that keeps the door open to continued use of the fund as a repository for Pentagon projects that couldn't cut it in the normal budgeting process. There are many reasons to question the wisdom of going to war in Iraq and Syria, but even members of Congress who currently support some sort of military action should be required to hold the line on unnecessary Pentagon outlays. And, as Congress casts a sharp eye on the administration's request for the war budget, it must also guard against the expansion of wasteful spending in the Pentagon's base budget. Advocates of higher Pentagon spending have seized on the crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine to argue for a lifting of the caps on Pentagon spending that currently exist. But given the levels of unnecessary spending that currently exist at the Pentagon, there is no need to lift the caps. A short list of items in the current Pentagon budget that need to be reduced before the department is allowed to request more funding should include the tens of billions spent on its vast civilian bureaucracy, the runaway funding for costly private contractors, vast overspending on basic items ranging from spare parts to prescription drugs, and unneeded and overpriced new combat systems like the F-35 and the new ballistic missile submarine. We shouldn't let the Pentagon use the conflict in Iraq and Syria to continue entrenched patterns of wasteful spending that add nothing to our national security. The ultimate proof that the Pentagon remains overfunded is the fact that it cannot manage a simple audit. The department can't even properly figure out how many contractors it has, what it is paying them, or what kinds and amounts of spare equipment and parts it has on hand. This sorry state of affairs is an invitation to fraud and abuse that is costing taxpayers untold billions every year. The last time the United States went to war, Pentagon spending was given a free pass that allowed it to grow to the highest levels since World War II with little accountability over how those funds were spent. As it considers next year's budget request, Congress has a responsibility to make the Pentagon justify every dollar of spending it is asking for. The alternative could be tens or even hundreds of billions in unnecessary expenditures in the years to come.","Pentagon uses budgetary sleight of hand to evade spending caps, says William Hartung .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Mark Pryor's newest campaign videos are hammering home the key issues that he's hoping will energize female voters to come out in November: Domestic violence and equal pay. The Arkansas Democrat released a pair of videos on his YouTube page Wednesday attacking his Republican rival Rep. Tom Cotton for voting against equal pay legislation and against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. The crucial Senate race is locked in a statistical dead heat, and Pryor is playing up his advantage among women. ""We've got to do something to break this cycle of domestic violence and Tom Cotton is not doing anything to help,"" Paulette Hill, the director of a 24-hour emergency domestic violence shelter, says in one video called ""The End"". ""What's Cotton got against women?"" Courtney, from Little Rock, Arkansas, says in another. ""Courtney"" is a regular in Pryor's ads, appearing in at least four videos this year and focusing specifically issues relevant to female voters. The videos also come one day after Pryor, the only remaining Arkansas Democrat in Congress, launched a ""Women for Pryor"" tour to rally the demographic group that favors him over his Republican rival 48 to 39%, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll released last week. That same poll showed the pair locked in a statistical dead heat, with Pryor holding a two-point advantage. A CNN poll released in early September showed Cotton leading by the same margin. Pryor's latest videos on domestic violence strikes a sharply critical tone as the ad's subject, Hill, says Cotton ""voted against protecting women and children from domestic abuse."" Cotton campaign spokesman David Ray pushed back against the ad claiming Pryor is ""making ridiculous election-year accusations."" ""While Senator Pryor is busy perpetrating a fictitious 'War on Women,' it is the Obama-Pryor economic policies that have harmed so many Arkansas women by increasing the cost of everything from health insurance to gasoline to groceries,"" Ray said in an email. And the campaign's response echoed the theme of the Cotton's latest minute-long ad posted on his campaign website the same day Pryor launched his ""Women for Pryor"" tour. The minute-long ad features a woman, Gina, who says Pryor's vote for Obamacare has hurt her small business. The ad also opens with Cotton walking alongside another woman. But Pryor's ad focuses on the context of Cotton's vote regarding the re-authorization of VAWA, and notes that one in four women are victims of domestic abuse -- a statistic backed by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. This won't be the first time Cotton has had to defend his vote on the domestic violence legislation, which he has said was too broad. Cotton's website reads, ""Violence against women is unacceptable, period."" The Pryor-approved ad also states that Cotton was the only Congressman from Arkansas to ""vote this way"" on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Fellow Arkansas Reps. Steve Womack, Rick Crawford and Tim Griffin were also part of the 138 Republicans who voted against the final act last year. Those Congressmen had voted in favor of a Republican alternative though, but Cotton said no to both. The state's other Senator, John Boozman, also voted against the bill that passed the Senate, but voted for the Republican alternative. But the Pryor ad is trying to paint a stark contrast with Hill closing the ad by saying: . ""There's a big difference between Mark Pryor and Tom Cotton, one wants to protect women and children, the other doesn't.""","Pryor's campaign released a pair of videos Wednesday, both highlighting women's issues.
Recent polling shows Cotton and Pryor are in a statistical dead heat.

"President Barack Obama told a United Nations meeting on Tuesday that pollution must be contained to address climate change. Specifically, he called out China, saying that the most populous country on Earth, with the fastest increase in carbon pollution, must join the United States to lead the rest of the world in carbon reduction. ""We have a responsibility to lead,"" Obama said to applause. ""That's what big nations have to do."" Obama was speaking at the U.N. Climate Summit, a one-day meeting hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and open to leaders of all 193 U.N. member states. Wednesday begins the U.N. General Assembly meeting, which has marked climate change as one of its top issues as well. The event offers Obama a chance to shift the conversation away from the threat posed by ISIS, Ebola, and other national security matters and focus on an issue where he can tout accomplishments. Hours after ordering strikes on Syria, Obama said that the ""urgent and growing threat of climate change"" would ultimately ""define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other"" issue. Obtaining broad agreement to combat global climate change does not come easy, an issue the President addressed. For instance, China has been reluctant to stem the influx of energy production, as it's in more demand. And in the United States, the issue is controversial, with some claiming to believe that humans don't cause climate change. ""In each of our countries, there are interests that will be resistant to action. In each country there is a suspicion that if we act and other countries don't -- that we will be at an economic disadvantage. But we have to lead,"" Obama said. Obama painted a tragic picture caused by a changing climate in the U.S., detailing floods in Miami, wildfires in the West, hurricanes in the north and drought followed by excessive rain in the middle of the country. Obama noted that some countries are more impacted than others by climate change, but said, ""No nation is immune."" Actions announced . The President unveiled a series of actions to urge the international community to cut emissions. He also announced measures to help developing countries better prepare for climate change. While efforts are still under way to meet and exceed goals set for 2015, the President outlined a partnership plan to meet additional carbon reduction goals by 2020. ""We cannot condemn our children and their children to a future that is beyond their capacity to repair -- not when we have the means, the technological innovation and the scientific imagination to begin the work of repairing it right now,"" he said. ""I believe in the words of Dr. King that there is such a thing as being too late."" Actions taken so far . In June 2013, Obama announced a plan to cut carbon pollution, including directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to establish new emission standards for active coal plants in the United States, and working with other countries including China and India -- two of the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases -- to establish new plans for addressing pollution globally. The plan included many executive actions -- things that don't need approval from Congress, such as new standards for coal plants -- that were controversial. A year later, in June, 2014, the EPA proposed a new plan designed to cut carbon emissions by 30% by the year 2030. That plan has become a popular subject in several Senate races this year, including West Virginia and Kentucky. Still to be done . For the environmental community, the next big frontier to tackle is methane emissions -- different from carbon emissions but, environmentalists say, just as important in the fight against climate change. ""For us the big next steps include making a decision to address methane pollution from the oil and gas sector,"" said John Coequyt, director of the international climate campaign at the Sierra Club, one of the country's oldest environmental organizations. ""That's one of the biggest unresolved pieces."" Polling . A demonstration in New York on Sunday featuring appearances from U.N. leader Ban and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, among others, turned out tens of thousands of supporters, but polling indicates that many Americans do not list addressing climate change as an issue they believe should be a top priority for the President and Congress. A Pew research poll conducted earlier this year found that 29% of respondents listed ""dealing with global warming"" as a top policy priority -- and that number has remained virtually unchanged since Obama took office in 2009. And  a Gallup poll conducted in March 2014, found that a little under a fourth of Americans -- 24% -- list climate change as a national problem that they worry about ""a great deal."" However, when it comes to addressing climate change, polling indicates most Americans back action. A Gallup poll from June found that 65% of those surveyed support the government tightening pollution regulations on businesses.","President Obama gives address on climate change at United Nations on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Few dinosaurs have as interesting a back story as the spinosaurus. In life, it dominated the waterways -- a 50-foot-long behemoth that employed its blade-like claws and conical, razor-sharp teeth to annihilate its prey. It chomped down on sharks for breakfast. Ninety-five million years after its extinction, this strangely aquatic dinosaur -- the only one of its kind that we know of -- has had to contend with Nazis, bomb raids, armed gangs and mysterious moustachioed men. Its story has all the makings of a spy novel. The most recent chapter in the spinosaurus' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when Nizar Ibrahim, a German-Moroccan palaeontologist from the University of Chicago, uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in Morocco's Sahara Desert. It also happens to be the only remaining skeleton of the species, as all other physical evidence of the spinosaurus was obliterated 70 years ago. ""It's a really mysterious dinosaur. (Until now), all we had was little bits and pieces, tantalizing clues and drawings of a partial skeleton that had been destroyed in World War II,"" explains Ibrahim. Early bones . The first, and up until recently only, spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer -- then one of the world's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of North Africa. For years, Stromer unearthed a paleontological treasure trove in the Sahara. ""Ernst Stromer was really a very productive scientist. He was an explorer, and he was really the first person to resurrect the lost world of Africa's dinosaurs in a big way,"" says Ibrahim. Unfortunately, his luck turned with the onset of a war that would rob him of his sons -- two died in battle while the third barely survived a five-year imprisonment -- and his life's work. Most of his finds were stored at a palaeontology museum in Munich. He begged the director to relocate the dinosaur collection, but was refused, and in April 1944, an allied air raid destroyed the institution and Stromer's findings. ""Everything went up in flames, and Stromer lost all these incredible finds in a single night,"" recalls Ibrahim, who considers Stromer his role model. ""Resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring Stromer back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology,"" he says. The man with the mustache . Ibrahim's hunt for the spinosaurus began in 2008 when he met a moustachioed Moroccan fossil hunter who was proffering rare-looking samples from a cardboard box. ""One piece looked really interesting. It was a blade-shaped piece of bone and I did think at the time that maybe this is a chunk of the spine of spinosaurus,"" he recalls. Years later, colleagues from the Natural History Museum in Milan showed him similar samples of what they, too, believed was a partial skeleton of a spinosaurus. ""It was spectacular. We had leg bones and spines and ribs and skull bones. It was very exciting, but we had a big problem. We had no idea where the skeleton came from, (which) means we don't know anything about the environment the animal lived in, the geological context, or if the bones were found in the same place,"" he says. With a closer look, however, the bones looked familiar. Ibrahim suspected they not only came from the same site as the specimen he was shown in Morocco, but from the same dinosaur. What followed was a five-year hunt for the man with the mustache -- it was the only detail Ibrahim remembered about the encounter. In 2013, Ibrahim called off the search while sipping mint tea with colleagues in a Moroccan cafe. ""I think I was a little naive and very optimistic, and ... we thought, OK, we can't find the guy, so that's the end of our mission impossible. Just like in a bad Hollywood movie, the very moment when I was ready to throw in the towel, a man walked passed our table. The man had a mustache and it was the man I had been looking for."" After Ibrahim caught up with him, the man took him back to where he first made the finds. Further excavations dug up even more bones, most likely from the same animal. The collection painted the most complete picture to date of what the animal looked like and how it lived. Mainly, Ibrahim was able to ascertain that spinosaurus was an aquatic dinosaur (a first; previously, there was no known evidence of such a creature). Dense bones -- rare in dinosaurs but common in penguins -- provided the animal with buoyancy in rivers, while a crocodile-like snout helped it both to breathe and sense movement underwater. A seven-foot ""sail"" on the animal's back helped it navigate through the seas. The findings were published in the journal Science last month, are the cover story of this month's issue of National Geographic, and are also currently the subject of an exhibit at the National Geographic Museum in Washington. The Sahara: Land of giants . The Sahara of today can be pretty inhospitable. The land is vast and remote, and offers few visual clues. Temperatures rarely dip below 100 F, and high winds make for some ferocious sandstorms. The sand is also riddled with booby traps: Scorpions, snakes and landmines -- not to mention the odd armed militia doing the rounds -- which tend to keep most palaeontologists at bay. Ibrahim, however, is addicted to the landscape. ""The Sahara is a magical place. You'll find fossils of giant fish and river turtles and crocodile-like predators, and that's when it hits you: This place was very, very different 95 million years ago. It was a bizarre world, really like a different planet,"" he says. In place of the current, seemingly endless expanse of sand, there was a river system that housed all manner of strange creatures. ""I call it 'the river of giants.' (There were) giant sawfish and lungfish, flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs."" It's a place Ibrahim is eager to revisit. ""Let's just say this isn't the last time I travel to the Sahara in search of lost worlds and bizarre creatures,"" he says.","Nizar Ibrahim found the most complete skeleton of spinosaurus .
It's the first known aquatic dinosaur .
The only other skeleton was destroyed in a bomb raid .
It's bigger than T-Rex ."
"John Henson -- a son of the late, great children's entertainment visionary Jim Henson --  died after a ""sudden, massive heart attack,"" his family's company said. The Jim Henson Company announced the death of the 48-year-old son of its iconic founder in a Facebook post Saturday. He died Friday while at home with one of his two daughters, the post said. John Henson is also survived by his wife, Gyongyi, and his siblings Lisa, Cheryl, Brian and Heather. Two other members of his family had top jobs in their father's namesake company, with Brian Henson as chairman and Lisa Henson as CEO. John Henson is listed prominently as one of five members of  ""the Henson family"" on the company's website. John Henson served as a shareholder and board member of The Jim Henson Company. According to imdb.com, John Henson was active in the family business in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, perhaps most notably for his portrayal of Sweetums, a large, gruff-looking, lovable character on ""The Muppets."" His father, Jim, died suddenly in 1990, after a celebrated career in which he launched shows like ""The Muppets,"" ""Fraggle Rock"" and created beloved characters from ""Sesame Street"" such as Big Bird, Elmo, the Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch.

"(CNN) -- My heart goes out to Brittany Maynard, who is dying of brain cancer and who wrote last week about her desire for what is often referred to as ""death with dignity."" Yet while I have every sympathy for her situation, it is important to remember that for every case such as this, there are hundreds -- or thousands -- more people who could be significantly harmed if assisted suicide is legal. The legalization of assisted suicide always appears acceptable when the focus is solely on an individual. But it is important to remember that doing so would have repercussions across all of society, and would put many people at risk of immense harm. After all, not every terminal prognosis is correct, and not everyone has a loving husband, family or support system. As an advocate working on behalf of disability rights for 37 years, and as someone who uses a wheelchair, I am all too familiar with the explicit and implicit pressures faced by people living with chronic or serious disability or disease. But the reality is that legalizing assisted suicide is a deadly mix with the broken, profit-driven health care system we have in the United States. At less than $300, assisted suicide is, to put it bluntly, the cheapest treatment for a terminal illness. This means that in places where assisted suicide is legal, coercion is not even necessary. If life-sustaining expensive treatment is denied or even merely delayed, patients will be steered toward assisted suicide, where it is legal. This problem applies to government-funded health care as well. In 2008, came the story that Barbara Wagner, a Springfield, Oregon, woman diagnosed with lung cancer and prescribed a chemotherapy drug by her personal physician, had reportedly received a letter from the Oregon Health Plan stating that her chemotherapy treatment would not be covered. She said she was told that instead, they would pay for, among other things, her assisted suicide. ""To say to someone: ""We'll pay for you to die, but not for you to live"" -- it's cruel,"" she said. Another Oregon resident, 53-year-old Randy Stroup, was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Like Wagner, Stroup was reportedly denied approval of his prescribed chemotherapy treatment and instead offered coverage for assisted suicide. Meanwhile, where assisted suicide is legal, an heir or abusive caregiver may steer someone towards assisted suicide, witness the request, pick up the lethal dose, and even give the drug -- no witnesses are required at the death, so who would know? This can occur despite the fact that diagnoses of terminal illness are often wrong, leading people to give up on treatment and lose good years of their lives. True, ""safeguards"" have been put in place where assisted suicide is legal. But in practical terms, they provide no protection. For example, people with a history of depression and suicide attempts have received the lethal drugs. Michael Freeland of Oregon reportedly had a 40-year history of significant depression, yet he received lethal drugs in Oregon. These risks are simply not worth the price of assisted suicide. Available data suggests that pain is rarely the reason why people choose assisted suicide. Instead, most people do so because they fear burdening their families or becoming disabled or dependent. Anyone dying in discomfort that is not otherwise relievable, may legally today, in all 50 states, receive palliative sedation, wherein the patient is sedated to the point at which the discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place peacefully. This means that today there is a legal solution to painful and uncomfortable deaths, one that does not raise the very serious problems of legalizing assisted suicide. The debate about assisted suicide is not new, but voters and elected officials grow very wary of it when they learn the facts. Just this year alone, assisted suicide bills were rejected in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, and stalled in New Jersey, due to bipartisan, grassroots opposition from a broad coalition of groups spanning the political spectrum from left to right, including disability rights organizations, medical professionals and associations, palliative care specialists, hospice workers and faith-based organizations. Assisted suicide is a unique issue that breaks down ideological boundaries and requires us to consider those potentially most vulnerable in our society. All this means that we should, as a society, strive for better options to address the fear and uncertainty articulated by Brittany Maynard. But if assisted suicide is legal, some people's lives will be ended without their consent, through mistakes and abuse. No safeguards have ever been enacted or proposed that can properly prevent this outcome, one that can never be undone. Ultimately, when looking at the bigger picture, and not just individual cases, one thing becomes clear: Any benefits from assisted suicide are simply not worth the real and significant risks of this dangerous public policy.","Legal assisted suicide can seem acceptable on individual basis, says Marilyn Golden .
But in a profit-driven health care system like the U.S. it can be dangerous, Golden says .
Diagnoses of terminal illness are often wrong, writes Golden ."
"(CNN) -- No one who works full-time -- in this, one of the wealthiest nations on Earth -- should have to raise a family in poverty. That is the fundamental principle behind our work to increase the national minimum wage. And today, on 10/10, National Minimum Wage Day, we are saying louder than ever that hard work should be rewarded with fair pay of at least $10.10 per hour. Every day for low-wage workers is filled with struggle and anxiety. We have heard from and visited with people making heartbreaking decisions about which bill to pay, which meal to skip, which growing child will get a pair of shoes this season and whether to buy a gallon of milk or a gallon of gas. For many of us, an unexpected car repair is an inconvenience; for a minimum-wage worker, it is a catastrophe. The national minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is unconscionably low. It is an affront to our values, and it has remained unchanged for more than five years. During that time, the cost of food, utilities, transportation and other essentials has gone up, but low-wage workers' paychecks have remained the same. In fact, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has been eroding steadily (PDF) since its peak in the late 1960s. Today's minimum wage would have to be well above $10 per hour to equal the purchasing power of the minimum wage in 1968. Too many low-wage workers must rely on public assistance just to keep their heads above water. Raising the minimum wage would allow up to 3.6 million people to come off the food stamp rolls. These workers would have the dignity and satisfaction of buying food with their own paychecks while American taxpayers would no longer have to pony up billions of dollars to subsidize the large companies that build wealth for shareholders on the backs of their workers. Fortunately, many businesses are turning away from this low-road business model. Poll after poll shows that employers -- especially small businesses -- are rallying around $10.10. We've seen it firsthand in visits to these businesses, where they know that higher wages strengthen their bottom line by increasing employee loyalty, retention and productivity. Businesses also know that they need customers with money in their pockets. When working families get a raise, they don't stash it in offshore tax havens. They pump it right back into their local economies at the grocery store, hardware store or auto body shop. Increasing the minimum wage boosts consumer demand, growing our economy and helping communities thrive. Henry Ford understood this. A century ago, long before there was a federally mandated minimum wage, he doubled the pay of the workers on his assembly line because he thought they should be able to afford the very cars they were making. He said, ""If we can distribute high wages, then that money is going to be spent and it will serve to make storekeepers and distributors and manufacturers and workers in other lines more prosperous. ... Countrywide high wages spell countrywide prosperity."" We, Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. George Miller, have offered legislation to increase the national minimum wage to $10.10, which would benefit 28 million workers. Polls show this increase is supported by an overwhelming percentage of Americans across party lines. But unprecedented partisan intransigence in Washington has kept it from moving forward. The Republican leadership of the House of Representatives won't even bring the minimum wage bill up for a vote. And this past spring, it was filibustered in the Senate; a minority of senators refused to even debate this proposal that a strong majority of the American people clearly support. The good news is that many state and local leaders are taking matters into their own hands. Emboldened by grass-roots momentum and a groundswell of public support, they are raising the minimum wage in their own jurisdictions. Thirteen states plus the District of Columbia have done so since the beginning of 2013, showing once again that sometimes change doesn't come from Washington but rather to Washington. President Obama is also using his executive authority to do what he can. Last week, the Labor Department took the final steps to implement the president's executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for workers on federal service and construction contracts. Too many of our hardest-working neighbors -- people who prepare our food, stock our grocery shelves, clean our offices, care for our children and seniors and more -- are working harder than ever but falling further behind. Today, on 10/10, we are proud to fight for them to get $10.10, and we'll continue to do so every day until we succeed.","Writers: No one who works full-time in the U.S. should have to raise a family in poverty .

"Mount Ontake, Japan (CNN) -- At least 31 people are presumed dead after rescuers found them showing no signs of life Sunday near the summit of a Japanese volcano that started erupting a day earlier. Police said the people were in a state of ""cardiac arrest,"" meaning that they were discovered without a pulse and weren't breathing but hadn't been declared dead by a doctor. A coroner confirmed the first four deaths Sunday. Rescue teams had begun searching Sunday for dozens of climbers who were caught by the sudden eruption of Mount Ontake. The volcano in central Japan unleashed a huge cloud of ash late Saturday morning that billowed down the mountainside and engulfed hikers in its path. Witnesses described hearing a sound like thunder when the eruption began. The exact number of people unaccounted for was unclear, as officials were uncertain how many had already made it off the mountain. Desperate relatives . Relatives of the missing gathered near Mount Ontake on Sunday desperately seeking information. Among them was Kiyokazu Tokoro from nearby Aichi prefecture, whose son, Yuki, was hiking on the volcano with his girlfriend. He said he knew they were near the summit at the time of the eruption because his son's girlfriend had sent a photo to a friend minutes beforehand. ""All I can do is beg for your help to get information,"" he told CNN. ""Please help us."" Authorities estimated there were 200 to 250 hikers in the area at the time of the eruption. Most of them were reported to have managed to make the long trek down the mountain. But some people remained trapped in several lodges on Mount Ontake, and others were missing altogether, local authorities said. More than 350 rescue workers -- a mix of police, firefighters and military personnel -- began climbing two separate routes up the mountain on Sunday morning, authorities in the nearby village of Otaki said. Alert level raised . Aside from those in cardiac arrest, more than 25 people were reported to have been injured, 10 of them seriously, according to the government of Nagano prefecture, where the volcano is situated. Helicopters ferried some injured people off the mountainside. Among the climbers trapped in the cottages, at least 11 were injured, officials in Otaki said. They said they had observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters) of volcanic ash covering the ground in some areas. The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. That means the public is advised to not approach the volcano, the summit of which is at an altitude of 10,060 feet (3,067 meters). The agency warned that another large eruption could take place in the next six days or so. Small continuous eruptions continued Sunday. The volcano's plume of smoke and ash was reported to have disrupted air travel in Japan, causing delays at several airports. Popular destination . Mount Ontake, the second tallest volcano in Japan, after Mount Fuji, is a popular destination for hikers, especially in the fall when the foliage's rich autumn colors are on display. About 250 people living near the mountain have decided to remain in their homes, police said. The last major eruption of Mount Ontake, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Tokyo, took place in 1979, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institute. That eruption lasted months, spewing out more than 200,000 tons of ash, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported. Smaller scale activity was reported in 1984, 1991 and 2007. CNN's Will Ripley reported from Mount Ontake, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Please help us,"" says a father seeking information on his missing son .

"The Pentagon's intelligence arm has assessed with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile, though the reliability is believed to be ""low."" Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing on Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. The surprise development comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks, including that of a possible nuclear strike. The Obama administration calculates a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time. But a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles believed being readied for tests have been armed with any nuclear material. Pentagon spokesman George Little said later Thursday, ""It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage"" of the DIA study. That stance was echoed by James R. Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, who said the statement read by Rep. Doug Lamborn ""is not an intelligence community assessment. Moreover, North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile."" Lamborn, R-Colorado, read from a declassified version of the DIA assessment at a House Armed Services Committee hearing. ""DIA assess with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles, however, the reliability will be low."" Reliability is apparently a reference to the accuracy of the missiles. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who was testifying before the House committee, appeared to be caught off guard when asked by Lamborn whether he agreed with the DIA assessment. ""Well, I haven't seen it,"" Dempsey replied. ""And you said it's not publicly released, so I -- I choose not to comment on it."" It is was not clear whether other U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA, agree with the defense analysis. The U.S. intelligence about North Korea revealed Thursday was ""mistakenly"" marked as declassified, according to an administration and a defense source. But Lamborn told CNN's ""AC360"" he acted properly, reciting declassified information. ""Whether it was a mistake or not, I can't answer that,"" Lamborn said of the information release. ""Given the seriousness of the threat, this is something that I think people do need to know about."" A House Armed Services Committee aide said staffers checked with the DIA to confirm the passage was not classified before Lamborn read it. North Korea's missile capabilities . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""We do not have any independent information to verify"" the DIA study's assessment. Tough talk, raising a missile . Is North Korea serious about military action or is it just testing the world? A missile had been briefly raised to an upright firing position, stoking concerns that a launch was imminent, a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday. Later, another U.S. official said it had been tucked back into its launcher. In more tough talk from Pyongyang, a government agency was quoted by the state-run media as saying that ""war can break out any moment."" After meeting privately with Ban in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama called on North Korea to tone down the rhetoric. ""We agree now is the time for North Korea to end the kind of belligerent approach they have been taking and try to lower temperatures,"" Obama said during a photo opportunity. ""No one wants to see a conflict on the Korean Peninsula."" War of words escalates: Timeline of a crisis . Ban called on Chinese diplomats to ""exercise their leadership and influence"" with North Korea to reduce tensions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, during an upcoming visit, will tell Chinese leaders that Pyongyang is, as one senior administration official said, ""putting China's own interests at risk."" The United States wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and to carry a strong message to the North that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China's goal, said the official and a senior State Department official. The latest move by the North could signify that a much-feared launch is less imminent. It could also mean the government was testing the equipment. The first U.S. official cautioned that the raising of the missile could have been just a trial run to ensure the equipment works or an effort to ""mess"" with the United States and the allies that are watching for a launch at any time. So far, South Koreans -- who've heard the cross-border bombast before -- are taking the swagger in stride. Washington regards much of the North's saber rattling as bluster. But no one is taking any chances as the daily clamor of threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's government shows no sign of letting up. The official declined to specify what type of intelligence led the United States to conclude the medium-range missile -- a Musudan -- was in a firing position. Should I stay or should I go? Expats mull future there . The Musudan is an untested weapon that South Korea says has a range as far as 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers). It could reach as far as Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases, and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems. The United States and South Korean militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of North Korea. Japan has deployed defense systems. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Thursday that Kim is using rhetoric to solidify his base within his country and its military. ""North Korea is one of those countries that's an army with a country, not a country with an army,"" said Rogers. Opinion: Why North Korea worries Dick Cheney . The mood in South Korea? 'Very ordinary' Life is generally continuing as normal in the region, however, despite the North's barrage of recent threats, which have included warnings to foreigners on the peninsula about their safety in the event of conflict. South Koreans, who have experienced decades of North Korean rage and posturing -- and occasional localized attacks -- have gone about their daily business without alarm. ""South Korea has been living under such threats from the past, and we are always prepared for it,"" South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told CNN Wednesday. He called the current climate ""a very ordinary situation."" Chinese tourism: The good, the bad and the backlash . South urges dialogue over industrial zone . The difficulties at the Kaesong industrial zone, a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, are among the few tangible signs of the tensions. Pyongyang repeated a threat to permanently close the industrial zone, which it jointly operates with the South, accusing South Korean President Park Geun-hye of putting the manufacturing complex at risk. The South Korean government, meanwhile, urged Pyongyang to work to resolve the situation through dialogue. ""Pyongyang should come to the bargaining table immediately,"" Ryoo said. North Korea has pulled its more than 50,000 workers out of the complex, which is on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas, and blocked personnel and supply trucks from entering it from South Korea. In a statement reported Thursday by state-run media, the North Korean government said that what happens at the complex in the coming days ""entirely depends on the attitude of the South Korean authorities."" DMZ: Tensions high at knife-edge of Korean conflict . U.S. intelligence cites direct threats . The dangers posed by North Korea came up Thursday at a separate House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats. Clapper said the United States believes the primary objective of Kim's bellicose rhetoric is to ""consolidate and affirm his power"" and to show he is ""in control of North Korea."" Clapper said he doesn't think Kim ""has much of an endgame"" other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power which ""entitles him to negotiation, accommodation and, presumably, aid."" But in a statement for the record before the committee, Clapper reiterated that the nation's ""nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the United States and to the security environment in East Asia."" Since December, North Korea has put a satellite in orbit atop a long-range rocket; conducted a nuclear bomb test, its third since 2006; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States, though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability. Its most recent nuclear test, in February, resulted in tougher U.N. sanctions, which infuriated Pyongyang, prompting it to sharpen its threats. Annual military exercises in South Korea by U.S. and South Korean troops, which often upset the North, have added to the tensions, especially when the United States drew attention to shows of strength such as a practice mission by B-2 stealth bombers.","Congressman said he used declassified information .

"The Arkansas Supreme Court on Friday struck down the state law governing how death-penalty inmates are executed by lethal injection. The court ruled 5-2 that ""the legislature has abdicated its responsibility and passed to the executive branch ... the unfettered discretion to determine all protocols and procedures, most notably the chemicals to be used, for a state execution."" The ruling does not invalidate Arkansas' death penalty but does leave the state without a way to execute prisoners because it struck down the entire law dealing with how the death penalty is carried out. That includes the designation of electrocution as the backup method in case of a legal challenge to lethal injection. Associate Justice Jim Gunter, writing for the majority, said the law does not include an explicit ""severabilty clause"" that would allow portions of the law to stand even if others were found unconstitutional. It is unclear whether the state will appeal the ruling, but Gov. Mike Beebe said he does not plan to call legislators into a special session to draft a new law. ""I will review what the options are, talk to the attorney general and key legislative leaders and will study the way other states have handled these rulings. I hope to have a proposed remedy in the next few months,"" he said. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by death row inmates who alleged that Arkansas' Method of Execution Act of 2009 violated the state Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. The ruling partially affirms a decision by the Pulaski County Circuit Court judge who found the law unconstitutional on grounds that it granted too much discretion to corrections authorities in determining the cocktail of chemicals used in executions. The law allowed corrections officials to choose from a short list of drugs or select or ""any other chemical or chemicals"" to put inmates to death. The court has previously ruled that lawmakers must include ""reasonable guidelines"" for executive branch agencies to follow in writing laws. The law governing executions didn't follow that rule, Gunter wrote. ""The statute provides no guidance and no general policy with regard to the procedures for the (Arkansas Department of Corrections) to implement lethal injections,"" Gunter wrote. The Supreme Court agreed that the measure violated the state's separation of powers doctrine but said the circuit judge erred in striking only the portion of the law that allowed corrections officials complete discretion in crafting the chemical blend. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Karen R. Baker wrote that the ruling flies in the face of rulings in other states, including Texas, Florida, Delaware and Idaho, finding that giving discretion to corrections officials does not violate state separation of powers provisions. The law provides a suitable ""general framework"" within which corrections officials must operate, she wrote. The court also lifted an injunction imposed by the circuit judge prohibiting state officials from acquiring execution chemicals ""by any means that violates state or federal law,"" according to the Supreme Court ruling. In their lawsuit, inmates had argued that the state had violated federal drug-control laws by obtaining a drug -- sodium thiopental -- from a retailer in the United Kingdom. The drug's manufacturer stopped making it in the United States in 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials and then scrapped plans to make it in Italy after authorities there objected to its likely use in U.S. executions. Since, shortages of the drugs have disrupted executions in several states, including Texas and Arizona. Federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents also seized some of the drug from Georgia officials in 2011. Justices said the injunction was inappropriate because the inmates had not asked for an injunction against using sodium thiopental from any source other than the U.K. retailer Dream Pharma. Arkansas last executed a prisoner in 2005, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Currently, 40 prisoners are under death sentences in Arkansas, according to the state Department of Corrections website.","Governor says no plans for special session on death penalty law .

"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says it is firing four senior officials after allegations and investigations of long wait times and other problems at VA medical facilities. Directors at the VA health care systems in Pittsburgh, central Alabama and Dublin, Georgia, are in the process of being fired, and the VA's deputy chief procurement director in Washington is also in line to lose her job, the VA headquarters in Washington said in recent news releases. The Pittsburgh move comes almost two years after CNN first reported about an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a VA hospital there. Part of CNN's 2012 investigation found 21 patients at the Pittsburgh VA who were diagnosed with the disease, five of whom died within 30 days of being diagnosed. VA officials knew about problems and dangers with the medical center's water system, but did not disclose that information for almost a year. In a followup investigation, the VA's inspector general found that the Pittsburgh VA's staff did not take the proper steps to prevent the spread of Legionella, such as flushing water faucets, and that pneumonia patients were not properly tested for the disease. The director of that hospital, Terry Gerigk Wolf, has been on administrative leave since June and is now in the process of being fired for ""conduct unbecoming a Senior Executive."" Wolf has the right to appeal that decision before the firing is complete, a VA representative said. ""VA will actively and aggressively pursue disciplinary action on those who violate our values. There should be no doubt that when we discover evidence of wrongdoing, we will hold employees accountable,"" VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson said. The firings are a direct result of wrongdoing found by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Office of Accountability Review, including significant delays and wait times of veterans, manipulation of appointment data, ""neglect of duty,"" inappropriate handling of VA contracts and misconduct at VA facilities. VA inspector general admits wait times contributed to vets' deaths . The firings also follow a yearlong investigation by CNN that found numerous instances of delays in care and, at times, deaths of U.S. veterans at VA facilities across the country. The reports sparked a national outrage, which led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and prompted numerous House and Senate hearings. That resulted in a new law revising the VA health care system designed to help veterans get faster care. The new law, which was passed this summer and signed by President Obama, also gives VA Secretary Robert McDonald more authority to quickly fire top executives. The VA also announced that John Goldman, the director of the VA medical center in Dublin, is in the process of being fired after the VA's inspector general revealed that the hospital's staff closed out more than 1,500 patient appointments to hide long wait times in order to meet goals set by VA headquarters. Goldman announced he was retiring four days before his removal was made public. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida and chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, who led the charge for more accountability at the VA and whose committee has been instrumental in pressing for details of wrongdoing at VA facilities, said Tuesday that he is not certain the new process of firings is enough. ""Bragging about the proposed removal of someone who has already announced his retirement can only be described as disingenuous. Department leaders must not tolerate this instance of what appears to be blatant deceit. Such semantic sleights of hand are insulting to the families struck by the VA scandal and only do more harm to the department's badly damaged credibility,"" he said in a statement to CNN. ""Congress acted with near unanimity to give the VA secretary greater authority to actually fire failing executives, not just propose removing them. Because this is merely a proposed action, we need to reserve judgment on whether appropriate accountability has been achieved."" In a statement Tuesday, VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson said, ""Recently, VA announced disciplinary actions against four individuals, consistent with the law that Congress just passed. If Congress wants VA to implement a different law, it should pass one.  Until then, VA will use the authority it has been given fully and responsibly to protect the health, safety, and well-being of our nation's veterans while at the same time ensuring that disciplinary actions are based on the best possible evidence from entities such as the Inspector General, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Justice Department, so that these actions stick."" Part of CNN's investigation brought national attention to a secret waiting list at the Phoenix VA and to charges by whistleblowers that veterans had died there, waiting for care. All of the charges have been substantiated by the inspector general. Just after those revelations, three top officials at that VA facility, including Director Sharon Helman, were placed on administrative leave and are in the process of being fired. Helman is still being paid. The VA is also in the process of firing James Talton, the director of the Central Alabama VA Healthcare System, where the inspector general confirmed this year that a lack of trained appointment schedulers contributed to some delays and dysfunction in the hospital's podiatry clinic. A 2012 inspector general report also found that Central Alabama VA patients did not receive timely colorectal cancer screenings. VA audits this year showed that more than 6,000 patients waited at least 90 days for care at this medical center and that some schedulers there were instructed to hide long wait times. The fourth VA employee being fired, Deputy Chief Procurement Officer Susan Taylor, inappropriately influenced the awarding of VA contracts to a private company and interfered with an investigation into the matter, according to a report by the VA's inspector general. Taylor reportedly gave preferential treatment to the company FedBid, an online marketplace, and had an affair with a former employee of several government agencies who had ties to the company. The VA's inspector general stated that Taylor ""improperly disclosed non-public VA information to unauthorized persons, misused her position and VA resources for private gain, and engaged in a prohibited personnel practice."" On Tuesday, the VA also announced that Joan Ricard, the director of the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital in Chicago, will retire at the end of this month, after 40 years at the VA, including two years as director of the hospital. Ricard has, like other VA officials, been at the center of controversy in recent months. At Hines, like other VA hospitals, CNN and other media outlets reported allegations made by whistle blowers about veterans being kept on secret wait lists, and hiding of actual delays in care, while administrators received bonuses.","Officials in Pittsburgh, Alabama and Georgia are in the process of being fired .

"(CNN) -- Is the ring the thing? Rumors are flying that Lady Gaga and her boyfriend, ""Chicago Fire"" actor Taylor Kinney, either have made things ""official"" with a commitment ceremony or are soon to head down the aisle. The talk heated up two weeks ago after actress Sophia Bush shared a photo on Instagram of Kinney wearing a ring on a significant finger. The post came complete with the hashtags #ThatsHisPersonalRing #NotForTheShow #EveryoneCalmDown. The Daily Star reported this week that Gaga and Kinney gathered friends and family for a small ceremony pledging their devotion to each other. Citing unnamed sources, the publication claims the couple plan to officially wed next year. Neither the singer nor the actor has commented on the reports. The singer and her beau -- who have dated since 2011 -- have managed to keep their relationship out of the limelight.

"When it comes to purchasing products on the Internet that claim to treat or cure Ebola, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has one word for consumers: Beware! This week the FDA sent warning letters to three companies the government agency says are selling products over the Internet that claim to treat, prevent or even cure the deadly disease. The letters were issued after an alert warning consumers about fraudulent Ebola products being hawked online went out last month. ""We have  a program at FDA that monitors the Internet to look for health fraud products, products not approved by FDA that claim to cure or treat disease,"" said Howard Sklamberg, the FDA's deputy commissioner for global regulatory operations and policy. ""We noticed that when there is a public health issue that really comes to the fore(front) -- for example H1N1 a few years ago, and now Ebola -- there tends to be an increase in health fraud products, which are products that claim to prevent, treat or cure disease and the product has not been approved by FDA."" The agency says they've had consumer complaints about the number of products making these claims, and that the websites of Natural Solutions Foundation of Newton, New Jersey; Young Living in Lehi, Utah and doTERRA International, LLC, based in Pleasant Grove, Utah, all offer products that are in direct violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they're being promoted as drugs that can fight the infection. In early August, FDA says a doTERRA consultant posted these tweets about Ebola prevention: ""Treating the symptoms of Ebola Virus with DoTERRA Essential Oils,"" and ""Many Essential Oils are highly Anti-viral.  I list here a few of them those (sic) oils that could help prevent your contracting the Ebola virus."" According to the agency, Young Living essential oils products were being sold on various websites with claims including, ""Viruses (including Ebola) are no match for Young Living Essential Oils,""  and ""Ebola Virus can not live in the presence of cinnamon bark (this is in Thieves) nor Oregano."" ""Thieves"" is one of the oils Young Living sells. The company's website says ""It is highly effective in supporting the immune system and good health."" The listed ingredients are clove, lemon, cinnamon eucalyptus and rosemary. Travis Ogden, chief operating officer of Young Living issued this statement to CNN: . ""Young Living is cooperating fully with the FDA regarding its inquiry. Young Living Members are provided specific instructions on how to promote our products to their customers. In the coming days we will be contacting all our membership to ensure that they understand how to best use our products and remain compliant with regulatory directives. We have already contacted each of the Members cited in the FDA letter to help get them into compliance."" Natural Solutions Foundation, which claims its product Nano Silver kills every pathogen it's been tested against without exception, had plenty to say in defense of the posted claims, including that ""NANO SILVER, AT 10 PPM (parts per million) effectively kills the Ebola virus."" Ralph Fucetola, a retired lawyer and trustee at Natural Solutions Foundation, says the company was advocating the nutritional benefits of Nano Silver years before the Ebola outbreak. ""We feel obligated to speak the truth, especially during a world health emergency that is happening in West Africa. So we welcomed WHO's declaration that even 'unproven interventions' can be used in this crisis and that is what we have tried to do,"" Fucetola said. ""Insofar as the word 'cure' is used, it was not intended to be the equivalent of an FDA-approved treatment but rather in the common usage of the word as something which would help a person get over the disease."" Fucetola cites a 2009 study on Nano Silver sponsored by the Department of Defense's Defense Threat Reduction Agency as support for the product. He says a presentation created from that study (PDF) showed ""the nutrient at 10 ppm (parts per million) regulated Ebola virus replication which may prevent the disease from killing it's victims."" Those familiar with the government research say the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funds a tremendous number of early stage science and technology projects that are tasked with countering nuclear, chemical or biological threats. Nano Silver was studied, but scientists determined there were other things that were a better investment. If the early research had proven promising, they say the research would have picked up by other agencies. ""The DTRA funded a research project between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2009 into a product called Nano Silver,"" a spokesperson, who did not want to be identified, said. ""The researchers produced slides at the end of that early science research.  The data in that presentation was not peer reviewed."" The FDA is firm: ""At this point there are no drugs or vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective to treat or prevent Ebola disease,"" Dr. Luciana Borio, the FDA's Assistant Commissioner for Counterterrorism Policy and Acting Deputy Chief Scientist, says. ""FDA is doing all it can do to help expedite development programs."" Borio says there are currently two vaccines in development. One is already in ""Phase I"" clinical trials; the other is expected to begin trials soon. She also says there are a handful of drugs in early stages of development for Ebola, but that it's very difficult to say how soon it will be before we have treatments available for patients. It depends in part on the results of these trials. In the meantime, the agency says, Internet ""cures"" are not the answer. ""We are continuing to monitor the internet and monitor how these three companies respond,"" Sklamberg said.  ""They have 15 working days to take corrective action.  If they don't take the corrective action, we can take enforcement action against them...seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution."" Natural Solutions says they will meet that deadline. ""We will offer to make further disclosures and disclaimers, including more carefully nuanced terminology,"" Fucetola said.  ""We are not in the business of violating the law but we are in the business of speaking the truth as we know it."" CNN made several efforts to contact representatives of doTERRA over two days and left messages, but there was no response.","FDA sends warning letters to three companies selling Ebola products .

"It's a tied race between two unpopular men. Three weeks before Election Day, Florida incumbent Gov. Rick Scott finds himself in a neck-and-neck sprint to the finish line against Democratic challenger and former Gov. Charlie Crist. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, each candidate has the support of 44% of likely voters, while Libertarian Adrian Wyllie pulls a significant share (9%) of the vote. With the race so close, Wyllie's support sets the stage for a potential Libertarian spoiler. ""And with one in five likely voters saying that they could change their minds between now and Election Day, it's really anyone's ballgame,"" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. The survey was done October 9-13 with 610 likely voters and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. College GOP: 'Say yes' to Scott's dress . Scott and Crist are familiar faces in Florida. Crist was governor in the term immediately preceding Scott's. Crist, however, was a Republican at the time. He became an independent during an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 2010, then became a Democrat in 2012. His party switch has become a major line of attack against Crist. But the former governor and his new Democratic allies say the Republican Party has taken a different ideological track in recent years. ""Hell, he didn't leave the (GOP). It left him,"" Vice President Joe Biden said Monday in Florida, while campaigning for Crist. Florida to vote on legalizing medical marijuana . Scott was elected in the tea party wave of 2010 with campaign promises to make big cuts and take on public unions. Despite holding true to his pledges and his state seeing a steady rise in economic growth, Scott's approval ratings have slipped dramatically. While both candidates are widely known in the state, it appears voters are split on who they like less. A majority of likely voters, 53%, have an unfavorable view of Crist, and a majority, 52%, also have an unfavorable view of Scott. ""One thing is certain: This year's race is not a popularity contest,"" Holland said. ""That may explain why a third-party candidate is in the high single digits."" With two prominent names in the mix, the contest has been one of the most closely watched races of 2014. Obama's midterm malaise . Crist threw his hat in the ring with much fanfare late last year, and early polls indicated he has a sizable advantage over Scott. But the race tightened this year, and the high-profile appeal of the race and its swing-state dynamics have attracted big-name surrogates on both sides. In addition to Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton campaigned for Crist this month, and first lady Michelle Obama will do a fundraiser for Crist on Friday in Orlando. On Thursday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will turn out for Scott. As chairman of the Republican Governors Association, it will mark Christie's fourth trip to the state this year. Fellow Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has also shown up for Scott. CNN will air a debate between Crist and Scott on October 21. The hourlong debate will air exclusively at 7 p.m. ET on CNN and WJXT and take place in WJXT's studios in Jacksonville, Florida. CNN's Jake Tapper, chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN's ""The Lead,"" will moderate with WJXT anchor Kent Justice joining in the questioning.â€‹ .","Rick Scott and Charlie Crist each have 44% of support from likely voters .

"Baghdad (CNN)Iraq's military abandoned a strategically important base in Anbar province after heavy fighting with ISIS militants, provincial security force sources told CNN on Monday. The base outside the city of Hit was one of the Shiite-led government's few remaining military outposts in Anbar, a predominantly Sunni province that has increasingly fallen under ISIS control. It is a key control point for roads running through the region. The Iraqi military still controls the Ayn al-Asad military base, which helps defend Iraq's second-largest dam and the provincial capital of Ramadi. Despite airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies over the weekend, reports suggest ISIS has continued to gain ground and has encircled Haditha, the last large town in Anbar not yet in the militant group's hands. Sabah Al-Karhout, president of the Anbar Provincial Council, said Sunday that ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State, had control of about 80% of the province. Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, at least, according to the provincial council's deputy head, Falleh al-Issawi. ISIS would control a swath 350 miles (563 kilometers) long. Anbar leaders on Saturday appealed for U.S. ground forces to help them fight ISIS, but Baghdad said it had not received any official request. The Iraqi government has been adamant that it does not want U.S. forces on the ground, and President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any. Besieged Kobani . Meanwhile in Syria, fighting continues in the key Kurdish border city of Kobani, which ISIS has been trying to seize for weeks. Monday has been one most violent days since ISIS launched its assault, with sounds of fierce fighting, including gunfire and explosions, CNN staff on the Syria-Turkey border said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh described seeing a mushroom cloud rising about 100 meters (nearly 330 feet) above the city in an area targeted by at least four blasts, generally after the sound of jets overhead. ""However, it remains unclear who is gaining the upper hand,"" Walsh said. ""Distribution of the airstrikes does not immediately suggest the Kurds are retaking the center so far."" Hunter: Terrorists crossing into U.S. -- but maybe not ISIS . The U.S. military said it and partner nations had attacked ISIS in Syria on Sunday and Monday, launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani, three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa. ""Fighter aircraft from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated in these airstrikes. All aircraft exited the strike areas safely,"" the U.S. military said in a statement. A fighter from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN's Arwa Damon that the battle was focusing on the main border crossing into Turkey. If ISIS took control, he said, ""it's over."" Oil and crime make ISIS rich . The fighter said the Kurdish fighters had pushed back an attempted advance by ISIS on Monday morning but that it would be ""impossible"" for them to hold their ground if current conditions continued. U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use bases and territory to train. ""They have said that their facilities inside Turkey can be used by coalition forces, American and otherwise, to engage in activities inside Iraq and Syria,"" Rice told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That's a new commitment and one that we very much welcome,"" she said. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Iraq's military leaves an important military base in Anbar province to ISIS, sources say .

"After Sen. Tom Harkin likened her to Taylor Swift, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst is taking the pop star's advice. Just ""shake it off."" That's how Ernst responded Monday to Harkin's remarks last week that Ernst wasn't fit to be Iowa's senator just because she's ""really attractive and she sounds nice."" ""I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers, but if she votes like Michele Bachmann, she's wrong for the state of Iowa,"" Harkin said at the Story County Democrats' annual fall barbecue, according to footage obtained by Buzzfeed News published Sunday night. He backtracked on Monday, calling his comments a mistake and praising Ernst's campaign. ""I shouldn't have said those things, I know that. I regret anytime someone feels offended by what I have said,"" Harkin said. ""But I am only human and I can make mistakes sometimes in how I say something. In fact, I have complimented her on running a very good campaign."" His apology came after Ernst fired back Monday on Fox News and in an interview with CNN affiliate KCCI and said Harkin would have never made those comments if she were a man. ""I was very offended that Sen. Harkin would say that. I think it's unfortunate that he and many of their party believe you can't be a real woman if you're conservative and you're female,"" Ernst said on Fox News. ""I believe if my name had been John Ernst attached to my resume, Sen. Harkin would not have said those things."" Ernst also slammed Democrats for their ""phony war on women."" ""I am a woman and second I have been to war. I am a combat veteran, this is not a war on women and anytime Democrats use the word war, they need to do it to honor our servicemen and women,"" Ernst said Monday. Ernst has gained momentum recently in the race against her Democratic opponent Rep. Bruce Braley, leading by two points in the latest CNN/ORC poll and up by 7 points in a Des Moines Register poll released this weekend. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday, one day before voters head to the voting booth said the race is all tied up with each candidate pulling 47%. Iowa is arguably one of the most crucial Senate races of the cycle that could hand over control of the Senate to Republicans if Ernst prevails. Ernst would be the state's first female Senator. Harkin's office did not immediately responded to CNN request for comment Monday.","Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin attacked GOP hopeful Joni Ernst last week .

"The third and final debate between Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist was dominated by personal attacks in one of the closest governors races in the country. In the debate, hosted by CNN and affiliate WJXT in Jacksonville, the two candidates took aim at each other in a showdown that covered a wide range of topics, including economic policies, the death penalty, and voting rights for felons. Death penalty . A heated moment came when Crist accused Scott of delaying an execution so that his attorney general could attend a political fundraiser. ""She asked me to delay it because it didn't work on the dates that she thought it was going to be on,"" Scott said in response. ""She apologized."" In September 2013, Pam Bondi apologized for delaying the planned execution of Marshall Lee Gore, a notorious rapist and murderer, because it conflicted with a fundraiser. Scott denied at the time that he knew the reason for the delay. ""Did you know it was for a political fundraiser?"" Crist pressed. ""What would you like her to do?"" Scott asked. Crist went on to blast Scott for not answering questions. No fangate repeat . The night got off to a breezy start, this time with no fan on stage for Crist and no protest from Scott. ""Everybody's comfortable here?"" asked CNN's Jake Tapper, who co-moderated the debate with WJXT's Kent Justice. His question was a subtle reference to last week's seven minute standoff. The debate quickly transitioned into a testy exchange with personal attacks over wealth. Scott blamed Crist for the loss of more than 800,000 jobs while he was governor from 2007-2011, saying Crist is out of touch with average Florida voters because he grew up with wealth. ""I grew up with families that struggled. I don't know my natural father. I lived in public housing. I have an adopted dad,"" Scott said. ""I didn't grow up with money. You did. You grew up with plenty of money. Charlie, you lost more jobs than any state but one."" Hammering back, Crist argued he was not responsible for the ""economic meltdown"" that occurred nationally during his tenure. He returned the attack against wealth, blasting Scott for being the one who's out of touch. ""You don't know me and you can't tell my story,"" Crist said. ""But I know you are worth about $100 million or $200 million today and God bless you for that wealth, but the way you got it was pretty unsavory."" Scott, a former health care CEO, ran into controversy when his company, Columbia/HCA, was fined $1.7 billion for alleged Medicare fraud last decade. Restoring rights for felons . Scott took a jab at Crist for bringing voting rights back to felons who had completed their sentences for nonviolent convictions. ""Here is Charlie's plan: You commit a heinous crime, as soon as you get out of jail, you get to vote.  Stalk, you get to vote. You have intentional permanent disfigurement of a child and you walk out of jail and you get to vote,"" Scott said. Crist fired back, accusing Scott of ""lying"" and saying the restoration law only applied to nonviolent criminals. Minimum wage . Asked whether Scott supports the idea of a minimum wage, the governor appeared unclear as to how exactly that policy would take place. ""Sure,"" he said. Pressed on what the minimum wage should be, Scott added: ""How would I know -- I mean, the private sector decides wages."" He went on to deflect and attack Crist on the loss of jobs during his governorship, calling him a ""zero-wage governor."" Asked to clarify if he supports the idea of the government setting a minimum wage, Scott answered: ""Just because they set a minimum wage doesn't mean you get a job."" Crist, who supports raising the minimum wage to $10.10, said he still stands by it, saying people ""deserve"" a higher wage even if it means some companies might have to lay people off as a consequence. Ebola . Tapper asked Crist how he would rate, on a scale of 1-10, President Obama's handling of the Ebola virus in the United States. ""I'd probably give him an eight. I think we had a little bit of a slow start, and I think everybody kinda recognizes that. But I think they've really caught their stride,"" said Crist. Asked if Scott feels confident that an Ebola patient could be treated in Florida, Scott said, ""absolutely."" One of the nurses who contracted Ebola flew on a plane earlier this month the day after she went to the hospital with symptoms. The plane first stopped in Dallas, where she de-boarded, then flew to Ft. Lauderdale in Florida. Scott's administration pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contact the passengers who flew on the Dallas to Ft. Lauderdale flight. He's also repurposing $7 million in federal grant money to spend on Ebola prevention efforts, and he ordered the Florida National Guard to set up two rapid response teams in case Ebola is diagnosed in the state.","Florida Republican Gov.

"Archie Andrews has lived, died and gone through a zombie apocalypse. And now, the comic book character is returning to TV. Archie Andrews' prior big foray onto the small screen was ""The Archie Show,"" which aired on Saturday mornings in the late 1960s. Fox is now bringing him back, as early as next fall, in a live-action show called ""Riverdale"" that promises to be pretty different from the traditional Archie comics we're used to reading. (And we won't even go into the ill-fated 1990 NBC TV movie.) CNN spoke to writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who also does the creepy ""Afterlife With Archie"" comic books, about ""Riverdale"" after the series was announced Thursday. CNN: How long has this idea been floating around? Aguirre-Sacasa: It's something we've been talking about for a while. When [publisher] Jon Goldwater and I first met, we talked about live action -- we actually were thinking about doing it as a movie. We even got so far as selling it to Warner Bros., but we soon realized that there were many, many different stories we wanted to tell, and actually it was probably more suited to a TV show. It's been in the works for a few years, but the stars are finally aligning. (Warner Bros. Television, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) CNN: Will the characters be recognizable as the Archie characters we know? Aguirre-Sacasa: Archie's still gonna have red hair, Betty is still gonna have blond hair and Veronica's gonna have dark hair. We are definitely not casting them retro-style to look like the comic book characters. They will definitely be contemporary kids. The pilot is set on the first day of school, after Archie was working for his dad's construction company. He's gonna be all buff and muscular, and that's why all the girls fall for Archie. We're tweaking the mythology a bit to answer questions people have had for 75 years. Jughead is still gonna wear that paper crown, it's so iconic. We are explaining for the first time in 75 years why he's wearing the crown. All these Easter eggs will have an explanation finally. They'll look like their iconic selves but with an edgier quality. Jughead will be more like Donnie Darko. CNN: We hear the tone will be quite different from what we know. Aguirre-Sacasa: A lot of the subtext is bubbling to the surface. One of the big stories we're telling in the pilot is that Veronica Lodge and her mother, Hermione Lodge, are moving to Riverdale because they're fleeing a financial scandal that her dad is involved in. It's very real world. Kevin Keller is a big character in the comic books. In the comics, he's completely accepted as being gay, and there's no question about that. In the show, we'll look at what that really means for kids in a small town coming out -- who accepts them and who doesn't accept them. Reggie has always been a frat boy douchebag, and we've never gotten to the core of why that is, and we're going to explore that, it has to do with Reggie's relationship with his parents. We're getting to the realness and the complexity of the characters. We're not going to arbitrarily make it dark, but we'll get real with these characters and make it a little bit weird, like ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Blue Velvet,"" which is one of my favorite movies. CNN: But will it still be funny? Aguirre-Sacasa: There will absolutely be humor in this. The voice will have a sardonic, ironic edge to it. The characters will be witty and funny, and every story will be a quintessential ""Archie"" story with a twist to it. The humor will always be part of the bread and butter. CNN: And the show will expand beyond the core characters? Aguirre-Sacasa: Archie Comics have thousands of characters in their library. One of the example is how ""Arrow"" introduced the Flash and spun ""The Flash"" off. We thought it would be great to have Josie and the Pussycats as a rival band, and they can spin off their own show.","Archie Comics characters will return to television in a live action series .

Crewman Matt Fisher hopes other ships can learn lessons from the Maersk Alabama takeover and recapture. It also contains some of the lessons they learned and hope to pass on to others who could face the same danger. Crewman Matt Fisher sent the e-mail to a fellow sailor aboard another Maersk ship. The U.S.-flagged Alabama was already heading to Kenya when he sent it, but it was before the U.S. Navy rescued the cargo ship's captain, who was held hostage on a lifeboat by the four pirates. ""The pirates got up to the bridge very quickly once they were onboard,"" Fisher wrote. ""We had a locked cage door over the ladder well from main deck, but it only took a second for them to shoot it off. They then got to the bridge up the outside ladders."" Fisher said that Capt. Richard Phillips and three other sailors were on the bridge when the pirates arrived, adding that he didn't know why they stayed.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . The rest of the crew, Fisher said, headed below and took positions in the engine and steering areas. One sailor kept watch in the engine control room, he said, while another ""was out on deck tracking the pirates' movement."" ""We kept swinging the rudder side to side,"" Fisher wrote. ""The pirates' boat capsized, though I'm not sure exactly when or what caused it. After about 20 minutes, the engine was killed, I don't know by whom."" After the engine was killed, the sailors shut off the power to the ship as well as the fuel line to the ship's emergency diesel generator. ""I think this was critical,"" Fisher wrote. ""The pirates were very reluctant to go into the dark."" Fisher said the sailors were safe where they were, since the pirates had no grenades and would never have been able break through with only firearms. The only problem, he said, was the heat and a shortage of water. ""In the future, we will store food and water in various spots for emergency usage,"" he said. ""I think we will also run a fresh water line into the steering gear."" Fisher said the sailors were able to sneak up to the engine room water fountain and filled some bottles, and the sailor who'd been on deck tracking the pirates dropped fruit and sodas from the ship's galley through a standpipe to the hidden sailors. At one point, Fisher wrote, the pirates sent one of the four sailors who had remained on the bridge to hunt for the other crew members -- unescorted. He escaped and joined his comrades. Later, one of the pirates escorted another sailor into the engine room, again searching for the missing crew members, but one of the sailors ""was able to jump him in the dark and we took him prisoner."" ""No one else came down into the E/R (engine room),"" he said. ""As the day went on, the pirates became desperate to get out of there."" Phillips finally talked the pirates into taking a small boat used for rescuing a sailor who falls overboard. The three remaining pirates and the captain went down into the boat, and the sailors, now in control of their ship again, dropped food, water and fuel to them. But the small boat wouldn't start. The sailors on board the ship dropped the lifeboat into the water and took it -- and their prisoner -- to the stranded boat with the pirates and the captain, intending to trade boats and prisoners. ""We were supposed to exchange their guy for the Captain, but they ended up keeping him,"" Fisher wrote. ""They motored off in the lifeboat. They had no way of getting back aboard, so we followed them."" A few hours later, the USS Bainbridge arrived on the scene.  Watch crew arrive in the United States » . ""We stayed close by for some time, but then the Navy asked us to head out,"" Fisher said. ""I heard that several other pirate vessels were heading our way and the Navy wanted us out of the way. That's about it."" Eventually, Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the pirates aboard the lifeboat. Phillips was freed, and the remaining pirate was taken prisoner. But the Maersk Alabama, with U.S. Navy protection aboard, was nearing Mombasa, Kenya, by that time. At the end of his e-mail, Fisher went over the what the Alabama's crew had learned. ""Have a well-fortified location with food and water supply. Kill all the lights. Leave the alarms going, the noise helped cover our movements through the house. Flashlights and radios are very handy, as well as the sound-powered phone."" ""It was a pretty stressful situation,"" Fisher wrote. ""I have to say I am impressed with how the entire crew responded. We didn't have anybody who wanted to give up."" Fisher also said he was ""pretty confident"" that his captain would come out of the ordeal ""OK.""  Watch Capt. Phillips arrive in Kenya » . ""They have to know that if they kill him they'll be done,"" he said.","Matt Fisher, crewman on Alabama, sent e-mail to sailor on another Maersk ship .

"The number of Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no ""additional interventions or changes in community behavior,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report Tuesday. The estimate was derived from a new forecasting tool developed by the CDC. The range of estimated cases -- from 550,000 to 1.4 million -- is wide because experts suspect the current count is highly under-reported. The official death toll from Ebola in West Africa has climbed to more than 2,800 in six months, with 5,800 cases confirmed as of Monday, the World Health Organization said. But the CDC estimates that if 70% of people with Ebola are properly cared for in medical facilities, the epidemic could decrease and eventually end. In a press conference Tuesday, CDC Director Tom Frieden cautioned that this model is based on older data from August. The numbers are not projections, but ""scenarios.""  The model does not take into account President Obama's announcement that the U.S. is sending troops and extra medical equipment to the area. Nor does it take into account the additional help from other countries promised. What the model does suggests, he said, is that the current surge of help can ""break the back of the epidemic"" and is ""exactly what's needed"" to end it.  He said he is now ""confident the most dire predictions will not come to pass."" The cautionary tale this data does tell, he said is that there would be an ""enormous cost"" if help is delayed. Gayle Smith, a special assistant to the President and senior director of the National Security Council said the model tells responders how to ""bend the curve"" and that the epidemic can end with a large international response.  ""The momentum must at least be maintained to ensure we are way out ahead of this,"" Smith said. And added that the international help will need to ""stay on this as long as it takes."" A separate nine-month assessment published by WHO experts in The New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday says the fatality rate of this outbreak in West Africa is 71% and that the ""current epidemiologic outlook is bleak."" It also warns that without ""drastic improvements"" in measures to control its spread, the number of cases and deaths from Ebola is expected to continue climbing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months. The cumulative number of cases could exceed 20,000 by November 2, the assessment said. It blamed the spread not on a particularly virulent strain of the virus, rather it said this outbreak was so deadly because of a ""combination of dysfunctional health systems, international indifference, high population mobility, local customs, densely populated capitals, and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict."" ""Perhaps most important, Ebola has reached the point where it could establish itself as an endemic infection because of a highly inadequate and late global response."" It warns that the global response must improve to meet the threat posed by this and future epidemics. Another six-month report from WHO -- which assesses the situation in three countries at the outbreak's center, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- is dedicated to those health workers ""who, as an expression of our innately shared human compassion, risked their lives, and lost them."" In the six months since this outbreak was first formally reported in March, 337 health care workers have been infected, of whom more than 181 have died, the WHO said. Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . Guinea: Porous borders aid spread . The WHO's six-month report on Guinea, where the outbreak began in a remote area, details how the virus first gained a grip on a vulnerable, frightened population ill-equipped to deal with the deadly disease. Once Ebola was identified as the killer, a national and international response swung into gear. But each time it looked like the country might be at the point of controlling the virus, new flare-ups occurred. The WHO report concludes Ebola kept getting reintroduced ""into Guinea -- with its notoriously porous borders -- from the large outbreaks in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone."" Controlling the virus then will not be feasible in Guinea until its stopped in neighboring countries. Meanwhile, health workers there have come under attack as they seek to educate the local population. ""Today, one of the biggest barriers to control is violence from an impoverished, terrified and shattered population that does not understand what hit it and fights back the only way it can,"" the report said. Liberia: Misery and hope . WHO's six-month report on Liberia summarizes their situation as one of ""misery and despair tempered by some good reasons for hope."" The number of Liberian cases is increasing exponentially, with 113 new ones reported over a single 24-hour period on one day last week, WHO said -- a record number in any outbreak. At the same time, treatment centers are overflowing. Many patients are turned away. The capacity to deliver other basic health services, such as care for women in childbirth, has been compromised. The report warns malaria-related deaths may soon surpass those from Ebola. Hope can be found in the opening of a new WHO-funded, 120-bed Ebola treatment center, it said. The U.S. government is also setting up a new laboratory to speed up diagnosis.  Currently there are four major Ebola treatment units in Liberia. In remarks made on Tuesday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that her country's health care system is hurting. Of the over 1500 who have died, 85 were health care workers. The President characterized the CDC's model for possible infections as ""scary to all of us."" She added, though, that she is happy with the U.S. response to the disaster. She believes it will make a ""major"" difference. She predicts with that increased international effort, Liberia will see better results in a couple of weeks. Sierra Leone: Urgent needs . The situation assessment for Sierra Leone explains how traditional burial practices helped the virus spread quickly there following the funeral of a respected local healer. The virus has taken a devastating toll on health workers and researchers. ""Sierra Leone's most urgent needs include more treatment beds in much safer facilities, better contact training and follow-up, more personal protective equipment and body bags, and more properly protected teams to collect bodies and bury them safely,"" WHO said. The deployment of international medical teams in West Africa, including from China and Cuba, may help. Nigeria and Senegal, where the situation is judged ""stable -- for the moment,"" are seen as success stories. Those countries have shown conventional methods such as early detection, contact tracing, isolation and an adequate supply of personal protective equipment can contain the virus, WHO said. ""If Nigeria can control an outbreak caused by such a deadly and highly contagious virus, right from the start, any country in the world can do the same,"" its report said.","CDC: Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to 550,000 by January .

"The Obama administration has shipped weapons directly to Kurdish forces battling ISIS militants in northern Iraq and is considering ways to expand the transfer of arms, U.S. officials told CNN. Shipments have so far come from the CIA, two U.S. officials said. But discussions are underway inside the administration about whether the Defense Department might get involved. The Pentagon and the State departments do not sell or transfer weapons to non-state entities, but the administration is looking at whether there is a way around that restriction, one official said. ""We're working with the government of Iraq to increasingly and very quickly get urgently needed arms to the Kurds,"" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN's New Day on Monday. In a separate statement, Harf said the Iraqi government ""has made deliveries from its own stock, and we have done the same."" She said such efforts are being done in ""full coordination"" with the government in Baghdad. Since last Thursday, the Iraqi government has transferred three shipments of arms and ammunition to the Kurds, one of the officials said. In addition, there have been other shipments from the CIA, the official said. The CIA shipments are useful because the Kurdish fighters -- known as the Peshmerga -- use different arms and ammunition than the U.S. military stocks, so the intelligence agency is better equipped to get that type of material to the Kurds quickly. One official noted more arms could come from other countries in consultation with the United States.

"(CNN)To some, the hijab is a symbol of female oppression and Islamic fundamentalism. But to Nazma Khan, a Muslim who moved from Bangladesh to New York at age 11, the headscarf is a symbol of her religious belief in beauty through modesty. ""Modesty is part of our Islamic faith,"" Khan wrote in an email. ""No one should be discriminated (against) for following their faith."" So Khan started World Hijab Day to build empathy for this perspective and to encourage non-Muslims, and Muslims who don't normally wear a hijab, to try it out. The Arabic word hijab refers not just to a headscarf but to modest dress and behavior in general. ""Our goal is to foster global religious tolerance and understanding through hijab awareness. Many women get discriminated (against) simply because they choose to wear the hijab,"" Khan said. ""Hopefully, this event will make people realize that women who wear the hijab are just like anyone else. They're not oppressed or are forced to wear it. They just simply want to follow their faith by being modest, just like Mary (mother of Jesus)."" For the first time in its three-year run, Sunday's World Hijab Day became a trending topic on social media as women supported the effort in events worldwide and shared images tagged #WorldHijabDay. ""Covering up should be a free choice! I may not be Muslim or religious but I support the beauty a hijab can bring to a woman,"" said one woman who shared an image through the World Hijab Day website. The concept of modesty is not unique to Islam. Other religions, including Judaism and Christianity, embrace the concept. Still, public expression of hijab can be controversial and often misunderstood -- especially in the United States -- despite being protected by the First Amendment right to free speech and freedom of religion. My Take: My hijab is my hoodie . Many hijabis, or wearers of hijabs, are stigmatized for the practice, Khan said, speaking from experience. After moving with her family to the U.S., she says, she was taunted and called names for wearing hijab to school. The harassment continued into high school and college and became worse after the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""I always faced the following question: 'Why don't you ever dress normal?' "" she said. ""I constantly lived in fear as I was called names such as Osama, terrorist, etc. It was a total nightmare."" In summer 2011, after friends from around the world shared similar stories of harassment, Khan began pondering solutions. ""I kept on thinking how can I help them and myself?"" she said. ""I thought if I could invite other women (Muslim & non-Muslims) to walk in my shoes just for one day, perhaps, things would change."" This year, ""ambassadors"" in 33 countries organized World Hijab Day events. Organizers in Canada, for example, invited the public to try on hijabs at a mall in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Kiran Malik-Khan, the organizer of that event, made the choice to start covering her head four years ago after a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest site. Born in Pakistan and raised in New Jersey, the 37-year-old United Way employee has practiced Islam all her life. The spiritual journey moved her to embrace her faith in a deeper way through hijab. ""I did it because I wanted to do it. It's progress for me as a Muslim woman, the next step in my faith,"" said Khan (no relation to Nazma Khan). ""It's moving forward religiously. If you're raised in Islam, then you want to embrace everything it says. For me, personally, that progress was doing the hijab."" She became involved in hijab activism in 2014, when Quebec's national assembly began hearings on a secular charter to ban overt religious symbols in the public-sector workplace. She felt compelled to start speaking up in her community to help others understand that, for people like her, the hijab is a choice, not an imposition. ""If we keep living in our silos, we will never be able to break down barriers and stereotypes,"" she said. ""Social justice is not a spectator sport, so if we don't work for it, nothing will change.""","World Hijab Day seeks to raise awareness about modest Muslim dress .

"(CNN)Four geisha, wrapped in kimonos under dark winter coats, walk in single file through a snow-covered forest. Their red and orange parasols a burst of color against the winter monochrome. It could be a scene from a print by 19th century Japanese artist Hokusai, but behind the evocative image is a modern story. Leading the four through the snows of Niseko, the ski resort on the northern island of Hokkaido, is Fiona Graham. She's an Australian citizen who first moved to Japan when she was just 15 and in 2007 became a geisha. Now working and living as Sayuki, she offers those intrigued by the geisha tradition a glimpse into their enigmatic world by hosting banquets and offering visitors the chance to watch them practice their arts. Her initial fascination with geisha came when working as a filmmaker pitching a documentary on the subject. She eschewed the detachment gained through a camera lens, claiming that only by becoming one herself could she really get to know their traditions and skills. ""I couldn't just take one step into it, I had to totally embrace it, it was the only way,"" she says. ""The geisha world is aesthetically very beautiful and with a very beautiful lifestyle,"" she says explaining what first attracted her to a very different life. ""But, really, to live a beautiful life in any country is not so easy,"" she adds hinting at the challenges she faced becoming one of the few western women to live as a geisha in Japan. An experience unchanged for 400 years . For most visitors to Japan attracted by the mystery of the geisha industry, Sayuki's tours may be as close as they will get to experience an authentic geisha experience. An evening's entertainment at a banquet consists of a multi-course meal with interludes for dances, singing or music played on traditional instruments like the shamisen, a three-stringed lute, or yokobue, a traditional Japanese flute. Traditionally, geisha would specialize in one art form and spend their careers improving their craft. Aside from a few 21st century additions like an iPod accompaniment to the dancing, Sayuki says that the scene at one of her hosted dinners would not have changed much for 400 years. ""If you come to a banquet you get to experience the most beautiful parts of Japanese culture, the best of Japanese cuisine. There really is no other way to experience it all in one space."" While Niseko is something of frontier in the country for geisha culture, the rest of the year Sayuki is based in Tokyo's Asakusa district and also travels to host geisha banquets abroad. A tradition cloaked in mystery . For centuries geishas have worked as entertainers and paid companions. The most literal translation of geisha is simply ""artist."" Different districts in Japanese cities have varying training regimen for geisha, but typically, as in Kyoto, exams are taken after the first year as an apprentice, with four additional years of training.h . Many operate within geisha houses -- academies for trainee geisha -- that help manage their careers, while also providing a unique bond and atmosphere of sisterhood. With each delicately crafted kimono costing thousands of dollars (traditionally each geisha would need a wardrobe of 36 to reflect changing seasons), being affiliated with a geisha house helps trainee geisha (called maiko in Kyoto, hangyoku in Tokyo) absorb the costs. After a year's training at a geisha house in Tokyo's Asakusa district Sayuki now operates as an independent. She says she was denied the chance to take on the position of  ""geisha mother"" and mentor young geisha affiliated with the geisha house she trained with because she is not Japanese. Along with Kyoto, the Asakusa district has a long tradition of geisha, enabling visitors today to easily indulge in some geisha-spotting (particularly the ancient Gion area of Kyoto) as they walk through streets on the way to functions at local teahouses and restaurants. Commercialization: Against geisha's nature . It's become something of a tourist pastime in Kyoto. There are now organized walking tours, something that many within in the community have criticized as being too intrusive. For some the commercialization of geisha culture goes against its very nature. ""Exclusivity is part of the deal with geishas,"" says author Lesley Downer who spent six months living in Kyoto's geisha district while researching her book, ""Geisha: The Remarkable Truth Behind the Fiction."" ""People want to commercialize it, but as a tourist you won't see the pristine experience, you'll get an experience, but it just won't be the same."" ""I think those that work in the geisha industry are very good at hiding (the world from outsiders)."" For Downer, geisha remain the embodiment of refinement and grace and are still the custodians of the traditional Japanese art forms. And far from being painted courtesans, their role as artists and professional companions makes them rather formidable, believes Downer. ""These are really impressive women. Walking down the street with them I felt really proud.""

"New York (CNN)Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who a New York grand jury decided not to indict in the death of Eric Garner, spoke with internal affairs investigators about the case this week. ""He indicated he never used a chokehold,"" said Stuart London, Pantaleo's attorney. ""He used a takedown technique he was taught in the academy. He said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure Mr. Garner."" London said Pantaleo had been trying to arrest ""someone who was noncompliant."" Speaking to investigators about the case on Monday, ""he was confident and related the facts in an accurate and professional manner,"" London said. Garner died in July after Pantaleo and other officers tried to arrest Garner, who they said was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes. A cell phone video of the arrest shows Pantaleo wrapping his arm around Garner's neck. A medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. New York's police commissioner announced shortly afterward that officers would undergo a three-day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. The controversial case has ignited protests across the country after the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo last week. Garner's last words, ""I can't breathe,"" have become a rallying cry during demonstrations. Critics say Pantaleo should have been indicted and say the case highlights problems in the criminal justice system. The police internal affairs investigation aims to determine whether Pantaleo violated department policy. The New York Police Department prohibits use of chokeholds . New York Police Commissioner William Bratton has said the investigation, which had been on hold during the criminal investigation, is expected to take at least three months. Investigators started interviewing other officers who witnessed the incident on Friday. CNN's Jason Carroll and Catherine E.

"(CNN)Two Renaissance sculptures of a nude man riding a panther may have been created by Michelangelo, says a British museum. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge says that the bronze sculptures, known as the Rothschild Bronzes and dating from the 1500s, were probably created just after the famed artist's David and just before he painted the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. The museum and researchers at the University of Cambridge say they have ""compelling evidence"" that the works, attributed to a Dutch sculptor, are actually from Michelangelo. If so, they are the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world, says the museum. The key clue that the unsigned bronzes were actually done by Michelangelo came from one of the master's apprentices. Last year, Paul Joannides, a Cambridge art history professor, noted that a Michelangelo student had made a study of several Michelangelo sketches for works believed lost. One of the drawings in the study, which dates from 1508, matched one of the bronzes. Further research indicated they were in Michelangelo's style, and X-rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation. ""Even a peroneal tendon is visible, as is the transverse arch of the foot,"" wrote University of Warwick anatomist Peter Abrahams, according to the UK Guardian. Victoria Avery, keeper of applied arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, described the project to the Guardian as ""a Renaissance whodunit."" She says that the museum was careful in assembling the evidence and that the works are masterpieces. ""The modeling is superb, they are so powerful and so compelling, so whoever made them had to be superb,"" she said. The works -- and some of the evidence -- will be on display at the Fitzwilliam from Tuesday through August 9. Though the museum is confident of the works' origins, research is continuing, and results will be presented at a conference in early July.","Formerly obscure works are believed to be by Michelangelo .

"In his 20 years of practicing emergency medicine, Dr. David Newman says, he remembers every patient who has walked out of his hospital alive after receiving CPR. It's not because Newman has an extraordinary memory or because reviving a patient whose heart has stopped sticks in his mind more than other types of trauma. It's because the number of individuals who survive CPR is so small. In fact, out of the hundreds of CPR patients who have come to the New York hospitals where he has worked, Newman recalls no more than one individual a year making a full recovery. Since it was introduced to American physicians in 1960, cardiopulmonary resuscitation has become a staple of emergency medicine. Between 2011 and 2012, more than 14 million people in 60 countries were trained in CPR administration, according to the American Heart Association (PDF). But recent studies suggest that the number of lives saved by CPR isn't as many as your favorite TV police drama would have you believe. Initially, CPR combined mouth-to-mouth breathing with chest compressions to keep blood and oxygen circulating throughout the body until further measures could be taken to restart the heart. In 2008, the American Heart Association began teaching ""hands-only CPR,"" in which the rescuer pushes down hard and fast in the center of the chest -- about 100 compressions per minute -- and forgoes rescue breaths. The new CPR procedure was developed to simplify the process and eliminate the ""yuck factor"" that potential rescuers could associate with putting their mouths on an unconscious victim. Studies showed that the modified procedure was as effective as chest compressions combined with artificial respiration. Yet despite advancements, the overall effectiveness of CPR remains disappointingly low -- although the practice still has its defenders. Exact survival rates are difficult to come by, as studies generally look at specific populations. A 2012 study showed that only about 2% of adults who collapse on the street and receive CPR recover fully. Another from 2009 (PDF) showed that anywhere from 4% to 16% of patients who received bystander CPR were eventually discharged from the hospital. About 18% of seniors who receive CPR at the hospital survive to be discharged, according to a third study (PDF). So when did the misconception about the effectiveness of CPR begin? Some researchers argue that television created the myth. Between 1994 and 1995, researchers from Duke University watched 97 episodes of ""ER,"" ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Rescue 911,"" taking note of when CPR was administered during each show. In these dramas, 75% of patients survived immediate cardiac arrest, and two-thirds were discharged from the hospital with full brain function, a stark contrast to the much smaller percentage found by medical studies. Newman says the few who do survive after CPR are what physicians describe as the ""healthy dead"": i.e. ""a boy who drowned moments before,"" ""a man who collapses while running a marathon"" or someone experiencing a mild heart attack. More common are the ""unhealthy dead"": those with terminal illnesses, the chronically ill and patients who do not receive CPR within five to 10 minutes of cardiac arrest. ""In these cases, (CPR) is unnecessarily burdensome, invasive and arguably cruel, with little to no chance of benefit,"" Newman said. Many survivors suffer abdominal distention or broken rib cages; some have severe brain damage from being without oxygen for so long. Still, trauma workers, including physicians, nurses and EMTs, are required to do anything and everything in their power to revive the patient unless an advance directive -- a specific written and signed order -- specifies that resuscitation should not be performed. Many veteran physicians have begun to opt out of the resuscitation practices they often administer to their patients. In a 2012 article published in The Guardian, ""How Doctors Choose to Die,"" retired physician Dr. Ken Murray reveals that members of his profession frequently turn down everything from chemotherapy to CPR. He notes that years of witnessing and administering ""medical care that makes people suffer"" leads many doctors diagnosed with terminal illnesses to choose to spend their last months or years at home and without medical treatment. Murray recalls some fellow physicians who go as far as getting tattoos that read ""no code"" to remind rescuers to forgo any attempts at revival. Murray is still an advocate for learning CPR, but he warns against hoping for miracles. ""People have too high expectations about what's going to happen,"" he said. ""They think you're going to do CPR and 99 out of 100 times (the patient will) be revived, which is just not the case."" Not everyone agrees. Saying that CPR is ineffective is ""the wrong attitude"" and a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" said Dr. Michael Sayre, former chairman of the American Heart Association's Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee. ""If you expect it to go poorly, than it will."" Instead, he says, we should be doing more studies: for example, comparing CPR teaching methods with cardiac arrest survival rates in major cities in the United States to understand how and when the technique is most effective. In some cities that have less CPR training, the survival rate is indeed low, Sayre says. But in other metropolitan areas with strong training programs and quick EMS response times, half or more victims survive. Sayre suggests teaching CPR in schools nationwide starting in seventh grade, as well as increasing access to  automated external defibrillators, portable machines that shock the heart to get it to ""reboot."" Using an AED, according to Sayre, increases the probability of survival to 80%. Promising research continues for substitutes to CPR, but ""there are no reasonable alternatives"" yet, Newman said. For now, emergency care providers have to use what they know. That doesn't mean Newman is happy with that reality. He remembers when he started as an EMT: ""I was led to believe that for those who experienced cardiac arrest, if you put your heart into reviving them, they would come back.""","CPR was introduced to American physicians in 1960 .

"Adrienne Arieff went through three miscarriages before she learned she was unable to carry a child. Her search for a solution brought her to India, where she found a woman willing to carry her and her husband's embryo in a controversial practice known as foreign gestational surrogacy. After considerable soul-searching, Arieff traveled in 2008 to Anand, a city in western India that has earned a reputation in recent years as the capital of India's so-called ""rent-a-womb"" industry. The 36-year-old marketing specialist from San Francisco met Vaina, the 26-year-old married mother who would be her surrogate, and began fertility treatment at the Akanksha Infertility Clinic. Weeks later, Arieff's husband arrived in India for the final stage of IVF, setting the stage for the emotional journey at the heart of her new book, ""The Sacred Thread: A True Story of Becoming a Mother and Finding a Family—Half a World Away."" ""Surrogacy advocates in the United States will tell you not to get involved with poor surrogates under any circumstances because it can lead to exploitation,"" she wrote in the book. ""I initially disagreed with this line of thinking. Charges of ""renting a womb"" and exploitation have long tarnished the practice of surrogacy. But in my mind, a woman going through the risks of labor for another family clearly deserves to be paid. To me, this was not exploitation. This was a win-win, allowing the surrogate to have a brighter future and the couple to have a child. If my money was going to beneﬁt an Indian woman ﬁnancially for a service she willingly provided, I preferred that it be a poor woman who really needed help because the money that a surrogate earns in India is, to be blunt, life- changing."" The book chronicles her struggle to cope with having a surrogate halfway across the world while fielding criticism from others over the decision to spend about $30,000 on the process, less than half of what IVF costs in the United States. She returns to India for the last six weeks of the pregnancy before the birth of her twin daughters, Emma and India, now 2 years old. Arieff spoke with CNN about the highs and lows of surrogacy and the unique bond that formed between her and Vaina. The following is a transcript of the conversation edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you end up choosing a surrogate in India? Adrienne Arieff: After three miscarriages a doctor in San Francisco told me to consider surrogacy or adoption. My husband and I looked into domestic and international options and learned about Indian surrogacy from an article in the New York Times in 2008. We thought it was particularly interesting because I had a big connection to India from having spent time there and I loved the country. Plus, Dr. Nayna Patel [medical director of the Akanksha Infertility Clinic] went to a great medical school and had impeccable credentials. Ironically, Dr. Patel went to medical school in London with a high school friend of mine and then my world became smaller. That made me feel comfortable. Also, the medical contracts are much less complicated in India and price is less than half of what it is in the U.S. CNN: What were some of the moral and ethical dilemmas you had to confront in using a foreign surrogate? Arieff: I never wanted to exploit anyone and there's so much exploitation in India. I definitely wanted to make sure that my surrogate was really on board and wanted to do this and felt empowered as a woman to be doing something to help me and her family. The whole ""womb for rent,"" that's where the medical contract and the business transaction side of things comes in, but after doing my research I felt comfortable that she was helping me because she wanted to and I was helping her. You have to be an advocate for yourself and surrogate and I always made sure she was OK. I wanted her to feel special because for the rest of your life I was going to put her on pedestal. With a lot of clinics in India you never meet the surrogates and that's weird, so there are definitely a lot of horrible things that happen in India with surrogates. It's big business but like with anything, you have to do your homework and be really smart about what you're getting into, financially, professionally and personally. So yes, there is a lot of corruption and exploitation with surrogacy in India but that was not the case in our journey. I was surprised by some of the criticism I got from people, especially ones who knew about my infertility and our history with miscarriages. This wasn't the way we'd planned it or wanted it. But still, it was shocking sometimes to hear the judgments in spite of everything we'd been through. CNN: At what point did you write a book based on your experience? Arieff: The book doesn't seek to change anyone's mind. I had a really positive experience and just wanted to share it. When I was considering surrogacy, I ended up buying 30 books, but they dealt with a lot of minutia of the process. There weren't many books from the point of view of the surrogate or the others involved. This was going to start out as a diary for our girls so they'd know how much we wanted them. It turned into a book because when I started telling people I was doing surrogacy I had so many friends call and e-mail with questions. It got a little out of hand. Because the questions were all so similar I thought maybe I will write a book about this and it was such an easy process and even while writing the book I wondered, should I be doing this? But in the end it turned out very powerful. I started taking notes around the IVF time of things [in India] because I really wanted to remember everything. I tend to forget if I don't write it down. I wanted to have all their questions answered if they had a lot of questions. CNN: What were your expectations? Arieff: I just wanted everything to be OK because I didn't think it was going to work. I was so sad from the chaos and loss I'd already experienced in trying to have children so I was very cautious with expectations. I knew I would only want the best for her and to feel some kind of bond with her for carrying to term, but I ended up feeling like her big sister. I wanted her to be comfortable, happy and safe. I just wanted to take care of her and make her feel as safe and comfort as possible. Maybe that's friendship but it felt like sisterhood. CNN: How did the relationship evolve? Arieff: When I first met her it felt like a business transaction. She needed some money for her family, it was the equivalent of 10 to 15 years of salary and I had fertility challenges so it was win-win, but initially it felt like more business transaction. It's surrogacy, it's not ideal but we came up with a business agreement for both parties. I saw her for the first time in the beginning. After I left, we'd exchange e-mails through a translator and Dr. Patel would send photos during the course of the pregnancy. One of the most challenging things was the distance. When your surrogate's in the U.S. you're able to talk to her every day and you're free to be engaged in her life so I didn't have that option, which was really sad and unfortunate because I really wanted to feel connected to the pregnancy. I had been pregnant before, once until very far in, so it was hard for me. If I could do it all over again I would stay in India the whole time. I think it's such a big part of the process and that was definitely a huge challenge for me. When I couldn't do it any longer I got on a plane, and I was so happy that I did. We'd do things like braid each other's hair, do each other's makeup. We don't speak the same language so the relationship was based on these basic human principles and exchanges. We'd take short walks, watch movies, some Indian films. I got this drum set, and we played that a couple of times. Music, we really bonded on music and had fun making fools ourselves. There were lots of iPhone films and looking at films together and sitting around doing nothing. We'd look at magazines I'd brought. I think her favorite was when I bought Toblerone chocolate. CNN: This was not your first trip to India. How did the purpose of this visit color your impressions of the country? Arieff: The first time I was doing it all in hotels and it was very touristy and I loved it, but it was very touristy. This time I was really staying there for an extended period of time so it was nice to slow down in the crazy country and get to know it as someone staying for extended period of time. It gets under your skin because there's so much going on but people are so warm and everyone's not on their iPhone constantly. The tech industry is the south, Bangalore. In western India, where I was, it was slow and quiet. You hang out and talk and just enjoy being there and that brings you into that whole spiritual place. When I returned both times, people thought I was following a guru because they were not used to me being calm. I was happy to be in a slower-paced setting with kind people. People's homes are more basic and it's more about family and religion.","Adrienne Arieff develops bond with surrogate in India who gives birth to her twin daughters .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, a propaganda video appeared on the Internet featuring Moner Abu-Salha, the U.S. citizen from Florida who died conducting a suicide bomb attack in Syria for al Qaeda in May. The video -- the third in a series of al Qaeda videos about Abu-Salha--underlines the importance of militant networks in Turkey that have enabled many hundreds of fighters from the U.S. and other Western nations to travel to fight with jihadist groups in the civil wars that are tearing apart Syria and Iraq. Abu-Salha says he travelled from the States to Turkey where he eventually connected with representatives of the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, explaining, ""From tons of research I knew that mujahideen [holy warriors] come from all around the world, they come to Istanbul. I heard that the Turkey-Syrian border is close."" Abu-Salha says that he was inspired to go to fight in the Syrian ""holy war"" by a lecture by the notorious Yemeni-American militant cleric, Anwar al-Awlaki who said this about traveling to jihad: ""It's like a cliff, you jump off the cliff but you don't know if the water is deep or shallow. ... You just have to jump and put you're (faith) in Allah that the water is going to be deep and you won't be harmed."" As Abu-Salha tells it, he arrived in Turkey with barely enough money for a Turkish visa and no contacts, but he eventually encountered a member of al Qaeda in Turkey who was bearded, dressed all in black and was missing an arm. The al-Qaeda fighter didn't speak English but Abu-Salha said, ""I'm mujahidin, I'm mujahidin,"" which the man understood and he took him on a bus to meet another al Qaeda member who did speak some English. Abu-Salha recalls, ""They get me something to eat. I tell them I come to fight jihad. I want to feel, die shaheed (as a martyr)."" He says that the members of al Qaeda then took Abu-Salha to a ""safe house"" in Turkey where he encountered two other al Qaeda fighters who had been wounded and who were recovering in the house. Abu-Salha stayed at the safe house for a month, he says, before he was spirited across the border into Syria. The issue of ""homegrown"" American extremists fighting in Iraq and Syria has raised significant concerns among counterterrorism officials. The government is tracking about 100 Americans who have fought or attempted to fight in the Syrian conflict. Douglas McArthur McCain, who grew up in Minnesota, died while fighting for the ultra-militant Islamic State in Syria this past weekend. In addition to Abu-Salha and McCain, eight Americans have been charged with crimes related to supporting or attempting to support militant jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. However, for now, no American involved in the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts has been charged with plotting an attack inside the United States. Both Moner Abu-Salha and Douglas McCain died fighting in the region rather than conducting attacks in their own country. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on August 25 that there are, so far, no signs of ""active plotting against the homeland"" by the Islamic State. As fears heighten of the potential threat from returning Western foreign fighters who have traveled to Syria or Iraq, restraining the flow of these fighters through Turkey must be a key objective. A European diplomat in Turkey told Reuters, ""In recent months especially we've seen a real hardening in Turkey's attitude, a recognition that this is a potential threat to their national security and a desire to take more practical steps through intelligence channels, police channels."" There are signs that Turkey's new efforts may be having an effect. One Islamic State spokesman told the Washington Post, ""It is not as easy to come into Turkey anymore."" Abu-Salah's recounting of his travel illustrates the potential risks foreign fighters take when seeking to reach Syria -- which may be exploitable by security services. Of his initial attempts to connect with militants in Turkey he said: ""It was very dangerous what I was doing because I could have went to jail."" If Turkey's new measures to disrupt the foreign fighter flow continue and a coalition can be built to adequately track and disrupt movement of militants into Syria and Iraq, the threat posed by Americans and other Westerners fighting with jihadist groups in the region may diminish over time.","Peter Bergen: New video of American suicide bomber shows Turkey networks key in jihad .

"A new video shows what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. And the CIA and the Pentagon either didn't know about it or couldn't get a drone there in time to strike. U.S. officials won't comment on that, but every frame of the video is now being analyzed by the United States. In the middle of the clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi, the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has said he wants to attack the United States. But in the video, he looks unconcerned that he could be hit by an American drone. The video started appearing on jihadist websites recently, drawing the attention of U.S. officials and global terrorism experts. U.S. officials say they believe it's authentic. ""This is quite an extraordinary video,"" Paul Cruickshank, CNN terrorism analyst, said. The video shows al-Wuhayshi addressing more than 100 fighters somewhere within Yemen, Cruickshank said, a restive nation on the southwestern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. The al Qaeda leader, he said, is ""taking a big risk in doing this."" But he doesn't mince words about his mission. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" U.S. officials believe the highly produced video is recent. With some fighters faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting. ""The U.S. intelligence community should be surprised that such a large group of al Qaeda assembled together, including the leadership, and somehow they didn't notice,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst. There is good reason to worry. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. The CIA and the Pentagon have repeatedly killed AQAP leaders with drone strikes. But the group is now emboldened. ""The main problem about this group is that it has a bomb maker who can put bombs on to planes that can't be detected,"" Bergen said. That bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, is believed to be responsible for several attack attempts against the United States, including the failed 2009 Christmas Day underwear bomber attack in Detroit. Al-Asiri doesn't appear in the video. He remains in hiding, and intelligence experts say he and other AQAP leaders have gone back to using couriers to communicate to avoid detection. That makes it even harder to figure out what al-Wuhayshi may order next. But the terror group leader's goal is clear, Cruickshank said. ""His message to the United States,"" Cruickshank said, ""was very much the same as (former al Qaeda leader Osama) bin Laden's: 'We're coming after you.' "" U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" that leaks tied to Yemen have affected U.S. intelligence collection, but he said he couldn't say whether U.S. intelligence knew about the meeting. Chairman: al Qaeda 'more diverse and more aggressive' than pre-9/11 . Asked by Blitzer whether the United States would have sent a drone if officials had known such a large meeting of terrorists was taking place out in the open, the Michigan Republican said it's unclear. ""It really depends,"" he said. ""There are a lot of procedures that one would go through ... to do an airstrike on any large package of individuals."" Seeing such a group of al Qaeda operatives assembled isn't a surprise, he said. ""I think they have these meetings more often than people realize,"" Rogers said. ""It's difficult to get assets in position. You have to know where they are and where they meet at the right time in the right place with the right equipment. That's a lot to do."" The video, Rogers says, is another sign that al Qaeda remains a dangerous threat. ""We think that they're feeling empowered. The less pressure you put on them, the more they take that as a victory, the more that they believe that they can get away with plotting, planning, organizing as you saw there (in the video), finance, training,"" he said. ""All of the things that they would need to do to strike a Western target, they're going through that process."" Retired Gen. Mark Kimmitt said smaller al Qaeda affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base. ""Sooner or later, if they continue to get better, stronger and more organized,"" he said, ""they will be a direct threat to the United States."" It's unlikely the United States wasn't aware of the meeting shown in the video, Kimmitt told ""CNN Tonight."" ""The question isn't why didn't we know,"" he said. ""The question is: What are we going to do about it?"" Al Qaeda leader urges militants to find out who killed his Syria representative .

"Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts is threatening to ""shut down the Senate"" with a Ted Cruz-style filibuster if President Barack Obama tries to thwart the congressional ban on moving Guantanamo Bay detainees into U.S. prisons. ""I stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth"" prison in Kansas, Roberts said during an event in Topeka, according to Roll Call. ""I shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate."" The White House denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is considering ways to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which could lead to detainees being transferred into the continental United States. Despite the denial, Republicans were outraged by what they said is another attempt to sidestep Congress. Roberts, faced with a tough re-election race, said he thinks other Republicans would be with him. ""Ted Cruz did it with regards to Obamacare, if necessary I'll do it for terrorists,"" Roberts said. ""I don't know if I could do 21 hours -- maybe 22 or 23. But I will have help on this. I can see John McCain there, and I can see Lindsey Graham there, and I can see Kelly Ayotte there, and I can see a whole bunch of other people there."" Other Republicans also pounced on the report. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Obama is willing to ""unilaterally rewrite the law"" because he is ""so eager to bring these terrorists"" into the country. ""Not only is this scheme dangerous, it is yet another example of what will be this administration's legacy of lawlessness,"" he said. Boehner also quickly sought to parlay the report into an advantage for Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterm elections, saying that ""each and every Democrat should make their position known"" and pledging that the House GOP would oppose any effort to keep detainees housed in Guantanamo Bay out of the United States. The Wall Street Journal's Friday morning report highlights another area where Obama could turn to executive action after seeing his initiatives thwarted in Congress. Already, the president has signed orders to raise the minimum wage and impose anti-discrimination rules for federal workers and contractors. He has also said he plans to announce an immigration overhaul after the midterm elections. In response, House Republicans have sought to sue the president, arguing that he is overstepping his authority. Obama's options could include vetoing an annual bill setting military policy, which since 2010 has included the ban on transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States, or he could attach a signing statement saying he considers that restriction an infringement on his executive power, the Wall Street Journal reported. However, the White House denied the report that similar action is in the works on Guantanamo Bay. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the White House doesn't know ""what new press reports are referring to when they say the administration is 'drafting options' intended to 'override a congressional ban.'"" ""It remains true that we continue to object to congressional restrictions, as we've said many times,"" she said. ""To the greatest extent possible and consistent with our national security interests, detainees will be repatriated or resettled, or prosecuted in federal courts or military commission proceedings,"" Hayden said. There are now 149 detainees housed within the Guantanamo Bay facility. More than half have reportedly been approved for transfer, and some could be shipped to other countries. The possibility of transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States could be a dangerous one for Democrats. A Gallup poll in June found that 66 percent of Americans oppose moving those detainees into U.S. prisons, while just 29 percent support doing so.

"They were taken from their homes, some pulled from their beds, in the middle of the night. They were fathers, brothers and sons, members of the U.S.-allied Albu Nimr tribe -- the Sunni clan considered among the last holdouts against ISIS in Iraq's western desert. About 50 members of the tribe were abducted in Hit in Anbar province, west of Baghdad, during the early morning hours on Saturday, Sheikh Nabil Al-Ga'oud, a tribal leader, told CNN. Their fate is unknown. But Al-Ga'oud and others believe they are likely dead, the latest casualties of ISIS who have killed hundreds of members of the tribe in mass executions in recent days. The Albu Nimr, who number in the tens of thousands, are ready to fight to take back Hit, Al-Ga'oud said. The city was seized last month by ISIS fighters after weeks of fighting the tribesmen. Hit and neighboring Ramadi were holdouts in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province after ISIS swept in from Syria, taking town after town in the western province. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running out of weapons and supplies. Tribal leader says fighters ready to strike ISIS . Albu Nimr has a strong force ready to attack Hit, but they need to get the final OKs from the government and also try to coordinate with the Americans, Al-Ga'oud said. Anbar was the scene of a bloody insurgency during the U.S.-led war in Iraq until an uprising by Sunni tribes, including Albu Nimr, in 2006 took on al Qaeda in Iraq -- the forerunner to ISIS, also known as ISIL. U.S. officials maintain that Iraqi support for Sunni tribes going on the offensive against ISIS will be a necessary part in the effort to defeat the militants, who refer to themselves as the Islamic State. In a news conference this week, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, signaled the possibility of the new role when he said the Iraqi government had not yet requested U.S. military support in efforts to defend a Sunni tribe that has suffered mass executions at the hands of ISIS militants. ""That's why we need to expand the train-advise-and-assist mission into the ... Anbar Province,"" Dempsey said. ""But the precondition for that is that the government of Iraq is willing to arm the tribes."" Dempsey said the United States had ""positive indications"" the Iraqi government was prepared to do that but had not yet acted. There is no indication from Pentagon officials on when such a mission could begin. Public executions, mass graves . The abduction and suspected killings follow reports this week of public executions and the discovery of mass graves containing the bodies of tribesmen killed by ISIS. The bodies of an estimated 200 members of Albu Nimr were found in a mass grave just outside Hit, a senior Iraqi security official told CNN. The tribesmen were captured by ISIS fighters after it took control of the area, the official said. Another 48 tribesmen were marched through the streets of Hit before they were publicly executed, the official said. And a mass grave was found in nearby Ramadi, according to Iraqi media accounts. Video of those executions had been uploaded to the Internet. ""We are deeply concerned by reports of mass executions of Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province by ISIL and strongly condemn the brutal actions that ISIL continues to perpetrate against the Iraqi people,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""...ISIL's indiscriminate crimes prove, yet again, that it is targeting all Iraqis, regardless of faith or region."" Albu Nimr fights back . Albu Nimr is known for its fighting skill and resistance. A 2003 Brookings Institution report observed that, though most Iraqi Sunni tribes were loyal to Saddam Hussein in the days when he ran the country, the Albu Nimr tribe had mounted a protest against the former Iraqi strongman in 1995 after the execution of a noted member. The protest was put down by paramilitary forces loyal to Saddam. In general, however, Saddam respected the Albu Nimr. Since Saddam's fall, they've been tapped to oppose al Qaeda in Iraq. They were also part of last year's Sunni uprising against the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government. They have been fighting ISIS but say they haven't received much support from the Iraqi government and international coalition members.","Hundreds of members of Albu Nimr tribe have been killed by ISIS .

"Australia has raised its terror alert level to ""high"" for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003. According to the four-level system, a reading of ""high"" means a terrorist attack ""is likely,"" however the country's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said no specific threat had been made. ""This does not mean a terror attack is imminent, we have no specific intelligence of particular plots. What we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks,"" Abbott said at a press conference in Canberra on Friday. What does ""high"" mean? Australia introduced its alert system in 2003, with four levels of risk: low, medium, high and extreme. It's been at ""medium"" since the system began, and is defined as meaning a ""terrorist attack could occur."" The elevation to ""high"" would not make much difference to daily life for most people, the prime minister said. ""What people would probably notice though is more security at airports, more security at ports, more security at military bases, more security at government buildings and more security at large public events,"" he said. Why now? The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) earlier this week. David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of jihadists fighting for Islamic extremists ISIS in the Middle East who had recruited Australians to fight. ""They are of concern because, if they come home, they come home with training and with potentially increased intent,"" he told the ABC. Officials believe there are at least 60 Australians fighting with terror group ISIS, and as many as 100 ""facilitators"" still in the country. A number of arrest warrants have been issued for suspected terrorists fighting abroad, and police have swooped on a number of suspects in Australia, most recently arresting two men in Brisbane for allegedly recruiting and funding fighters sent to Syria. Alert levels elsewhere . Australia's higher alert level follows an increase in the United Kingdom, which raised its level from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" in late August. Again, authorities said there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent. However, hundreds of British citizens are believed to have joined jihadists abroad. Notably, a hooded man with a British accent appeared to be the executioner of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff on videos released by ISIS. The U.S. replaced its color-coded warning system with the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) in 2011. NTAS alerts are only issued if there's ""credible information about a threat."" And, alerts are classified as either ""elevated"" or ""imminent."" France abandoned its color-coded alerts earlier this year, and instead now relies on a two-level ""Vigipirate"" system. When more vigilance is needed, the triangle logo is displayed in public places. If there's specific intelligence of an attack, the logo carries the words ""alerte attentat"" or ""attack alert.""

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)On the principal's desk at the Peshawar's Government High School for Boys sits a screen beaming surveillance video from around the campus. In one of the desk's drawers, within easy reach of Abdul Saeed's right hand, lies a fully loaded pistol. A teacher for 15 years, Saeed argues that bringing a gun to school reassures his students, who are still terrified after a brazen attack on the Army Public School and Degree College in December, when Taliban militants stormed the building and massacred dozens of students during a six-hour siege. ""They would look to the door every time they heard a sound. Now when they see me wearing a gun, they need not worry and can focus on the task at hand, which is to educate themselves,"" Saeed says. Barbed wire, surveillance cameras and snipers have become a common sight in the schools of this Pakistani city.  Private schools in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkua, which lies along Pakistan's northwest frontier, have been instructed by the government to arrange security guards and metal detectors. School officials remain tight-lipped about the threats they've received from militants, but stories have emerged of empty coffins being sent to principals as an ominous suggestion of the danger that could lie ahead. After the brutal attack, Pakistan Taliban spokesman Mohammed Khurrassani told CNN the bloodshed was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen during repeated army operations in provinces including South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency. Last month, the provincial government pledged to spend seven billion rupees ($69 million) on enhancing security at government run schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhua. However, KPK information minister Mushtaq Ghani says it is still not enough prevent in an attack on the 35,000 government-run schools in the province. So, in an extraordinary measure, the KPK government has allowed teachers with firearm licenses to keep guns at school. Umar Daraz, a mild mannered primary school teacher who has been a member of the Executive Council of Peshawar's Primary Teacher Association for more than 20 years, is shocked by the decision. ""Why would you glorify guns?"" he asks. ""If teachers take guns into classroom it glorifies this deadly weapon in the eyes of children, and in the future it could inspire them to seek out guns, misuse them and cause more tragedies to take place."" ""Teachers are meant to teach,"" he adds. At a shooting range in Peshawar, the Khyber Pakhtunkua police force has started basic weapon training sessions for teachers interested in learning how to use firearms. Faisal Mukhtar, a police superintendent, says that one of the reasons given for arming teachers is so they can hold militants at bay during a potential attack until security forces arrive. Around 20 female teachers have already received training from Inspector Rozia Altaf. Most had never held a gun before. ""The tragedy of December 16 has emboldened these women,"" Altaf tells CNN. ""Most of them were mothers and they were helpless then -- they will be never helpless again."" Regardless of the day's training, Mukhtar says none of the teachers involved have expressed interest in obtaining a gun license. Back at the principal's office, Saeed places the gun on his desk and shares his experience of volunteering at hospitals on the day of the attack. His eyes tear up as he recalls seeing schoolboys as young as 12 with bullet wounds that would not be uncommon on a battlefield. He brushes away those who criticize the decision to bring in guns to schools, saying ""these are extraordinary times and we must deal with them in extraordinary ways. ""After what I have seen I refuse to be helpless and unarmed if anyone comes in to attack my students the way [the militants] did in December. ""We were once warriors of the chalk and the blackboard. Now we must be soldiers at war and fight for the cause of education and a brighter future for our children.""","Teachers in Peshawar, Pakistan now allowed to carry guns to school .

"America's top military officer raised the specter Tuesday of U.S. troops in Iraq taking on a combat role to fight ISIS, a position that was quickly knocked down by the White House. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it was possible that U.S. troops advising and assisting Iraq's military could be deployed to fight. ""To be clear, if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the President,"" Dempsey said during testimony before the committee. Dempsey's comments, which he made several times under questioning by senators, contradicts President Barack Obama's promise that the campaign to defeat and destroy the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State would not include American ""boots on the ground."" U.S. airstrike hits ISIS target near Baghdad, first in 'expanded efforts' The contradiction quickly raised a question for the White House: How is serving as ""close combat advisers"" -- in Dempsey's words -- not a combat role? Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, pressed Dempsey on the issue at one point in the hearing, asking if pilots dropping bombs in Iraq were part of a combat mission and if the U.S. would rescue any pilots shot down. Dempsey responded ""Yes and yes."" Top U.S. military officer: U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS, if necessary . The Obama administration moved quickly to tamp down any suggestion that the United States would deploy combat troops. Even Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was seated next to Dempsey at the Senate committee hearing, repeated the President's promise. White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated Obama's position, telling reporters that U.S. troops -- some 1,600 -- in Iraq were serving in advise-and-assist roles, staffing the joint operation centers and defending the Embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Irbil. ""What he's been very specific and precise about is that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role into Iraq or Syria,"" Earnest told reporters. War against ISIS: What does Rand Paul's 'yes' mean? The Pentagon's spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, characterized Dempsey's statement as a hypothetical, saying on CNN's ""Amanpour"" that the chairman was speaking about his ""best military advice"" should U.S. troops in Iraq need to act in an advise-and-assist role with ""lower level units."" ""If he felt that the strategy as it was being proposed and executed was failing that he would not hesitate to change his advice to the commander in chief about maybe putting advisers in lower level units out there,"" Kirby said. ""But he also said that he supports the strategy that we are executing right now, and he also said that he doesn't believe we are at that stage right now."" Even so, when pushed during his testimony to expand on his statement, Dempsey told the senators that if the current approach fails, he may recommend the use of ground troops. Borger: Vote on war against ISIS? Don't be silly . The committee hearing came as the House prepares to vote to give the President authorization to arm and train moderate Syrian rebel groups that have been vetted. A Senate vote on the measure would follow. The Obama administration has, however, ruled out putting U.S. military advisers on the ground in Syria. Early in his testimony, Dempsey also seemed to lay out a new version of the administration's mission, saying it was to ""destroy"" ISIS in Iraq and to ""disrupt"" it in Syria. The hearing was interrupted several times by antiwar protesters from the groups Code Pink and Popular Resistance, each of whom chanted and held up signs until they were ejected. ""There is no military solution,"" one woman chanted. ""America does not want war."" The latest CNN/ORC poll shows the American public is worried about the threat of ISIS, with 87% saying they are ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the group. About three-quarters of Americans support U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, and 38% even support putting U.S. ground troops in Iraq or Syria.

"Madrid (CNN)Spanish authorities arrested four suspected members of a terror cell Saturday morning in that country's North African territory of Ceuta, a quartet that Spain's Interior Minister claimed were well-trained and well-prepared to attack. Those arrested were two pairs of brothers, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters Saturday. ""What is especially noteworthy with the breakup of this cell are the many parallels with the attacks in Paris recently carried out against the Charlie Hebdo magazine,"" Fernandez said, referring to the January 7 massacre that ended with 12 dead. Ceuta is a tiny, 7-square-mile Spanish exclave bordering Morocco, across the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain. The suspects, who are Spanish citizens and are of Moroccan origin, are ""strongly radicalized"" and had psychological and physical training, as well as training in the use of weapons, said the minister while addressing reporters at an event of his ruling conservative party. ""(They were) willing to carry out an attack,"" Fernandez said. ""And, according to the police, to blow themselves up.""","Interior minister: ""They were willing to carry out an attack""

"Kaci Hickox, a nurse placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey, went on CNN on Sunday and criticized the ""knee-jerk reaction by politicians"" to Ebola, saying ""to quarantine someone without a better plan in place, without more forethought, is just preposterous."" Hickox, an epidemiologist who was working to help treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, has tested negative twice for Ebola and does not have symptoms, she said. She is quarantined for 21 days at University Hospital in Newark. ""This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,"" Hickox told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union."" She described herself as ""physically strong"" but ""emotionally exhausted."" ""To put me through this emotional and physical stress is completely unacceptable,"" she said. She slammed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for describing her as ""obviously ill."" ""First of all, I don't think he's a doctor; secondly, he's never laid eyes on me; and thirdly, I've been asymptomatic since I've been here,"" Hickox told Crowley Sunday. In a separate interview with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, Hickox elaborated on what she thought of Christie's assessment of her medical condition. ""I'm sorry, but that's just a completely unacceptable statement in my opinion. For (Christie) -- a politician who's trusted and respected -- to make a statement that's categorically not true is just unacceptable and appalling."" What would mandatory quarantines do? ""She's fine. She's not sick."" Hickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is ""not a sound public health decision"" and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety. ""For the first 12 hours, I was in shock. Now I'm angry,"" she added. On Sunday, Hickox's lawyers met with Hickox at the hospital, saying they had a 75-minute conversation through a piece of clear plastic while she sat inside the tent. ""She's fine. She's not sick,"" lawyer Steven Hyman said in a sidewalk news conference aired on CNN affiliate WABC. ""She went and did a magnanimous thing and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, not put in isolation because some political leaders decided it looks good to do that."" Lawyer Norman Siegal,  former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said he'll be filing papers in court for Hickox to have a hearing no later than five days from the start of her confinement. He said the doctors at the hospital say there's no medical reason to hold her. The policy Christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad, he said. ""We need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests,"" he said. In a Sunday evening news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commented briefly on Hickox's case, saying that ""what happened to her was inappropriate."" ""This hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction."" ""We owe her better than that, and all the people who do this work, better than that,"" he added. Ebola gets political . 'To put me in prison is just inhumane' Hickox arrived in Newark Liberty Airport on Friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital. She was put in an isolation tent inside University Hospital in Newark. She's twice tested negative for Ebola, including a test at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Hickox says she has asked repeatedly but hasn't been told how long she'll be held at the hospital. ""To put me in prison,"" she said, ""is just inhumane."" On Sunday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he was changing the state's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the Ebola zone. People who worked with Ebola patients but don't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home, the governor's office said. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said late Sunday night: ""The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home.  Nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey."" On Fox News Sunday morning, Christie said he had ""no second thoughts"" about New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for health care workers. ""I believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they've been directly exposed to people with the virus,"" he said. Christie also told ""Fox News Sunday"" that a voluntary system of quarantine isn't reliable. ""I don't believe that when you're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system; this is the government's job."" At a news conference Saturday, the governor said, ""I'm sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced, but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much, much greater concern of mine.  I hope she recovers quickly."" Hickox said she has nothing to recover from. Her temperature is normal, and she feels fine. ""Everyone keeps asking how I'm feeling physically and of course I'm fine physically, but I don't think most people understand what it's like to be alone in a tent and decisions are being made that don't make sense and show no compassion,"" Hickox said, starting to cry. ""I just feel like fear is winning right now, and when fear wins, everyone loses."" Her life in quarantine . She's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper scrubs to wear. Hickox said she has no shower, no flushable toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material. Mostly, she says, she stares at the walls. On Sunday afternoon, the hospital issued an update saying ""the patient has computer access, use of her cell phone, reading material (magazines, newspaper) and requested and has received take-out food and drink."" Hickox said she's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else. ""The tent has a window, and doctors talk to me in normal clothes from outside the window,"" she says. ""So if there's no risk to them talking to me from outside the window, it doesn't make any sense that my lawyer wouldn't be able to do the same."" A spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make Hickox comfortable. ""While we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience, it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible. We have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient,"" said Stacie Newton, spokesperson for University Hospital in Newark. Would policy discourage health workers? Hickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to West Africa to help quell the Ebola outbreak. That thought was echoed by Dr. Rick Sacra, an Ebola survivor. He said he's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored . ""You might have some renegade workers flying into Toronto and then driving home and so they're not on anyone's radar,"" he said. ""If quarantines push people away from transparent, friendly, respectful, dialogue with public health workers, that may increase the risk back home."" Hickox said she would welcome Christie to visit her in the hospital. ""Maybe he could tell me what 'obviously ill' means. That would be great,"" she said. She added that she doesn't regret her trip to help Ebola patients in Africa. ""Someone asked me earlier would I do this again if I knew what would happen, and my answer is categorically yes,"" she said. ""I feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work."" After hearing Hickox's phone interview with Candy Crowley on Sunday, New Jersey Health officials emailed CNN's ""State of the Union"" to refute some of the claims made by Hickox. In the email, Donna Leusner, communications director for the New Jersey Department of Health, wrote that Hickox did receive reading materials and got computer access. Leusner also wrote that ""the patient was given a copy of the quarantine order on Friday and is receiving regular updated information.""","New Jersey puts Kaci Hickox into a 21-day quarantine despite her testing negative for Ebola .

"(CNN)At least 3.7 million people, including world leaders, marched in anti-terrorism rallies in Paris and elsewhere in France on Sunday, French officials said, calling the massive gathering in the nation's capital the largest in France's history. The day was emotional and peaceful, a gesture of unity just days after Islamic extremists slaughtered 17 people. World leaders joined French President Francois Hollande, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The day also brought together an unlikely duo at the rally: Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A photographer captured Merkel leaning her head gently on Hollande's shoulder. The rally began with a march through Paris streets at 3 p.m., but a massive group of people stayed into the night. Among them was Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Great Mosque of Paris and president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. One man in the crowd said the French people must not ""give in to fear."" Terrorists, he said, ""will not win."" Others carried signs that echoed the now-famous phrase that honored slain journalists at the magazine Charlie Hebdo, ""Je suis Charlie."" Zineb El Rhazoui, a journalist at the magazine, talked about the magazine's financial struggles and the difficulty of working under constant threats: ""I am very happy for all this help, but for us, it was a heavy price to pay, and it is too much. ""It took 12 deaths for us to finally be a little bit understood after we have been hated and booed by everybody."" For the guards and police officers who lost their lives in last week's attacks in France, there were signs reading ""We are all cops."" For Muslims in France who want to convey that the ideology embraced by the Muslim gunmen does not represent the whole of the faith, signs read ""We are all Muslims."" For everyone, no matter their race, class or ethnic background, signs that said ""We are all French"" were held up with pride. Sunday brought the end to a traumatic week in France. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, the Charlie Hebdo gunmen, were killed Friday after one of two violent standoffs. Twelve people were slain at the satirical magazine offices on Wednesday. In the other standoff, Amedy Coulibaly, suspected in the shooting death of a police officer, was killed by security forces Friday after he shot and killed four hostages during a siege at a kosher market. French law enforcement officers were told to remove their social media presence and carry their weapons at all times, because terror sleeper cells had been activated over the past 24 hours in the country, a French police source who attended a briefing Saturday told CNN terror analyst Samuel Laurent. Coulibaly had made several phone calls about targeting police officers in France, according to the source. A video that appears to show Coulibaly pledging allegiance to terror group ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is being shared on Jihadist websites. Brian Hale, the spokesman for the U.S. director of national intelligence, told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. intelligence community is ""aware of the video and is reviewing it to determine its authenticity."" Threats against people outside of France, particularly against journalists, persisted Sunday. The offices of Belgian newspaper Le Soir were evacuated Sunday after members of the newsroom received an anonymous phone call of a bomb threat, the newspaper reported. Police locked down the street where paper operates. And officials in the New York City Police Department responded to a threat from ISIS after someone re-released a September 2014 message that tells followers to ""rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians,"" specifically naming the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. NYPD employees were told to ""remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol,"" especially in light of the attacks in France last week, in an internal memo. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement. Both notices make clear that the threat is consistent with previous threats ISIS and others, including al Qaeda, have made. As investigators worked leads, a sea of demonstrators in Paris broke into song, held hands, cheered and passionately denounced violence. An imam and a number of Muslims were in the crowd. A young Muslim French woman held a sign that said, ""I am a Jew."" She told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen that she was horrified to hear of the killings, and the killers do not live according to the Islamic principles she's been taught. ""Our religion is the religion of love. ... Our religion loves Jews ... loves Christians. We are not terrorists,"" one Muslim man said, his voice rising. He lifted his arm and gestured to many people around him who came to denounce violence: ""We are all Muslim!"" French officials announced ""exceptional measures"" to protect the throngs gathered near the Place de la Republique in central Paris, and a who's who of foreign leaders at the rally -- a test of the security forces of a nation rocked by days of terrorist violence. After the rally, Hollande arrived to huge applause and a cheering crowd at the Synagogue de la Victoire to show support for France's Jews. He was joined by Netanyahu. The targeting of the kosher grocery store shook the nation's Jewish communities. Amid heightened security concerns, the synagogue was closed Saturday for the first time since World War II. On Sunday, ""Jerusalem of Gold"" -- a popular song by Naomi Shemer that became an anthem during the Six-Day War in 1967 -- played in the place of worship. It was just one of several gestures of solidarity Sunday among some of the world's most influential leaders. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Queen Rania were at the rally. Several people in the crowd and on social media wondered why U.S. President Barack Obama was not there; he was at the White House on Sunday. CNN has asked for an explanation from the State Department and White House of his absence. There has been no response so far. Secretary of State John Kerry was not at the rally either. A senior State Department official told CNN that Kerry had committed a long time ago to be the lead speaker at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's entrepreneurship and innovation summit in India. The official said that Kerry did not want to cancel that as he continues to work on the United States' relationship with the nation. Attorney General Eric Holder was not at the rally but was in Paris this weekend to attend a security summit on combating terrorism. He recorded interviews that aired in the U.S. on Sunday. Ambassador to France Jane Hartley represented the United States at the rally. She tweeted several images of the crowd. Speaking on air with CNN's Jake Tapper, who was at the rally, ""Global Public Square"" host Fareed Zakaria tried to put Obama and other senior leaders' absence in context. Zakaria called it a mistake. France is the United States' ""deepest ideological ally,"" he said, and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member, or the President, standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders. Tapper noted that security has been tenuous. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and other officials said 2,300 police officers, as well as paramilitary forces, would be deployed Sunday. The dignitaries and leaders were to be protected by special units. Police snipers, plainclothes and anti-terror officers were deployed, and parking and transit restrictions were in place. The government planned to close large sections of the city to traffic, Cazeneuve said. Zakaria observed that security concerns didn't dissuade Netanyahu or Abbas or other controversial leaders from showing up. The bright side, he said, is that Obama's absence showed that the struggle against radical Islam is ""not all about America."" ""Many people have tended to think that Islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without America,"" Zakaria said. ""This is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists. Even if you take the U.S. out of it ... the civilized world is up in arms."" French investigators are still trying to piece connections between three terror suspects killed Friday and their suspected links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other terrorist groups. Security will remain heightened as the investigations continue, officials have said. CNN's Evan Perez, Lorenzo Ferrigno, Laurie Segall, Pamela Brown, Kristina Sgueglia,  Kevin Bohn, Ray Sanchez and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","NYPD and other U.S. law enforcement alerted to threat from ISIS .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans and outside groups used anonymous Twitter accounts to share internal polling data ahead of the midterm elections, CNN has learned, a practice that raises questions about whether they violated campaign finance laws that prohibit coordination. The Twitter accounts were hidden in plain sight. The profiles were publicly available but meaningless without knowledge of how to find them and decode the information, according to a source with knowledge of the activities. The practice is the latest effort in the quest by political operatives to exploit the murky world of campaign finance laws at a time when limits on spending in politics are eroding and regulators are being defanged. The law says that outside groups, such as super PACs and non-profits, can spend freely on political causes as long as they don't coordinate their plans with campaigns. Sharing costly internal polls in private, for instance, could signal to the campaign committees where to focus precious time and resources. The groups behind the operation had a sense of humor about what they were doing. One Twitter account was named after Bruno Gianelli, a fictional character in The West Wing who pressed his colleagues to use ethically questionable ""soft money"" to fund campaigns. A typical tweet read: ""CA-40/43-44/49-44/44-50/36-44/49-10/16/14-52-->49/476-10s."" The source said posts like that -- which would look like gibberish to most people -- represented polling data for various House races. Posting the information on Twitter, which is technically public, could provide a convenient loophole to the law â€” or could run afoul of it. ""It's a line that has not been defined. This is really on the cutting edge,"" said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization focused on campaign finance issues. ""It might not be legal. It's a cutting edge practice that, to my knowledge, the Federal Election Commission has never before addressed to explicitly determine its legality or permissibility."" At least two outside groups and a Republican campaign committee had access to the information posted to the accounts, according to the source. They include American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Karl Rove; American Action Network, a nonprofit advocacy group, and the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the campaign arm for the House GOP. Accounts deleted . The accounts that CNN reviewed were active in the months ahead of this month's election, which gave Republicans their largest majority in the House since World War II and control of the Senate. They were live until Nov. 3 but deleted minutes after CNN contacted the NRCC with questions. Representatives for American Crossroads, American Action Network and the NRCC declined repeated requests for comment for this story. CNN captured screenshots of the Twitter communications before contacting the parties involved. American Crossroads dropped $21.6 million during the most recent election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The American Action Network, meanwhile, spent nearly $9 million on federal elections in 2014. It's difficult to determine whether Twitter posts prompted ad buys or other spending in specific races. Two of the profiles were named @TruthTrain14 and @brunogianelli44 but it's unclear which group used specific accounts. Still, the tweeting through special code could raise questions about whether the groups illegally coordinated, according to Kenneth Gross, a former head of the FEC enforcement division who now advises Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance issues. 'Decoder ring' ""If it truly requires some sort of Ovaltine decoder ring to make heads or tails of the information, then there certainly is the possibility that there was some pre-arrangement,"" Gross said. ""Just making it public is not enough. You have to further meet the requirement of no pre-arrangement or coordination. But it is the burden of the government to demonstrate that."" Beyond coordination, the social media operation could also raise questions about whether the polling data contained in the tweets constituted a donation to the NRCC that should have been reported. The groups could have violated election rules by not reporting the information in the tweets as a donation. The tweets captured by screenshots stretched back to July, but the groups have communicated in this manner for four years, the source said. Staffers for each group deleted individual tweets every few months, so only the past few months of data were available when CNN first viewed the Twitter accounts. The social media strategy isn't the first time parties and outside groups have used Twitter to communicate. In April, it was Republicans who accused Democrats of attempting to ""subvert campaign finance laws"" when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's official Twitter accounts posted messages that Democratic super PACs later incorporated into their ads. And both parties are working hard to find ways to work more closely with well-financed outside groups. Earlier this year, for instance, the National Journal reported that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, posted what appear to be ad scripts on her websites that Republicans say telegraphed messages the campaign would like to see on the air. In the North Carolina Senate race this year, Republican Thom Tillis' campaign posted a detailed memo on its website specifically laying out its needs for television and digital ad buys. Meanwhile, outside groups also share details of their plans by releasing spending plans to the media or posting the information on their websites as press releases. But the Twitter accounts in this case are unique in that they did not publicly identify their association with the groups who posted to them or advertise their existence. Citizens United . The Twitter operation underscores the uncertain state of campaign finance rules after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision upended limits on outside spending in politics. Regulations provided by the FEC in the wake of the court ruling leave much to interpretation about what constitutes ""coordination,"" creating a Wild West environment that, according to campaign finance experts, gives outside groups ample opportunity to share information while arguing they stayed within the confines of the law. ""It may bend common sense, but not necessarily the law,"" said Daniel Tokaji, a professor of Constitutional Law at Ohio State University who co-authored a study this year examining the relationship between outside groups and campaigns. ""A lot of things you and I would consider coordination are not coordination under the law. I don't think sharing polling data is going to be enough to establish that the campaign was materially involved in decisions about content, target audience or timing."" In response to this story Monday, FEC vice-chair Ann Ravel said the commission may address the use of social media to share campaign information, but conceded that the rules governing campaign finance are ""murky."" The strategy, Ravel wrote on Twitter, ""shows that tech changing politics... but coordination rules sadly murky."" The practice also serves as another reminder of Washington's revolving door between campaign committees, party leadership and outside groups.

"Organizational confusion, gaps in training, a series of communication failures and more allowed Omar Gonzalez to jump a fence and enter the White House in a September incident that led to the Secret Service director's resignation. The Department of Homeland Security published an in-depth review of the failures that allowed Gonzalez to run past several agents and burst into the first family's residence. Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' findings were made public Thursday after lawmakers were briefed on its findings. The report details alarm and radio systems that didn't work as planned, a chase foiled when Gonzalez disappeared into the bushes, and an officer who was supposed to release canines trained to take down intruders who reacted 11 seconds late because he was in a van talking on his personal cell phone, without his radio earpiece in place and with his second radio in his locker. The canine officer ""gave Gonzalez the required verbal warning about the canine, caught a glimpse of Gonzalez heading toward the bushes, and gave his canine the command to apprehend Gonzalez,"" the review said. ""The canine, however, did not have enough time to lock onto Gonzalez and may not have seen Gonzalez at all,"" it said. The review offered a particularly grim look at the Secret Service's communications systems, which it said prevented some officers from being notified that a man had jumped the White House's fence. ""A combination of technical missteps, lack of radio discipline, improper use of equipment and aging infrastructure,"" as well as an improper setting on the Secret Service's radio system, contributed to those problems, it said. The officers who activated the Secret Service's emergency communication system didn't provide the necessary details of the incident over that system -- and even if they had, some key posts had muted their receivers. The review also pointed to time cut from the understaffed Secret Service's training programs, saying officers hadn't received instruction on how to handle intruders who didn't appear to be armed. Officials: Fence jumper made it into East Room of White House . An executive summary of the review was published Thursday evening by Democratic members of the House Homeland Security Committee. A White House official confirmed that the review of the incident is complete. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said the report shows the Secret Service was ""significantly hampered"" by ""critical and major failures in communications, confusion about operation protocols, and gaps in staffing and training."" ""While some of these problems can be attributed to a lack of resources, others are systemic and indicative of Secret Service culture,"" Thompson said. The incident led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson. Her interim replacement, Joe Clancy, was seen having breakfast with agents, including the special agent in charge of President Barack Obama's protective detail, on Thursday morning. The bulk of the review of the September 19 incident focuses on the period after 7:19 p.m., when Gonzalez climbed the fence at a spot where an ornamental spike was missing, ignored the instructions of two officers outside the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue to stop and ran onto the White House's North Lawn. Two more officers pointed their rifles at Gonzalez but chose not to fire, because they believed he wasn't armed. Then they lost him in the bushes on the White House's North Portico. The officers said they were ""surprised that Gonzalez was able to get through the bushes; prior to that evening, the officers believed the bushes too thick to be passable."" The canine officer, meanwhile, missed the radio alerts. Official: Secret Service twice interviewed, released Gonzalez . An officer parked behind the canine officer couldn't see past the 6- to 8-foot tall bushes and trees on the north grounds. ""By the time the officer exited his vehicle and began yelling commands at Gonzalez, Gonzalez had nearly arrived at the bushes,"" the review said. ""The officer was unable to reach Gonzalez before he entered the bushes and, as a result, went around the bushes toward the North Portico only to find that Gonzalez had already entered the White House."" The officer posted outside the North Portico doors of the White House heard ""unintelligible traffic over the radio"" and ""pointed his weapon at Gonzalez, put his finger on the trigger, and ordered him to get down."" ""Gonzalez did not obey, but the officer did not see any indication that Gonzalez was armed or presented a threat warranting the use of lethal force,"" the review said. ""The officer saw that the wooden mansion doors were closed and assumed that they were locked and that Gonzalez would be cornered between him"" and other officers and canines. The doors weren't locked. The officer stationed behind those doors was knocked backward when Gonzalez burst through as she was trying to lock them. She tried twice to take Gonzalez down but failed ""because of the size disparity between the two."" She tried to use her baton, but accidentally grabbed her flashlight instead. She threw it down, grabbed her gun and continued to order Gonzalez to stop, as he ignored her and briefly entered the East Room. That's when an officer inside the White House and down the hall ""managed to bring Gonzalez to the ground in the center hallway."" Two agents who had just finished their shifts ran to help, and together they pinned down and handcuffed Gonzalez.","Fence-jumping incident prompts Homeland Security review .

"(CNN)Anais Bordier and Samantha Futerman have the same laugh and the same freckled cheeks. They wear their hair the same way and have since they were babies. They share a hatred of cooked carrots, a love of the same color nail polish and the need to sleep 10 hours a day. The pair tease, poke and prod each other like they've grown up together, but they didn't. Neither woman knew she had an identical twin sister until less than two years ago. That's where the power of the Internet, a lot of luck and a series of ""what ifs"" enter the picture. I sat down with the 26-year-old sisters in Central Park recently to talk about their new book ""Separated @ Birth: A True Love Story of Twin Sisters Reunited,"" which chronicles their thoroughly modern reunion. Bordier, who grew up in Paris, is an aspiring fashion designer who was studying in London. On a Saturday in December 2012, while she was on a bus, a friend sent her a screen shot of a YouTube video featuring Futerman, who is an actress. ""I'm automatically thinking, 'Oh, who posted a video of me on YouTube?' "" she said with a laugh. The resemblance was uncanny. When she got home, she looked again and realized it wasn't her but a girl who looked exactly like her who lived in the United States. She looked for credits on the video to find the woman's name but couldn't find anything, so she dropped the matter. That was until the same friend who sent the screen shot said he saw the girl from the video in a movie trailer, also on YouTube, about a month later. Bordier's investigative instincts kicked into overdrive. She learned Futerman's name and discovered they shared a birthday and were both adopted in South Korea. ""I stalk her a little bit more, learn that she was actually born in the same port city in Korea, and yes, started looking through all her pictures."" She got up her nerve and decided to contact Futerman via Facebook, sending her a friend request and a message. The similarities between her story and the film ""The Parent Trap,"" featuring Lindsay Lohan in the most recent version, were not lost on Bordier. She wrote in her message to Futerman: ""I don't want to be too Lindsay Lohan, well ... but ... how to put it ... I was wondering where you were born?"" Futerman, who was raised in Verona, New Jersey, and who has two brothers (her parents' biological sons) and a half-brother from her father's previous marriage, at first didn't know what to make of Bordier's friend request and message. ""It's pretty strange to get a message from yourself on Facebook,"" she said. ""It's a really weird experience."" It took her a few days to respond. ""I thought, 'Wow, this could actually be true,' "" Futerman said. The first time they talked on Skype, they were supposed to chat for 90 minutes but ended up talking for three hours -- a conversation that proved to be life-changing. ""We were 25 at the time, and it's like that quarter-life crisis thing when you think it's all downhill,"" Futerman said. ""I have to buy my health insurance. I'm getting kicked off my parents' (plan). There's nothing good any more, and then it teaches you that anything's possible."" For Bordier, an only child, discovering she had a sister was amazing, but realizing that she had a twin was ""even crazier, because you have so much in common."" ""You have a very strong bond that you can't actually explain, but we understand each other without even really talking,"" Bordier said. ""I could see her body language. ... We understand each other right away."" A DNA test proved what they already knew -- that they were, in fact, twins -- and now they planned to meet in person for the first time in London. ""The only way to explain it is being the most intense long-distance relationship and talking over months on social media and Skype,"" Futerman said. But connecting on the Internet was one thing; meeting in person was ""still really scary,"" she said. Bordier said she found herself at that first meeting needing to keep her distance, because it all felt ""very strange,"" but at the same time wanting some proof that her identical twin sister was real. ""So I just poked her,"" she said during the interview, at which point they both laughed. That same laugh. Their reunion, which they each chronicle in alternating chapters in the book, is also part of a documentary, which they are producing and hope to release next year. The support they have received as their story has gotten national attention and the interest they have had from other adoptees and twins have motivated them to try to raise awareness and provide resources for international adoptions. ""It inspired us to become something bigger than just ourselves and to share our story for a reason,"" Futerman said. She and Bordier have teamed up with Futerman's friend, fellow actress Jenna Ushkowitz, a Korean-American adoptee and cast member on ""Glee,"" to start a foundation called kindred. The foundation is focused on helping adoptees, both in the U.S. and worldwide, with family reunions and any other issues they might encounter. ""It's such a joy to find your family,"" Bordier said. ""I guess when you're adopted, you're always looking for somebody that looks like you, that will understand you."" Both women say their parents are delighted with the news, although they were upset initially, since neither set of parents knew the girls had a twin. Their adoption papers list their births as a single birth, they said. ""Of course, my mom was very protective and said, 'We would have taken both of you' when they felt that we were missing out on growing up together,"" Futerman said. They have tried to reach out to their birth mother but reveal in the book that she has not been interested in connecting with them. ""If we've learned anything in this story, it's that things will happen as they should,"" Futerman said. ""And if one day she wants to reach out to us, then we're here, and we're willing, and we're ready."" Though they still live halfway around the world from each other, Bordier in Paris and Futerman in Los Angeles, they text multiple times every day. ""Basically, I wake up to 20 text messages, 'What are you doing?' 'I'm on my way to work.' 'It's cold out,' "" Futerman said. ""It's just completely arbitrary things that happen during the day. And it's constant."" Bordier says Futerman is always waking her up in the morning via text because of the time difference. She'll get messages like, ""Wake up, you're late,"" she said. ""It's amazing to feel that someone is always awake somewhere in the world, and you feel protected,"" Bordier said. They may have been torn apart as babies, but they say they are now forever bonded. ""We're not worried about being separated again,"" Futerman said. What do you think about the twins' story?

"Opponents of President Barack Obama's plan, which makes sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system by use of executive order, focused their criticism on the legal case, saying Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his authority and is ignoring the will of the people. Republicans started attacking the plan long before and soon after the President's prime-time address to the nation Thursday night, as GOP activists and lawmakers took to TV, their emails and their Twitter accounts to call out the commander-in-chief. ""By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement after the speech. ""His 'my way or the highway' approach makes it harder to build the trust with the American people that is necessary to get things done on behalf of the country. Republicans are left with the serious responsibility of upholding our oath of office."" RELATED: Democrats, Republicans take immigration fight to Twitter . Across the right, high profile Republicans -- including potential 2016 White House hopefuls -- vented their rage at an executive branch they see as out of control and out of touch. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called Obama's action ""ill-advised"" and said it ""undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis"" that should come from Congress. ""President Obama has once again put divisive and manipulative politics before the sober leadership and sound laws required of an exceptional nation,"" Bush said in a statement. ""It is time for Republican leaders in Congress to act. We must demonstrate to Americans we are the party that will tackle serious challenges and build broad-based consensus to achieve meaningful reforms for our citizens and our future."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he ""will not sit idly by and let the President bypass Congress and our Constitution."" ""President Obama is not above the law and has no right to issue executive amnesty. His actions blatantly ignore the Separations of Powers and the principles our country was founded on. The President has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration,"" Paul said in a statement. The GOP seemed to take little comfort in Obama's explanation that his actions were in line with other actions past presidents had made. ""His actions are not only unconstitutional and in defiance of the American people who said they did not want amnesty in the 2014 elections, but they are also unfair to every immigrant who has come to our nation legally,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas posted to his Facebook profile. Other Texas Republicans said that the President's actions were not only lawless but also ineffectual. ""The president's decision tonight will lead to more illegal immigration, not less,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. ""It is time for the president and Congress to secure our border, followed by meaningful reforms. There is no more time for political grandstanding."" Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the second-place finisher in the 2012 battle for the GOP presidential nod and a potential 2016 contender, called the executive order ""just another in a long line of power-grabs by this administration. Despite saying as recently as one year ago that he was not the 'emperor' of the United States, this President simply does not believe that the Executive is a co-equal branch of government."" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, though, offered a more muted reaction -- focusing his criticism on how Obama handled the changes he announced Thursday night. ""We need immigration reform. But the right way to do it is to first bring illegal immigration under control by securing the borders and enforcing the laws, then modernizing our legal immigration system,"" Rubio said in a statement. ""After we do these things, we will eventually have to deal with those here illegally in a reasonable but responsible way. The President's actions now make all of this harder and are unfair to people in our immigration system who are doing things the right way."" The attorneys general in Texas and Oklahoma both said they were planning lawsuits challenging Obama's authority to overhaul immigration rules without the approval of Congress. In Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is weeks away from becoming governor, said in a statement he is ""prepared to immediately challenge President Obama in court, securing our state's sovereignty and guaranteeing the rule of law as it was intended under the Constitution."" Some Republicans were working on ways to block Obama from implementing his immigration order. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina posted on Youtube his case against the President's proposal. ""I will try to defund the effort for him to go at it alone,"" Graham said in a video post Thursday night. ""We will challenge him in court."" Others said they'll look to government funding bills. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter pledged on Twitter that he will do ""everything I can"" to stop Obama's move, ""starting with removing any funding for amnesty."" Arizona Sen. John McCain said Obama's ""executive fiat"" hurts chances of working with a Republican-dominated Congress on an immigration reform bill. He said in a statement that Obama's executive action ""not only lacks legal justification, but will set back important bipartisan efforts to reform our broken immigration system and secure our nation's borders -- causes I have long supported."" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus -- who just two years ago, in the wake of the GOP's 2012 electoral defeat, endorsed a report that called on his party to support an immigration overhaul -- blasted Obama for both his policies and for acting as a ""one-man legislature."" ""The last time the President issued a politically motivated executive order to change our immigration laws, he precipitated a crisis at our border, leaving thousands of children at risk and ripping apart the families he claims to want to protect,"" Priebus said. ""Granting amnesty does not secure our borders. Sadly, rather than trying to solve our country's immigration problems, the President's actions are intended to poison the legislative process at a time when he should be working to bring Americans together.","Republicans focused their criticism on the legal case against Obama's immigration proposal .

"(CNN)If you listen to rock or pop, you've heard Desmond Child's work. And if you were one of the 6.5 million people who listened to Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a Prayer"" on Pandora during a three-month span in 2012, you helped him, and his two co-writers, split a grand total of $110. ""We could each buy a pizza,"" said Child, an inductee in the Songwriters Hall of Fame who has worked with artists ranging from Aerosmith and Kiss to Ricky Martin and Cher. ""A large pizza."" Music streaming apps and sites were supposed to make music cheap -- or free -- for consumers while assuring that the artists who created the songs would be fairly compensated. But musicians and songwriters say they're barely seeing any money from streaming. ""It's upside down,"" Child said. ""It needs to get back in balance. It's just simply not fair."" Last week, singer Taylor Swift pulled all of her music from Spotify, saying that the ability to stream her new album, ""1989,"" threatened to hurt sales. Spotify has roughly 50 million users, who either pay $9.99 a month for the service or listen to a free version with advertisements. ""I'm glad the Taylor Swift thing has caused people to consider it more, because I do think it's an imperfect business model,"" said Jason Isbell, the Americana Music Association's 2014 Artist of the Year, whose albums are available on the streaming sites. The Taylor Swifts of the world can actually make out well on streaming sites -- Spotify said she had been on pace to make $6 million from the app this year. But Isbell said he earns so little in online streaming royalties that he barely pays attention to them. ""It doesn't add to my income in any way that isn't negligible,"" he said. In a blog post Tuesday, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek responded to Swift's decision and other artists' complaints. ""We started Spotify because we love music and piracy was killing it,"" Ek wrote. ""So all the talk swirling around lately about how Spotify is making money on the backs of artists upsets me big time."" Ek noted that Spotify has paid more than $2 billion to record labels, music publishers and groups that distribute royalties to songwriters and recording artists -- $1 billion of which came in the past year. But Child said that money gets divided up unfairly. Too little of it trickles down to the people who wrote and recorded the music, he said. Streaming sites treat each stream like a purchase, similar to downloading a song from iTunes. That kind of contract pays a bigger percentage to record labels than licensing agreements, which pay out at about 50-50 between artists and record companies. ""At some point, they sold the acts some idea like, 'We're promoting your music so you can go out and tour and make money with merchandise and ticket sales and stuff,' "" Child said. ""But a lot of those artists co-wrote with people like me. I don't get a piece of the touring. I don't get a piece of the merchandise."" In his blog post, Ek said he's open to exploring ways to compensate writers and performers more fairly. Earlier this year, Pandora came under fire for its payment model after singer Bette Midler had complained about it, saying she'd gotten $114 for more than 4 million plays on the site. (Pandora disputed that number.) On Wednesday, Pandora compared its service not to record sales, but to a traditional radio station. ""As the highest paying form of radio, Pandora is proud to play the music of thousands of artists for our more than 75 million users,"" Dave Grimaldi, Pandora's director of public affairs, said in an email. He noted that, as traditional revenue streams dry up, streaming sites like Pandora are growing. ""If half of radio listening shifts from terrestrial to Pandora and other internet radio platforms, it will mean billions in additional royalty dollars for performers and songwriters,"" Grimaldi said. Pandora's published rate for at least one form of royalties is .0013 cents per stream, divided among a song's various interest holders. Child said he's working with other songwriters such as Eddie Schwartz -- who penned Pat Benatar's ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" -- on a system they call ""fair trade music."" It would establish guidelines for fair treatment of artists. Isbell said he believes that streaming sites should allow a set number of plays of any given song before the site asks users to purchase the music. ""It would be nice to have peace of mind and be able to know I'll be able to make music for the rest of my life without having to cut anybody's grass but my own,"" Isbell said. ""And I think that's a worry for people who are at my level and the levels below me.""","Songwriters and musicians say music streaming isn't paying the bills .

"Ashton Carter, the former second-in-command at the Pentagon, appears to be the top choice to replace outgoing Secretary Chuck Hagel. Barring any last minute complications, Ash Carter will be President Barack Obama's choice as the new Secretary of Defense, several U.S. administration officials told CNN. An administration official had said that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, a former General Counsel at the Pentagon, was also still on the list of possibilities, but on Tuesday morning, sources said Johnson was no longer being considered. The prospect of an additional confirmation hearing for Johnson's replacement if he were to move to the Pentagon as the Senate switches to Republican control would have been problematic for the White House. Related: Was Hagel doomed from the start? Hagel announced his resignation last week, but has said he will stay on until his successor is confirmed by the Senate. Carter, who served as Deputy Defense Secretary under both Leon Panetta and Hagel, would bring a wide range of experience to a department confronting multiple crises in the Middle East and preparing to enter a new phase in Afghanistan as the NATO combat mission ends. Carter's ability to hit the ground running from his past experience at the Pentagon, in addition to the respect many senior military leaders have for him are seen as major benefits to winning confirmation should Obama nominate him. ""His career has sort of prepared him perfectly for this kind of a moment,"" says Michael O'Hanlon, a defense industry analyst at the Brookings Institution. In addition to a broad understanding of the Pentagon bureaucracy, Carter is seen as a master of managing large budgets, a premium in the present era of continued belt tightening on Capitol Hill, as well as an expert on weapons acquisitions. Related: White House struggles to find Hagel successor . He also has a firm grasp on understanding the trends and technology of warfare in the future. ""On paper and in terms of his resume and preparation you probably couldn't do much better,"" O'Hanlon said. But Carter does lack certain experience shared by Hagel, Panetta had and many other secretaries - first--hand military experience. Carter has extensive experience at the Pentagon and in academia, but he was never actually in the military. ""You can always find things that you would have loved in a hundred year life span to have seen everyone do before they take this job, but realistically he has accomplished about as much as you could ask,"" O'Hanlon said. Whoever is ultimately selected may not have much opportunity to make a mark at the Pentagon. They'll likely have less than two years likely on the job after confirmation. The next defense secretary will confront the specter of another possible round of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration to navigate with Congress, along with a White House known by some for micromanaging foreign and defense policy. While Carter was always seen likely on Obama's short-list of candidates, his name gained prominence following the withdrawals from consideration by former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed that they not be considered for the post. Carter, who does not have a background as a political operative, is believed to be open to returning to the Pentagon, and would likely generate a smooth confirmation process officials tell CNN. He was previously a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, and was recently listed as a senior executive at the Markle Foundation.","Sources said Tuesday that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson is no longer considered .

"A New York judge Tuesday vacated the conviction of a man who spent nearly a quarter of a century behind bars for a Brooklyn slaying that occurred while he was vacationing in Florida. Jonathan Fleming, 51, was found guilty in 1989 in the death of Darryl Rush in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and served the next 24 years and 8 months in prison, according to the Kings County district attorney's office. He was released Tuesday afternoon. Fleming has always maintained he was on a family trip to Disney World in Florida when Rush was shot to death early on the morning of August 15, 1989, in a dispute over stolen money. After years of reviewing documents and re-interviewing witnesses as part of a joint investigation between his attorneys and the Brooklyn district attorney's Conviction Review Unit, it was determined that the only evidence tying him to the crime was an alleged witness who later recanted her statement. ""As you can imagine, after sitting in jail for 25 years for a crime he didn't commit, he can't help but feel vindicated,"" said one of Fleming's lawyers, Anthony Mayol. ""On the flip side, that's 25 years that have been stolen, that he'll never get back."" At his trial, defense lawyers provided family photos and home videos of Fleming in Florida around the time of Rush's killing. But according to Taylor Koss, another of  Fleming's lawyers, they did not have evidence he was in Florida on the day of the slaying. The prosecution persuaded jurors to ignore the alibi. Fleming told his attorneys he had paid a bill for phone calls made from his Florida hotel room the night before Rush was killed, and he believed the receipt was in his pocket when police arrested him. But authorities told the defense he had no such receipt, according to Koss. In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the killing, according to the district attorney's office. ""This is proof of alibi that was basically purposely withheld,"" Koss said. The review unit also interviewed Fleming's former girlfriend, who said she called Fleming the night of the killing while he was still at his hotel in Florida. The investigation found her story to be credible, with phone records to support it. The prosecution also produced a witness who said she saw Fleming commit the crime. According to Koss, the woman recanted her testimony weeks after Fleming's conviction. She later testified in front of a judge that she was on parole and had been arrested with another woman for being in a stolen van the night of the killing. She said police persuaded her to give a statement against Fleming to avoid going back to jail. Koss said the judge threw out her later testimony because she could not provide enough facts to back up her story. A review unit search of police records years later came up with a timeline. The woman on probation was arrested with another woman on grand larceny charges and brought to the Brooklyn district attorney's office, where she gave a statement. Within the hour, the investigation found, charges against her were dropped. Koss said defense investigators even found a witness in South Carolina who claims to have been the getaway driver during Rush's killing and who even identified someone they say is the real killer. Judge Matthew D'Emic Tuesday vacated the conviction after a ""careful and thorough review of this case, and based on key alibi facts that place Fleming in Florida at the time of the murder,"" said District Attorney Ken Thompson. Koss and Mayol say the next step is ensuring that Fleming has a way to support himself after he is released. ""He has no job, no career, no prospects,"" Koss said. ""We're suing everybody, let's be honest,"" Koss added, saying Fleming's legal team intends to bring a civil rights lawsuit against the city and seek reparations from the state under a provision set up to redress wrongful convictions. Thompson, who became district attorney at the beginning of the year, has already released two men who had been in prison for more than half their lives in connection with three killings after DNA evidence tore holes in their convictions in February. Antonio Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were teenagers when they were imprisoned. But after reviewing DNA evidence, Thompson said the previous convictions for the 1992 murders in Brooklyn would most likely not stand up in court and agreed the two men should be freed. Those cases, as well as Fleming's, are not connected to investigations into Detective Louis Scarcella, whose questionable tactics have led to a review of some 50 other cases, the district attorney's office said. On Monday, Thompson named Harvard law professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. as special counsel to the district attorney for the Conviction Review Unit.  Sullivan, who heads Harvard's Criminal Justice Institute, will guide the group in future cases brought for review, according to the District Attorney's office.

"Washington (CNN)Fewer members of the military are being sexually assaulted and more victims are coming forward, the Pentagon said in a long-awaited report obtained by CNN on Wednesday. But 4.3 percent of the United States' active-duty women still say they were the victims of unwanted sexual contact in the last year, and most still aren't reporting those assaults. Some of those who did report their assaults faced retaliation, according to the Pentagon's findings. In the 136-page report due to be publicly released Thursday, the Pentagon said more victims are reporting sexual assaults. In 2012, just 1-in-10 victims reported those assaults, and by 2014, 1-in-4 did. The report pointed to a 50 percent increase in the number of victims who reported the assaults from 2012 to 2013, and another 8 percent leap in 2014. The Pentagon said, ""The importance of this upward trend in reporting cannot be overstated."" ""Increased reporting signals not only growing trust of command and confidence in the response system, but serves as the gateway to provide more victims with support and to hold a greater number of offenders appropriately accountable,"" the report said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and Gen. Jeffrey Snow, the director of the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, delivered the report to the White House on Tuesday. The report noted a major increase in reports of sexual assaults in recent years -- from 3,604 in 2012 to 5,518 in 2013 and then 5,983 in 2014 -- and said it's ""unlikely"" the bump is happening because more crimes are taking place. ""Given the underreported nature of sexual assault, the department believes this increase in reporting is likely due to greater victim confidence in the response system,"" the report said. The number of active-duty women who said they were victims of unwanted sexual contact in the last year was 4.3 percent in 2014 -- down from 6.1 percent in 2012 -- the report said, citing surveys from those two years. Victims of sexual assault can file ""restricted"" reports, which allows them to access health services without launching investigations and legal proceedings, or ""unrestricted"" reports, which do trigger independent investigations. In 2014, the Pentagon said, 19 percent of the victims who filed restricted reports later decided to make those reports unrestricted and pursue investigations -- the highest figure it has ever recorded. The report also included a survey of more than 150 military sexual assault survivors. It found that three-quarters said they'd recommend that others report being assaulted -- and 90 percent said they were satisfied with the aid and legal counsel they received. ""However, too many of these respondents indicated they perceived social and/or professional retaliation as a result of making a report,"" the Pentagon said. That admission comes as lawmakers push for bigger changes to separate sexual assault prosecutions and court-martial proceedings from the military's chain of command. New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is making a new push for that legislation. She's seeking to have the proposal added into a defense spending authorization bill that's set for a House vote in the coming days. ""The military has not been able to demonstrate that they have made a difference and they need to be held to the scrutiny and that standard this year because throughout the last year we have continued to see evidence of how much farther we have to go to solve sexual assault in the military,"" Gillibrand said Tuesday at a news conference with a bipartisan set of senators who are advocating for her proposal. Among the GOP proponents is Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 presidential contender. ""If you were in a corporation you would not report to your boss -- you would go to the police,"" he said. ""In the military it's a little different but you still wouldn't want to go to your boss directly or you wouldn't want your boss to be making the decisions -- particularly if your boss was buddies with the perpetrator -- you would want people you don't know outside the chain of command.""

"(CNN) -- The allegations about Bill Cosby keep coming. For decades, Cosby was thought of in glowing terms as a perceptive comedian, upbeat pitchman and genial father figure. His public personality made him more than rich -- it made him a role model, admired for his support of education and his no-nonsense talks on parenting and achievement. In recent weeks, that persona has been paired with another, much darker image. On Tuesday, the famed comedian and TV star was accused of rape by Janice Dickinson, a former model. In an interview on ""Entertainment Tonight,"" Dickinson claimed Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. Cosby attorney Marty Singer was blunt in his response. ""Janice Dickinson's story accusing Bill Cosby of rape is a lie,"" he told CNN in a statement. ""There is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002. Ms. Dickinson did an interview with the New York Observer in September 2002 entitled 'Interview With a Vamp' completely contradicting her new story about Mr. Cosby. ""That interview a dozen years ago said 'she didn't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off.' Her publisher HarperCollins can confirm that no attorney representing Mr. Cosby tried to kill the alleged rape story (since there was no such story) or tried to prevent her from saying whatever she wanted about Bill Cosby in her book."" He added, ""Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinson's own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie."" Dickinson's allegations come on the heels of other rape accusations. Cosby has repeatedly said the allegations are untrue. He has never been prosecuted. Over the weekend, Cosby was asked about ""serious allegations raised about you"" by NPR's Scott Simon. ""Do you have any response to those charges?"" Simon asked. In response, Cosby shook his head in silence. On Sunday, Cosby attorney John P. Schmitt released a written statement. ""Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced,"" Schmitt said. ""The fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment."" The accusations have received wide publicity in recent weeks, spurred in particular by two events: a viral video of comedian Hannibal Buress in which he called Cosby a ""rapist,"" and an attempt to create a Cosby meme sponsored by Cosby's Twitter account. The latter led to many images of Cosby with the rape accusations emblazoned over his picture. The allegations have taken a toll on Cosby's family-friendly, fatherly image. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that a Cosby special, set to debut November 28, would be postponed. Then, on Wednesday, his old network, NBC, announced that a Cosby show in the works has been scuttled. The events detailed by Cosby's accusers took place over many decades. Five women have gone on record in describing them. Another woman, Andrea Constand, approached Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, authorities in 2005, but prosecutors decided they had ""insufficient credible and admissible evidence."" ""The desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong,"" Bruce Castor, then the Montgomery County district attorney, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday. ""The problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it."" At the time, Cosby lawyer Walter M. Phillips Jr. told CNN the allegations were ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre."" Constand later filed a civil suit. Her lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories. However, Constand's suit was settled in November 2006, and the witnesses were never called. Terms have not been disclosed. Here are details on the other five named women: . Name: Joan Tarshis . Who was: a 19-year-old actress . When alleged events happened: Late 1969 . At the time, Cosby was: a year removed from his hit TV series, ""I Spy,"" starting work on a new sitcom, ""The Bill Cosby Show,"" and one of the most popular comedians in America. His 1968 album, ""To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With,"" had won a Grammy as best comedy performance in March -- Cosby's fifth straight win in the category. The accusation: Tarshis, who later became a journalist and music industry publicist, said she met Cosby while visiting Los Angeles. The two became friendly. One night after a taping of his sitcom, he invited her back to his bungalow and fixed her a ""redeye"" (a Bloody Mary topped with beer, her regular drink). ""The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,"" she told Hollywood Elsewhere. ""I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one."" It was the first of two incidents, Tarshis said. When she went public: 2014 . -- . Name: Tamara Green . Who was: an aspiring model in her early 20s . When alleged events happened: 1970 . At the time, Cosby was: starring on ""The Bill Cosby Show."" A year later, he would start guesting on the children's program ""The Electric Company."" The accusation: Green, who later became an attorney, said she met Cosby at a working lunch with several other people. She was suffering from the flu and Cosby ""went into some sort of office area at the back of the restaurant and he produced two capsules in his hand,"" she told the ""Today Show's"" Matt Lauer. She took the capsules, which at first made her feel ""great"" and then left her ""almost literally face down on the table of this restaurant."" Cosby took her to her apartment and started ""groping me and kissing me and touching me and handling me and you know, taking off my clothes,"" Green said. After telling Cosby ""that if he didn't kill me and he tried to rape me, it was going to go very badly,"" he left two $100 bills on her coffee table and left. When Green went public, a lawyer for Cosby told ""Today,"" ""Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier, and the incident she describes did not happen. The fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration."" When she went public: 2005 . -- . Name: Janice Dickinson . Who was: a noted model . When alleged events happened: 1982 . At the time, Cosby was: touring as a comedian and well-known for his Jell-O and Coca-Cola commercials. The accusation: Dickinson says that she and Cosby had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and he gave her a glass of red wine and a pill she believed was for menstrual cramps. ""The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,"" she told ""Entertainment Tonight."" Dickinson said she wanted to write about the incident in her 2002 memoir ""No Lifeguard on Duty,"" but said Cosby's lawyers told her to remove details. Marty Singer, the Cosby attorney, told TheWrap.com that her claim is untrue. ""(N)either Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives ever communication (sic) with the publisher about any alleged rape or sexual assault about the book,"" he said. When she went public: 2014 . -- . Name: Beth Ferrier . Who was: a model in her early 20s . When alleged events happened: mid-1980s . At the time, Cosby was: a touring comedian, advertising pitchman and, starting in 1984, the star of ""The Cosby Show,"" the No. 1 show on television. The accusation: Ferrier told the Philadelphia Daily News and People magazine that she met Cosby in Denver in the mid-'80s. He mentored her for a time but, one night, she said he gave her a drugged cappuccino. ""I woke up in my car in the parking lot with my clothes all a mess,"" she said. ""I wondered, I still wonder, 'What did he do with me? Why was my bra unhooked?' "" The two later conducted an ""on-and-off consensual affair"" that lasted several years, wrote People's Alex Tresniowski. ""He kept luring me in,"" Ferrier told the magazine. ""I felt like I couldn't say no."" At the time, Cosby's publicist told People that he had no comment. When she went public: 2005 . -- . Name: Barbara Bowman . Who was: a teenage model and actress . When alleged events happened: mid-1980s . At the time, Cosby was: starring in ""The Cosby Show."" The accusation: In 1985, Cosby met the then 17-year-old Bowman in Denver and visited her a number of times, giving her acting lessons and ""flying me around to major cities to events,"" she told Newsweek. After she turned 18, Cosby ""assaulted (me) a number of times."" In an incident in New York, Bowman ""had one glass of wine and then I blacked out. I woke up throwing up in the toilet. ... I was wearing a white T-shirt that wasn't mine, and he was in a white robe."" In an incident in Atlantic City, an angry Cosby ""got on top of me and started taking his pants off and I was screaming and crying and begging him to leave me alone and I fought so hard and I was screaming so loud that he got mad and threw me aside and got away from me, and that was it."" The statement of Cosby attorney Schmitt, released Sunday, said, ""Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced. The fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment."" When she went public: 2006. She has since written a Washington Post column published November 13. CNN's Eliott C.

"A nurse's release Tuesday from an Atlanta hospital leaves a single person in the United States now battling Ebola, though she and others -- including President Barack Obama -- stressed the fight against the deadly virus isn't over. ""While this is a day for celebration and gratitude, I ask that we not lose focus on the thousands of families who continue to labor under the burden of this disease in West Africa,"" said 29-year-old Amber Vinson. About two weeks ago, Vinson became the second nurse from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas to get the virus while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who began showing Ebola symptoms after arriving in Texas and died of it there. She and Nina Pham -- the other Dallas nurse who was discharged from a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland on Friday -- are differ from the handful of other U.S. Ebola cases in the United States because they caught the disease in America, rather than contracting it in West Africa. Vinson's diagnosis came amid a wave of national concern about the prospect Ebola could spread in the United States, especially after it became known she'd flown on two commercial flights after treating Duncan. Yet there was no such alarm Tuesday. Instead, Emory University Hospital's Dr. Bruce Ribner declared Vinson ""has recovered from her infection with Ebola virus, and she can return to ... her community and to her life"" without any concerns about infecting anyone. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed . Standing behind a lectern in a gray suit, Vinson thanked God as well as those at the Atlanta hospital, where she arrived October 15. She also voiced appreciation for Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, two Americans who got Ebola in Africa and were treated at Emory, for their contributions of plasma for people in the United States struggling with the disease. Dr. Craig Spencer is now the only person in the United States being treated for Ebola. The 33-year-old was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in New York City after developing a fever on Thursday, six days after returning to the United States and over a week after leaving Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders. Timeline of Spencer's activities after returning home . Even without more cases, Ebola remains a hot topic of conversation around the country. That includes a debate about whether anyone should be allowed into the United States from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, or at least whether health care volunteers and others coming from those Ebola-ravaged nations should be quarantined for three weeks upon arrival. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that ""monitoring and movement guidance"" for those returning from the region should be ""sensible,"" so long as it is based on  science and doesn't unnecessarily prove an obstacle to those who risk their lives and livelihoods to head overseas to help those in need. ""We don't want to discourage our health workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way,"" Obama said. ""...""We don't just react based on our fears. We react based on facts."" Obama: We can't react 'based on our fears' U.S. focused on West Africa . Ribner, from Emory, said that his hospital has learned ""a great deal"" from treating four Ebola patients. That includes lessons on things such as fluid and electrolyte management and that physicians can successfully treat Ebola patients who need dialysis. Still, while sharing such information with other U.S. health care professionals could be helpful, it won't end the threat. ""The thing that we really have to keep in mind is that the only way that we are truly to be able to make our citizens safe is that we control the outbreak in Africa,"" said Ribner. This is a point Obama has made repeatedly, including again on Tuesday. He insists ""no other nation is doing as much to make sure"" we contain Ebola at its source, from the medical experts on the ground to approximately 1,000 U.S. troops (with 3,000 more to come) involved in helping local officials with everything from logistics to building treatment centers. Some American service members are now in quarantine at an Army base in Vicenza, Italy, after returning from West Africa, according to Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army forces in Africa who is among those isolated. Williams talks to CNN from quarantine . Washington even dispatched a top diplomat, Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who arrived Tuesday in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. She told reporters her visit aims ""to show solidarity with the people of the region so that you know that you are not alone as you face this terrible epidemic,"" as well as to help Liberia emerge from the crisis ""stronger and more resilient."" After speaking Tuesday to members of a multiagency Disaster Assistance Response Team, who have been in West Africa since August, the President offered a hint of optimism. ""The good news is that it's starting to have an impact,"" Obama said of such U.S. efforts. ""They are starting to see some progress in Liberia, and the infrastructure is beginning to get built out."" Still, progress doesn't equate to victory. According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 10,000 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola -- almost all in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- and nearly 5,000 deaths. And those are only the ones that authorities have been able to count, in a region where health care access and record-keeping is limited. The WHO, the United Nations' health authority, has said that the mortality rate from the current outbreak, starting with the first death in December, is about 70%.

"(CNN)After months of anticipation, a grand jury's decision on whether to indict a Missouri officer for fatally shooting an unarmed  black teenager could come at any moment. And when it does, anything could happen in the tinderbox that is Ferguson, Missouri. But how did we get to this point? Here are six things to know to get up to speed on the case: . On August 9, 18-year-old Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were walking in the middle of a residential street when a white officer, Darren Wilson, pulled up and told them to get out of the road. That's where the stories quickly diverge. According to Johnson, he and Brown told the officer they were almost at their destination and would be out of the street shortly. But Johnson said the officer grabbed Brown by the neck and drew his gun, eventually shooting Brown. ""At no point in time did they struggle over the weapon because the weapon was already drawn on us,"" Johnson said. By contrast, a Wilson family friend identified as ""Josie"" told local radio station KTFK that Brown started a physical altercation with the officer. ""Michael just bum rushes him, and just shoves him back into his car, punches him in the face and then of course Darren grabs for his gun and Michael grabs the gun,"" Josie said. ""At one point he's got the gun totally turned against his hip, and then he shoves it away and the gun goes off."" A source told CNN that Josie's account matches what the officer told investigators. Both sides agree that Brown ran and then turned back -- the question is whether he turned to attack or surrender. ""He was running for his life and just got shot and turned around and didn't try to reach for anything,"" witness Piaget Crenshaw said. ""He put his hands in the air being compliant, and he still got shot down like a dog."" Josie gives a different explanation. ""All of a sudden (Brown) just started to bum rush him. He just started coming at him full speed so (Wilson) just started shooting and he just kept coming,"" Josie said. ""The final shot was in the forehead and then he fell about 2, 3 feet in front of the officer."" The official autopsy, as published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, said Brown suffered six gunshot entrance wounds. The wounds included a shot to the hand at close range, according to an autopsy analysis reported by the Post-Dispatch. That detail could support Wilson's claim of a struggle inside his patrol car. But that doesn't explain why Wilson continued shooting, including at least one shot to Brown's head. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed the teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The grand jury is deciding whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes. Those possible charges include first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, said Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office. The grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges, and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action, authorities said. At the same time, the grand jury will consider Missouri's statutes for self-defense and police use of deadly force. Different states have different numbers, but there are 12 members on the Missouri grand jury. Nine of the 12 must vote yes to indict someone on a charge. The grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret. The grand jurors' races and ethnicities are also kept under wraps. Though the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come in mid-November. Complete coverage of the events in Ferguson . Who knows. For more than 70 days and nights, protesters have demanded an indictment for Wilson and have called for Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson to resign. Only on a few nights has the situation turned violent, with some protesters hurling bottles or rocks at officers while police, dressed in riot gear, threw tear gas canisters. Gov. Jay Nixon made clear he's not anticipating violence but wants to be ready for anything. Police from various departments will operate as a unified command. The National Guard will be available as necessary. Law enforcement is prepared to extend shifts and limit leave, and additional resources have been distributed, Nixon said. But one protester predicts violence if Wilson isn't indicted: . ""If there is not an indictment, excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Sara Sidner, Sara Weisfeldt and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","A grand jury could decide at any moment whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson .

"Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on a progressive agenda that he said would narrow the widening gap between the rich and poor in the nation's largest city, was sworn in Wednesday as New York's 109th mayor. On a chilly first day of 2014, former President Bill Clinton administered the oath of office at a ceremony outside City Hall using a Bible once owned by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Clinton's wife, Hillary, a former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate, also attended. De Blasio and the Clintons: The ties that bind? De Blasio took the oath with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and the couple's children, Chiara and Dante, at his side. His November electoral victory ended a long losing streak for Democrats that began when former Mayor David Dinkins, de Blasio's former boss, lost to Republican Rudy Giuliani in 1993. In his inaugural speech, de Blasio touched on the key themes of a campaign that portrayed itself as the progressive alternative to the long reign of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose policies de Blasio said favored the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase ""tale of two cities."" ""When I said we would take dead aim at the tale of two cities, I meant it,"" he said Wednesday. ""And we will do it. I will honor the faith and trust you have placed in me. And we will give life to the hope of so many in our city. We will succeed as one city. We know this won't be easy. It will require all that we can muster."" On inaugural day, the new mayor outlined a sweeping progressive agenda for his administration, including higher taxes for those earning more than $500,000 a year to fund full day, universal pre-K and after-school programs for middle school students. He also wants to expand paid sick leave for employees of businesses that have 20 or more workers. ""Big dreams are not a luxury reserved for a privileged few,"" he said, ""but the animating force behind every community, in every borough."" Before the oath, Clinton also talked about the growing wealth gap. ""This inequality problem bedevils the entire country,"" the former president said. ""But it is not just a moral outrage, it is a horrible constraint on economic growth and on giving people the security they need to tackle problems like climate change."" Mostly ignored, shifts emerge in the politics of poverty . In his speech, de Blasio took a moment to praise Bloomberg, who led New York for 12 years, shepherded the city through the recession, and is credited with making New York safer and more livable. ""To say the least, you led our city through some extremely difficult times,"" de Blasio said. ""And for that, we are all grateful. Your passion on issues such as environmental protection and public health has built a noble legacy."" A virtual unknown nationally, despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as a public advocate -- a sort of civic watchdog -- sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton's first U.S. Senate campaign. His biracial family's visibility in the campaign resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial stop-and-frisk policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas. Stop-and-frisk -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- was one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time. Law enforcement and other proponents said the practice helped reduce crime. To critics, it's racial profiling. ""We will reform a broken stop-and-frisk policy, both to protect the dignity and rights of young men of color, and to give our brave police officers the partnership they need to continue their success in driving down crime,"" de Blasio said Wednesday. And de Blasio inherits a city with the highest level of homelessness since the Great Depression, according to advocates. More than 52,000 people, including 22,000 children, spend each night in city shelters. ""We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten to unravel the city we love,"" the new mayor said during his inaugural. ""And so today, we commit to a new progressive direction in New York. And that same progressive impulse has written our city's history. It's in our DNA."" De Blasio was ceremoniously sworn in shortly after midnight on New Year's Day outside his Brooklyn home, with his family next to him -- as they were during much of his campaign. His son Dante, a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn, appeared prominently in campaign ads as de Blasio soared in the polls. Daughter Chiara, a college freshman, danced with the rest of the family at the West Indian Day, and recently spoke publicly about her struggle with depression and substance abuse. McCray, a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio, was a top campaign strategist. ""With all due respect to the television show,"" Clinton said Wednesday, ""they're our real modern family."" De Blasio, who has a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's in international and public affairs from Columbia University, met McCray while working in the administration of Dinkins, who was the city's first black mayor and attended Wednesday's ceremony. On Wednesday morning, Bloomberg and the de Blasios greeted each other at the City Hall subway station as they arrived for the inauguration. Also sworn in Wednesday was Letitia James, who as public advocate becomes the first black woman to hold citywide office in New York City.","""We will succeed as one city,"" Bill de Blasio says in his inaugural speech .

"(CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIA's brutal interrogation tactics against detainees captured after the September 11, 2001, attacks is drawing mostly criticism from around the world. While the initial overseas reaction from both United States' allies as well as its enemies was largely muted, the revelations of the intelligence agency's use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" in the post-9/11 era have been widely condemned. The report found CIA tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the Bush White House and Congress in the dark. Afghanistan . Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani condemned the ""inhumane actions"" outlined in the report and told reporters in Kabul Wednesday that the document ""unfortunately shows that our Afghan compatriots had been tortured."" It was ""really painful"" that some torture victims were innocent, he said. ""All Afghan people should know that after 2014 no international forces would be allowed to put any Afghan citizen in jail, get into their homes or have prisons,"" he said. China . Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters Wednesday: ""China consistently opposes torture. We believe that the U.S. side should reflect upon and rectify its relevant behavior, earnestly obey and implement the provisions of international conventions."" In a commentary published by the state-run Xinhua news agency, China blasted what it said was ""the sheer hypocrisy of the United States as a defender of human rights."" The commentary said Guantanamo Bay was ""notorious for human rights violations since 2004,"" adding that neither President George W. Bush nor President Barrack Obama ""has done anything to change the situation."" ""To simply look through the details of water boarding, deprivation of sleep and sexual abuses in the report can constitute a traumatizing experience,"" Wang Shang said in the commentary. Russia . The Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the information made public from the report ""is another confirmation of gross systematic violations of human rights by the American authorities."" ""We urge the human rights community and relevant international organizations to demand from Washington a disclosure of full information of offenses committed within the framework of the 'global war with terror' and to bring perpetrators to justice,"" the ministry said in a statement. Great Britain . Prime Minster David Cameron condemned torture while in Turkey on Tuesday, saying: ""Torture is wrong. Torture is always wrong. Those of us want to see a safer, more secure world, want to see the extremism defeated. We won't succeed if we lose our moral authority."" Iran . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to the report in a series of tweets, saying of the U.S.: ""They claim they've a prideful nation; US govts. debased & misguided their ppl who aren't aware of many realities."" He wrote in another tweet: ""Today, US govt. is symbol of tyranny against humanity; even American ppl are faced w cruelty."" France . The Foreign Ministry said that, when it comes to the fight against terrorism, ""the main objective of the international community must stay within the framework of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law."" Germany . Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on his verified Twitter account that the report findings pointed to ""clear violations of democratic values"". ""This cannot be repeated,"" he added. ""President Obama clearly breaks with the politics of his predecessor. We welcome this new transparency to admit mistakes ... What was considered right in fight against Islamic terrorism was unacceptable+a serious mistake."" Pakistan . ""We deplore the systematic torture of the detainees at various locations by the CIA,"" said Tasnim Aslam, a spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. Aslam said that the report ""reinforces what we have said all along -- that the international human rights and the international humanitarian law must be respected when encountering intelligence terrorism."" ""We have also emphasized the need for transparency,"" Aslam told reporters. ""We have noted the reassurances held out by the U.S. administration, including at the highest levels, that this behavior would never be repeated again."" North Korea . North Korea referred to the report in an article published by the state news agency KCNA, which accused the United Nations Security Council of a double standard for ""turning its face from the inhuman torture practiced by the CIA over which the UN Anti-Torture Committee expressed particular concern and which is dealt with in the 6,000 page-long report presented by the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Senate."" Poland . Former President Aleksander Kwasniewski said the report findings further ""the feeling that the USA is becoming weaker, especially in Moscow, where for many years now there is an opinion to 'test' the west as America is weak."" ""I think that this report is something that the Kremlin will receive as an unexpected Christmas present,"" he said. ""We had every right to believe that they would conduct activities in accordance to law, American law, which is not more liberal than Polish law or international law ... Another lesson from this report is, that trust even in your closest ally must be limited."" United Nations . U.N. Special Rapporteur on Counter Terrorism and Human Rights Ben Emmerson called on the U.S. to prosecute those responsible for crimes outlined in the report. Emmerson said the program was ""a clear policy orchestrated at a high level within the Bush administration, which allowed ... systematic crimes and gross violations of international human rights law.""

The destruction so near complete, the fight is more now for victory alone, not for its spoils. One salient fact stands out: They have given up on hospitals inside the city. Yes, the lightly wounded are treated by the handful of doctors who remain, but since a huge car bomb near the official border crossing with Turkey obliterated their main hospital, they send the injured straight to the border. Another hospital would just be another possible target for ISIS. In the past the Kurds battling the militant Islamists for control of the border city have claimed as many as 10,000 civilians remain inside. During our two days there we saw little to justify that large a figure. There are civilians here, but they eke out a life in the rubble, seeking food and fuel as winter looms, and likely number in the low thousands. There are civilians here who refuse to flee or cannot. Turkey has closed the western crossing point through which many refugees left -- indeed many stand there now, trying to get out, looking at the Turkish soldiers to help. Those inside, however, are besieged increasingly by ISIS from all fronts. Nothing can protect them from the indiscriminate, constant shelling. ISIS forces routinely use homemade mortars: gas canisters packed with shreds of scrap metal. They rain down on the Kurdish civilian areas, where fighters also mix. U.S. options in Syria shrivel as Assad, Islamist forces make gains . Yousuf, who is 12, lists the friends who have left Kobani. He also shows us what they do to protect themselves when the blasts begin. There is no shelter, just a room in their house where their uncle told them to run. They show us the cushions they use to hide. Some line the walls, others they put on top of them. Were this a game, it would not have any rules. Ali is 60 years old and a week earlier lost one of his six daughters. She was 7 years old. He walks us to the spot where the mortar hit her. ""Three to four mortars fell near us. The first mortar we escaped from. The second mortar we escaped from. The third fell on us."" He is interrupted by the thud of another mortar landing some streets away. ""My daughter was 7 years old; 7 years old -- and she died. God bless help us."" They could not flee; the 150 sheep he tends are their livelihood, as is the family car they did not want to abandon. The animals stand helpless, too, near the spot where Ali's daughter died. Ali and his family moved here when ISIS attacked their village, 15 kilometers from Kobani. Ali must live with these decisions. The day before, he sat at his daughter's grave for a half-hour. He kisses her photograph. ""She was 7 years old. She was so beautiful. Small. People who saw her felt the need to lift her up and down in play."" The graveyard on the city's outskirts also is a somber scene. It, too, is makeshift. Rubble -- bits of cinder block -- are used as headstones. Next to the fresh graves lies a long trench -- ready for the next wave of dead. It, too, is the scene of children playing, clambering around the trench. The conflict's brutality may be beyond their reach, but the fight for Kobani will decide what kind of life they could be left with if they survive.

"(CNN)New York may be a paradise of Zagat-rated, Michelin-starred restaurants, but some of its best food can be found on the streets. Hundreds of mobile eateries hawking gourmet global cuisine occupy corners across the city, alongside traditional hotdog vendors and halal carts. King of Falafel & Shawarma . Halal carts slinging styrofoam plates piled high with falafel, shawarma and rice are ubiquitous in New York, but you'll recognize ""the King"" by the seemingly endless line crowding the sidewalk beside it. Originally a Queens staple, the cart dominated the corner of 30th Street and Broadway in Astoria for almost a decade before it won the Vendy Award for New York's Best Street Food in 2010. Now, its second cart in Midtown Manhattan peddles its famous falafel and shawarma to the masses, in addition to meaty plates like the Freddy's Junior: chicken, kefta and basmati rice topped with chopped onion and doused liberally in tahini and chile sauce. King of Falafel & Shawarma; 53rd Street and Park Avenue; +1 718 838 8029 . Milk Truck . Bessie, Milk Truck's sunshine-yellow food truck, is a welcome sight for hungry New Yorkers during lunch hour. Every day, the truck's perpetually cheerful staff hawk classic American comfort foods like mac and cheese and turkey chili. The most popular item by far is the grilled cheese sandwich. There are three variations: the classic, the classic with onion and mustard, and a hearty three-cheese version with apple. Despite not having a regular location -- Bessie's daily whereabouts must be tracked online -- Milk Truck has become a fixture in the New York street food scene thanks to its fiercely loyal following. Milk Truck; locations vary; +1 646 233 3838 . Red Hook Lobster Pound food truck . New Yorkers don't need to go to New England for a good lobster roll. Thanks to Big Red, Red Hook Lobster Pound's lobster shack on wheels, they only need to walk to the curb. Rolls come Maine-style, served cold with mayo, or Connecticut-style, served warm with butter and lemon, each stuffed with a quarter pound of fresh Maine lobster. Despite a price tag high that's high for the streets -- $16 per roll at the time of writing -- the truck still sells between 300-400 rolls every two hours. Red Hook Lobster Pound Food Truck; locations vary; +1 718 858 7650 . Lumpia Shack . Though Lumpia Shack has recently upgraded to its own brick-and-mortar, its original location at Brooklyn's Smorgasburg street food market still remains. Lines form before the tiny street stall as early as 11 a.m. each Saturday for lumpia, crispy, Filipino-inspired spring rolls. Each roll is made using locally sourced ground pork, roasted duck or truffled adobo mushrooms, hand-rolled and then deep-fried. Unlike regular street food, Lumpia Shack's plating is restaurant quality: the lumpia are arranged artfully on a tray, drizzled with homemade sauce and garnished with pea shoots and pickled vegetables. Lumpia Shack; Smorgasburg at Kent Avenue and Wythe Avenue, Brooklyn; +1 917 475 1621 . Dirty water dogs . Sometimes it feels like almost every other Manhattan street corner is dressed with the ubiquitous blue and yellow striped Sabrett umbrella, under which you'll find New York's most iconic street food: the dirty water dog. Named after the warm, salty water it's soaked in, the hot frank is served in a soft bun (which sops up residual water) and then topped with ketchup, mustard, onions, relish and sauerkraut. It's neither sophisticated nor gourmet, but it's the quintessential New York food experience. Various locations . Solber Pupusas . Culinary heavyweights Anthony Bourdain, Marcus Samuelsson and Martha Stewart are all said to be fans of Vendy-winning Solber Pupusas, and it's no wonder. Husband and wife owners Rafael and Reina Soler-Bermudez (""Solber"" is a portmanteau of their last names) have been making the stuffed Salvadoran corn tortillas in their tiny mobile pupuseria for more than 15 years, selling more than 600 on a regular day. The signature platter comes loaded with two pupusas, tangy curtido, pickled jalapenos, tomato sauce and sour cream. Served on banana leaves with a tangy slaw, the Salvadoran tamales are also crowd favorites. Solber Pupusas; Brooklyn Flea Market at Lafayette Avenue and Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn; +1 516 965 0214 . Calexico . Unlike California, New York isn't renowned for its Mexican food, but the city has stepped up its game in recent years, thanks in large part to Calexico. What started out as a lone taco cart in SoHo in 2006 -- one of New York's first -- has since grown into a fleet of carts across the city and a handful of brick-and-mortar locations. Its original SoHo cart remains its most popular location, still slinging soft corn tacos cradling slow-cooked chipotle pork, hearty bowls of jalapeno cheddar grits and burritos packed with beer-battered fish, beans, rice and Monterey Jack cheese. Calexico; Prince Street and Wooster Street; +1 646 590 4172 . Bolivian Llama Party . Traditional Bolivian street food staples can now be enjoyed on the streets of Brooklyn thanks to this popular Smorgasburg stall. Though saltenas -- crusty, empanada-like pastries filled with meat and vegetables --are easily its best-selling item, the chola slider is the real star here. The modern take on the humble sanduiche de chola comes stuffed with either pork or beef brisket and topped with hibiscus-pickled onions, carrots, kolla cheese and parsley. Bolivian Llama Party; Smorgasburg at Kent Avenue and Wythe Avenue, Brooklyn; +1 347 395 5481 . Breakfast cart bagels . New York boasts many terrific brick-and-mortar bagel shops, but you won't get a cheaper or more authentic breakfast than a bagel and coffee from a street cart. Every morning, locals file out of the subway and make a beeline for the nearest silver breakfast cart, whose narrow shelves are stocked high with bagels and pastries of every kind. Many pre-prepare their bagels for convenience, but most carts will make your bagel to order. Coffee, usually deli-quality, is served in small blue-and-white Anthora cups that have become as characteristic of New York as yellow cabs and dirty water dogs.

"A controversial Rolling Stone article began a heated conversation about rape on college campus after a student the magazine called ""Jackie"" described being gang raped at a University of Virginia fraternity. Now some advocates worry where that conversation is headed after the magazine flagged possible flaws in the article. ""I've had a lot of our members, especially sexual assault survivors, emailing me, asking if this is going to distract from the broader, bigger problem of sexual assault on campus,"" said Monika Johnson-Hostler, president of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. ""They're worried that fallout from one story is going to give people a reason to believe campus sexual assault isn't a real problem or it's been overhyped."" One in five women are sexually assaulted during college, according to a White House task force report issued this summer. Last month, Rolling Stone published Jackie's story, a harrowing retelling of how she was allegedly raped by seven men at a Phi Kappa Psi party in 2012. The article sparked international outrage and placed the University of Virginia in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault. Students protested, and university officials banned Greek activities for the semester and vowed change. Then The Washington Post identified holes in the story. Also on Friday, Rolling Stone posted an apology on its website. Editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie, nor did the magazine attempt to contact any of the men Jackie claimed participated in the attack for fear that that could bring retaliation against the college student. Editors regretted that, the note said. The note went a step further, saying: ""In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced."" A day later, Rolling Stone amended that note. It removed the reference to trust being misplaced and added this: ""These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie."" The magazine offered no explanation for the update. Victim blaming? Rolling Stone has been accused of victim blaming when it said that its trust in Jackie was ""misplaced."" On CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" writer Hanna Rosin spoke about the peril of focusing blame on Jackie. Rolling Stone's initial apology that said its trust in Jackie was misplaced ""essentially said this is Jackie's fault but, you know, Jackie is not a journalist,"" Rosin said. ""She doesn't know the rules of journalism. She's just telling her own story. It's on us to know that you have to trust but verify. You have to check the sources. You have to figure out with the story is true because if not you end up in a mess like the one we're in now."" Johnson-Hostler said that by focusing on the telling of one survivor's story, it can have the unintended consequence of holding that experience as the ""true"" rape experience. ""It can imply to a survivor, 'Well, my experience wasn't as bad as that one, so maybe I wasn't raped,' "" said she said. Would all of that actually make it less likely survivors might come forward? ""A survivor will see the way this young woman in the Rolling Stone article is being attacked from all sides -- from the media, from the school, from the Greek system -- and think it's not worth coming forward,"" said John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who was an assistant dean at UVA from 1998 to 2002. He has devoted much of his career researching sexual assault in college and military culture. Are discrepancies really that? Foubert says the ""noise"" around the Rolling Stone editors' apology will probably mean survivors are going to be less willing to share their stories with journalists. Some advocates feel that keeping those stories in the dark only makes survivors feel more alone and it takes away from the public's education about preventing and reporting sexual assault. As far as perceived discrepancies in Jackie's story, Foubert said that could simply be symptom of the trauma she endured. ""Someone who experiences such extreme stress will talk and remember the stress in different ways at different times, through each telling. The assumption is that it didn't happen or she's lying."" That is not in line with the way post traumatic stress presents itself, he said. University of Virginia English professor Susan Fraiman also worries that the attention paid to the Rolling Stone story will detract from the bigger picture at the school. ""There's a broader desire to make sure that adjudication of rape cases are handled fair,"" she told CNN. Even after the Rolling Stone article published, there was more fallout from UVA regarding campus sexual assaults. Associate Dean of Students Nicole Eramo, who guides women through their options when they report they've been assaulted, recently told WUVA that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault, even when the accused admitted it. Eramo told WUVA that there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year.","Rolling Stone told story of ""Jackie,"" who alleged she was gang raped at UVA .

"An Egyptian court sentenced several dozen workers for non-governmental organizations, including Americans, to jail Tuesday in a case that has infuriated the U.S. government and democratic activists around the world. The workers were accused of having illegal foreign funding.  They denied any wrongdoing. All but one of the Americans were sentenced in absentia, having left the country after posting $132,000 each in bail money. In all, 43 NGO workers, including several Americans and other foreigners, were charged.  The court sentenced 27 NGO workers in absentia to five-year sentences; 11 defendants to one-year suspended jail sentences; and five others to two-year sentences that were not suspended, the state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported. The court also ordered the closure of five NGOs -- the U.S.-based Freedom House, the International Democratic Institute, the National Democratic Institute, the International Center for Journalists and Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation -- and confiscation of their funds. ""Freedom House condemns in the strongest possible terms the conviction of 43 NGO workers, including six currently with Freedom House and a former staff member, after a government-led witch-hunt intended to strangle civil society activity and limit free expression in post-revolutionary Egypt,"" the agency said in a prepared statement. Robert Becker of the National Democratic Institute was the only American who stayed behind to fight the charges, along with one German and 13 Egyptians, he said. It was not immediately clear which sentence he was given. ""Thank you everyone for the kind words. Reviewing my legal/appeals options with lawyers,"" he tweeted, adding that he is maintaining his innocence ""on charges of starting NGO six years before I actually arrived in Egypt."" On Monday, he wrote on his blog that if ""evidence matters in an Egyptian court, tomorrow's verdict will be not guilty.""  But, he added, ""this case has been political from the very beginning; so guilty is also real possibility, despite the lack of evidence."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States is ""deeply concerned"" about the result of ""a politically-motivated trial."" ""This decision runs contrary to the universal principle of freedom of association and is incompatible with the transition to democracy,"" he said in a statement.  ""Moreover, the decision to close these organizations' offices and seize their assets contradicts the government of Egypt's commitments to support the role of civil society as a fundamental actor in a democracy and contributor to development, especially at this critical stage in the Egyptian people's democratic transition."" He called on Egypt to ""work with civic groups as they respond to the Egyptian people's aspirations for democracy as guaranteed in Egypt's new constitution."" Yehia Ghanem, an Egyptian who worked for the International Center for Journalists -- an American NGO -- received two years in jail and vowed to appeal. ""For me and everyone it was clear the prosecution failed to produce a shred of evidence on all the allegations,"" he said in a statement Tuesday. ""We were planning on a training course for journalists but we never even had the chance to launch it,"" he said.  ""So it's amazing to be tried on something that never even happened -- it's a trial on intentions.  We didn't even have a chance to do anything from our good intentions. "" Egyptian officials said the NGOs' work contributed to international interference that was stoking continued protests against the government. In December 2011, authorities raided the offices of 10 NGOs.  The general prosecutor's office said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations that the groups received illegal foreign financing and were operating without proper licenses. The case sparked a crisis in relations between the United States and Egypt.  The U.S. State Department called the charges ""politically motivated."" One of the Americans charged and sentenced in absentia is Sam LaHood, the country director of the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Human Rights Watch called on Egypt last year to drop the charges against the NGO workers, calling the case ""a politicized saga."" And the organization Human Rights First said it was ""disturbed."" ""This prosecution had a chilling effect on the work of independent human rights and democracy promotion organizations in Egypt,"" said Brian Dooley, director of the organization's defenders program.  ""The fact that the court issued convictions in the case means that independent NGOs that wish to work in Egypt must do so under the threat of prosecution for exercising their basic human rights.""","Kerry: The U.S. is ""deeply concerned"" about the result of ""a politically-motivated trial""
