"England have unveiled their new kit ahead of the autumn internationals - with the home design to be worn for the first time when Stuart Lancaster's men host the All Blacks on November 8. The red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2, and the 'Test' jersey is available for a hefty £90. However, there is also a 'Pro' version, which can be bought for the cheaper price of £55. With the traditional all-white home jersey being largely unchanged aside from the re-positioning of the rose and the introduction of new ball-deadening grip on the chest, the alternate kit is somewhat different to the previous edition. England have unveiled their new Canterbury kit to be worn for first time against New Zealand on November 8 . Geoff Parling poses in the new England kit which sees the red rose in the centre of the jersey for the first time . England unveiled their alternate Scarlet kit which will be worn for first time against Samoa on November 22 . In a to England's heritage, the St George's Cross and the red rose, Lancaster's men will wear a crimson shirt and navy blue shorts. While the white kit will be worn against New Zealand at Twickenham in the first QBE international, the crimson shirt will be used for the first time against Samoa on November 22. Head coach Lancaster said: 'The England shirt is a source of huge pride for the players and it's a special moment when they receive it before an international as it represents many things - those that have supported the players on their path to becoming an England player, former internationals who have worn the shirt before them, all those who are involved in and support the game and the English nation as a whole. 'That pride in wearing the shirt is massively important to the players and hopefully it is something the fans can see and connect with. Julian Savea and New Zealand will be the first opponents for England in their new home shirt on November 8 . Chris Robshaw will captain England against New Zealand on November 8 in their new all-white home kit . Ma'a Nonu and New Zealand will face England at Twickenham in the first QBE November international . Stuart Lancaster, England's head coach, is excited by the new design of the shirts . 'The support for the squad over the past few seasons has been fantastic and it really means a lot to the players, the coaches and the wider support team that we all look to build that English national identity on the way to the World Cup. In the meantime, all our focus is now on the QBE Internationals and more importantly that first game against New Zealand.' The core values of England Rugby are also emblazoned onto the reverse of the 'Test' and 'Pro' shirts, with the words Teamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline and Sportsmanship visible in the design. England second row and Canterbury ambassador, Geoff Parling, is also impressed by the new kit design. He said: 'There is something special about wearing the English rose on your chest, whether you're a player about to step on the pitch at Twickenham or a fan cheering the team on from the touch line . 'One of the highest honours is to play for your country and there is something magical and unique about playing for England and being able to say you've worn the rose.'","England unveil new Canterbury kit with red rose in centre for first time .

"The recent ruling to reform the New York Police Department's controversial 'stop-and-frisk' tactic has already led to a sharp rise in shootings, new figures reveal. In the month after the policy was ruled unconstitutional shootings spiked nearly 13 per cent while gun seizures fell almost a fifth, the figures show. In the 28 days up to September 8 there were 140 shootings across the city, compared with 124 over the same period last year, according to NYPD statistics. Police stop and search an African American motorist in Brooklyn: The recent ruling to reform the New York Police Department's controversial 'stop-and-frisk' tactic has already led to a sharp rise in shootings, figures reveal . The shocking rise in gun crime has emerged days after the federal judge who ordered an overhaul of the stop-and-frisk strategy refused to delay it pending an appeal by the city. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said such a delay would send 'precisely the wrong signal.' She had ordered changes in August after finding the program discriminates against minorities. Police have stopped, questioned and sometimes patted down about 5million people over a decade. Dismissing the suggestion that reforms of the 'stop-and-frisk' strategy be delayed, Judge Scheindlin wrote: 'Ordering a stay now would send precisely the wrong signal. 'It would essentially confirm that the past practices, resulting in hundreds of thousands of stops - overwhelmingly of minorities - that resulted in little or no enforcement action or seizure of contraband were justified and based on constitutional police practices. 'It would also send the message that reducing the number of stops is somehow dangerous to the residents of this city.' But with figures showing the number of gunshot victims up 9 per cent over the same period last year following the ruling on August 12, that's the message implicit in the latest statistics on gun crime on NYC. Seizures of firearms are also down, with 239 taken by police between August 10 and September 8, compared with 289 over the same period last year, according to the statistics seen by the New York Post. And gun charges have fallen by more than 15 per cent from 492 last year to 417 this year. Sources blamed Scheindlin's ruling for the disturbing trends. A police department source told the Post that police are reluctant to stop and search because 'they're scared of being sued.' 'They feel as if the city is not going to indemnify them in lawsuits,' the source said. 'They never stop and frisk old white guys like me': U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled the tactic unconstitutional last month after finding the program discriminates against minorities . Judge Scheindlin has not commented on today's statistics, but on Tuesday she criticised 'certain high-level city officials and pundits' who have misinterpreted her ruling. She said she did not order an end to the stop-and-frisk program but instead insisted that it be carried out legally. And she defended her remedies, which include the appointment of a monitor to ensure the program's legality and of a facilitator to conduct meetings with interested parties in neighborhoods where frequent stops occur. She had also ordered some officers to wear cameras. She said the vast majority of the overhaul won't be implemented until the monitor and the facilitator meet with the community, the police department and other stakeholders to create sensible solutions. 'In short, the only activity at this stage is discussion between the monitor, the facilitator and the parties to develop the remedies,' she said. 'No other specific relief is imminent, much less ordered.' Michael A. Cardozo, the city's top lawyer, said in a statement that the city remains committed to reversing Scheindlin's rulings as quickly as possible. He noted that the city has asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan for an expedited appeal so police officers are not in limbo. 'We cannot afford such delay, as public safety is of paramount concern to the mayor and the police commissioner,' he said.","Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled on August 12 policy must be reformed .

"Aston Villa defender Aly Cissokho revealed how AC Milan pulled out of a deal to sign him... because of problems with his teeth. AC president Adriano Galliani claimed he had signed the world's best left back when he agreed a deal to sign the Frenchman from Porto for £12m back in 2009. But just 48 hours later the Italian giants pulled out of the deal, blaming a dentist's report. Aly Cissokho claims AC Milan pulled out of a deal to sign him because of a problem with his teeth . Cissokho signed for Aston Villa in the summer after spending last season on loan at Liverpool . Villa are second in the Premier League, aided by Gabriel Agbonlahor's winning goal at Anfield . Speaking to The Sun, Cissokho said: 'The problem only developed when Milan tried to agree a different deal with Porto. 'Milan said there was some kind of problem with my body, which was linked to my teeth! 'But it was just an excuse because I completed my medical in two hours, with no problems.

"Reading have announced that an Asian consortium has completed a takeover at the Madejski Stadium. Sir John Madejski, who has been at the helm in Berkshire since 1990, revealed in a statement on the club's website that everything was finalised to end months of uncertainty, which saw majority shareholder Anton Zingarevich leave the board in June. 'I am delighted to announce that, following confirmation from the Football League, our new Asian consortium partners are now in place at Reading Football Club,' he said on the club's official website. Sir John Madejski will remain as co-Chairman of Reading, with Khunying Sasima Srivikorn as Co-Chairwoman . Khunying Sasima, Narin Niruttinanon  and Sumrith Thanakarnjanasuth have completed the takeover . 'After months of tireless hard work and a lot of speculation, I am very pleased to say that Reading Football Club's future has been resolved.' Zingarevich, who purchased a 51 per cent stake in Reading in May 2012, pulled out of a deal to complete a full takeover shortly after the Royals were relegated from the Premier League in 2013 and his departure from the board was announced earlier this summer. During that time the club has been searching for fresh investment, but that hunt is now over after Khun Narin Niruttinanon bought a 50 per cent stake, Khunying Sasima Srivikorn took 25 per cent and Khun Sumrith Thanakarnjanasuth bought the remaining 25 per cent. Madejski also confirmed that he will remain at the Royals in a co-chairman capacity, with Khunying Sasima taking up the role of co-chairwoman, while chief executive Nigel Howe and non-executive director Ian Wood-Smith will also stay at the Sky Bet Championship club. Irish forward Cox scored the opening goal for Reading, it was the Irish forward's third goal of the season . 'I cannot speak highly enough of our new partners from the time we have spent together so far,' Madejski said. 'They have shown great professionalism, perseverance, patience and diligence and, on a personal level, our relationship is excellent and long may that continue.' The 73-year-old described how his tenure at Reading had already given him some of the 'greatest memories of my life' and he is hoping for many more at the Royals after a strong start to the season has seen Nigel Adkins' side climb to sixth. 'We have started this season well, which is testament to all of our staff and players here,' he added. 'There are reasons to be optimistic on many fronts, and we now move forward with a renewed vigour and high hopes for a bright new future.'

"Scotland goes to the polls today as a final series of opinion polls last night suggested the future of the UK hangs in the balance. Polling stations opened at 7am this morning and people have until 10pm to cast their ballot, with the result expected to be known by breakfast time tomorrow. The crucial ballot, which could see the 307-year-old union between Scotland and England brought to an end, is expected to go down to the wire, with polls showing the contest is too close to call. After a frenetic final day of campaigning from the rival sides yesterday, the turnout is expected to be high, with 4,285,323 people registered to vote, according to the Electoral Commission, and for the first time 16 and 17-year-olds across the country will be able to take part.

After a frenetic final day of campaigning from the rival sides yesterday, the turnout is expected to be high, with 4,285,323 people registered to vote . With just hours until the historic referendum, a new poll has placed the No campaign in the lead with 51 per cent . Voters arrive at the polling station in the village hall of the remote Highland area of Lochcarron . Two young Yes supporters give the thumbs up outside the polling station on Brunswick Road in Edinburgh . A YouGov survey for The Sun and The Times and a separate poll by Panelbase both found 52per cent of Scots will to vote to stay in the union, with 48per cent favouring independence, when undecided voters are excluded. If correct, almost all the undecideds – some 170,00 or so voters – would now have to break for Yes for independence to get the go ahead. A Survation poll for the Daily Record, excluding the nine per cent who said they did not know how they would vote, put Yes on 47 per cent and No on 53 per cent. Last night’s polls confirmed that women remain more resistant to independence than men. A blind pensioner was yesterday punched in the face for supporting a No vote as Scottish nationalists mounted a last-minute bullying campaign to intimidate people into voting for independence. Thousands of police will today man polling stations as the separatists are expected to use menacing tactics to persuade people to break up the Union. Last night it emerged the BBC had hired security guards to protect staff because of concerns that police may not be able to cope after the Corporation was targeted over alleged ‘bias’ last weekend. As a poll found that 46 per cent of No voters had felt personally threatened by Yes supporters during the campaign, there were concerns about the possibility of mob violence in the event of a No vote. A 75-year-old man, who is registered blind, was yesterday punched in the face by a nationalist supporter as he handed out leaflets in support of the Union in Glasgow. Incredibly, the YouGov poll found that Ed Miliband is now less trusted than David Cameron in Scotland, traditionally a Labour heartland, on 25 per cent against 26 per cent for the Prime Minister. The tightest referendum poll left the No camp with just a two-point lead. The Ipsos MORI survey for STV put support for Yes on 49 per cent against 51 per cent for No, once undecided voters are excluded. Taking them into account, the No campaign is backed by 49 per cent, Yes on 47 per cent and ‘don’t knows’ on 5 per cent. The figures are rounded up. That represents a slump in support for the No campaign of five percentage points from August, while Yes is up seven points. Turnout for the referendum is now likely to be extremely high, with 95 per cent claiming that they are certain to vote. While this figure is higher with those aged 55 and over who traditionally are more likely to turn out – 97 per cent – it is still very high across all age groups, including those aged 16 to 24, where 90 per cent claim they are certain to vote. The record for any UK referendum was set by the 1998 vote in Northern Ireland, in which 81 per cent of voters took part.

Speaking in Glasgow yesterday, a snippet from his esteemed oration: . 'What we created together, let no narrow nationalism split asunder. ‘Hold your head up high with dignity and pride – stand up and be counted. ‘Tell them Scotland does not belong to the SNP. 'To those people that have still got doubts and are wavering, people who were thinking about voting Yes yesterday but could be persuaded today, let us tell them about the real risks.' After proclaiming a premature victory lap, Alex Salmond received a hero's welcome as he spoke in Perth near Stirling yesterday for the last time in his Yes campaign. To the roars of a jubilant crowd, he urged them to 'seize the opportunity of a lifetime'. 'We are the underdogs in this campaign, as we always have been. 'The Westminster establishment will fling the kitchen sink and half the living room and probably most of the bedroom at us. 'They thought all they had to do was agree to it, see off Scotland, and then it wouldn't matter. 'This is our opportunity of a lifetime and we must seize it with both hands.'

"Arsenal's injury-prone midfielder Abou Diaby played 90 minutes for Arsenal Under 21s as they continued their strong start to the season at Villa Park, thanks to two goals from Chuba Akpom. Diaby, who has been plagued with injuries over the past four years, was playing his second game for the academy side this season at an empty Villa Park, with just 377 fans in attendance. The French midfielder was strong and composed in the centre of the park, and showed occasional signs of his undoubted quality by threading sumptuous through-balls between the heart of the Villa defence.

And the striker, who broke the Arsenal record for the 10m sprint last week, doubled his tally late on, showing strength to match his speed as he held off a defender before finishing calmly with a flick of his right boot.

"Cara Delevingne is once again supporting the campaign for topless rights, posting two provocative images to her six million followers on Instagram. The 21-year-old posted a snap denoting the anatomical similarities between the male and female breasts drawn on a topless man and woman’s bodies.

"Ali vs Frazier, Coe vs Ovett, Borg vs McEnroe, Prost vs Senna... the rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo is football's response to these immortal sporting duels and the contest resumes on Tuesday night in Manchester. These two giants of the international game find themselves on a collision course for the 27th time in their careers when Argentina play Portugal in a friendly at Old Trafford. Their personal battle began in April 2008, when Ronaldo was still at Manchester United and they met Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi resume their epic rivalry when Argentina play Portugal at Old Trafford . Ronaldo was back on familiar ground at Old Trafford as Portugal geared up for the showpiece friendly . Lionel Messi (second left) kicks out as Argentina train at Carrington ahead of the friendly . Games Played: 26 . Messi wins: 12 . Ronaldo wins: 7 . Draws: 7 . Messi goals: 17 . Ronaldo goals: 15 . Messi assists: 10 . Ronaldo assists: 1 . It continued and intensified with a European final in 2009 and then grew more frequent when Ronaldo made his £80m switch to Real Madrid later that summer. Since then, the bitter rivals have contested Clasicos in La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Supercopa and the Champions League, with the balance of power swinging to and fro. This match will be only their second meeting for their countries, the first being a friendly staged in Geneva back in February 2011. Their rivalry splits fans right down the middle but admirers of Ronaldo might want to look away - in their 26 meetings so far, Messi has been on the winning side in 12 of them, Ronaldo in seven, with the other seven drawn. The Argentinian wizard has scored 17 times when they've met compared with Ronaldo's 15. Messi has also provided 10 assists compared with just one for his Portuguese nemesis. That first encounter back in 2008 - the semi-final, first leg of the Champions League at the Nou Camp - wasn't an occasion Ronaldo will remmember too fondly. The two players collide during the 2008 Champions League semi-final, second leg between Manchester United and Barcelona at Old Trafford - the English club won 1-0 thanks to a Paul Scholes screamer .

He skied a second-minute penalty but United hung on to claim a 0-0 draw, going on to win the second leg by virtue of a Paul Scholes screamer and then lift the trophy by beating Chelsea in Moscow. Messi gained his revenge in Rome 12 months later, scoring Barcelona's second goal in a 2-0 win over United in the final as Ronaldo departed Old Trafford on a low note. By the end of that year, the two players were beginning their still-rumbling rivalry in the Spanish game and the 2009-2010 campaign saw first blood to Messi as Barcelona won home and away against their rivals. November 2010 saw perhaps the lowest point for Ronaldo in the head-to-head when Barcelona thrashed Real 5-0 - but Messi failed to find the net that night. Both converted penalties as the return match at the Bernabeu finished 1-1 and, four days later, the Portuguese scored an extra-time winner as Real won a Clasico final of the Copa del Rey. The two teams were then drawn against one another in the semi-finals of the Champions League and Messi again sparkled. Ronaldo can only turn away as Messi and Xavi celebrate Barcelona's 1-0 La Liga win over Real in 2010 . Ronaldo tries to stop Messi in his tracks during a January 2012 Copa del Rey meeting at the Nou Camp . He scored twice in the Bernabeu during the first leg after Pepe was sent off and a 1-1 draw at the Nou Camp was enough to see Barcelona through to another final with United, which they won. The following season saw six meetings across the various competitions, with Barcelona winning three of them. Ronaldo did, however, score the winner in Real's 2-1 success at the Nou Camp in the league late in the campaign, an important result as they broke Barcelona's strangehold on the title. The magical hold these two players have on their teams was perhaps best illustrated in the thrilling 2-2 draw at the Nou Camp on October 7, 2012 as both players scored twice. There were only the two Clasicos last season but March's epic 4-3 win for Barcelona in the Bernabeu saw Messi score a superb hat-trick, including two pressurised penalties. The latest meeting came late last month when a Ronaldo penalty set Real on their way to a 3-1 league win, ending Barcelona's unbeaten start. Who knows what these two marvels of modern football will conjure up at Old Trafford in the latest instalment of football's most gripping personal rivalry.

"Jules Bianchi’s crash was so shocking that it’s almost difficult to put into words. I was informed of the severity of his accident by the FIA immediately after the Japanese Grand Prix; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant. You would have seen that Lewis, Sebastian and I did not spray any champagne on the podium. It wasn’t a time to celebrate. Since the race, I have spent a lot of time thinking about Jules, his family and the people who are close to him. Sebastian, Lewis and I did not spray champagne during a very sombre podium at the Japanese Grand Prix . I will be wearing a sticker showing support for Jules on my crash helmet (right) during this weekend's race . He has a lot of friends in the paddock – obviously being a Frenchman many of them are from France – so I have been spending some time with them, particularly Jean-Eric Vergne. I flew from Japan to Russia with the Toro Rosso driver and I am staying in the same hotel with him. We have spent that time exchanging our different stories of Jules. I am really hoping that there is some good news on his condition, but tragically it has to be said that it is looking very serious. As such, the mood in the paddock ahead of this weekend’s race is very different. Nobody is laughing or having a good time. Everyone is talking and thinking about Jules. Because I speak French, I have had several chats with Jules since he made his debut at the start of last season. In the picture below you will see me sharing a joke with him ahead of this year's British Grand Prix. I can’t say I know him that well, but what I can say is that he is highly regarded in the Formula One paddock and certainly considered to be one of the upcoming drivers of the sport. Nico speaking to Jules ahead of this year's British GP.  The Frenchman is highly regarded in the F1 paddock . Everyone is thinking about Jules' horrible accident in the build-up to the inaugural Russian Grand Prix . We will be wearing stickers on our crash helmets for this weekend’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix to show to the world that we are all still with him. The stickers translate to: ‘Everyone with Jules’. Of course his accident at Suzuka will be a big topic for the drivers when we meet on Friday evening with the FIA, like we do every race weekend, to discuss the safety of the sport and what we can do moving forward. All the drivers will be there and the focus of the meeting will be how, as a sport, we can learn from this. On a personal note, did I think it was too dark or too wet in Japan for the race to continue? To be honest, I don’t wish to comment on any of that because it is not my position to say whether it was right or wrong. This is a time for compassion and our thoughts now must be with Jules, his family, and how the sport can move forward from this. Jules Bianchi's name is still above the Marussia garage ahead of this weekend's race in Russia . Lacking confidence . Last time out in Japan I really struggled on the intermediate tyres, which was a complete contrast to the handling of the car whilst I was leading on the extreme wets. Our car balance was completely wrong from where it should, and usually would, have been, and that is why we were really troubled as a team. I struggled much more than my team-mate Lewis Hamilton because the balance was so far off and I had so much oversteer, which meant the rear of the car was stepping out all the time. It was really difficult for me, and probably for the first time this year, it was a race where I really lacked confidence in the car. That is my conclusion and explanation for our lack of pace which was unfortunate really. Rosberg admitted he lacked confidence in the car despite leading the early phase of the Japanese race . Mercedes were caught off guard which made if difficult for Rosberg during the Japanese Grand Prix . When it rains so heavily as it did in Suzuka, you go into the race in completely different conditions than you have ever driven before so you are heading into the unknown. You have got what you’ve got and you cannot develop your setup as you would do in dry conditions over the course of a weekend. That made it difficult  for me to drive during the race and that is also the reason why Red Bull were quicker than us on the intermediate tyres because we got the balance wrong. There was some suggestion we could have adopted a wet setup in qualifying, as Red Bull did, but the oversteer we encountered in the race was impossible to foresee. It is easy to say in hindsight we should have adapted before the race because we knew the rain was coming, but it is not that easy, and the balance problem caught us off guard. Despite now being 10 points adrift of Lewis, I still regard myself as being in a good position in the fight for the championship, now that I am the chaser, instead of the one being chased. Russia makes its F1 bow . Looking ahead, we are here in Russia for the first time in the history of Formula One. I have been here all week and it is certainly an interesting country. I’ve driven the Sochi circuit in the simulator and if I was to compare it to a track we have been to before it would probably be Valencia as they have their similarities. It looks as though it will be a good circuit and it is always a challenge, as a driver, to adapt. The Russian Grand Prix is making its debut on the Formula One calendar this weekend . The Sochi circuit will evolve over the course of the weekend. The best laps will improve by four seconds . The track has never been used before so the asphalt will get quicker and quicker as the race weekend progresses. Indeed we’re expecting the circuit to evolve by something like four seconds a lap between the first runs on Friday and our quickest laps in qualifying on Saturday, which is huge, a different world! Double trouble . Mercedes AMG could win the constructors’ championship this weekend and that was obviously one of our main targets of the year. It is great to be where we are and have the possibility to do that would be an amazing feat for our team. After Russia we have some time off so I will spend some of it with my family and some with the team to prepare for the final three races of the season in Texas, Brazil and then the finale in Abu Dhabi. Of course, the title could be decided on the new double points ruling which is completely artificial and strange to have such importance for one race, but I guess now that I am behind, it is a good thing. When you are in front it is not so good! Nico is 10 points adrift of Lewis Hamilton, winner of the Japanese Grand Prix, with four races remaining . VIDEO Bianchi remains critical but stable . Nico Rosberg's fee for his column will be donated to the Grand Prix Mechanics' Charitable Trust, which is dedicated to providing help to former and current Formula One mechanics and their families, putting F1 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need. You can follow Rosberg on Twitter @nico_rosberg and MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS @MercedesAMGF1 .","It's difficult to put into words Jules' awful crash at the Japanese Grand Prix .

"Jenna Miscavige left the church in 2000 and praises Leah for getting out for the sake of her young daughter . She says the church would usually try to 'smear' defectors but is now 'struggling' She has told of her traumatic childhood amid the murky realms of Scientology – prompting her to flee the church when she was 20. And today the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige has revealed he will be extremely unhappy by the departure of King of Queens star Leah Remini – as it is ‘definitely not good PR’ for the organisation – adding: ‘PR for the most part is all they care about.’ Jenna Miscavige, an outspoken critic of the religion – having once dubbed her uncle David ‘evil’ - told MailOnline: ‘I’m really happy for Leah. I think it took a lot of courage on her part to do this so publically. It's fantastic.' Happy, now: Jenna Miscavige, the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige, seen here with her young son Archie and husband Dallas, today said it was 'fantastic' news that Leah Remini had quit the Church . Kept from her parents: Jenna Miscavige has told how she was parted from her parents when she was just 12 . Speaking exclusively, Jenna, 29, a third-generation Scientologist who left the organisation when she when she was 20 in 2005, added: 'It’s fantastic that she got out – but to me, the best part is that she has a young daughter and it’s great she won’t have to be brought up in the church. ‘Scientology definitely does use . families in order to get people to do what they want them to do, they . know people care and love for their families. ‘So if they have to use the threat of possibly losing them in order to get them to tow the line they’ll do it.’ 'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda' Jenna . said she had met Leah once, and when asked how her uncle would take the . news of her departure, she replied: ‘I’m guessing not very well! ‘There are so many things going on for the church right now and this is just another thing. ‘It’s definitely not good PR for them – and PR , for the most part is all they care about.' The daughter of Elizabeth and Ron Miscavige, Jr. Jenna was subjected to a childhood in the teachings of Scientology - and was separated from her parents from the age of 12. Now a happily married . mother-of-two living in San Diego, California, with her husband Dallas . and their two children three-year-old Archie and 13-month-old daughter . Winnie, Jenna said: ‘I think Leah’s brave, I’m really happy for her. 'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda. ‘I . can imagine it’s been very stressful for Leah. But the Church is . struggling – in the past they would smear defectors and say bad things . about them, now people know these tactics. Troubled: Jenna Miscavige released a book on being brought up in Scientology earlier this year. She managed to finally leave the church when she was 20. ‘I think more recently they’ve got stuck in a weird place where they think ‘do we smear them or do we not?’ ‘I do think now it’s easier than ever to leave. It’s . becoming easier and easier to become vocal about the church, and look . at the all celebrities leaving like Lisa Marie Presley, Katie Holmes and . Paul Haggis. ‘All those people leaving makes it easier for Leah to go too. Good for Leah.’ At the age of seven, Jenna was admitted to the Sea Organisation, the branch of Scientology's most dedicated followers - and was forced to sign a billion-year contract that bound her immortal spirit (known as the 'Thetan' to a life of dedication to the Church. In April, she told the Independent: 'Looking back I feel completely brainwashed. I didn't even know what I liked or what sort of person I was. I was just a robot of the church.' Despite her tender age, Jenna was forced into gruelling labour for several hours a day from the age of six to 12, including digging trench holes for irrigation and rock hauling. And between the ages of 12 and 18, Jenna saw her mother only twice and father four times. They then left the religion when she was 16 – while she chose to stay behind, admitting she knew nothing else at the time. Actress Leah,43, made her dramatic break from the church this week.

"Officials in southern Utah spent Friday serving eviction papers on the first of possibly dozens of homes in Warren Jeffs' polygamous sect. The residents are among dozens of families who have failed to pay $100-a-month occupancy fees for years, depriving the trust of more than $4 million. Loyal followers of Jeffs have refused to pay, arguing they shouldn't have to give the state money for homes they built and maintained. But Friday signaled the start of a widespread crackdown, starting with 14 homes selected at random. Evictions: At least 14 polygamous families have been evicted from the Hildale settlement in Utah after they refused to pay the $100-a-month occupancy fees to authorities. The residents owe a combined total of $4m . The evictions went smoothly and without major confrontation — but it was painstakingly slow changing locks and clearing rooms at large homes built for multiple wives and dozens of children. By 4pm they still had four homes left. Jean Dickson, a Washington County constable who oversaw the evictions, said: 'There are so many darn doors with all the wives. They each have to have their own way in and out.' One house had 75 doors, she said. Most of the homes were empty or had just a few people there to monitor things, Dickson said. 'They knew this was coming,' she said. 'They were pretty cooperative.' The evictions were the first since Utah took control of a trust in 2005 due to allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs and other sect leaders. Jailed: Warren Jeffs is the former leader of the extremist Mormon sect which brands itself The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He is serving a life sentence for sex abuse . The trust, created by the fundamentalist Mormon sect in 1942, has more than 700 homes and properties valued at more than $100 million in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Utah state Judge Denise Lindberg ordered the evictions this summer, saying she was fed up with a free-rider problem in the community. Lindberg hoped the evictions would send a message and prompt people to pay up. Val Oveson, a spokesman for officials appointed by the judge to oversee the trust, said it's too early to tell if that will happen. Out of 26 homes in the first batch given initial notices in July, only 12 agreed to pay. Evictions of seven additional homes are expected within weeks. Next year, dozens more homes could face the same fate. The evictions were served on houses, rather than people, due to uncertainty surrounding who lives in them, Oveson said. 'They move people around so frequently and so often that they could be in another home with another family,' he said of Jeffs' group, known as The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The sect is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism whose members believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibit it. Jeffs is serving a life sentence in a Texas prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting underage girls whom he considered wives. But he's reported to still lead the sect from prison. The fact that the homes had been vacated and no women and children had to be removed — and no fights broke out — came as a relief for state officials. 'It is very good news for us,' Oveson said. 'We just hope the rest of them will go as smooth.'","State of Utah took over Hildale compound after Warren Jeffs was jailed .

"The World Cup final can be the best occasion of a footballer's life, or the worst if they crumble under the pressure. Germany and Argentina contested the climax to the 2014 tournament, with Mario Gotze scoring a stunning late winner to win it for Joachim Low's side. Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown, the ex-England and Arsenal defender, rates all of the players involved in the match. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fans go wild in Berlin as Germany beat Argentina 1-0 . Crucial: Mario Gotze celebrates scoring the goal that won Germany the World Cup against Argentina . Leader: Jerome Boateng was superb in the World Cup final . Ouch: Manuel Neuer clatters into Gonzalo Higuain in the second half... he still earned his team a foul . GERMANY . MANUEL NEUER - 7 . Didn’t have much to do in the first half. Dangerous challenge on Higuain. Presence helped put off Messi when through on goal. PHILLIP LAHM - 7 . Partnership with Muller good again. Intelligent and economical with his passing. Timed his tackles and interceptions perfectly. JEROME BOATENG - 8... STAR MAN . Did well. Saw the danger early and put his body on the line. Only one with real pace in the German back line. Suited central role. MATS HUMMELS - 6 . Outpaced by Messi time and time again. Had a good tournament but struggled against the runners from deep . BENEDIKT HOWEDES - 6 . Very high tackle and was maybe a tad fortunate just to get a yellow. Exposed by his side’s high line. Also missed good chance with header near end of the first half. Booked. Great chance: Benedikt Howedes missed a fine chance to open the scoring for Germany with a header . Leader: Bastian Schweinsteiger did a fine job in stemming the flow of the Argentine attacks . BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER - 7.5 . Made very important interceptions. Crucial role in stemming the Argentina runs from deep. Booked. CHRISTOPH KRAMER - 5 . Fleeting appearance. Unlucky to have that clash of heads. Did OK before that but was a huge call to pick him. Not sure I would have. Unlucky: Cristoph Kramer had to go off after picking up a head injury in this challenge . THOMAS MULLER - 8 . Boundless energy down the right-hand side but delivery needed to be better at times. Movement, as ever, was incredibly intelligent. TONI KROOS - 7 . Quite quiet but still had chances to score. Plays longer balls than the rest of their midfield and that gave Germany variety. MESUT OZIL - 6.5 . Looked up for the game, worked hard off the ball. However, didn’t do enough in possession in final third. Commendable: Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil worked hard for his team on Sunday night . Experience: Miroslav Klose lead the line well at the Maracana . MIROSLAV KLOSE - 7 . A bit quiet. He’s a finisher and was too reliant on everybody else bringing him into the game. Didn’t have legs to keep up. SUBSTITUTES . ANDRE SCHURRLE (for Kramer 29, 6.5) Impact player normally but did job well on the left-hand side. MARIO GOTZE (for Klose, 88) The best moment of his life. MANAGER . JOACHIM LOW – 7 . Not the right call to hand Kramer his full debut. You were waiting for his Plan B but not sure there really was one. TEAM AVG - 6.8 . Best moment of his life: Mario Gotze's technique was superb... it was a superb touch . Motivator: Joachim Low has been superb tactically all tournament . ARGENTINA . SERGIO ROMERO - 7 . Looked very good and made a couple of smart saves, particularly in the first half. Dealt well with crosses, too. A commanding figure. PABLO ZABALETA - 7.5 . Got forward well and made a few vital interceptions. So important for Argentina and also made decent ventures forward. MARTIN DEMICHELIS - 6.5 . Was hanging on at times, just about making the right decisions. Had just enough pace to get by. Good for him that Klose isn’t fast. EZEQUIEL GARAY - 6.5 . Much quicker than Demichelis so provides a good balance. Not really troubled but dealt well with what was thrown at him. Organised: Martin Demichelis and Ezequiel Garay were solid at the back for Argentina . MARCUS ROJO - 7 . Another player with real pace. Didn’t go forward very much but awkward to beat. It’s not easy marking Muller. JAVIER MASCHERANO - 7 . No-nonsense performance. Would tackle his grandma. Was around the referee at every opportunity. Booked. LUCAS BIGLIA - 7 . He linked the defence and front players. That meant he covered a lot of ground and was very calm on the ball. ENZO PEREZ - 6 . Quieter than he was against Holland, when he impressed me a lot. Part of the hard-working midfield. Gave away no space. Wasn't his day: Lionel Messi was encouraging for the South Americans, but couldn't quite lead them to victory . LIONEL MESSI - 7.5 . Troubled Germany by running at them. Worked hard and came very deep for the ball. Poor miss early in second half. GONZALO HIGUAIN - 5.5 . Missed such an easy chance — scored a harder one against Belgium. Should have timed run better for disallowed goal, too. Opener? Higuain thought he scored for Argentina in the first half, but he was yards offside . Fluffed his lines: The Napoli striker also scuffed his shot wide with just the goalkeeper to beat early on . EZEQUIEL LAVEZZI - 7 . Has such pace. Is so direct and made yards every time he got the ball. Superb cross for disallowed goal. Blow to lose him injured. SUBSTITUTES . SERGIO AGUERO (for Lavezzi 46, 6). Looked fired up, desperate to make impact. Booked. PALACIO (for Higuain 77, 6). No real impact. GAGO (for Perez 86). MANAGER . ALEJANDRO SABELLA – 8 . Sabella set his team up to be so much better organised than Brazil. Deserves credit for that. His team more dangerous. REFEREE . NICOLA RIZZOLI (Italy) — 7 . Big call not to send off Howedes. Didn’t notice him too much, which is a good thing. Was very firm withMascherano, who is difficult to referee as he is so mouthy. ATTENDANCE: 74,738 .

"England manager Roy Hodgson has described Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds'. Hodgson is considering naming the 21-year-old in his England squad for the first time, having taken notice of Kane's goalscoring exploits at White Hart Lane. Kane scored two goals against Chelsea in Tottenham's 5-3 win and is being tipped to be involved in England's next game against Lithuania on March 27. Harry Kane has been in sensational form for Tottenham - most recently netting a double against Chelsea . Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with Kane (centre) after scoring their fifth goal against Chelsea . Hodgson's selection, however, could have repercussions for Gareth Southgate, the England Under-21 manager ahead of the European U21 Championship in June. 'Harry is one of those players – Andros Townsend being another one – who didn't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in,'  Hodgson told SiriusXM FC. 'They got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade, if you like, or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade. 'We have watched [Kane] for a while and I worked with him briefly in the Under-21s when I filled in for one game. Harry has come on in leaps and bounds and I'm not surprised because I know [former coaches] Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand very well. After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side . England manager Roy Hodgson described Tottenham's Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds' 'They have worked with him at Tottenham and they always believed in him as a goalscorer. It's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the Under-21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we didn't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders. 'And yet suddenly Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings are all doing exceptionally well. It will be a headache for Gareth who he picks to play in the summer.' Hodgson reserved special praise for Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin, too. 'Charlie is doing very well,' he continued. 'He's another one who has come through the lower leagues and, a bit like Rickie Lambert, I'm sure people have watched Charlie many times and dismissed him because he doesn't run like the wind. 'You can be a good footballer sometimes without needing to run like the wind and Harry Redknapp has brought the best out of him for QPR.'

"The average British wedding now costs a bank-busting £22,000, a rise of £7,000 over a decade. But one thrifty bride who spent just £5,000 on her dream wedding by making her own dress and finding bargains on eBay has said she loved economising... and now plans to make £500 re-selling bits of her big day online. Seamstress Charlotte Denn-Cirrone, 31, from east London, is the founder of handmade children's wear brand What Mother Made, so was able to make her own gown from scratch for just £600 when she married Julian earlier this month. Charlotte and Julian on their wedding day, wearing the dress that she made from scratch and a vintage suit found on eBay that Charlotte adjusted herself . The mother-of-two said the wedding was hard work, but that she wouldn't have had it any other way, even if she had the money. 'It was very hard work, but money was tight so we didn't really have another option,' Charlotte told MailOnline. 'Plus, I love shopping on eBay and trailing car boot sales and I'm really into making and mending - it's sort of a passion of mine - so even if we had had the money I wouldn't have done it differently. 'I brought my bridesmaid dresses on eBay . and amended them myself as I am a seamstress. We went to try on dresses . that we liked in stores and then I waited for them to come up on eBay. 'It's amazing, you're almost always guaranteed to see it eventually! It . didn't matter what size they were because I could take them in. I saved . about £350 by doing it that way.' Charlotte and her bridesmaids on her big day, wearing the dresses she made or altered herself . Charlotte had homemade place settings and guests took home homemade sauces, jams and chutneys . Charlotte is now planning on selling some of the items she made or bought on eBay to make back some of the £5,000 she spent on the wedding. She said: 'The best thing about hand sourcing . rather than hiring all your outfits and decorations is that you can sell . them afterwards. 'eBay is the best place and If you advertise them as . wedding items you can show your wedding images with all your items . looking fabulous!' Although Charlotte was considering selling her homemade wedding dress online, she has become too attached to it and doesn't want to see it go. 'I reckon we'll make about £500 from selling napkins and tablecloths on eBay,' she said. The bridesmaids dresses were all bought on eBay, having been seen in Monsoon, and then Charlotte tailored them to size . Charlotte made her own wedding dress for just £600, and guests were given disposable cameras to take pictures of the big day . Charlotte, who has two children, Maddie, six, and nine-month-old Arlo, said eBay was all about 'seeing the potential' in something. Vintage bridal shoes     £11 . Bridal veil     £13 . Gift for bridesmaid, gold necklace    £35 . Gifts for Groomsmen, cufflinks    £9 . Wedding ring     £54 . Small bunch of artificial flowers     £4 . Pack of invitations     £10 . Centrepieces     £17 . Photo album     £9 . Her advice for a bride planning a thrifty wedding is to 'know your budget and stick to it'. She added: 'It's so easy to just overspend and as . there is so much to buy it all adds up. 'Also try to find listings on . eBay that end during the week, there tend to be fewer bidders going for . the same thing. 'Remember that it's just one day and that it'll be lovely... especially if you don't spend too much! Ours was just perfect. 'I kept telling everyone how small our budget was! I was really proud actually that I had achieved such a high end look on such a low budget. 'I love miss matching items to create the look we were after so finding random beautiful things on eBay was perfect for our budget.' eBay spokesman Steven Heywood said: 'We . all attend a multitude of weddings and it's always the very personal . ones that stick in our memory and are the most fun. 'With the cost of . weddings continually rising it’s more important than ever that we look . to make the most of our budgets and eBay provides the perfect . platform for all your wedding inspiration and needs'. All of the flowers and foliage were foraged or from Charlotte's mother's garden . Charlotte and Julian planned the whole day for under £5,000 . Total cost: £4,980 . Charlotte's advice to marrying on a budget is to use eBay, make as much as you can yourself and source items from friends . 2013 now sees the average wedding cost a budget busting £22,000 - rising a massive £7,000 over the last decade. But your perfect day doesn't have to cost the earth. eBay.co.uk teamed up with wedding planning expert George Watts, The Wedding Fairy, to show you how to create your bespoke dream day without breaking the bank.

"Tiger Woods has endured a disastrous return to the golf course after a raging fever caused him to be sick twice on the course over the weekend and he ended up finishing last. A profusely-sweating Woods vomited twice on the golf course in Florida as the former world number one finished the Hero World Challenge with plenty of work ahead of him. Woods has not played since August while he recovered from a back injury. Scroll down for video . Tiger Woods has endured a disastrous return to the golf course after a raging fever caused him to be sick twice on the course over the weekend and he ended up finishing last. A profusely-sweating Woods vomited twice on the golf course in Florida as the former world number one finished the Hero World Challenge with plenty of work ahead of him . In last place in the 18-player field, he coughed repeatedly into a towel and vomited along the third fairway, but carried on in his return to competition after an absence of some four months due to back pain. 'It feels good to feel that rush again,' Woods said. 'I didn't hit the ball as well as I would like. My short game was awful. But I was able to play for four days and hit the ball the way I wanted to and that's progress. 'It's so nice to hit drives that hard again, take bunkers out of play, cut corners, hadn't felt healthy enough to do that in a very long time.' After battling illness for two days, stumbling to five-over in his first eight holes and displaying woeful chip shots thrown off by swing changes, Woods found the positives in simply playing without pain, rare for him in 2014. The 14-time major winner closed with three consecutive birdies to the delight of the large gallery following him at the layout that was his longtime home course. The former world number one was hit by a vomiting fever at his Florida comeback over the weekend . Woods, who ended a four-month back injury layoff at the event, fired a par 72 Sunday at Isleworth to complete 72 holes on level par 288, sharing last with Hunter Mahan in the 18-golfer field. 'I made some progress,' Woods said. 'I hadn't played in four months. I was able to play without any issues and that really reinforces that I'm doing the right thing for my body. 'It's nice to be able to go out and hit driver that hard again. I've gotten my speed back. Look how far I'm hitting it now. That's nice. 'I obviously need to clean up my short game. That still needs a lot of work. To come out and not play in any kind of pain and hit the ball as hard as I want without really flinching is great progress.'\ . Woods, who had not played since the PGA Championship in August, said he planned to build upon his solid start in a four-month plan to peak for the Masters, happy his body was healthy enough for full-power practices. 'If I stay the course I'm on now, I'll eventually be able to do what I want to do,' Woods said. Throwing up: Woods, who said he was on antibiotics to battle a bug that had observers wondering if he could start, let alone finish, the round, could barely speak after playing a quick 18 . Woods, ranked 24th, would like to challenge Rory McIlroy at Augusta National in April as the current world number one tries to win his third consecutive major and complete a career grand slam. 'I've been hurt. I've been out of it for a long time. I've had to make my run to get back there,' Woods said. 'It takes winning... it's a process to get back to that level. You've got to build up to it. I've got some time.' The 14-time major champion, chasing the record 18 majors won by Jack Nicklaus, says he will practice one more week, take a holiday break, and return to work in January. 'I like what I'm doing right now,' Woods said. 'I just want to reinforce it before I take my break. There are some things I can do with my short game I can definitely work on.' Under pressure: Woods said he started to feel a little better as the round built up but he also continued to throw up as well . Woods gave no hint about his early 2015 tournament plans, with past years having included stops at Torrey Pines, Doral and Bay Hill in the run-up to the Masters in April. 'It's a pretty full schedule,' Woods said. 'I'll leave it at that.' Woods, who has not won a major since the 2008 US Open, turns 39 later this month and no player has won four majors beyond that birthday. On Sunday, Woods opened with six pars before a tap-in birdie at the par-5 seventh and sank a 10-foot birdie putt to finish his front nine at two-under. But Woods' chipping woes cost him dearly at the par-5 13th, where he needed three tries to pitch the ball onto the green on his way to a triple bogey. Woods sank a 40-foot par putt at 14 but missed an four-foot putt to take a bogey at the par-3 15th. He answered with a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-3 16th and a six-foot birdie putt at the par-5 17th. In the rough: Sick to his stomach during warmups, he retched on his way to the first green after sipping from a bottle of water .","The former world number one was hit by a vomiting fever at his Florida comeback over the weekend .

"The mother of a girl who says she was abused by a world famous artist has described herself as 'a moral coward' for dismissing her daughter's allegations. The woman was giving evidence at the trial of 70-year-old Graham Ovenden, a founding member of the Brother of Ruralists collective with pop artist Peter Blake in 1975. Renowned portrait painter Ovenden is accused of a string of indecency offences involving children dating back 40 years. Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard . The charges relate to four victims, all young girls at the time of the alleged offending, who cannot be named for legal reasons. They . include offences allegedly carried out while Ovenden was taking . photographs of them, at his studio in Cornwall and at his former home in . London. Giving evidence at . Truro Crown Court in Cornwall today, one woman - once a regular visitor . with her daughter to Ovenden's 25-acre estate in north Cornwall - . described how she initially ignored her then-teenage daughter's . allegations of what happened when Ovenden took her picture as a little . girl, ten years earlier. She . said her daughter made the claims aged around 15 or 16. The woman said: . 'I was a moral coward. An absolute coward. I'm ashamed of it now. I . thought: ""I cannot think about it, it was such a long time ago."" 'I thought: ""Do I go down to [Ovenden's home in Cornwall] and confront Graham?"" I didn't even tell my husband. 'I . just pretended it didn't happen. It is awful but I didn't want to think . about it. It is not the sort of thing you wanted to hear about your . daughter.' Asked by defence counsel Christopher Quinlan QC if the woman believed her daughter at the time the allegations were first made, the witness told court: 'No, I was a moral coward and swept it under the carpet. Court appearance: The Cornish artist's work includes nude and semi-nude portraits of young girls . 'I remember thinking: ""She hasn't told me."" It is something I have never forgiven myself for.' The court heard the woman was 'content' for her daughter to be photographed by Ovenden, and said it was 'just how life was' at the estate, which was 'chaotic' with visitors of all ages. Asked by Mr Quinlan if she thought anything 'untoward' was going on, the woman replied: 'No, I didn't.' The court heard the woman continued to visit Ovenden's home after her daughter's allegations. She said she went to visit Ovenden's wife, Annie - herself an esteemed artist. However, she said she would sit around and play cards as a group, at which Ovenden would also take part. The court heard yesterday how internationally-acclaimed Ovenden was described as a paedophile who put sticky tape over young girls' eyes as a 'ritual' before committing indecent acts. Ovenden, who bragged to police that he had a 'major reputation' for having 'some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years', was said to regularly invite other artists to his home near Bodmin where they would paint and take photographs based on a set theme, including Alice in Wonderland. However, one witness told the court his home was also the setting for Ovenden's abuse of her. Speaking from behind a screen, the woman said: 'I would have to go in by myself. I would then be made to take my clothes off and put on some kind of gown. I would have my eyes stuck down with black tape. 'We would have to go through this strange ritual.' When asked by prosecutor Ramsay Quaife why she did not tell anyone about what happened, she replied: 'I'm sure I won't be the first or last kid to keep some horrible secret from people.' Mr Quaife described how the four alleged victims had previously posed for Ovenden. They said they weren't able to see because they had sticky tape put over their eyes before being abused, Mr Quaife told the court. The women made formal complaints to police in the late 2000s, he said. Mr Quaife told the court: 'What we (the Crown Prosecution Service) say is that Mr Ovenden is a paedophile, that is a sexual abuser of children. In this case we say the target of his abuse was young girls.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Graham Ovenden is accused of abusing children who posed for him .

"Police texted a bike thief demanding he hand himself in before calling his mobile phone, only to be told by the teenager: ‘Come and find me - peace out’. Drug user Axl Parker, 19, had been raiding his downstairs neighbours’ sheds in Ramsgate, Kent, before one of them told officers she thought he was the culprit, a court heard. The neighbour, Claire Bain, told police about a Facebook picture of Parker with an optic - used for serving measures of spirits - hanging up behind him, which had gone missing from her shed. Cocaine user: Axl Parker, 19, pictured, had been raiding his downstairs neighbours' sheds in Ramsgate, Kent, before one of them told police she thought he was the culprit after seeing a Facebook picture, a court heard . Police officers went to arrest Parker at his home but he was not there, Canterbury Crown Court was told. However Parker then posted a text message, sent to him by police, on Facebook - and it read: ‘Axl its (sic) Heidi from the police stn, im working today and can deal with u if u r ready 2 come in’. He wrote on Facebook in response: ‘Margate police no they can’t catch me lol’, before police called him to say they needed to talk - but he replied: ‘Come and find me - peace out’, then hung up. Parker was arrested soon after at his home - just upstairs from two of the six sheds he had raided for bikes, a leaf blower, tools and the optic, the court heard. When police raided Parker’s home they found the stolen items. This was after neighbours had been discussing who the culprit could be and came up with Parker’s name, Jim Harvey, prosecuting, said. He told the court: ‘She (Claire Bain) went onto Facebook to his page and on his profile picture, in the background she saw an optic which had been stolen from her shed.’ Contact: Parker posted a text message, sent to him by police, on Facebook - and it read as above . The case began when neighbour Tracy Adams alerted cops that her shed had been broken into and her 11-year-old son’s bicycle had been stolen in March this year.

She told officers that Parker’s bedroom overlooked her garden and that she was sure he was the culprit. Miss Bain also realised her shed had been broken into and spoke to other neighbours. Miss Bain - upon checking Parker’s Facebook page - found him posing in a picture with the stolen optic hanging up behind him, although the photo has now been deleted. She alerted police that she had ‘found evidence’ and officers set about arresting Parker. Police initially turned up at his house to arrest him but found that he wasn’t home in March this year. A statement from Ms Adams, read in court, said: ‘How can you tell your 11-year-old son that his bike is stolen? He has been greatly affected. Reply: He wrote on Facebook in response: 'Margate police no they can't catch me lol', before police called him to say they needed to talk - but he replied: 'Come and find me - peace out', then hung up . ‘His bedroom overlooks the garden and he no longer wants to sleep there in case this man comes back.’ 'I wonder if you ever stop and think about that 11-year-old boy or wondered how it feels to have your bike stolen. Or think about the widow whose late husband’s tools you took? How low does it get?' Judge James O’Mahony . Judge James O’Mahony, who heard how Parker was addicted to drugs, said that cocaine turned people into ‘low, nasty thieves who steal children’s bikes’. He told Parker: ‘I wonder if you ever stop and think about that 11-year-old boy or wondered how it feels to have your bike stolen. Or think about the widow whose late husband’s tools you took? How low does it get?’ Parker, who admitted theft, was handed a three-month jail sentence - suspended for two years - and ordered to take a six-month programme to deal with his drugs habit.","Axl Parker, 19, had been raiding neighbours' sheds in Ramsgate, Kent .

"Reunited: Edwina Currie with daughter Debbie . Spicing things up a bit is her speciality. So when Edwina Currie was sent into the celebrity jungle, she did exactly what was expected. But it wasn’t her frank confessions about her love life that raised eyebrows (after all, she is the woman who told all about her affair with Prime Minister John Major). It was her open admiration and flirtatious approach to the young men in the jungle that seemed to rile so many viewers. Last night, back in her five-star hotel after being voted off I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, Miss Currie, 68, was unrepentant about her behaviour and the open way she discussed sex on the show. Indeed she said it was precisely because of her age that she was happy to talk about it. ‘It may be a taboo subject for young people,’ she declared. ‘When you get to a certain age, you talk about it all the time. It’s one of the issues of the WI.’ Forget the Women’s Institute traditions of jam making, arts and crafts and even more modern pursuits such as learning to surf the internet. Miss Currie said what her generation really want is to talk about sex. ‘I am a baby boomer, for God’s sake. I was born in October 1946. My parents were married in January 1946. 'We were part of a generation who changed the world – and I think we changed it entirely for the better with issues like racism and sexism. Our generation of women are just about reaching our prime.’ Miss Currie’s flirtatious behaviour in the jungle involved ogling male campers as they worked out, in particular X Factor star Jake Quickenden, at whom she directed much of her attentions. She marvelled at his muscles and toned figure as he lifted logs as weights. And the mother of two, who has written several racy novels, led discussions about sex and virginity while in the camp. Smooch: Carl Fogarty plants a kiss on Edwina Currie on  'I'm A Celebrity, .Get Me Out Of Here!' Miss Currie’s flirtatious behaviour in the jungle involved ogling male campers as they worked out, in particular X Factor star Jake Quickenden (pictured), at whom she directed much of her attentions . She happily spoke about her own sex life, going into detail about having one-night stands. She justified herself by saying: ‘I don’t mind talking about what happened half a century ago. ‘If it enlightens and assists other people to overcome that extraordinary obstacle and gets them to a state of maturity and sexual awareness, I’m happy.’ However, she complained that other contestants’ stories might have been edited out of the programme. ‘We were all talking about losing our virginity,’ she said. ‘If the programme producers have only broadcast my remark, that is unfair. It was so long ago anyway.’ Miss Currie also offered sex tips to her camp-mate Nadia Forde. Asked what she told the singer, Miss Currie said she drew on advice from her late mother. She said: ‘I probably just said, “Enjoy it while you can, love!” My mum made it to nearly 93.’ ÷ Last night former World Superbike Champion Carl Fogarty was crowned King of the Jungle in the final of the show. The 49-year-old beat Mr Quickenden, who came second, and TV presenter Melanie Sykes who came third. Miss Currie came fourth.","The former MP, 68, was seen admiring male contestants on hit TV show .

"Social media giants will be ordered by ministers to do more to combat online bullies after the death of teenager Tallulah Wilson . Social media giants will be ordered by ministers to do more to combat online bullies after the death of teenager Tallulah Wilson. Culture Secretary Maria Miller will call in bosses from firms including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to tell them to deal with complaints more quickly and decisively. She will also demand a united approach on how to deal with allegations of online abuse. The move follows the appeal by Tallulah’s mother Sarah for social media networks to stop online ‘poison’. She has spoken of the ‘toxic digital world’ her daughter, 15, was sucked into. Tallulah, a talented ballerina, threw herself in front of a train last October after sharing self-harm images of herself on Tumblr, a micro-blogging site. She had claimed she had ‘no future’ and one user had encouraged her to hang herself. Social media networks will be told to look out for youngsters who talk about harming themselves and point them to bodies which can help. They will also be expected to  suspend or delete accounts of repeat offenders and make it easier to  report problems. Tomorrow, Mrs Miller and Home Secretary Theresa May will update the Prime Minister on progress being made to protect children on the web. The Daily Mail has campaigned against online pornography and David Cameron has already pressured the industry into action by supporting a default filter against such images. It is expected he will also back the campaign against online bullying. On Saturday, the Mail revealed that police were investigating if Tallulah death’s was linked to that of a teenager who attended the same school and died in similar circumstances. Schoolgirl: Tallulah was a pupil at the £11,000-a-year St Margaret¿s School in Hampstead, North-West London . Mary Stroman, 16, was briefly in the same year at St Marylebone School in Westminster, central London. She died nearly two weeks ago in Yarnbrook, Wiltshire, after being struck by a train on a level crossing. A special conference of major social media companies will also be called by Mrs Miller in the next few weeks. Officials admitted that Tallulah’s tragic death has ‘given the whole thing fresh urgency’. A source said: ‘Some of the behaviour being seen online is deeply disturbing. Culture Secretary Maria Miller will call in bosses from firms including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to tell them to deal with complaints more quickly and decisively . It would be completely unacceptable to threaten physical violence such as rape or murder during a face-to-face argument so why do people think it is acceptable online? ‘Behaviour that is unacceptable and even illegal in the offline world is exactly the same online.’ The source pointed out it took huge pressure before internet giants had agreed to filter out online porn. The industry is planning a national campaign aimed at parents about keeping their children safe. But despite fears about online risks, some Liberal Democrats will try to dilute measures at their spring conference with a motion that users should not have to ‘opt out’ of filters.","Ordered to combat online bullies after death of teenager Tallulah Wilson .

"A teenage girl in the same school year as tragic Tallulah Wilson has died in similar horrific circumstances after being struck by a train. Mary Stroman was killed while an inquest was being held into the death of gifted ballerina Tallulah, 15, who killed herself at London’s St Pancras station. The inquest into the death of the schoolgirl – who became addicted to websites glamorising self-harm and suicide – was widely reported in the media. Death: Tallulah Wilson, 15, left, was found dead on the tracks at St Pancras station. Mary Stroman, right, died while an inquest into the death of Tallulah Wilson was taking place . Police were last night investigating ‘chilling similarities’ between the deaths of  16-year-old Mary and Tallulah, who had both been pupils at St Marylebone School in Westminster. Mary, the daughter of US musician and jazz professor Scott Stroman, died ten days ago in Yarnbrook, Wiltshire. She is understood to have been staying in the area and was struck by a train shortly after 8pm on a foot crossing. Police had begun searching for the teenager, who had been reported missing. Emergency services rushed to the scene but Mary, one of five children, was pronounced dead. Sources said both girls were ‘clearly very troubled’ but there is no evidence that Mary had been on any self-harming websites. Police do not believe the girls had been close friends – either in person or online. Mary attended St Marylebone School for about two months four years ago. But the fact they were briefly at school together means police have not ruled out the possibility they were in close contact with each other before Tallulah’s death. It is believed that a key line of the police investigation into Mary’s death is her medical history. The Mail has learned that the teenager had suffered health problems. Another line of inquiry is that Mary was bullied but officers say there is no  evidence of that at this stage. School: Both girls attended St Marylebone School in Westminster, though Mary was only there for two months . Tallulah Wilson’s inquest heard claims that she had been bullied at St Marylebone school, which she attended until the summer of 2012 when she moved to St Margaret’s School in Hampstead weeks before her death in October 2012. A teacher responsible for pupil welfare at St Marylebone said Tallulah never complained to staff about being bullied. Last night Mary’s family issued a statement saying: ‘To all her friends and people who knew her, please remember Mary as a bright, clever and funny girl who was gentle and kind to everyone. ‘She loved animals and the outdoors, and she always had great love and affection for all of her family. Mary is now at peace with herself and it was an honour to have her as a daughter and a sister.’ A British Transport Police spokesman said: ‘Mary had injuries consistent with having been hit by a train and was pronounced dead at the scene. The incident is currently being treated as non-suspicious.’ Kathryn Pugh, head teacher at St Marylebone School, said yesterday: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are for Mr and Mrs Stroman and for their other children who attended our school. Mary and Tallulah were in the same year but not in the same form group. ‘Mary was here for a very short time, around two months about four years ago. Because she was unwell she left the school.’ Mary’s family live in a three-storey terraced home in Finsbury Park, North London. Mr Stroman, 55, is an award-winning musician who has lived in the UK since 1982. He and his wife Sue have two sons and two other daughters, all older than Mary. Mary is the third London schoolgirl to die in recent years in similar circumstances. In June 2012, Rosie Whitaker, 15, killed herself by lying in front of a train after visiting websites which promote self-harm and suicide. Rosie, from Beckenham, South-East London, was a talented ballet dancer. She suffered from bulimia and had scratched the word ‘fat’ across her stomach when she died. Tallulah killed herself four months later. When her inquest ended on Wednesday, her mother Sarah demanded action against the ‘toxic digital world’ of the internet that glamorises suicide and self-harm. Tallulah said Rosie was a friend of hers and paid tribute to her the day before her death. In a message posted on Tallulah’s Twitter account, which she had dedicated to Rosie, she wrote: ‘Why the **** should I stay if no one around me stays for me? It’s not ****ing fair. I’m done. I’m ****ing done #suicide #goodbye.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mary Stroman, 16, died in a similar way to Tallulah Wilson, 15 .

"The Dallas emergency-room doctor who initially treated a Liberian man infected with Ebola has said he didn't know the man's home country or that he had a 103-degree fever shortly before he left the hospital. Thomas Eric Duncan was released in the early hours of September 26, about half an hour after his medical records indicate he had a fever that high - a key potential symptom of Ebola, The Dallas Morning News reported. Dr. Joseph Howard Meier told the newspaper he didn't see that temperature reading on Duncan's medical chart. Patient: Thomas Eric Duncan was released in the early hours of September 26, about half an hour after his medical records indicate he had a fever that high - a key potential symptom of Ebola . 'I was unaware of a 103-degree fever,' Meier said in written answers to questions released by his attorney. 'It appears in the chart, but I did not see it.' Duncan returned to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas two days later in an ambulance and was quickly diagnosed with Ebola. He died October 8. Duncan's sister and fiancee have said he told medical staff in the emergency room during that first visit that he was from Liberia, though the hospital's medical records only indicate Duncan said he was from Africa, The Dallas Morning News reported. 'I have a general recollection of Mr. Duncan, but I don’t recall the specifics of our discussions,' Meier told the newspaper, answering a question about if he spoke to Duncan regarding travel history. 'However, I routinely pair the recent travel question with the sick contact question so it is likely that I did so in this instance.' The hospital has already acknowledged mistakes in its care of Duncan and said its records system previously didn't make a patient's travel history clear, the newspaper pointed out. Duncan's case set off a scramble by authorities to monitor dozens of people who potentially had contact with him, including in the days after his release from the hospital. None of those people ended up testing positive for Ebola. Two Presbyterian nurses were infected while treating him, but have since recovered. Garteh Korkoryah, center, mother of Thomas Eric Duncan, is comforted during a memorial service for her son on October 18 . Hospital: Dr. Joseph Meier treated Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, pictured (file photo) In his written responses to The Dallas Morning News, Meier also said 'As medical professionals we aspire to perfection in the diagnosis and treatment of all our patients and have regrets when an incorrect diagnosis occurs.' 'It’s very easy to make a diagnosis of any condition after the patient’s medical evaluation confirms the final diagnosis,' he said. 'Unfortunately, such 20/20 hindsight is not available to medical professionals caring for patients in real time.' Meier said 'If [Duncan] told me he came from Liberia, this would have prompted me to contact the CDC and begin an evaluation for Ebola, but the likelihood would have still been low since Mr. Duncan denied any sick contacts.' But he was less sure about the 103-degree reading. 'Given what little information I had, a 103 temperature would most likely not have helped with the diagnosis of Ebola,' Meier said. 'Although, if it did not quickly improve, he could have possibly been admitted to the hospital.' Asked about whether he would do anything differently, Meier told The Dallas Morning News that 'Hindsight is always 20/20 so it’s virtually impossible to answer this question. Based on the information I had at the time, I believe that the care and treatment were appropriate.'","Thomas Duncan was released September 26, after his medical records indicate he had a 103-degree fever - a key potential symptom of Ebola .

"Thousands of children aged 10 and younger are so depressed, anxious and stressed out that they require medical treatment, it has emerged. Up to 10 per cent of schoolchildren are believed to be affected by some form of mental illness, according to campaigners. And it has now been revealed that worrying numbers of young people are being treated for serious mental issues in hospitals and other NHS centres. Experts blame the 'toxic climate' of the bullying culture on websites popular among the young, as well as other pressures of modern life, for fuelling the spate of anxiety. Fears: A worrying number of children aged 10 or under are suffering from mental health problems, new findings have revealed (picture posed by model) Despite the epidemic of mental health problems among children and young people, two thirds of councils have cut spending on services intended to tackle the issue. A total of 4,391 children aged 10 or below have been treated for depression, anxiety or stress in the past five years at two of Britain's biggest NHS mental health trusts. The figures from South London and Maudsley trust and South Essex Partnership University trust were revealed following a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mirror. They cover just two out of 60 mental health trusts in England alone - meaning that the true number of children affected is undoubtedly much higher. Tragic: 15-year-old Tallulah Wilson killed herself after visiting self-harm websites . Children's mental health charity YoungMinds estimates that 96,000 children aged between five and 10 suffer from an anxiety disorder, while 8,700 are seriously depressed. Overall, more than half a million children and young people up to the age of 16 are affected by a diagnosable mental health disorder, according to the charity. The problems are significantly worse for children in care, three quarters of whom suffer from behavioural or emotional issues. YoungMinds has previously forecast that by 2020, 100,000 children could be hospitalised every year due to self-harming. 'An increase in under-11s needing mental health services is a sad and very worrying indictment of the society we live in and the pressures children face,' the charity's Lucie Russell told the Mirror. 'Every day we hear about the unprecedented toxic climate young people face in a 24/7 online culture where they can never switch off, where they experience constant assessments at school, bullying, sexualisation, consumerism and pressure to have the perfect body at a young age.' A survey by YoungMinds revealed that 34 out of 51 local councils had cut spending on mental health services for children and teenagers since 2010. Former Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for an investigation into the new findings, describing the number of children requiring treatment as 'shocking'. He told the Mirror: 'It is clear children are increasingly having to receive NHS care because of cuts to child and adolescent mental health budgets.' Health minister Norman Lamb said: 'Children's mental health is a priority for this Government and we are investing £54million over this Parliament into improving access to therapeutic treatments for children. 'I have always been clear that mental health must be treated with equal importance as physical health and it is totally unacceptable to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds.' A number of tragic suicides among children have recently been linked to online bullying as well as websites which are accused of glamourising self-harm. The mother of 15-year-old Tallulah Wilson, who threw herself under a train 16 months ago, blamed her daughter's death on 'a toxic digital world'.

"Rather than blighting rooftops as at present, future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a Ghostbuster-style team. Scientists from the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering invented a new way to spray solar cells onto flexible surfaces using miniscule light-sensitive materials known as colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). Illan Kramer at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering said: 'My dream is that one day you'll have two technicians with Ghostbusters backpacks come to your house and spray your roof.' Scroll down for video . Illan Kramer (pictured) from the University of Toronto's Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering is one of the driving forces behind the developement . Solar-sensitive CQDs printed onto a flexible film could be used to coat all kinds of objects from laptops to aircraft wings. The surface of a car roof would produce enough power for three 100-Watt light bulbs or 24 compact fluorescents. And the breakthrough could send prices of solar panels crashing. The system sprayLD is a play on the manufacturing process called ALD, short for atomic layer deposition, in which materials are laid down on a surface one atom-thickness at a time. Until now, it was only possible to incorporate light-sensitive CQDs onto surfaces through batch processing - an inefficient, slow and expensive assembly-line approach to chemical coating. SprayLD blasts a liquid containing CQDs directly onto flexible surfaces, such as film or plastic, like printing a newspaper by applying ink onto a roll of paper. Potential breakthrough: Rather than blighting rooftops as at present, future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a Ghostbuster-style team . This roll-to-roll coating method makes incorporating solar cells into existing manufacturing processes much simpler. Two papers published in the journals Advanced Materials and Applied Physics Letters showed that the sprayLD method can be used on flexible materials without any major loss in solar-cell efficiency. And the system is easily built using a spray nozzle used in steel mills to cool steel with a fine mist of water and a few regular air brushes from an art store. He added: 'This is something you can build in a Junkyard Wars fashion, which is basically how we did it. We think of this as a no-compromise solution for shifting from batch processing to roll-to-roll.' Professor Ted Sargent said: 'As quantum dot solar technology advances rapidly in performance, it's important to determine how to scale them and make this new class of solar technologies manufacturable . 'We were thrilled when this attractively manufacturable spray-coating process also led to superior performance devices showing improved control and purity.' Thing of the past? Traditional solar panels may no longer be the best way to harness the sun's energy .","Scientists from University of Toronto hope to make breakthrough soon .

"It is the happiest day of a couples life but can also be  one of the most expensive, seeing many people saving for years in order to afford their perfect wedding. However one thrifty bride has proved that a magical matrimony needn't require draining your bank account or taking out a second mortgage. Shelley Richmond, 30 from Terrington in Yorkshire created her dream day all for less than £4,000 which although is still a large amount of money it's a snip considering that last year the average wedding cost was £21,939. Cheap and cheerful: Shelley and Paul's wedding cost just £3, 800 . The scrimping bride made whopping savings by making her own wedding dress costing just £115 with shoes. She purchased her bridesmaids' dresses on Ebay with the cheapest costing just £7. Incredibly, spendthrift Shelley spent just £600 feeding all 120 guests, working out at just £5 a head. However, there was one area that Shelley wasn't prepared to scrimp on with her wedding drinks being her biggest set back. Her total bar bill was £1000 making sure her wedding went off with a bang. Bargain bride: Shelley's wedding dress and shoes set her back just £115 . Shelley's venue cost a bargain £400 making her total spend for her ideal wedding just £3,800. For Shelley and her partner Paul, an lavish bash wasn't an option as the couple had just bought a house together so were running low on funds but they didn't want to cut corners on their special day. She and Paul had been together eight years before getting engaged on holiday in Scotland in . August last year. 'We were staying in our little camper van and had just been out for a meal at our favourite restaurant. Paul . tricked me by saying he could see a pod of dolphins in the sea, but . when I turned back round he was holding a beautiful shiny ring.' Shelley saved money on her bridesmaids' dresses by purchasing them on Ebay with the cheapest costing £7 . Shelley and Paul (centre) met eight years ago and got engaged while on holiday in Scotland last year . Shelley who works as a painter and photographer, says that she was able to save so much by calling in favours from friends. 'The main way we cut down on costs was skill swapping, so my friend's band played the reception, and I'll be shooting their wedding photos, friends did the catering and I set them up a website for their new business. 'My dress I made from fabric bought through a wholesaler for around £75. Shelley called in favours from friends to avoid spending a fortune. Her friend did her hair and makeup for her . Pennies make pretty: Shelley created her own floral decorations for her wedding (left) Shelley and Paul held a cake competition at their wedding (right) Creative saver: Shelley paid her waiters in booze in order to save on cash . Shelley was able to feed her entire wedding party for just £5 a head and made her own liqueur for the toasts . 'I bought all my bridesmaid dresses on eBay or as samples from a friend who works in fashion, so they were free. The most expensive one was £7.' Shelley saved further by getting creative, designing and making her own floral decorations rather than relying on a pricey florist. 'We picked flowers from a . family friend's garden, just topping them up with a few from the . supermarket. We all made our own bouquets and my bridesmaids did the buttonholes for the men too.' Not-so-pricey party: Shelley's venue came in at a snip for just £400 . Shelley and Paul couldn't afford an overindulgent wedding as the pair had just bought a house together . Despite having stretched to a slightly dearer bar bill, the bride still found ways to cut the costs when it came to drinks. 'I . made flavoured liqueur for the toasts, served in shot glasses from . charity shops. Everyone had a different glass which was lovely, but now . I've got 120 shot glasses I don't know what to do with.' Say Shelley who even managed to sort cheap accommodation for her large group of guests. 'We had 120 . guests at the wedding who didn't have to pay for anything. We bought the . alcohol at wholesale prices from a local supplier, then I arranged for . everyone to be able to camp at the village hall to save them paying for a . pricey hotel.' Shelley's bridesmaids helped her create her budget wedding by skill-sharing . Shelley went for a vintage feel at her country wedding and the experience has inspired her to set up a money-saving crafty blog - Pretty Thrifty . Shelley even got creative when it came to means of paying seeing her waiters work for something other than tips. 'Our catering was done by our friend Kenny, and we used students for waiters - they will work for beer.' For . the dessert Shelley and Paul held a cake-making competition, which was . so successful they still have cake in their freezer now. Shelley says that no one would be able to tell it was a budget wedding unless they had already known . Shelley doesn't think that her wedding suffered at all despite her clever cost-cutting. 'I think unless you knew it was cheap, you wouldn't have guessed.' The experience has even led Shelley to turn her skills and passion into a profession running her own blog called Pretty Thrifty where she shares DIY tutorials, money-saving tips and shares other budget weddings and common sense wedding planning advice.

"Troops have been deployed at American posts across the world ahead of the release of a report into CIA torture tactics which experts warn could spark a wave of violence and terrorism. The 480-page Senate report summarizes a still-classified 6,000 page study about measures used on al Qaeda detainees held in secret across Europe and Asia following the 9/11 attacks. Disturbing passages include descriptions of such techniques as sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces, humiliation and the simulated drowning process known as waterboarding. The report also says the torture failed to produce life-saving intelligence - a conclusion disputed by  CIA director John Brennan. Fears: A report concluding the CIA's tortures were not effective could sparked global violence, it is claimed . Warned: The Obama administration supports the release of a report on CIA torture tactics despite warnings that it could incite violence and murder. The 480-page summary describes disturbing post-9/11 techniques . Its release next week comes despite warnings from intelligence officials and foreign governments of 'the heightened potential that it could stimulate a violent response'. On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged the senator in charge of the report to consider the timing of the release. U.S. intelligence agencies and foreign governments have said privately that the release of the report is likely to cost lives, according to Rep Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is regularly briefed on intelligence assessments. However, Obama administration officials say they still support making it public. Rogers questioned why the report needed to become public, given that the Justice Department investigated and filed no criminal charges. Hesitation:  Intelligence Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said the report could cause deaths abroad . A congressional aide noted that the White House has led negotiations to declassify the report since April, and that both the president and his director of national intelligence have endorsed its release. The government has taken steps to beef up security at American posts around the world, said the aide, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. President Barack Obama has acknowledged: 'We tortured some folks.' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Los Angeles Times in a story published Sunday that 'We have to get this report out.' Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times that the harsh interrogations undermined 'societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of.

"Monica Van De Pitte has won undisclosed damages after settling a discrimination and harassment case with her former employer . A mother-of-two who was 'mooed' at while pumping breast milk at work has won undisclosed damages after settling a discrimination and harassment case with her former employer in Oregon. Monica Van De Pitte also alleges that she found a picture of a cow taped to the door of the supply room at Velocitel, a Lake Oswego-based wireless network company, that she and other mothers were told to use for pumping while at work. Van De Pitte said the harassment was so hurtful that she 'struggled to compose herself enough to express any milk once inside the room', according to her complaint. On joining the company in 2012, Van De Pitte had explained to bosses that she was still nursing her one-year-old son, and would need a private space where she could pump during the work day, reports People magazine. On her first day of work, another nursing mother warned her to keep her breast pump hidden because other employees thought it was 'gross.' Van De Pitte also alleged that some of her colleagues openly bragged about their sex lives.

"Britain could become a ‘second-class’ member of the European Union under plans floated in Brussels yesterday. An influential group of European federalists, who want to see Brussels given even greater powers, is suggesting the UK is relegated to ‘associate member’ status. The move would see Britain remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full EU membership. David Cameron is due to give a major speech on Britain's membership of the EU within weeks . However the UK would lose its veto on . EU policy and would no longer have an EU commissioner or British . representation in the European Parliament. Downing Street was cool on the idea . yesterday, saying that although David Cameron wanted a new relationship . with the EU, based on membership of the single market, he was wary of . adopting the same position as Norway – which although not a full EU . member, as a major trading partner is obliged to adopt many of its . regulations. Former Eropean Council President Jacques Delors has backed the idea of Britain becoming a 'partner' of the EU . Critics condemn the position as being ‘ruled by fax’ from Brussels. But some Eurosceptic Tories welcomed . the suggestion, arguing that it was the first sign that federalist . politicians were starting to take seriously the debate in the UK over . the ever-increasing loss of sovereignty to Brussels. Former Tory Cabinet minister John . Redwood hailed the idea as ‘great news’, adding: ‘It shows that the UK . can negotiate a new relationship with them. 'It shows that many on the Continent . now recognise that the UK cannot join their euro union and needs a . looser relationship with them based on trade.’ But fellow Tory Mark Pritchard said . the proposal did not go far enough. ‘The UK should be free to trade with . Europe but not shackled by the strictures and regulations of the single . market,’ he said. The Union of European Federalists is expected to set out its plan for Britain in a draft EU treaty in the spring. British Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff, who . heads the group, said the proposal would create a new category of . membership to ensure Britain did not leave altogether. ‘If David Cameron proposes a . catalogue of opt-outs, derogations, red lines and rebates for Britain to . pick and choose, then he will strengthen the argument for the creation . of a formal association for the UK,’ he said. ‘The priority on the Continent is to . create a federal system which works, and Britain is seen at present as a . continual impediment.’","Federalists suggest creating 'associate member' status for Britain .

"Save of the tournament? Given the magnitude of the game (a World Cup quarter-final) and the timing (the 94th minute), it’s certainly a contender. A heavy first touch took Karim Benzema wider than he would have liked, but his left-foot strike was still firm and true, the ball arrowing towards the roof of the net at Manuel Neuer’s near-post.

Flinging out his right arm, he brilliantly deflected Benzema’s shot away from goal, to preserve Germany’s narrow 1-0 lead and deflate French hopes as time ticked down to the final whistle. Benzema could not believe it, turning away and looking to the heavens for an answer as to how Germany’s No 1 had swatted away his vicious strike so effortlessly.

"Russia is about to start tapping into a huge source of diamonds that could supply the world market for the next 3,000 years. Scientists estimate there are 'trillions of carats' lying beneath a 35million-year-old asteroid crater in Siberia - more than ten times the global stockpile. The Kremlin has known about the reserves under the 62-mile-wide impact zone since the 1970s. But it has kept it a secret until now because it was already reaping big profits in what back then was a heavily controlled market. In the money: An aerial view of the 35-mile-wide Popigai Astroblem crater in eastern Siberia which contains 'trillions of carats of diamonds' The Soviets had also been producing various artificial diamonds for industry which proved a lucrative enterprise. Government officials finally gave scientists from the nearby Novosibirsk Institute of Geology and Mineralogy permission to lift the lid on the crater's hidden gems in a meeting with journalists over the weekend. The official news agency, ITAR-Tass, said the diamonds at the site, known as Popigai Astroblem, are 'twice as hard' as the usual gemstones, making them ideal for industrial and scientific uses. According to The Christian Science Monitor, . the institute's director, Nikolai Pokhilenko, told the agency that the new . source would cause a radical shake-up in the precious stones market. Lucrative industry: These diamonds, weighing over 50 carats each, were found in Russia's Yakutia mine, which has been rich resource for the country, but nothing compared to the new one . Russia's lucrative diamond industry was fuelled in large part by the colossal mine at Mirny, above, in Yakutia, which produced immense profits for the country. Operations started in the 1950s when scientists discovered a huge diamond deposit at the site, some 4,300km from Moscow. In the following half century, the mine yielded diamonds worth at least $17bn (£10bn). The pit shut down 11 years ago due to dwindling yields and safety issues. The Russian state diamond company Alrosa later began mining underground, but this is far more expensive and came during the financial meltdown. The new source at Popigai Astroblem makes Mirny look like a mere rabbit hole and will bring a much-needed revival to the industry. 'The resources of super-hard diamonds . contained in rocks of the Popigai crypto-explosion structure are by a . factor of ten bigger than the world's all known reserves,' he said. 'We are speaking about trillions of carats. By comparison, present-day known reserves in Yakutia (a Russian mine) are estimated at one billion carats.' The stones at Popigai are known as 'impact diamonds' which result when an object like a meteor strikes an existing diamond deposit. They are also unique, which will make them even more sought-after in high-precision scientific and industrial markets. Pokhilenko said: 'The value of impact diamonds is added by their unusual abrasive features and large grain size. 'This expands significantly the scope of their industrial use and makes them more valuable for industrial purposes.' Diamond production was booming in Russia in 2007 when output reached $1.35billion, 98 per cent of which was exported to Belgium, Israel, South-east Asia and the USA. But the bottom fell out in 2009 when polished diamond production fell to an unprecedented low of US$350 million during the economic crisis. With world markets starting to show signs of resilience, this may explain why Russia has chosen now to reveal its hidden treasure.","Supply under 35million-year-old impact zone is ten times bigger than global reserves .

"Police are investigating racist abuse targeted at Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli on Twitter. In a statement Merseyside Police said: 'We can confirm officers are looking into offensive comments made on Twitter about Mario Balotelli earlier today.' Asked if they were launching an investigation, a Merseyside Police spokesman said 'Yes, we are', adding: 'As far as I am aware there have been no complaints but we have been made aware of it by a number of press inquiries.' Mario Balotelli received racial abuse in response to this tweet poking fun at Manchester United after their 5-3 defeat at Leicester City on Sunday afternoon . The abuse was triggered by Balotelli's reaction to Manchester United's shock defeat by Leicester. The Italy forward, part of the Liverpool side which lost 3-1 at West Ham on Saturday, tweeted: 'Man Utd...LOL' in response to United's 5-3 loss at the King Power Stadium. His tweet was met by a string of racist messages, including one from an account called @CraigSainsbury which read: 'F*** you Mario you f****** n*****. Got eat some bananas and get ebola you dirty monkey.' Balotelli was on the losing side on Saturday as Liverpool went down 3-1 to West Ham . The account from which the tweet was sent subsequently appeared to have been closed. Balotelli has been singled out for racist abuse in the past. He was heckled by Italy supporters during a pre-World Cup training camp in May and was on the receiving end of numerous instances of racist abuse during his time at Inter Milan and, more recently, AC Milan. Balotelli spoke about the abuse directed at him in an interview with GQ magazine in July. 'They aren't used to seeing people who are different, not white, who act not as rebels but normally,' he said. Balotelli is shown a yellow card after a clash with West Ham goalkeeper Adrian during Saturday's match . Balotelli unleashes a shot during the match at Upton Park but couldn't prevent Liverpool losing 3-1 . 'I think what the ignorant people don't like is that people who are different are allowed to act that way. 'These stupid people, they get angry with me, they say horrible things, but I haven't done anything different from other people. 'I have made mistakes, like everyone does, and I have always paid for my mistakes. I think that if I was white maybe some people would still find me irritating or annoying but it wouldn't be the same. Absolutely not. 'Jealousy is a horrible thing, but when this jealousy is towards people who are different from the majority, and who maybe also have more than you, then it becomes anger, it becomes rage, and that's the overt racism.'

"'Hey, is your dad the bass player in INXS?' There it was… the standard question during my weekly social event. As usual, I'd try not to act irritated, slap on a smile and respond with a civil return: 'Yes he is! Garry 'Gary' Beers.' A tedious drone of questions about fame, tours and life-as-­the‐daughter‐of‐a‐D‐list‐rock‐star would follow, most of which I would politely answer before excusing myself to get another wine… or two. I suppose it would be socially inappropriate to tell the truth: that you can't judge a band by its cover. Scroll down for video . Lucy-Mae Beers describes how her father (pictured with her as a child) did not accept it when INXS's fame 'fell to the wayside' Lucy-Mae Beers (left) says her relationship with her father (right) is now conducted via email . Little do my acquaintances at the bar know my contact with my dad is purely through email… less than a dozen per year. My responses (if not silence) are melancholy answers, much like how I respond to sloppy pick-up attempts or family friends who ask the age-old questions such as 'what are you studying?' or 'what are your life goals?' My father is a stranger to me, and does not deserve any personal rhetoric, especially through superficial email. Lucy-Mae Beers (left), with her sister, Matilda, has told how her father is a 'stranger' to her . INXS at a hotel room in Glasgow circa 1988 - from left Michael Hutchence, Kirk Pengilly, Jon Farriss, Tim Farriss, Garry Gary Beers and Andrew Farris. Lucy was raised by her mother Jodie (left) and says she has 'a very fortunate life' However, there was an occasion recently when I did manage to find a heated reaction. A mere few hours after the much‐awaited INXS miniseries: 'Never Tear Us Apart,' aired in Melbourne, I had a lovely egotistical email in my inbox asking:` 'What did you think of Hugh Sheridan playing myself?' Much like the INXS autobiography, the series failed on all accounts to factually explain Garry's personal life – not to mention his Peter Pan syndrome. Lucy and her sister Matilda grew up on a NSW farm with their father when he wasn't touring . Lucy writes that her father Garry has 'five children in three different countries' Lucy writes that her dad is 'now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside' The lovable Hugh Sheridan, playing my father, Garry 'Gary', rationalises sleeping with a backup singer because he was 'lonely' and 'she was beautiful'. There you go folks, it's all justified when you see a beautiful woman and you're lonely on tour, while your pregnant wife was at home with a brand new Harley Davidson as a gift for your return. The series seemed to conveniently leave out the fact that Garry has five children in three different countries and is now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside. Or that the fetus in the opening scene of 'Never Tear Us Apart' - soon to be me, has mostly grown up without a father. Australian rock band INXS first formed in Sydney as The Farriss Brothers in 1977. The band - made up of Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on guitar, Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone, Garry Gary Beers on bass, and main lyricist Michael Hutchence on vocals - was fronted by Hutchence for 20 years. The star, who dated pop singer Kylie Minogue in the 1990s, was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997. INXS, who have sold close to 40 million records worldwide, had their story turned into a TV mini series in 2013. INXS: Never Tear Us Apart aired on the Seven Network in February this year and told of the band's behind the scenes antics. Luke Arnold played Hutchence, Alex Williams played Pengilly, Nicholas Masters played Tim Farriss, Hugh Sheridan played Beers, Ido Drent was Jon Farriss and Andy Ryan was Andrew Farriss. Meanwhile, Damon Herriman played band manager CM Murphy and Samantha Jade was cast as Kylie Minogue. Sure, I had a comfortable childhood. Until the age of thirteen, I was riding in tractor buckets, hunting bandicoots and sitting in the tin dingy on one of our dams - all memories I shared with my dad and our secluded farm in Somersby, NSW, north of Sydney. But as my proverbial father once quoted in their autobiography 'INXS Story to Story': 'The cliché is true: you don't know what you've got until it's gone.' For $45 apiece, you would think he would stick to a more honest motto. When INXS's long‐lived fame fell to the wayside, as it expectedly did, my dad did not accept it easily. For a man who thrived off a diet of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, a settled family lifestyle with us was not appealing in the slightest – he longed to be back on tour fooling around with instruments and women. About the time we sold the farm, everything went south, including my mother, sister and me. My father told us he was packing up and moving to the United States to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house. There were the obvious reassurances (as in any divorce scenario) that the family would remain as close to normal as possible and our father/ daughter relationship would not falter. How could it? He was only moving 12,000 kilometres away. We are a decade on, and I am lucky to receive an email on my birthday – never filled with anything more than petty small talk, attached photos of his two-­year‐old blonde twins and the frequent sign-off of, 'I am your Father' – which is obviously always read in the voice of Darth Vader. Lucy (right) and her sister, Matilda, says her father 'longed to be back on tour fooling around with instruments and women' She explains how her little sister found out about her father's affairs in the INXS autobiography in the school library . Lucy (pictured here on her 21st birthday with a friend) says she is 'fine' because her mother raised her . A multitude of excuses have escaped my dad's mouth in his time, but never the word 'sorry'. It is clear he is not sorry that my little sister found out about his first affair in the INXS autobiography in the school library, or that we were sent to four psychologists to understand why we were upset with him for abandoning us like stray dogs. For the record, I am fine. Thanks to my mother I have a very fortunate life and am working hard to follow my dreams. If I have learnt one thing from my parents though, it's how far apart two people can be.

"Steve Jobs would probably be alive today if he had not put off conventional medical treatment in favour of alternative remedies, a leading cancer doctor has said. Dr Ramzi Amri, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, claims the Apple boss had a mild form of cancer that is rarely fatal and that his choice of treatment 'eventually led to an unnecessarily early death'. Writing on Quora, a forum frequented by Silicon Valley executives, Dr Amri said: 'Let me cut to the chase - Mr Jobs allegedly chose to undergo all sorts of alternative treatment options before opting for conventional medicine. Claims: Steve Jobs, pictured in June, would probably be alive today if he had not put off conventional medical treatment in favour of alternative remedies, a leading cancer expert said . 'Given the circumstances, it seems . sound to assume that Mr Jobs' choice for alternative medicine has . eventually led to an unnecessarily early death.' Mr Jobs died earlier this month due to respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer. He was 56. His death certificate, released by the . Santa Clara County Public Health Department this week, said that Mr . Jobs had a 'metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor' and there would . not be an autopsy. The certificate also stated that Mr . Jobs had the cancer for eight years before his death and that he was . first diagnosed in October 2003. Leading authority: Dr Ramzi Amri is an expert on pancreatic cancer who works at Harvard Medical School . Dr Amri claimed that Mr Jobs . succumbed to the disease more quickly because of his apparent refusal to . embrace 'conventional treatment', especially over the last year, the . period when he visibly began to lose weight. The pancreatic cancer expert wrote: . 'It seems that even during this recurrent phase, Mr Jobs opted to . dedicate his time to Apple as the disease progressed, instead of opting . for chemotherapy or any other conventional treatment.' For nine months between his diagnosis . in 2003 and at least July 2004, Mr Jobs 'decided to employ alternative . methods to treat his pancreatic cancer, hoping to avoid the operation . through a special diet ', according to a 2008 CNN Money article. But the rapid advance of the cancer . caused Mr Jobs to undergo an operation known as a 'Whipple procedure' in . which he had his pancreas and duodenum removed. Dr Amri suggests that this procedure, . which is only undertaken if the cancer is quickly spreading, might not . have been necessary had the Apple CEO pursued conventional medicine . sooner. He wrote: 'The only reason he'd have a . transplant would be that the tumour invaded all major parts of the . liver, which takes a considerable amount of time.' Tributes: A makeshift memorial for Mr Jobs was set-up at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, last week . Dr Amri claims that had Mr Jobs had . the cancer surgically removed immediately after the disease was . diagnosed then he may well have survived with 'no residual . side-effects'. He added that as Mr Jobs had . comparatively mild neuroendocrine tumors, compared to the far more . aggressive pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumours that 95 per cent of . pancreatic cancer sufferers have. He wrote: 'In my series of patients, for many subtypes, the survival rate was as high as 100 per cent over a decade.' Dr Amri said he had the 'profoundest respect for Mr Jobs and his legacy' and did not wish to offend anyone with his comments. But he added: 'I have done 1.5 years . of research on the type of tumour that affected Steve Jobs and have some . strong opinions on his case, not only as an admirer of his work, but . also as a cancer researcher who has the impression that his disease . course has been far from optimal.' When contacted by website Gawker, Dr Amri said: 'I wrote that on a personal title and it's my personal opinion.' It is unclear what 'special diet' Steve Jobs may have adhered to after he was diagnosed with the tumour. He was known to be a pescetarian, so ate fish alongside a vegetarian diet. He may have consulted a dietician after diagnosis because people with pancreatic disease often find it hard to digest fat. Enzymes are often prescribed to help break down food as the pancreas is not working as effectively. Alternative treatments that may relieve symptoms of the disease - such as nausea and pain -  include acupuncture, herbal supplements such as plant-derived enzymes and massage therapy. However, there is no robust medical evidence any of these could actually fight the disease.We know that Mr Jobs didn't follow the controversial 'Gonzalez protocol', which is supposed to treat pancreatic cancer using vegetable juices, 150 daily supplements and having coffee enemas. This is because DrNicholas Gonzalez himself said the Apple-founder had not gone to him. He went on to say had Jobs done so he could have saved his life - although the early termination of a trial comparing chemotherapy to Gonzalez’ protocol would suggest otherwise. Meanwhile Dr David Gorski, from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, is cautious about judging Mr Jobs’ decision to not have immediate treatment. He said on sciencebasedmedicine.org: 'While Jobs certainly didn’t do himself any favours by waiting nine months to undergo definitive surgical therapy of his tumor, it’s very easy to overstate the potential harm that he did to himself by not immediately letting surgeons re-sect his tumor shortly after it was diagnosed eight years ago.' He added: 'There is no information of how large the tumour was upon its discovery or by how much it grew during those nine months. Whatever the case was, the surgery was apparently a success, with complete removal of the tumour.' Mr Jobs originally had an islet cell neuroendocrine tumour, which tend to be slow growing and can be treated even if they spread to the liver.","Apple CEO's choice of alternative treatment 'led to an unnecessarily early death', Dr Ramzi Amir says ."
"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Arizona Sen. John McCain let their hair down on Saturday night at a party in the Hamptons. At the urging of entertainer Jamie Foxx, the Republican politicians got on stage at separate points during Foxx's medley to shake their groove things at a star-studded fundraiser benefiting the Apollo Theater. According to the New York Post's Page Six column, Christie showed off some 'rambunctious gyrating,' and McCain did the robot. 'It's the ones you don't expect. It's the Republicans.

John McCain later did the robot on stage with Foxx . 'Mr. McCain, you want to get up and show us something?' Foxx said, bidding McCain to come to the front . At last year's fundraiser, Foxx coaxed retired four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell to join his on-stage dance party during a cover of Blurred Lines. The annual Apollo in the Hamptons party raises money for the historic Harlem theater. This year's event was held at the East Hampton home of theater board member Ronald Perelman and raised $4 million for the historic Harlem theater, according to Page Six, with tables at the barn party costing between $50,000 - $100,000 . Barbra Streisand, Paul McCartney, Robert DeNiro, Anjelica Huston, Lorne Michaels, Howard Stern, George Stephanopolous, Bill O'Reilly and Harvey Weinstein were among the guests at the fundraiser, which has become a must-attend event for New York's elite class. Christie and his wife attended the event as guests of legendary singer and New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi, who performed at the event along with Gladys Knight, Sting, The Roots and Pharrell Williams, and sat at a table that included DeNiro and Stern.

Including stellar performances from Arsene Wenger on the touchline, Louis Van Gaal and his long-ball dossier and David Moyes trying to speak Spanish, to name but a few, we have looked back over the season so far and come up with the best displays in football. The results are below. And the winner is… . Arsene Wenger pushes Jose Mourinho in the chest during Chelsea's 2-0 win against Arsenal last year . Best technical area tantrum: Arsene Wenger . The clash was more akin to outside a boozer after a heavy Saturday night than on the touchline in one of the biggest fixtures of the calendar. A furious Arsene Wenger stunned everyone when he stormed over and shoved Jose Mourinho in the Stamford Bridge technical area during the first half of Arsenal’ s defeat against Chelsea earlier in the season. It was like years of pent-up rage had finally burst out of the usually serene Frenchman. Fourth official Jon Moss acted as the bouncer and had to step in-between them as the pair squared up to each other. Fourth official Jon Moss acted as the bouncer and had to step in-between the pair . Best press conference rant: Louis van Gaal . You could barely have made it up if you tried. Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal had his ego pricked by West Ham boss Sam Allardyce accusing his team of long-ball tactics and responded by arriving at his next press conference armed with a small dossier complete with pages of blue and red allows explaining why his team, in fact, did not simply lump the ball up the pitch now. It evoked memories of Rafael Benitez’s infamous ‘facts’ rant at then-United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2009. The reaction of the United press officer as she grimaced after handing out the sheets of paper was priceless. Louis van Gaal brandishes his dossier as he attempts to prove that Manchester United are not a long ball side . Van Gaal produced a dossier full of stats in a lively press conference after Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball' jibe . Van Gaal looks unimpressed as the Dutchman tells a packed press conference about his tactics . Best foreign-language film: David Moyes . This was fantastically cringeworthy. David Moyes, newly-appointed as Real Sociedad manager, was asked about his knowledge of their reserve team in a press conference. Moyes had been in Spain for little less than a month and had clearly picked up a bit of the lingo. ‘I know the B-Team, I know some of the players,’ he replied. ‘They have been training with me… uno, dos, tres, cuatro… umm… times… but I’ve not seen them play.’ It’s hard not to watch the video over and over again once you have seen it for the first time. Moyes was widely mocked for it, but hats off for giving the language a go. David Moyes attempted a bit of Spanish during his Real Sociedad press conference . The Sociedad boss said, 'they (B team) have been training with me uno, dos, tres, cuatro times' Best comment: Gary Neville . The chemistry between Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville on Monday Night Football was dynamite from the start. In their first show together, Neville was explaining how hard it is to mark Robin van Persie by comparing him to a burglar in your house who you can’t find. ‘That’s the big problem for centre-backs,’ Neville said. ‘He’s a bit like a burglar in your house you don’t know which room he’s in.’ Carragher hit back with: ‘You’d be under the bed.’ Before Neville floors him by replying: ‘You’d probably be the burglar.’ Carragher almost choked on his water. Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Neville have provided several brilliant moments on Monday Night Football . Best swan dive: Gary Cahill . ‘It’s like something out of Swan Lake,’ was opposition manager Steve Bruce’s take on Gary Cahill’s theatrical dive against Hull. In Chelsea’s 2-0 win back in December Cahill, already on a yellow card, flicked the ball between Tom Huddlestone and David Meyler then followed it through, legs spreadeagled and arms flailing. There was clearly no contact from the Hull players. Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but also failed to book the player. Bravo for that performance. Gary Cahill goes down theatrically in the box for Chelsea during a 2-0 win against Hull City in December . The Chelsea defender was also on a yellow card and risked getting sent off . Chris Foy (second right) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for Cahill . Best supporting actor: Nemanja Matic . As Chelsea have lead the way out-front at the top of the Premier League table everyone’s been talking about Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Oscar, Willian, John Terry, Thibaut Courtois. But it is Nemanja Matic who has been lurking in the shadows, pulling the strings for the side. They’ve only lost one game out of 37 with him in the side, and two out of three without. It is for this statistic alone that he deserves the best supporting actor award. Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic has been one of the star players at Stamford Bridge this season . The Serbian's tough-tackling in front of the Chelsea defence has been key for Jose Mourinho this season . Achievement in make-up and hairstyling: Alex Song .

Top hats, sunglasses, pink trainers, full yellow tracksuits, boots, ties, denim dungarees, long sleeves, short sleeves, no sleeves. He likes accessories and short hair and long hair and dyed hair. It really is hard to keep up with his changing fashions and unusual tastes on a daily basis. Midfield enforcer Alex Song was the obvious choice for Sportsmail's style award .

"Alex Salmond claims an independent Scotland needs an extra 24,000 migrants . Alex Salmond’s independence blueprint aims to attract thousands more immigrants, who could use Scotland as a back door to England. The Scottish National Party say they would ’celebrate’ more people arriving from overseas, reversing what they claim is years of ’depopulation’. Mr Salmond says Scotland needs an extra 24,000 immigrants a year to fill jobs and bankroll the welfare system for ageing Scots, but without tough border controls many could use it as an easy route into England and Wales. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that over the long term Scotland can expect net migration of only 15,500 a year, on current trends. But Mr Salmond’s target of 24,000 means he will have to attract an extra 9,500-a-year, or 190,000 over two decades, by adopting different immigration rules to the rest of the UK. Mr Salmond has admitted the thousands of extra foreign workers are needed to fund the state pension in Scotland. The ratio between pensioners and workers is far worse in Scotland than in the UK as a whole, meaning the cost of funding pensions is borne by fewer people. Pete Wishart, the SNP’s home affairs spokesman, wrote on the party's website: ’We plan a controlled points-based system to support the migration of skilled workers for the benefit of Scotland’s economy. ’An independent Scotland will have an inclusive approach to citizenship and a humane approach to asylum seekers and refugees.’ He complained about ’anti-immigrant rhetoric’ and claimed Scotland currently has to ’lump inappropriate Westminster immigration laws, and we are constantly told that they must become even more restrictive to protect us from the various ‘floods’ of ‘foreigners’ who are to erode our way of life’. Scroll down for video . He added: ’In Scotland, when we see an increase in our population given our history of depopulation, we celebrate the good news. At Westminster it couldn’t make the politicians more miserable.’ The SNP hopes for an independent Scotland to join Common Travel Area (CTA) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The official white paper for independence states: 'We plan to remain part of the CTA which means that there will be no border controls, and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.' An illegal migrant tries to step into a truck going to the UK in the French port of Calais. David Cameron wants to see migration cut - but Alex Salmond insists Scotland needs more labour from abroad . An independent Scotland operating an open border migration strategy would jeopardise an English government's attempt to curb the number of migrants settling . However, Mr Salmond also wants to have a more relaxed immigration policy than that adopted by Westminster, raising the prospect of Scotland being used as a back door route into the UK. The SNP plans to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry to Scotland, and to reintroduce a 'post-study work visa'. It means it would effectively have a more open immigration policy than the rest of the UK, requiring controls at the border. The Prime Minister wants to see net migration cut to 100,000 a year - but is currently running at almost 250,000 . The changes would take effect from 24 March 2016 when Scotland would formally become an independent country. Earlier this year Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael accused the SNP of having 'two fundamentally contradictory propositions'. 'First of all they say we can be part of the CTA, which [would be] an open border between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, and at the same time they say they will have a widely divergent immigration policy. 'You can have either of these things, but you cannot have them both. My challenge to the Scottish Government is to explain which of these it is going to be.' Mr Carmichael said the SNP's immigration proposals are 'radically different' and would be 'incompatible' with the CTA. It means travellers heading south could be forced to pull over and undergo lengthy Calais-style identity checks on 21 roads that cross the border, including the A1, A68 and M74. Rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train leaving from Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen for England, in a similar time-consuming regime to Eurostar journeys from France. A UK Government analysis paper, launched in January, also revealed that lorries and vans could be inspected at the English border if Scotland becomes independent amid fears of alcohol and tobacco smuggling. A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'Existing UK passports can continue to be used as normal until they expire. ’People will travel freely over the border between Scotland and England just as they travel freely from Northern Ireland to Ireland.’","Salmond wants a rise in net migration of 24,000 each year .

"Portuguese winger Nani has left the door open for a return to Manchester United. The 28-year-old spent seven years at Old Trafford having joined in 2007, but was loaned out to his former club Sporting Lisbon this summer. But, after playing in Portugal's 1-0 win over Argentina in Manchester, he insisted that he hasn't yet given up on his career in the Premier League. Nani is open to the idea of returning to Old Trafford after his loan spell at Sporting Lisbon . The Portugal winger has been in impressive form for Sporting Lisbon since rejoining his former side . When asked about his loan spell at Sporting, Nani said: 'It's great. I'm doing well. 'I'm trying to do my best. Things are going well and I hope it continues like that.' Then asked if he thought he would return to United, Nani said: 'Why not? I went out to play more and get to my best, and it is an opportunity. We will see.' Nani has scored five goals in 13 matches so far for the Portuguese side. Nani returned to Old Trafford as he played in Portugal's 1-0 win over Argentina on Tuesday . Nani left Angel di Maria on the floor with this late challenge on the Argentine in the first half . It is a return to form the winger desperately needed after making just 22 league appearances in his final two seasons at United. His last Premier League goal came in September 2012 in a 3-2 defeat by Tottenham and he only registered once in all competitions during the 2013-14 campaign in a 5-0 Champions League win at Bayer Leverkusen. United are still paying Nani's £120,000 per week wages in full and received no loan fee, although it is understood the move was integral to the signing of Argentine defender Marcos Rojo.","Nani currently on loan at Sporting Lisbon from Manchester United .

"It has barely changed in 100 years. But a proposed redesign for the dollar has left Americans up in arms. Instead of the archetypal green and trusty old presidents, the revamped version would feature astronauts, molecules and stars in a series of motifs about innovation. US artist Travis Purrington, who developed the designs for his thesis at Switzerland's Basel School of Design, said: 'One day we Americans will make a significant move in our currency design that reinforces the evolution of our cultural climate...this is where I would start'. Controversial: An American artist has released these images for a proposed redesign of the dollar bill . An aerial view of fields is printed on the proposed $5 bill. The $10 note, according to Purrington, would feature a building or a molecule. New $20 bills would be adorned with a sparkling purple wave. Moving up to $50, we have an astronaut. And the peak of $100 is a mountain range or a starry sky. Each bill is printed with similar font to the euro, with a muted gray border. Muted: The paper notes would feature fields and molecules instead of revered presidents and dollar signs . Dramatic change: Instead of the archetypal green, Purrington would switch the bills to a light gray . Change: The artist, based in Switzerland, says currency should reflect the evolution of our cultural climate . Purrington was inspired by competitions held in European countries that let members of the public suggest new currency designs. 'This idea of such a strong visual change every 20 years or so within a relatively conservative culture deeply rooted in banking lead me to ask, ""Why couldn't the U.S. do this?""' Purrington told Slate. 'And subsequently, 'What would it look like if the U.S. held such a competition?' ' Responding to his critics, Purrington insists the thesis was merely an attempt to inspire new designs. Innovation: Purrington was inspired by American innovation as well as European design features . The big bucks: Wealthy Americans could fill their wallets with mountain ranges and starry skies . Alternative: For those not fond of the nature photographs, he also fashioned scientific designs . How it would work: For his thesis, Purrington demonstrated the ways in which the note could work in practise . 'I simply wanted to introduce the idea that there is still room to grow and innovate in U.S. culture with currency,' he told Slate. 'I'm not declaring that this proposal is a suitable replacement for the USD as much as I'm suggesting that one could exist,' he said. He insists the idea is not ultramodern as it maintains paper form. But he assures his critics that it is 'transitional', not realistic. His inspiration came from European design movements of the 20th century and his observations since moving to Europe. 'I tried to tie the concept of learning, discovery, authorship, and accountability into the notes in a way that was aesthetically conducive to the organisation of information more than I worried if it looked too European or not ""American"" enough,' Purrington wrote. 1914: The first Federal Reserve $100 note is 7.3x3.1 inches with Franklin on the front and figures on the back . 1929: It is reduced to 6.1x2.6 inches, Franklin's portrait is changed, and Independence Hall is put on the back . 1990-1996: In the first revamp in 70 years, the bill was marginally altered, keeping Franklin and the Hall . 1996-2013: Franklin got a close-up six years later, when the numbers were made bold and borders straight . 2013-present: The Liberty Bell was added, as was a 3D security belt, in the latest redesign issued last year .","Artist Travis Purrington said we need currency that reflects evolved culture .

"Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, 25, will leave prison on Friday . Ched Evans will be released from jail as early as tomorrow with no electronic tag and nothing to stop him going back to a lucrative career in football. The news came as his former club raised the prospect of the convicted rapist returning to play for them. Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said ‘one or two discussions’ had been held about re-signing the centre forward, who originally cost the club £3million. Evans was on a reported salary of £20,000 a week before his conviction and remained in-contract for almost six weeks after he was jailed. Last night Sheffield United declined to say whether it had continued to pay his salary during that period. Prison sources have indicated that Evans will walk free from Wymott prison in Lancashire tomorrow. He will remain on licence for the next two and a half years, meaning he must adhere to certain conditions, including holding regular meetings with his probation officer. Evans will also be on the Sex Offender Register indefinitely and cannot change his address without telling the authorities. But prison service insiders revealed the footballer – who continues to protest his innocence – will not be subject to the same electronic monitoring as many other newly freed criminals. That is because Evans has served exactly half his five-year sentence – the normal point for release. Electronic tagging is reserved for convicts released before the halfway point, under the so-called Home Detention Curfew regime. It removes the prospect of Evans returning to the football field wearing an ankle tag. Sources said probation officials could still opt to place a curfew on Evans, but this would be highly unlikely to prevent him taking part in competitive football matches or training. Restrictions on employment are applied only if the job would pose a danger to the public. The most likely issue would be if he joined a team based abroad or that had fixtures overseas, as he might need permission to leave the country. It could also have an impact on his international career if he resumes playing for Wales. Evans has been an inmate at Wymott Prison in Lancashire, a specialist Category C jail for sex offenders . Evans has been supported throughout by his longterm girlfriend, businessman's daughter, Natasha Massey . If Evans did return to League One team Sheffield United, it would be against the wishes of more than 145,000 people who have signed a change.org petition against him returning. Fewer than 5,000 have signed a counter petition saying they wanted him back at the club. Despite the furore, United manager Clough yesterday said a return remained possible – though he stopped short of endorsing such a move. He told BBC Radio Sheffield: ‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it. It is above a football level. If he comes back then we [the coaching staff] will decide whether to play him or not.’ Clough added: ‘It’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place – that’s theirs.’ Judy Finnigan caused a storm when she said Evans' crime 'was not violent' and that the victims was drunk . International: Evans may also be invited back to play for Wales - the team will take on Belgium next month . Upon his conviction, Evans was not sacked by the club. He was jailed on April 20, 2012, and on May 30 of that year the club said it would not be renewing his contract. Asked whether he was still paid during this time, a spokesman said last night: ‘We have no comment to make on that.’ Gordon Taylor, of the Professional Footballers’ Association, has argued that Evans should be allowed to return to the game, saying: ‘I didn’t know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can’t do anything.’ But Katie Russell, the director of communications for Rape Crisis England and Wales, has argued that barring Evans from the game would ‘send a strong message condemning sexual violence against women’.","The 25-year-old former Sheffield United striker will leave prison on Friday .

"Rapist: More than 145,000 have signed a petition opposing Ched Evans resuming his playing career . Signatures have flooded in on a petition calling for Ched Evans to be stopped from playing football for his former club following Judy Finnigan’s controversial comments about his conviction. At the weekend the online campaign had attracted 90,000 supporters. But by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to ‘refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player’. It argues: ‘To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.’ However, the club’s manager Nigel Clough yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow – something many fans strongly support. ‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it,’ he told BBC Radio Sheffield. Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012. Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor said last week that Evans should be allowed to continue his career on his release. But former Sports Minister Richard Caborn, a lifelong Sheffield United fan, told the Daily Mail that Evans should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal, adding: ‘People should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong.’ At the time, Evans was a 22-year-old Welsh international striker with Sheffield United. Great things had been predicted of him when he was playing in the youth ranks at Manchester City . Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted. Among material it makes public is CCTV footage showing the 19-year-old, her face obscured, arriving at the hotel shortly before the rape took place in May 2011. It is accompanied by a commentary alleging that the footage clashes with her version of events – including her ability to walk in high-heeled shoes despite saying she had been too drunk to remember what happened.","Number  signing jumped after Judy Finnigan's controversial comments .

"Ex-spy: Anna Chapman has become a celebrity in Russia since she was deported there four years ago . Former intelligence agent Anna Chapman was told by Russian spy chiefs to seduce Edward Snowden, a defector claimed today. Ex-KGB agent Boris Karpichkov alleged that a plan was launched for Chapman, 32, to keep US whistleblower Snowden, 31, in Moscow - so the Russians could continue to question him. The two were said to have met just once - but Chapman proposed  in a tweet in July 2013. Mr Karpichkov told journalist Nigel Nelson for the Sunday People: ‘If Snowden had accepted he would have a right to Russian citizenship. That would lock him in Russia. As a citizen he’d need permission to leave.’ Mr Karpichkov - who fled to Britain after 15 years as a KGB agent, but is still in contact with sources in Moscow - said Snowden became ‘concerned about what the consequences would be’ of being attached to Chapman. Former Conservative MP Rupert Allason, better-known now as spy writer Nigel West, said that Chapman was ‘sophisticated enough to live with an American’. Mr Allason told the Sunday People: ‘There aren’t many of those in the FSB (formerly the KGB). She would be prepared to use her obvious gifts.’ In September 2013, Chapman refused to answer questions about the proposal in a bizarre five-minute interview with NBC, and walked out after she was asked about the tweet. She has never publicly commented on it. Chapman, the daughter of a senior KGB agent, was arrested in 2010 with nine others, accused of working for a spy ring for Russia's external intelligence agency. Edward Snowden is wanted in the US after leaking classified details of government surveillance programmes . Anna Chapman was arrested in 2010 with nine others, accused of working for a spy ring for Russia's external intelligence agency. She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was deported back to Russia in 2010 . She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was deported back to Russia in July 2010 as part of a prisoner swap. She has since become a celebrity in Russia. She married British public schoolboy Alex Chapman in 2002 and the pair moved to London, but divorced in 2006. When unmasked as a Russian agent, she was stripped of her British passport. Since returning to Moscow, Chapman - dubbed a 'femme fatale' - has carved out a lucrative career as a TV presenter, model and owner of a fashion brand. Question: They were said to have met just once - but Chapman proposed to Snowden in a tweet in July 2013 . In the spotlight: Since returning to Moscow, Chapman has carved out a lucrative career as a TV presenter, model and owner of a fashion brand . Snowden left his long-term girlfriend Lindsay Mills in Hawaii when he fled the US, and was granted asylum in Moscow in August 2013, after six weeks of waiting at the city's airport. In the summer Snowden was reunited in Russia with Miss Mills, a pole-dancer. The pair were pictured together on a theatre date in Moscow. Snowden now has a three-year residency permit. He is wanted in the US after leaking classified details of government surveillance programmes. His critics view him as a traitor, while supporters see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties.","Ex-KGB agent Boris Karpichkov makes claims over proposal background .

"Toxic nuclear and industrial waste, dumped illegally by the Neapolitan mafia, is responsible for a surge in cancers in southern Italy, it is feared. The Italian Senate is investigating a link between buried pollutants and a rise of almost 50 per cent in tumours found in the inhabitants of several towns around Naples. In classified documents from 1997, only now released to the public, a mafia kingpin warned authorities that the poison in the ground would kill everyone 'within two decades'. Cancer: Naples is the capital of Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy . Camorra chief Francesco Schiavone, once the world’s number one mafia fugitive, said: ‘The inhabitants are all at risk of dying from cancer within twenty years. ‘In towns like Casapesenna, Casal di Principe, Castel Volturno, and so on, they have, perhaps, twenty years to live. In fact I don’t think anyone will survive.' Doctors first noticed that cancers in towns around Naples were on the rise in the 1990s. But since that time they have increased by 40 per cent in women and 47 per cent in men. The illegal trafficking of hazardous waste came to light in 1997 when Francesco’s cousin, Carmine Schiavone, was overcome by guilt at the environmental damage he and others were inflicting, and decided to turn super-grass. Francesco Schiavone was arrested and eventually given a life sentence for a string of murders. In secret out-of-court testimony he told lawyers how the Casalesi clan ran ‘a military style operation’ dumping millions of tonnes of waste on farmland, in caves, in quarries and even on the edge of towns. Toxic waste: Several areas around Naples are affected . The mafia family also disposed of contaminated waste in Lake Lucrino and all along the coast. Operatives were equipped with real police and carabinieri uniforms, as well as firearms, and the clans raked in huge profits of up to 600 million of the old lire (£200,000) a month. The industry became an officially clan-sanctioned ‘business’ in 1990 but had been going on long before. Nuclear sludge, brought in on trucks from plants in Germany, was dumped in landfills, Schiavone said. The trucks would unload waste at night before earth was thrown over with a JCB. He said: ‘I know that some is on land where buffalo live today, and on which no grass grows’ The cost of a clean up would run into billions, he said, describing several sites in the suburbs of Naples. Schiavone revealed: ‘We buried 520 drums of toxic waste in a specially dug quarry near the town of Pure Villaricca. But we also did it in very populated places, outside towns- at Casal di Principe behind the sports field at the edge of the motorway.’ He added: ‘We disposed of 70 or 80 trucks from the north, millions and millions of tonnes. ‘To clean it up it would cost the entire Italian budget for a year I think.’ The lower house in the Italian Parliament had elected to make the documents public in the interests of transparency.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on Philippe Coutinho following his side's 2-1 FA Cup victory against Bolton by insisting the Brazilian playmaker has the potential to follow in the same footsteps as Luis Suarez. The Reds staged a grandstand finish against 10-man Bolton, with Coutinho scoring a stunning 20-yarder in stoppage time to  set up a fifth round trip to Crystal Palace. Coutinho's strike was certainly fit to win the game and was an appropriate way to mark the signing of his new contract, which keeps him at Anfield until 2020. Philippe Coutinho's 90th minute strike gave Liverpool a 2-1 lead against Bolton on Wednesday night . The Brazilian midfielder points to the sky after his goal put Liverpool into the FA Cup fifth round . Brendan Rodgers believes Coutinho has the potential to follow in Luis Suarez's footsteps . Coutinho - 11 goals in 82 appearances . Suarez - 82 goals in 133 appearances . Rodgers felt compelled to compare the Brazilian to his former striker Suarez. 'You would pay money to watch the kid,' said Rodgers. 'He is a great role model for lots of technical players in this country. He will become world class in the next couple of years. 'Luis Suarez grew and grew in this team and I can see Coutinho falling in the same way, although he might not be as prolific. 'Signing a new deal shows he is really committed to Liverpool and his development.' Liverpool lost 3-1 at Palace in the Premier League earlier this season and Rodgers said: 'We didn't play anywhere near our level but that was the lowest moment of the season in terms of performance levels. 'We go back there in a different frame of mind and with big confidence.' Raheem Sterling's 86th-minute strike had levelled Eidur Gudjohnsen's penalty on Wednesday night. Coutinho recently put pen to paper to sign new long-term contract at the club . The Brazilian playmaker Coutinho played alongside Suarez before the Uruguayan's move to Barcelona . Rodgers applauds the Liverpool fans, and was also full of praise for his side's improvements . Bolton manager Neil Lennon may be the subject of FA disciplinary action after he called referee Roger East's performance 'rubbish'. But Rodgers was adamant that Liverpool deserved the victory. 'At 1-0 I expected us to win it,' he said. 'The confidence at the moment is ver high. It was never a penalty. Our composure after that was very good. We scored two, could have had many more. 'We have got a great habit at the minute, which is winning games. You can't question the character. They have shown a real strong mentality in my time here. We needed to arrest the momentum which was going the other way after that Palace game. 'We did that by taking seven points out of nine. It is pleasing because you can see the confidence. The players were magnificent. I have to give them huge credit. The quality of goals was outstanding.' Lennon was furious with match official East, saying: 'I thought he was rubbish. The first booking Neil Danns gets isn't a booking. He doesn't make contact. I thought he spoiled a very good game. I understand the sending off because it is a second yellow card but the first one isn't.' Liverpool's best chance in the first half came when Raheem Sterling hit the Bolton post with a curling effort .

"Unhappy: Denise Lindsay, 45,  of Clapham, south London, complained about the use of the word . A chef who apologised after he mentioned the old ‘golliwog’ label on Robertson’s jam in front of a black colleague was still guilty of harassment, top appeal judges ruled today. Mark McAleese used the word when his back was turned to Denise Lindsay in a discussion about food labelling in the kitchens of the London School of Economics halls of residence, in Bloomsbury, where they both worked. After 45-year-old Miss Lindsay complained, an employment tribunal described Mr McAleese’s use of the words ‘golliwog’ and ‘golliwog jam’ as ‘unwanted’ and ruled that what he said amounted to ‘an isolated act of harassment’. That was despite the fact that Mr McAleese had swiftly apologised to his co-worker after the incident in January 2009 and said he had not intended to violate Miss Lindsay’s dignity or to ‘create an intimidating, hostile, degrading or offensive environment for her’. Three Appeal Court judges today upheld the tribunal’s harassment finding, even though Mr McAleese had spoken with his back turned, in a quiet voice and his comments were not aimed at Miss Lindsay, of Clapham, south London. Her legal team had argued that the use of the term was ‘inherently racist, whatever the context’. And Lord Justice Floyd agreed that the word ‘gollywog’ was ‘obviously racist and offensive’ if used in the presence of a black person. The most important issue in the case, he said, was ‘why did Mr McAleese say what he did? Was it because he knew he had used the word on the grounds of her race, but dressed it up as innocent chat? Or was it for some other reason?’ Brand: Mark McAleese said a conversation turned to Robertson's jam and the fact that its label had changed . Mr McAleese had himself recognised that the term would be ‘down right offensive’ if aimed at a black person, and the judge said he had ‘not been truthful’ in repeatedly denying, including before the tribunal, that he had in fact uttered the word. Lord Justice Floyd, sitting with Lords Justice Moore-Bick and Christopher Clarke, upheld the tribunal’s finding that the ‘the most likely explanation was that Mr McAleese had used the word because of Miss Lindsay’s race’. He added: ‘His failure to be truthful about the fact that he had used the term at all, coupled with his own subjective view that any use of the term in the presence of a black person would be offensive, formed an adequate evidential basis for the tribunal’s finding that the words had been used by him on the grounds of race.’ However, Miss Lindsay was told that she had lodged her complaint too late and that it would not be ‘just and equitable’ to allow her to continue with her compensation claim against the LSE. The effect Mr McAleese’s comments had on her, whilst upsetting, was ‘evidently short-lived’. He had quickly apologised and matters seemed to have settled down in the kitchen before Miss Lindsay lodged a formal grievance five months later. Scene: Mr McAleese used the word when his back was turned to Miss Lindsay during a discussion about food labelling in the kitchens of the LSE halls of residence (pictured), in Bloomsbury, where they both worked . Mr McAleese’s account was that he and Miss Lindsay had their backs turned to each other as they innocently discussed food and packaging. After chatting about Walkers crisps, he said the conversation turned to Robertson’s jam and the fact that its label had changed. 'White people don’t get called golliwogs. The word is an overtly racial comment. ‘Golliwog cannot be interpreted in any other way' Daniel Matovu, for Miss Lindsay . Daniel Matovu, for Miss Lindsay, had earlier told the court: ‘White people don’t get called golliwogs. The word is an overtly racial comment. ‘Golliwog cannot be interpreted in any other way. What the authorities make clear is that, when something is inherently discriminatory and clearly has racial overtones, there is no further debate.’ However, the LSE’s barrister, Shaen Catherwood, insisted that Mr McAleese’s use of the word - spoken quietly and quickly - did not come anywhere close to racial harassment. ‘I say it is unsatisfactory that somebody should be labelled with a finding of harassment on racial grounds when the actual context in which the word was used was innocent and inoffensive,’ he told the court. The Appeal Court judges dismissed Miss Lindsay’s challenge to the dismissal of her case on grounds of delay. Her other claims of race discrimination had earlier been rejected by the tribunal, although she still has a victimisation claim against the LSE extant.","Mark McAleese used word when his back was turned to Denise Lindsay .

"Amazon has come under fire for selling a fancy dress costume of a golliwog. The online shopping giant has not removed the outfit from sale despite receiving a flood of complaints from furious customers. Many commenters have denounced the costume as 'racist' because of its links with outdated stereotypes about black people. 'Racist': This golliwog outfit is currently on sale on Amazon through a third-party company . The outfit is advertised as an 'Adult Golly Fancy Dress Costume' and is on sale for £39.99. It is being listed on Amazon by Orion Costumes, an independent company which also sells 'sexy' outfits such as a schoolgirl costume. The golly kit includes a mask and wig as well as striped trousers, a tailcoat and an oversized bow tie. The official product description reads: 'Our amazing Golly Costume is a fantastic recreation of the popular rag doll character and is ideal if you are looking for a memorable outfit!' A number of angry browsers have left one-star reviews on the Amazon website, calling for the outfit to be removed from sale. On sale: Amazon has refused to remove the outfit despite receiving a flood of complaints . Anger: Just one of the furious complaints left by customers on Amazon's website . Michelle Coke wrote: 'This should not be an item for sale and should be removed immediately. This is offensive and show lack of sensitivity on the part of Amazon.' Another user said: 'This is repulsive and offensive. Amazon take this down! Did you go back in a time machine to the 1940s?' And a third added: 'This costume is ridiculous. I don't need to say any more than that, I can't believe it's even on sale really.' Anti-racism campaigners have also called on Amazon to apologise for the outfit. Hellen Pattison of Youth Against Racism told The Sun: 'Yet again Amazon has shown they will sell highly offensive and demeaning products, as long as they can make a profit.' Iconic: The golliwog was once a much-loved children's toy which appeared on jars of Robertson's jam but has since become tainted by the use of the term as a racist slur . Withdrawn: This 'zombie Jimmy Savile' outfit was taken down from Amazon last month . The outfit is still available on the site, which is the world's dominant online retailer, and Amazon has refused to comment on the controversy. The golliwog was long treasured a popular children's book character and famously appeared on jars of Robertson's jam for more than 90 years. However, after it became a term of abuse aimed at black people it has become increasingly taboo. Nonetheless, dozens of golly-themed products are available on Amazon, including dolls, clocks and keyrings.

"Cllr Dawn Barnett was found guilty of bringing Brighton and Hove City Council into disrepute with her remarks . A Conservative councillor is to undergo diversity training after offending ethnic minorities with her claim that golliwogs are 'nostalgic, not racist'. Cllr Dawn Barnett was found guilty of bringing Brighton and Hove City Council into disrepute with her remarks. In August, Cllr Barnett said she thought golliwogs were 'nostalgic, not racist'. And she dismissed complaints against a city homestore selling golliwog placemats as 'political correctness gone too far'. However, a panel of three fellow councillors cleared the 72-year-old of failing to treat others with respect and breaching the Equalities Act. The board - sitting in a closed hearing on Thursday - also recommended that all councillors should undergo diversity training in the future. Her comments provoked four 'separate but similar' complaints from three people and the council's Black and Minority Ethnic Workers' Forum. One complainant asked for an apology from Cllr Barnett while another said they wished to see her expelled from the council. Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Barnett said the issue should never have progressed to a hearing and was a waste of taxpayers' money. Cllr Barnett dismissed complaints against a city homestore selling golliwog placemats as 'political correctness gone too far' The hearing was originally scheduled for November 28 but was dramatically postponed when Cllr Barnett fell down a flight of stairs on her way to the meeting. She was carried to hospital wearing a neck brace and on a spinal board. Yesterday's hearing - lasting more than five-and-a-half hours - was also attended by a number of senior council staff. The golliwog was a character in children's books in the late 19th century and usually depicted as a friendly rag doll. Florence Kate Upton struck upon the character and invented the name which at the time had no negative connotations. In 1894 the first story, The Adventures Of Two Dutch Dolls And A Golliwogg, the doll was initially described as 'a horrid sight, the blackest gnome', but turns out in fact to be good, loveable and brave, with a 'kind face'. However, the word 'wog' began to be used as a derogatory word for black people. First popularised during World War II, it was uttered by some British soldiers as a slur against North Africans. By the 1960s, both the use of the term 'golliwog' and the dolls themselves were under increasing attack. In 1983, the Greater London Council banned Robertson's products from its jurisdiction, and in 1988 the character was no longer used in TV advertising. They included a monitoring officer, head of complaints, and head of democratic services. A council report on the proceedings will not be made available to the public until early next week. Cllr Barnett, of the Hangleton and Knoll ward, said: 'They threw out the two most serious charges but said I was guilty of breaching the code of conduct. 'I am pleased they have let me off on the other two serious charges but very disappointed they have judged I broke the code of conduct. 'I don't think it should have got this far, it was a waste of taxpayers' money and officers' time. 'I apologised to anyone who was upset by my comments and that should have been the end of it. 'I understand the reasons why they had it behind closed doors but there were a lot of upset people outside the meeting that were angry it wasn't held in public.' A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said the incident highlighted the 'need for training and awareness raising among all councillors on equalities issues'. This will form part of member development in the future, she added.","Cllr Dawn Barnett was found guilty of bringing Brighton and Hove City Council into disrepute with her remarks .

"The summer transfer window wouldn't be the summer transfer window without Real Madrid flexing their financial muscle. Last year they broke the world transfer record to sign Gareth Bale from Tottenham for £85.3million. Fast forward 12 months and more global stars are joining. They have signed World Cup winner Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £24m and are trying to complete a £63m deal for world football's new kid on the block James Rodriguez. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez celebrating winning the Golden Boot . Welcome to the European champions: Carlo Ancelotti shakes hands with Toni Kroos . No 1 target: Real are looking to tie up a deal for James Rodriguez now Kroos has arrived . Once Rodriguez is secured, his compatriot and Monaco team-mate Radamel Falcao is expected to follow. As if their Champions League winning squad wasn't strong enough already. But just how will Carlo Ancelotti pick his strongest starting XI next season with so much world class talent at his disposal? Here, Sportsmail has a stab at doing the Italian's job for him. Not bad, huh? Even with Barcelona's front line of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, Ancelotti's new look side has the potential to go all the way domestically and Europe again next season. For £20m, Kroos is perhaps the most value for money signing of the summer, his displays in Brazil are testament to that. The midfielder is the heir to Xabi Alonso's central midfield throne, though the Spain maestro can still expect ample playing time next season. And if Real's move for Monaco star Rodriguez comes off, then their front four will be one of the most feared on the continent. His displays in the No 10 role for a Colombia were a highlight of the World Cup. And who knows how far the Colombians would have gone if their main goal-poacher Falcao were fit. So to combine that with the attacking prowess of Cristano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale then you've only one outcome: goals. VIDEO Real closing in on Rodriguez . Prolific: Radamel Falcao scored 52 goals in 68 games during two seasons in La Liga with Atletico Madrid . Welsh wizard: World record signing Gareth Bale enjoyed a fine first season at Real Madrid in 2013-14 . The world's greatest: Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo won the 2013 Ballon d'Or . And if for whatever reason that starting XI doesn't work out then Ancelotti needn't worry too much. To replace Diego Lopez in goal read Iker Casillas, to step in for Sergio Ramos or Pepe in central defence you have Raphael Varane, if the central midfield isn't quite working perhaps Alonso, Isco or Sami Khedira could do a better job, and there's always Karim Benzema to step in up front. It's a tough life being Ancelotti. Spoilt for choice: Real manager Carlo Ancelotti will have an embarrassment of riches at his disposal .","Toni Kroos has signed for Real Madrid in £24million deal .

"As career moves go, they don’t come any more extreme than swapping Barnsley for Panathinaikos. From Yorkshire grit to Ancient Greece. Sitting in his seaside apartment in the upmarket Athens suburb of Glyfada, Luke Steele has had time to reflect on the dramatic switch that took him to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium in the summer after six years at Oakwell. ‘It’s the biggest change I’ve had in my life,’ says the former Manchester United and England Under 21 goalkeeper ‘There’s all the culture surrounding the place — and I live by the sea, so it’s drastically different from the streets of Yorkshire. People ask how I’ve adapted but it’s not like I’ve gone to Mars. Goalkeeper Luke Steele has joined Greek side Panathinaikos after a six-year stint with Barnsley . Steele on moving: ‘I didn’t have any regrets staying that long but I needed to be put out of my comfort zone' Born: England, September 24, 1984 (30) 1999-2002: Peterborough (2 lg apps) 2002-2006: Manchester United (0) 2004-2005: Coventry City (loan) (32) 2006-2006: Coventry City (loan) (0) 2006-2008: West Brom (2) 2006-2007: Coventy City (loan) (5) 2008-2014: Barnsley (209) 2014-NOW: Panathinaikos (1) ‘I didn’t have any regrets staying that long but I needed to be put out of my comfort zone. This is a new life and a new beginning. The adventure really appealed to me, being thrown in the deep end. ‘It’s a short career and I’m just about at the halfway point. I really want to achieve things in football, not just plod along and see it out. ‘If I really wanted to kick on and reach the places I’ve dreamed of, like playing in the top leagues or in Europe, I needed to change completely.’ A clause in his contract meant that Steele could leave on a free transfer when Barnsley were relegated last season. There were two opportunities to join bigger Championship clubs but the 30-year-old had caught the eye of Nikos Dabizas, the former Newcastle defender who is now technical director at Panathinaikos. The 20-time Greek champions were offering a two-year contract and the lure of European football. ‘He said he wanted to meet me face to face in London,’ recalls Steele. ‘It’s a Greek thing. They like to look you in the eye and make sure you’re up to the job. Apparently I passed the eye test.’ The Peterborough-born keeper has not been afraid to make bold decisions before. Steele played under Fabien Barthez and Edwin van der Sar during four years at United, and was an FA Youth Cup winner in 2003, but he left Old Trafford for West Brom in search of first-team football. ‘I didn’t expect to be here,’ says Steele, who shot to prominence when he starred in Barnsley’s FA Cup wins over Liverpool and Chelsea in 2008 after signing from Albion on loan. Jamie Vardy of Leicester is denied by Barnsley goalkeeper Steele during their Championship match . ‘I didn’t set out to sign for Panathinaikos, but I made the decision pretty quickly. ‘I thought that it wouldn’t happen but the move was agreed at 10pm and I was on the 8.30am flight from Manchester the next day. ‘This felt right, especially the attraction of playing in Champions League qualifiers. We ended up in the Europa League but European football was huge for me.’ Steele admits he was a little naive about the move but was given a crash course in the passion of Greek fans during a pre-season ‘friendly’ at lower league Panegialios. ‘I couldn’t believe it,’ he says. ‘I thought there would be two or three hundred and there were thousands. It was like they’d just been let out of prison for their first football match. I absolutely loved it. ‘There were fireworks and smoke bombs — and this was a pre-season friendly. I came on in the second half and I was jumping around because firecrackers were going off behind me. ‘That got blown out of the water when I went to the Panathinaikos stadium and saw our fans for the first time. You’ve got Gate 13 who are the fanatics. They’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees. The noise, the smoke bombs, the fireworks. It’s absolutely electric.’ That was Steele’s league debut, a 1-0 win over Niki Volos in September. Four days earlier, he played his first competitive game on his 30th birthday in a Greek Cup-tie against Olympiacos Volos, not to be confused with his club’s bitter Athens rivals Olympiacos. Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez celebrates scoring against Barnsley goalkeeper Steele at the Etihad . James Vaughan of Crystal Palace sees his close range header saved by goalkeeper Steele of Barnsley . Games between the teams are known rather dramatically as the Derby of Eternal Enemies, and the exaggeration is only slight. This is one of the most hostile encounters in football. Away supporters are now banned but that did not stop Panathinaikos fans setting fire to their own stadium two years ago. In March, their coach Yannis Anastasiou was floored by an object thrown by the home fans at Olympiacos’ Karaiskakis Stadium — which hosts the first derby of this season a week on Sunday. ‘I’ve been told it’s on a different planet,’ says Steele. ‘I’ve seen some crazy footage and heard of police getting involved in the dressing rooms. I’ve played in big games but this might be a bit different.’ Steele believes his Greek adventure could open the door to a move to the Premier League, and has not abandoned hope of a senior England call-up after representing his country at every age-group. ‘I’ll be 31 by the time I finish here and, being realistic, I can play for 10 more years,’ he says. ‘I never think my chance has gone.’ Meantime, will he be taking in much of Ancient Greece? ‘My advice is go to the Acropolis but go once. That’s enough. It’s one of the oldest buildings in the world and I did love each of the 45 minutes I was there, but I’m not going to be getting a degree in Greek history. ‘For me, it’s pretty much sand, sea, crazy football fans and Panathinaikos.’ A younger Steele pictured during an FA Cup semi-final loss at Wembley with Barnsley .","Luke Steele spent six years with Barnsley, making 209 league appearances .

"A 'healthy' toddler died from a rare and deadly heart infection which spread so rapidly it killed him in just 24 hours. Tamael Cabe Robertson, who had been complaining of sickness and pain, was in bed when he became severely ill - just days after seeing his family GP. He was taken to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital by his parents Cassie Robertson and Neil Richmond but his condition deteriorated. The two-year-old passed away nine hours later as doctors battled to save him. Tamael Cabe Robertson, two, died of infective endocarditis - a rare heart infection - just hours after falling ill . Tamael was taken to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital after complaining of pain and sickness and doctors fought to save him but he died just nine hours later . A post mortem examination showed the 'happy, cheerful' child died on July 1 last year from septicaemia and multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis - a condition so rare and rapid that doctors have found it difficult to investigate. After an inquest on January 31, Ms Robertson, from Urmston, Manchester, said: ‘It's a relief in a way to have a final answer and to know for definite what took him - but it doesn't make it any easier. ‘It's so rare. Why did it have to happen to our little boy? ‘On Saturday he was a seemingly well, very happy, laughing little boy, enjoying the fresh air, sunshine and his new boots. ‘On Sunday he was suddenly a fatally ill little boy and then gone from us. At just two years old, he was denied the wonder and experiences of the life laid out before him and his parents were denied ever seeing him grow into the wonderful young man we knew he would be. Life is so very, very cruel sometimes.’ Earlier, the Manchester hearing was told Tamael was a normal baby who had learnt to count and read and loved nothing more than playing with his trucks. An inquest into Tamael's death concluded that he died of natural causes . He was healthy until he joined a playgroup in December 2012 when he began to pick up viruses and infections - but nothing more than a normal child of his age. Miss Robertson, 43, added: ‘He was up to ten with his numbers and doing well with his letters. He was such a bright, cheerful and happy child. Infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics. After someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. It is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers. The infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life-threatening. Most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body. People who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles. In the UK, endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year. It is most common in people with heart valve problems, have had heart valve surgery, have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system. Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, having aches and pains, tiredness, fever and loss of appetite. ‘On June 10 last year he became feverish. We thought it was a virus and gave him fluids. After a week he became cold and the doctor found he had an infection in his throat but as far as we were aware tests and records were normal. ‘He was prescribed medication which helped and he began to eat again. On June 17 he began shrieking as if in pain and he became cold and clammy. We took him to see the GP but by the time we saw the doctor his condition had improved.’ A rash was then found on Tamael's chest and he was prescribed antibiotics. She added: ‘By the end of the week on tablets he had improved and I wasn't worried at that stage as he had responded. He was still a bit under the weather so we decided not to send him to playgroup. ‘He had been coughing though so we took shifts to stay up and make sure he wasn't coughing in case he vomited.’ By Saturday June 29 Tamael was back to his normal self so his parents took him on a shopping trip. ‘About 5.30pm he asked to go to bed,’ Miss Robertson said. ‘It was early for him but he had a busy day. He woke up at 2am and asked for some milk and drank most of it. 'At 6am he woke up again and was loud and crying and wanted to get up. ‘Neil took him down and he went on the computer and after about 10 or 15 minutes he went back to bed. ‘About 10 minutes later he was crying due to stomach pain. The pain seemed to be coming in waves. ‘He also vomited some yellow fluid. I took him to the walk-in centre and the observations seemed alright. We took him home and got him some pain relief. ‘He still had some pain and vomiting but by 12 midnight he wasn't himself. While in the car to the hospital he just wanted to drift off. ‘We kept waking him up and he kept saying “sorry”. We got to hospital and it was clear something was wrong. His condition deteriorated and he passed away.’ A post mortem examination showed the 'happy, cheerful' child died on July 1 last year from septicaemia and multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis . Tamael's mother, Cassie, said: 'Life is so very, very cruel sometimes.' Tamael is pictured with his mother and his father, Neil Richmond . Doctors battled to save Tamael when he was admitted to the emergency department where his symptoms suggested septic shock. He was given intravenous medication but didn't respond so was put on life support. Dr Robert Yates, who tended to him in his final moments, said: ‘An echocardiogram suggested a poor heart and despite large doses of medication he suffered a cardiac arrest and died at 9.30am with his parents. The clinical assessment was he had overwhelming sepsis.’ Dr Stefania Bitetti, a consultant at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital who conducted the post mortem examination said the infective endocarditis had severely inflamed Tamael's heart. ‘There are few theories as to how it comes about,’ she added. ‘It is very rare and extremely rare in children. There are mechanisms by which bacteria can enter the blood. The inquest into Tamael's death heard his condition was extremely hard to treat as the infection is very rare and was very aggressive . Miss Robertson said: 'It's a relief in a way to have a final answer and to know for definite what took him but it doesn't make it any easier' ‘It's often a case associated with congenital heart defects. If he was born with an abnormal heart it is also more predisposed but that was not the case here. ‘There could be some underlying immune problem but it's not possible to determine that after death. It spreads so rapidly that it's very hard to investigate this condition. ‘It's an infection of the heart so the symptoms aren't as clear as a chest infection, for instance.’ Recording a verdict of death by natural causes coroner Sara Lewis told Tamael's parents: ‘I offer my sincere condolences for your loss. It was clearly a very shocking and distressing event that happened very quickly. ‘It's so difficult to understand what happened because it is so extremely rare.’","Tamael Cabe Robertson died of infective endocarditis on July 1, 2013 .

"Brain-wave sensing machines have been used to ‘telepathically’ control everything from real-life helicopters to characters in a computer game. Now the technology has gone a step further by allowing someone in India to send an email to his colleague in France using nothing but the power of his mind. The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) headsets to record electrical activity from neurons firing in the brain, and convert the words ‘hola’ and ‘ciao’ into binary. The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) headsets which recorded electrical activity from neurons firing in the brain to convert the words ‘hola’ and ‘ciao’ into binary. In EEG, electrical currents in the brain are linked with different thoughts that are then fed into a computer interface . In EEG, electrical currents in the brain are linked with different thoughts that are then fed into a computer interface. This computer analyses the signal and controls an action. In the latest study, published in Plos One, researchers decided to replace the computer interface with another brain to receive the signals. In the initial test, the greeting was sent from a volunteer in Thiruvananthapuram, India to Strasbourg, France. There, a computer translated the message and then used electrical stimulation to implant it in the receiver’s mind. This message appeared as flashes of light in the corner of their vision. In France, a computer translated the message and then used electrical stimulation to implant it in the receiver’s mind that appeared as flashes of light in the corner of their vision . The light appeared in sequences that allowed the receiver to decode the information in the message. Researchers then conducted a similar experiment in which thoughts were successfully transmitted from two participants, one in Spain and one in France. The human brain is made up of billions of active neurons that have around 105,600 miles (170,000 km) of combined length. Every time you have a thought, your brain produces weak but distinct electrical signals corresponding to it. The electrical impulse is generated by the chemical reaction between neurons, which can be measured. Recording and deciphering those signals is called electroencephalography (EEG), and it has been medically possible since 1924. The second experiment resulted in a total error rate of just 15 per cent, with a 5 per cent on the encoding side and roughly 11 per cent on the decoding. The technology was developed as part of a collaboration between the University of Barcelona in Spain, Axilum Robotics in France,  Harvard Medical School and Starlab Barcelona in Spain. According to the researchers, this is the first time humans have sent a message ‘almost directly’ into each other’s brains. ‘We anticipate that computers in the not-so-distant future will interact directly with the human brain in a fluent manner, supporting both computer- and brain-to-brain communication routinely,’ they wrote. Human-to-brain technology is also gaining traction. In May, German scientists showed how seven pilots used mind control to fly with ‘astonishing accuracy.’ In a simulation, several of the pilots managed the landing approach under poor visibility, while one was able to land a few metres from the runway’s central line. Meanwhile, in June, University of Oregon researchers unveiled a device that claimed to be able to monitor memories in near real time to see what a person is thinking. The receiver's brain (pictured) was stimulated (areas shown by dots) to see sequences of light that could be decoded into a message.

"The taxi driver who picked up Carole and Michael Middleton after they met their grandson for the first time has revealed they didn’t leave a tip. But Tracy Mitchell still insists that escorting them from St Mary’s Hospital was an ‘incredible’ experience. She was called to the hospital’s private maternity ward by a third party, and realised the identity of her passengers only when she pulled up. You'll never guess who I had in my cab! Taxi driver Tracey Mitchell said she cannot stop talking about picking up the Middletons after they met baby George . Happy day: The Duchess of Cambridge's thrilled parents Carole and Michael Middleton leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, and sitting patiently in her cab was Tracy Mitchell . Incredible: Mrs Mitchell admitted she had no idea her £15 fare was for the Middletons . Upon being briefed by a press officer, she exclaimed: ‘I wish I’d known – I’d have done my hair.’ The 49-year-old said Mr Middleton tried to pay the £15 fare when they arrived back at Kensington Palace – but was told it had been paid in advance. He did not, however, offer a tip. ‘They chatted amongst themselves, and she spent much of the journey on the phone,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘When we got to the other end I congratulated them on the arrival. They said thank you very much. Very down-to-earth people, they seemed. She was kind of bewildered by it all.’ The cabbie, from the Isle of Dogs in East London, said Mrs Middleton spoke during the 15-minute journey of being ‘overwhelmed’ by the experience. Mrs Mitchell responded jokily: ‘Imagine what it was like for me as the taxi driver!’ Mrs Middleton replied that she was ‘really sorry’, but Mrs Mitchell laughed off the apology, adding: ‘No, no, it was very exciting for me.’ The driver – and her distinctive bright blue cab – could be seen in news footage of the Middletons emerging from the hospital that was broadcast around the world. Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son George out of hospital for the first time . She has driven Lily Allen, Julian Clary and Russell Grant since taking the wheel last year – but described the Middletons as ‘the best’. ‘It was incredible,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘I mean, picking up the future king’s grandparents ... it doesn’t get much better than that. ‘It wasn’t until I got there that I was told it was Kate’s mum and dad I was picking up. You really could have knocked me down with a feather, to be honest with you. I was really quite taken aback.’ She had answered a call at about 4pm on Tuesday, and was told to report to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in Paddington, West London, where the Duchess had given birth the previous day. Mrs Mitchell, who had initially been told she would be picking up someone called Danielle, was then called by a press officer, asking what car she was driving and what colour it was. Shell-shocked: Mrs Mitchell, from east London, didn't receive a tip and went home shortly afterwards for a beer . Later: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived at the Lindo Wing after the Middletons, in a Jag, not a cab . ‘It didn’t dawn on me that it could be anyone to do with [the birth] or Kate’s mum and dad,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She took one more fare after dropping off the Middletons – and then enjoyed a celebratory bottle of beer at home. The Middletons themselves were soon entertaining the new prince. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their new arrival, are now staying at the family’s £4.7million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. Meanwhile, the new grandparents’ company Party Pieces is already advertising its baby-themed wares on Facebook with a picture proclaiming: ‘It’s a boy.’ The photo, which appeared at about midday yesterday, shows off several products from the couple’s ‘christening’ and ‘new baby’ ranges, including a rocking-horse cake stand for £11.99. The Middletons have been accused of cashing in on their daughter’s royal status several times before; their firm launched royal-themed products ahead of the Duke  and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, and the Diamond Jubilee a year later. A company spokesman said: ‘Party Pieces has specialised in parties to mark children’s births for over 26 years. Our acknowledgment of the birth is entirely appropriate and entirely fitting with our customers’ joyfully received messages of congratulations.’","Tracy Mitchell had no idea £15 fare was for Prince George's grandparents .

"Massive fan: Aged only six, Jack Pinto - a Sandy Hook victim - was a massive Giants fan . He was only six years old, but Jack Pinto was already a huge New York Giants fan. And in particular, he loved Victor Cruz, the 26-year-old receiver who celebrates every touchdown with a little salsa dance. So when Pinto was tragically gunned down during the Sandy Hook massacre on Friday, his idol needed to mark the moment. When his team took on the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, Cruz's boots were inscribed with the words 'Jack Pinto, My Hero', 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' and  'This one is for you'. His tribute came after describing how humbling it was to find out how much of an impact he had on Pinto's short life. In fact, Pinto's parents are considering burying Jack in a Cruz No. 80 football shirt, as they prepare to bury him next Monday. Cruz said he plans to give the gloves he wore during the game to the boy's family, and spend some time with them. He said: 'There's . no words that can describe the type of feeling that you get when a kid . idolizes you so much that unfortunately they want to put him in the . casket with your jersey on. 'I can't even explain it.' Respect: Cruz, pictured earlier this year, was moved to hear how big a fan Jack Pinto was, and paid tribute to him on the pitch . Cruz added: 'I also spoke to an older brother and . he was distraught as well. I told him to stay strong and I was going to . do whatever I can to honor him. 'He was fighting tears and could barely speak to me.' Cruz started the tributes before the match, tweeting: 'Today's game is for you, Jack.' Afterwards he said: 'It was very humbling to hear how big of a fan he was and how they were thinking about putting my jersey on him for the services. 'It was an emotional time. It really shows you what type of effect that athletes have on kids. Not just seeing you on TV. They want to be you. They idolize you. They wear your jersey everywhere. 'It really showed me how real it is to be a role model. It was definitely humbling for sure.' Smiles amidst the tragedy: Victor Cruz walks off the field after the Giants defeated the Dallas Cowboys . Tributes on the boot: Cruz also sent a Tweet out before the match, saying: 'Today's game is for you, Jack' Tribute: The shoe of New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz bears the words 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' in memory of one of the Sandy Hook victims . A community devastated: Eighteen of the massacre's youngest victims . “When a family is facing that much tragedy,” Cruz added, “you want to be someone that inspires them and can put a smile on their face in a time where it’s tough to do that.” Jack's funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Monday at the Honan Funeral Home in Newtown, followed by burial at . the Newtown Village Cemetery. NFL fans across the nation paid respect to the victims with with periods of silence and reflection. Some teams darkened their scoreboards and lowered their flags to half-staff, while others wore helmet decals or black ribbons.

"Guests at a christening were in for a surprise when the parents interrupted the baptism of their son to get married. The vicar told guests that she had an announcement as they filled the pews at St Nicholas Church in Husthwaite, North Yorkshire, for the christening of four-month-old Harry Thornton. Best man Jimmy Derham, a former jockey, and wedding photographer Robert Smith were in on the surprise. Surprise! Yvonne Dennis and Andrew Thornton, surprised the 80 guests at their baby son Harry's Christening at St. Nicholas' Church in Husthwaite, North Yorkshire, when they told the congregation they were also getting married . Even the couple's parents did not know about the secretly planned wedding, and shocked guests broke out into applause as the vicar told the congregation that florist Yvonne Dennis and jockey Andrew Thornton, the baby's parents, would actually be getting married first. The couple were happily married and the vicar then moved on to Harry's christening. 'There was a massive applause and it was lovely - there were a few shocked faces,' said the new Mrs Thornton. 'The vicar knew and so did the photographer, who was a friend and was sworn to secrecy. I had to tell him because I wanted him to capture people's faces.' Secret: Even the couple's parents did not know about the secretly planned wedding, and shocked guests broke out into applause as the vicar told the congregation the good news . The 80 guests went to the couple's home in Rainton afterwards for a party. Although the couple have known each other since they were seven years old, they have been in a relationship for just over three years. There were no elaborate table decorations, wedding presents, sit-down meals or any organised entertainment, even though Yvonne is a professional wedding florist. Fuss-free wedding: The couple were happily married and the vicar then moved on to Harry's christening. Wedding florist Yvonne didn't want a frilly wedding and kept it simple . Yvonne said: 'I'm a wedding florist - I have been in the industry for about 23 years. I just see weddings week in week out and I didn't want all the frills and spill; just a really personal party and to focus on just getting married. 'We both know hundreds and hundreds of people - especially through Andrew's job - and just thought we could get carried away with inviting 400 people easily. We didn't want to offend anybody by missing them out, so this way it was kept very personal with closest and oldest friends.'

"West Ham United forward Diafra Sakho will not face retrospective punishment from the FA after allegedly headbutting Luke Shaw. Manchester United’s sense of injustice over Wayne Rooney’s red card on Saturday had been heightened by their private view that defender Shaw was a victim of an attack. The left back was fielding a shining black eye after the win at Old Trafford but, after reviewing video footage, the offence wasn't deemed serious enough to warrant a red card had the referee seen it at the time. Luke Shaw was allegedly involved in an incident with Diafra Sakho (left) that left him with a black eye .

Lee Mason hadn't included the incident in his post-match report, allowing the FA to review. Shaw was also critical of the decision to send off Rooney and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by Sakho earlier in the game. 'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza’s red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn’t stop play,' said Shaw. 'Earlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me. 'But I just focus on winning games and I’ll keep doing that.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Hiring a hitman has never been easier. Nor has purchasing cocaine or heroin, nor even viewing horrific child pornography. Such purchases are now so easy, in fact, that they can all be done from the comfort of one's home at the click of a button... and there's almost nothing the police can do about it. This worrying development of the criminal black market is down entirely to the Deep Web - a seething matrix of encrypted websites - also known as Tor - that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity. Chilling: So for those looking to bump off a difficult acquaintance, all they have to do is enter the Dark Web and search 'hitman for hire', such as this one . Guns for hire: This site appears to offer the services of a team of former mercenaries from the french foreign Legion . The Deep Web has existed for more than a decade but came under the spotlight last month after police shutdown the Silk Road website - the online marketplace dubbed the 'eBay of drugs' - and arrested its creator. But experts warn this has done next to nothing to stem the rising tide of such illicit online exchanges, which are already jostling to fill the gap now left in this unregulated virtual world. So for those looking to bump off a . difficult acquaintance, all they have to do is enter the Deep Web - known also as the 'Dark Web' or the 'Undernet' - and . search 'hitman for hire'. Place your bets: Some 'hitmen' seem to offer others the chance to profit from their killing by allowing users to bet on when a victim will die by putting money in a pool. The closest guess takes home the pot . Kill that ex you hate? This rather more rudimentary website offers to 'neutralist the ex you hate, your bully, a policeman that you have been in trouble with, a lawyer a small politician' There they are presented with lists of willing assassins touting their wares to anyone who will pay. And like The Silk Road, transactions are all made using the mysterious online currency Bitcoin. One site, whose name MailOnline has chosen not to publish, offers an assassination in the US or Canada for $10,000 and one in Europe for $12,000. 'I do not know anything about you, you do not know anything about me,' crows one self-styled assassin, according to The Daily Dot. 'The desired victim will pass away. No one will ever know why or who did this. On top of that I always give my best to make it look like an accident or suicide.' Tor - short for The onion Router - is a seething matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday . internet with complete anonymity. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online. Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer. The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user. Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search. An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed. 'I have gained endless experience(s) in this [sic] 7 years,' he goes on. 'It has changed me a lot. I don't have any empathy for humans anymore. 'This makes me the perfect professional for taking care of your problems and makes me better than other hitmen. If you pay enough I'll do ANYTHING to the desired victim. If I say anything I mean anything.' Many of the sites even use slogans and marketing techniques that, if it weren't for their macabre subject matter, could be as at home on the website of a legitimate retail website. 'The best place to put your problems is in a grave,' boasts one. Some even seem to offer others the chance to profit from their killing by allowing users to bet on when a victim will die by putting money in a pool. The closest guess takes home the pot. And while many appear every inch the cold-blooded killer one would expect from a gun-for-hire, there is also apparently the odd humanitarian hitman. 'Killing is in most cases wrong, yes,' writes one. 'However, as this is an inevitable direction in the technological evolution, I would rather see it in the hands of me than somebody else.' 'By providing it cheaply and accurately I hope that more immoral alternatives won't be profitable or trusted enough. This should primarily be a tool for retribution.' Adding that murder should always be . committed for 'good reason', he writes: 'Bad reasons include doctors for . performing abortions and Justin Bieber for making annoying music.' The Silk Road: The Deep Web has existed for more than a decade but came under the spotlight last month after police shutdown the Silk Road website - the online marketplace dubbed the 'eBay of drugs - and arrested its creator . Arrest: The Silk Road's creator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested earlier this month after allegedly hiring an undercover FBI agent to kill two people . The Silk Road's creator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested last month after allegedly hiring an undercover FBI agent to murder a member of the site who was apparently blackmailing him. He allegedly also tried to have an employee killed who he thought might blow his identity to police. Meanwhile, even as the Silk Road was trundling to a halt, already hundreds of other websites were springing up in its place, peddling anything from drugs to stolen identities, illegal weapons to sickening child pornography and even explosives. In June it emerged one such site, called Atlantis, was even offering its wares in an advert posted on YouTube. Looking . like an advert for a well-funded Silicon Valley start-up, the slick . promo video for Atlantis boasts that it is 'the world's best anonymous . online drug marketplace'. Dangerous drugs: A screengrab of of the Atlantis online marketplace shows some of the illegal drugs on offer, including heroin, cannabis, MDMA and LSD . It comes as the site's backers announced the launch of a 'big social media campaign' that seems intended to make a play for the market share of the better-known Silk Road. But while experts say police are all . but powerless to shut down websites selling illicit products, authorities claim . they are making inroads in their bid to stifle the Deep Web's growth.

"Serious delays over the release by an Italian court of the full findings of Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's conviction for tax evasion have been criticised by the Football League for continuing to cast a shadow over the club. Cellino was found guilty of a tax evasion offence back in March and the Football League tried to have the Italian businessman barred from taking over the club but he won an arbitration appeal on the grounds that the offence was not one of dishonesty. The appeal was only granted on condition, that the full written reasons of the Italian court case did not rule it a dishonest act. Those findings were expected in June but have still yet to materialise. Delay: Court findings of Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's tax evasion case were meant to be released in June . Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey, speaking to reporters at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said: 'It's exceptionally disappointing that we haven't actually had the judgement, if not only to draw a line under the whole scenario so that everyone knows where they are. 'It's a cloud still hanging over both the Football League and the club, and Mr Cellino himself. 'We are constantly monitoring it. We have been asked to be kept informed. Our influence over the judicial system in Italy is somewhat limited. 'We have Italian lawyers monitoring it for us and we've been told it will come out when it comes out. That's how the Italian judicial system has been described to us.' Harvey said if the case was judged to be one of dishonesty Cellino would have to sell his majority shareholding and cease being a director of Leeds. He added: 'From our perspective he then fails the owners and directors' test and at that stage the provisions are in the rules that he has to divest himself of his interests. Cloud: According to Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey 'It's a cloud still hanging over the club' 'We'd obviously give the club a reasonable period of time to organise its affairs because you wouldn't want to put the future of the club at risk immediately that you had a decision. It's a matter the Football League board would have to consider at that particular time.' Harvey also explained why the league had initially tried to bar Cellino. He said: 'The Football League felt that the current court case in Italy constituted a dishonest act and as such should have barred him from being able to own the club. As is his right, he appealed and the appeal found that we didn't have the ability to say that. 'The actual single arbiter in the matter made it very clear that when the written reasons are issued as part of the judicial process, if it is clear in there that the act was one of dishonesty, which is the test that we apply, then at that stage he would fail the owners and directors' test and as such wouldn't be able to be a director of the football club or exert any control.' Mixed reception: Cellino has already sacked two managers at Leeds and has divided supporters at the club .","Massimo Cellino found guilty of tax evasion offence back in March .

"The first family has not bought a house in Asheville, North Carolina, the White House said Monday, clamping down rumors started by a financial media company's website which claimed it had an iron-clad confirmation of the future move. Given Barack Obama's frequent trips there before and during his presidency, the rumor mill spent all day Monday spinning. He visited Asheville last year, speaking at an auto parts plant owned by Linamar Corp. to advocate for a minimum wage hike the day after his State of the Union address. Obama has visited the trendy city of just 85,000 people three other times since his first presidential campaign. It was his debate-preparation retreat before going toe-to-toe with Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008. He took his family there for an April 2010 vacation. And he made a pitch there for jobs in 2011. But asked Monday if the Obamas had bought property there, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest shot back: 'That is not true.' Anyone need a wide runway? Obama spoke at the Asheville airport in 2011 about how useful it would be to put North Carolinians to work making the tarmac broader and the taxiway more manageable . The 12 Bones Smokehouse restaurant in Asheville is a barbeque landmark that Obama mentioned by name during his 2013 visit -- and which he visited with the first lady in 2010 . The rumor made lots of sense: Obama smiled on the 10th fairway at the Grove Park Inn Resort in Asheville during a round on April 23, 2010 . You could have fooled the president, judging from his past banter in Asheville. 'It is good to be back. I love coming to Asheville,' Obama said on February 13, 2013, during his most recent jaunt there. 'Michelle and I always talk about how if – after this whole presidency thing – we're looking for a little spot ...' 'Come on down!' came a shout from the crowd, finishing his thought. The president reminded his partisan audience of something they already knew: Western North Carolina is known as a laid-back tourism hub. He said he might 'play a little golf, do a little hiking, fishing, barbecue' if he ever moved in. 'There are two things that keep bringing me back here,' Obama said then. 'Number one is I really like the people. Number two is 12 Bones [barbecue], which I’ll be stopping at on my way back to the airport.' Asheville is also famously liberal, serving as a politically progressive oasis in a historically red state and housing a sizable community of artists and galleries. There is also the occasional drum circle. 'We have lots of what are known here as ""Trustifarians,"" an Asheville real estate agent told MailOnline, requesting anonymity 'in order to not offend anyone.' 'These are pretty ordinary rich kids with trust funds who like to play at being hippies.' 'But they pay top dollar for lovely properties, so we certainly welcome them even if these are their second homes,' she chuckled. The agent said she wasn't in the loop on an Obama move to the area, first reported by Wall Street Cheat Sheet, but thought it might have improved property values. 'Lots of . the president's fans are going to want to move here if it's true,' she . told MailOnline. 'But I bet the Secret Service will mean no one wants to . live on his street.' All I can tell you for sure, she laughed, is that they're not buying the Biltmore.' During a February 13, 2013 speech in the western North Carolina town of Asheville, Obama had said that he and Michelle might move there 'if, after this whole presidency thing, we're looking for a little spot' Man of the people: Obama will have lots of opportunities to fetch his own coffee beginning in 2017, as he did Monday on the spur of the moment -- but the Secret Service may have to work hard to blend in wherever he moves . Out of the question: The Biltmore Estate, America's largest privately owned home, is in Asheville -- but while the Obamas have toured it, no one thought they were in the market for a 250-room, 178,926 square foot mansion . That was a reference to the 250-room mansion completed in 1895 for the wealthy Vanderbilt family. The nation's largest privately held home is now a tourist attraction – one that the Obamas checked out in 2010. The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the potential real estate purchase. But during an October 17, 2011 speech at Asheville's airport, Obama argued that one of his make-work jobs programs could help improve the modest transportation mini-hub. 'There is plenty of work to go around,' he said 'In this airport right here in Asheville, you’ve got a runway that needs to be widened and repaired.' 'You’ve got a taxiway that’s in the wrong spot – which means that planes sometimes get too close together. So we could be doing some work right here at the Asheville Airport that would help boost tourism, help to boost the economy here, put people to work right now.' Obama, the rumor held, could have been going in and out of that airport on a regular basis in just a few short years. The website AskAsheville.com quickly published a Buzzfeed-style list on Monday of the top 10 reasons Obama was supposedly moving there. '""Mayor of Asheville"" sounds cool,' one item read. 'Wouldn’t that be the perfect gig for an ex-President?'","A popular financial media website claimed it had 'confirmed' that the town of 85,000 was to be the Obamas' future home .

"This shocking footage reveals the moment a brazen motorist swerved in front of a lorry driver on a busy motorway in an attempt to claim £75,000 for whiplash injuries in an insurance scam. The video shows the Ford Galaxy veering over three lanes of traffic on the M25, in front of the HGV, causing it to slam on its brakes before crashing into the back of the car. But the occupants filed four whiplash claims, totalling up to £75,000, following the ‘accident’ - claiming the smash was the lorry driver’s fault. Scroll down for video . Crash: The video shows the Ford Galaxy veering over three lanes of traffic on the M25, in front of the HGV . Swerving: The car's occupants filed four whiplash claims, totalling up to £75,000, following the 'accident' The insurance nightmare only ended when the footage, captured by the truck’s on board camera, proved the car had deliberately driven into its path. Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, which supply the cameras, said he had seen a huge surge in demand due to the on-going problems of bogus whiplash claims. He said: ‘This is a real problem, particularly for hauliers and fleet managers who are running large numbers of vehicles and could be targeted by these fraudsters every week. ‘This new video perfectly illustrates the problems responsible motorists face. ‘The lorry driver was travelling well within the speed limit when the people carrier swerved directly in front of him to avoid hitting another car in the fast lane. ‘The haulier was very surprised to be on the receiving end of a four whiplash claims for £75,000. ‘Drivers can often feel like they are on shaky ground when they go into the back of another vehicle, particularly if there are no reliable witness to explain what happened. Video: The insurance nightmare ended when the footage proved the car had deliberately driven into its path . Hit: As the Galaxy had been hit from behind the occupants pressed ahead with their whiplash claims . ‘Blame is nearly always attached to . the driver who hits the vehicle from the rear. However, in this case, . there was a reliable witness, the SmartWitness camera. ‘It showed that the lorry driver was blameless and the occupants of the Galaxy had a real cheek blaming him for what happened.' 'This is a real problem, particularly for hauliers and fleet managers who are running large numbers of vehicles and could be targeted by these fraudsters every week' Simon Marsh, SmartWitness . The video shows the Galaxy speeding past the lorry, which is travelling at 55mph in the slow lane of the M25. The people carrier reacts too slowly to deal with oncoming queuing traffic and brakes violently. It then swerves across three lanes and into an unavoidable collision with the blameless truck driver. As the Galaxy had been hit from behind the occupants pressed ahead with their whiplash claims. Around 550,000 whiplash claims are filed annually in the UK. But insurance experts estimate around 60 per cent are ‘cash for crash’ scams, netting up to £1billion a year. The shocking figures were given to MPs by insurers who said the UK had now become the ‘whiplash capital of the world’ Problem: Whiplash claims, boosted by no-win, no-fee claims, are adding up to £90 to the average UK policy . Rising issue: SmartWitness said it has seen a huge surge in demand for its cameras due to the on-going problems of bogus whiplash claims . According to The AA, since 2006 there has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims while the number of reported accidents on UK roads has fallen by 20 per cent over the same period. Fraudsters running ‘cash for crash’ scams, which stage fake car crashes and then file claims for personal injury and damage to their vehicles, have also blighted the insurance industry. 'It showed that the lorry driver was blameless and the occupants of the Galaxy had a real cheek blaming him for what happened' Simon Marsh, SmartWitness . Whiplash claims, boosted by no-win, no-fee claims, are adding up to £90 to the average UK policy. Sales of Smart Witness incident cameras have soared by 40 per cent in the last year as motorists protect themselves against the danger of bogus whiplash claims. But many motorists have been able to reduce their premiums after fitting the cameras. The cameras - similar to a black box journey recorder - fit onto the windscreen, and are powered through the car’s cigarette lighter or can be directly wired in. They record the driver’s view of the road ahead and also monitor the car’s location, speed, breaking and impact G-forces. If a motorist is innocent in an accident, this is all the proof they will need. The haulage firm concerned did not involve the police and the four ‘whiplash scam’ perpetrators - who dropped the claim - were not prosecuted for fraud.","Video shows Ford Galaxy veering over three lanes of traffic on M25 .

"A man with a fetish for rolling naked in cow manure has been sentenced to five years in jail after he threatened to kill a family when they asked him to stop using their farm. David Truscott, 43, became obsessed with Woodbury House Farm near Redruth and carried out an eight-year campaign against the family when they tried to prevent him from using their land. He threatened to burn down the farm in West Cornwall and to attack owner Clive Roth, his wife Jackie, and their family. Fetish: David Truscott has a cow slurry fetish and has been jailed for five years at Exeter Crown Court after threatening to kill a family who tried to stop him targeting their farm . His hate . campaign started in 2004 when he was caught rolling naked in cow pats . and then banned from the property after stripping off and climbing into a spreader. Mr Truscott removed cow pats from the farm and began entering the farm to masturbate while rolling around in slurry, Judge Philip Wassall told the court on Friday. And when . farmers Clive and Jackie Roth attempted to stop him by removing slurry from their fields, he became enraged. He set light to the milking parlour in . revenge torched a tractor, shed and hay and was jailed in 2005, 2009, and 2011. In September . 2009, he received a 16-week sentence after he stripped naked in the . cattle pen, released the cattle and climbed into the slurry spreader. On his release, Mr Truscott returned to the farm and sat naked in cow faeces, and was jailed for a further 20 weeks. But whilst staying at a hostel in . Exeter, he made a series of chilling threats about how he wanted to . take revenge on the family by burning their farm and tying their . 17-year-old son to a tree. Mr Truscott spent a few weeks at another supported hostel in Somerset where staff allowed him to indulge in some aspects of his fetish, but he became angry and upset after being moved to Exeter, where he could not continue. He was being treated for a type of autism. The court heard how his threats have had a devastating effect on the Roth family and the farmer is now seriously ill, while his wife and family say his vendetta has affected their work and their lives. Cow pat: His hate campaign started in 2004 when he was caught rolling naked in cow pats and then banned from the property after stripping off and climbing into a spreader. Mr Truscott boasted of having £2,000 cash which he wanted to spend on a hitman and spoke of his admiration for revenge killer Raoul Moat. He fantasised about kidnapping members of the Roth family, tying them to trees, dousing them with petrol and setting them alight. Admiration: Mr Truscott boasted of having £2,000 cash which he wanted to spend on a hitman and spoke of his admiration for revenge killer Raoul Moat, pictured . The 43-year-old formerly of Pengegon Parc, Camborne, Cornwall, and Langdon Hospital in Dawlish, admitted making threats to kill and threats to destroy property. On Friday he was handed an extended sentence of 10 years following psychiatric reports. His lawyer, Robin . Smith said: 'My client is a complex and troubled individual and the . context in which he made the threats is a very relevant feature. 'He . was released on February 27, 2012 half way through his sentence and for . three and a half months he stayed at a hostel in Somerset. He . said: 'He was very content there and was allowed to engage in some of . his bizarre behaviour. His difficulties came when he was transferred to . Exeter and these threats were made three days later. 'It . was in that conversation he made these threats when he was agitated and . angry. There was an element of bravado, hot-headedness and attention . seeking.' Mr Trustcott will start his sentence in a mental hospital and will be subject to an order under the Mental Health Act until he is deemed well enough to be moved to complete his sentence in prison. He was also handed a restraining order banning him from going west of a line stretching from Perranporth to Portscatho for life. Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'You expressed your anger and frustration at the people who owned the farm. 'They must have been at their wits’ end that you kept coming back to their land. They are living in fear of seeing you again. 'From everything I have heard and read I have not the slightest doubt you are a dangerous offender who poses a very real risk of causing serious harm.

"Scientists have found the first pieces of space rock that hurtled to Earth last week and exploded over a Russian city, kickstarting a 'gold rush' that could see each fragment fetch £6,500. Experts have been scouring a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, believed to have been carved out when the fireball crashed to the ground. And after three days of combing the ice for clues, they have finally unearthed fragments of stone which each have a strong magnetic field and emit unusually high traces of radiation - clear signs that it came from space. Scroll down for video . Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the expedition from Urals Federal University in February following the crash, said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake . Rock of proof: On Saturday, divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris . Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter . Service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in Yekaterinburg after being recovered from near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region. A total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in Yekaterinburg . Fragments have started to appear on Avito.Ru, a Russian website for classified ads. Many pieces were harvested around Chelyabinsk, where more than 1,000 were injured as the meteor disintegrated overhead. One user asked for around £6,500 for a small piece, while another offered 18 pieces for £11 each. Residents of a village near Chelyabinsk searched the snowy streets, collecting stones they hoped would prove to be the real thing. But not all were ready to sell. 'I will keep it. Why sell it? I didn't have a rich lifestyle before, so why start now?' a woman in a pink woollen hat and winter jacket, clutching a small black pebble, told state television Rossiya-24. Almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000mph on Friday, blowing out the windows of 900 schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes. The debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash. On Saturday, divers searched the . waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty . handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed . formed by a piece of falling debris. Worth up to £6,500: These tiny fragments are said to be valuable and some are already being auctioned online after they were found near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia . Terrifying: Almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph . Friction: Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk . As it raced through the sky, the . 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, . creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball . somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am . local time on Friday. Although . some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and . steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns . was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding. Collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece. Film director Steven Spielberg is a noted collector. In October a 9in piece of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for $43,750 (£28,200).Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day. Putin problem: The revelation comes a day after the Kremlin called on the world's most powerful countries to urgently develop technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten Earth . Nasa said that when he meteor entered the atmosphere, it exploded with the force of a nuclear weapon. The revelation, based on an analysis of the earth's rotation, comes a day after the Kremlin called on the world's most powerful countries to urgently develop technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten Earth. 'Instead of fighting on Earth, people should be creating a joint system of asteroid defence,' demanded Alexei Pushkov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and chairman of the Russian foreign affairs parliamentary committee. He urged the US, Russia and China to join forces to create an Anti-Asteroid Defence System, warning this was far more urgent that the American priority of a European-based star wars defence system aimed at deterring attacks from rogue states. Deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin made clear Russia will lead an international drive for such a move. 'I have already spoken of the need for an international initiative aimed at creating an early warning system that would also prevent extraterrestrial objects from coming dangerously close to the Earth,' he said. 'Humankind must create a system to identify and neutralize objects that pose a danger to the Earth.' The disaster in the Urals - which led . to damage to hundreds of buildings from a ten ton space fireball that . had the force of a nuclear bomb - was a wake-up call to the world, which . is not ready to cope with the threat, he warned. Wake-up call: Experts said asteroid 2012 DA14 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system . Destruction: Officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place, Russia would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris . 'Russia . and other major countries do have a system of space monitoring and . control, but it is mainly geared towards monitoring instances when . spacecraft may come dangerously close to space junk,' he said. The key task was 'not waiting for new incidents to happen but handling problems in advance'. He . called on international players to pull their efforts together instead . of 'piling up military stuff in space, aimed only at lowering our . planet's defences'. Rogozin . expressed the hope this latest incident would make 'officials think of . more important issues and look beyond the space horizon'. There . are some 1,300 space rocks on NASA's list of 'potentially hazardous . asteroids' - yet many like the one that struck Chelyabinsk were not . tracked in advance. Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . The US-based B612 Foundation, which includes NASA veterans, said Friday's close encounters amount to a wake-up call. 'Of the million asteroids as large as or larger than 2012 DA14, we have only tracked less than 10,000,' said the organisation. Divers . were yesterday scouring frozen Lake Chebarkul for remnants of the . meteorite that struck on Friday with two monumental explosions, as . 20,000 emergency workers cleared up the damage from broken glass, . collapsed roofs and structural damage to buildings. Former Kremlin minister Alexander Pochinok called for a joint US, Russian and EU initiative. 'We will clearly have a need to create near-earth stations, with stronger, advanced telescopes,' he said. Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk, Russia, heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them . Local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions . 'Perhaps the calculations might show us that we can even bring nuclear weapons into orbit. It is impossible to envisage it now. It is a matter of calculations, we need to figure out what needs to be done to detect such meteorites, asteroids, to forecast them coming, to change their trajectory, to destroy them. These are tasks for physics and engineering.' Leading scientist Andrei Kokoshin stressed: 'It is high time to create a common international centre for monitoring and responding to natural threats from space. 'The UN should create a special committee within its structure to coordinate efforts.' If the meteorite had hit at a different time of day, it could have struck the UK with devastating consequences .","Experts have been scouring 50-foot hole in a frozen lake near Chelyabinsk .

"A man shot and killed by Los Angeles police on Friday night in Hollywood regularly dressed up as the villain from the horror movie series Scream in order to pose with tourists in return for money, according to people who claim they knew him. LAPD have yet to release the man's name but they have described him as a young, white adult male. Two Los Angeles police bicycle officers shot and killed the man just before 7 p.m. on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue after someone called 911 to report a man with knife. He is not believed to have been dressed as the Scream villain when he was shot. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Shooting: Police are pictured shooting a man near the Hollywood and Highland intersection in Los Angeles . The man shot and killed by LAPD police on Friday night in Hollywood regularly dressed up as the villain from the horror movie series Scream in order to pose with tourists in return for money . Deputy Chief Terry Hara said the suspect was threatening the crowd and the officers and was carrying a 3- to 4-inch folding knife. Cops fired several rounds, leaving his body laying on a corner as shocked witnesses looked on. The shooting occurred just a few hundred feet from the Dolby Theater, where the Academy Awards are held, and one of the most popular tourist spots in Hollywood. But some locals are saying the man was merely a street performer known as 'J' who would pose with tourists holding a prop knife made of plastic. Danny Howe, who sings on Hollywood for tips, said he saw the man three or four days in the past week working as the 'Scream' character for photo tips. Scene: The officers (pictured), who have not been named, were called to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and North Highland Avenue on Friday evening after receiving a report of an assault with a deadly weapon . Weapon: When they arrived at the scene, they found a man wielding a weapon - belived to be this thick silver knife, pictured - and shortly after, fired at least one round at him, the police's Media Relations Office said . 'He scares people for a living,' he told KPCC. 'It kind of makes you wonder that if you scare people for a living, the cops are going to come.'

Many of the performers dress up as characters from Hollywood movies, who pose with tourists for photos in exchange for tips.

"Hacker group 'Lizard Squad' has claimed responsibility for attacking Sony's online PlayStation store, after the network went down on Sunday night. After taking credit for temporarily disrupting Xbox Live on Friday night, Monday morning the group posted a link to comments regarding the PlayStation Network's online status. It then tweeted: 'PSN Login #offline #LizardSquad.' The PlayStation Knowledge Center continued to show the network's status as online, but users reported issues logging into the system. Hacker group Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for attacking Sony's online PlayStation store . Visitors to the PlayStation store site were met with a message that reads: 'Page Not Found! It's not you. It's the internet's fault.' The disruption is the most recent in a series of attacks on Sony Entertainment, with a cyber attack last month resulting in unreleased movies being leaked online, along with personal information on some 47,000 individuals, including celebrities. A group calling themselves Guardians of Peace froze Sony Pictures' computer systems worldwide, posting a message that warned it would release 'top secrets' unless its 'request be met'. According to website Re/code, Sony and security consultants were investigating the possibility that someone acting on behalf of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible for the hacking attack. Visitors to the site were met with a message that reads: 'Page Not Found! It's not you. It's the internet's fault' After taking credit for temporarily disrupting Xbox Live on Friday night, the hacker group claimed responsibility for the most recent attack on Sony Entertainmant . North Korea denied involvement, but praised the attack as a 'righteous deed'. The hack came just under a month before Sony Pictures was due to release The Interview - a comedy about two journalists, played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding. The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones. Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved. A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain. The group has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on targets including EA games, Destiny, Twitch and World of Warcraft. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June. In a further cyber threat on Friday, Sony Pictures staff received an email claiming to be from the same hackers, reportedly with warnings that they and their families were 'in danger.' The email also warned that 'all hope will leave you and Sony Pictures will collapse', according to the industry journal Variety. Sony Pictures described the hack attack a 'brazen' effort, but said it did not yet know the full extent of the 'malicious' security breach. On the same day, Xbox Live was hit with a DDOS - or a distributed denial of service attack - which overloaded the system with requests until it shut down, preventing users from getting online. Lizard Squad, which is known for using DDOS in its attacks, claims to be behind the outage. The group has taken responsibility for taking offline other high-profile targets in the past including EA games, Destiny, Twitch and online game World of Warcraft. On Twitter, Lizard Squad warned that the attack on Xbox was 'a small dose' of what is to come this this Christmas. The PlayStation Knowledge Center continued to show the network's status as online, but users reported issues logging into the Playstation Network system . Last month's attack on Sony came just  before the tech giant was due to release The Interview - a comedy about two journalists, played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .","Visitors to the site reported issues logging into the PlayStation Network .

"A drug for men with advanced prostate cancer has been licensed for use earlier in the disease – delaying the need for chemotherapy. Enzalutamide extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options – with some living 18 months or longer. It is currently given to men who have stopped responding to hormone treatments or chemotherapy. The drug enzalutamide is currently given to men who have stopped responding to hormone treatments - but when given earlier can delay the need for chemotherapy and its distressing side effects (pictured) But new data shows that when given earlier in the course of the disease, the drug can delay the need for chemotherapy and its distressing side effects by 17 months. It cuts the risk of the disease progressing or death by more than three-quarters compared with ‘dummy’ treatment. Doctors hope enzalutamide – which was discovered in the UK – will help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness by combining new and older agents together for longer survival. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments, of whom about 6,000 might be eligible for pre-chemo treatment with enzalutamide. The drug, which is a pill taken at home, costs around £25,000 for an average course of treatment and it is not routinely available on the NHS. Some men in England have been able to get it via the Cancer Drugs Fund, for which manufacturer Astellas Pharma reduced the price through a patient access scheme. The drug costs around £25,000 for a course of treatment and is not routinely available on the NHS . Dr Alison Birtle, consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Preston Hospital, said the drug was cost-effective because it improved quality of life, reduced the need for palliative radiotherapy and GP visits, and cut down emergency hospital care. She said ‘For many men with advanced prostate cancer, enzlautamide has already shown that we can improve how long men live with this diagnosis and ensure they have good quality of life achieving all their milestones.’ She said men needing the drug were often breadwinners, or taking care of their grandchildren. ‘The pre-chemotherapy data is very good and today’s approval for a new licence is a much needed development in prostate cancer’ she said. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK charity said ‘Enzalutamide is a highly effective drug which we know can give men with advanced prostate cancer the extra quality time they need. ‘Making it available for use pre chemotherapy is a no brainer. We hope today’s announcement that enzalutamide is now licensed for use in this way means we can finally see it appraised to become routinely available on the NHS. ‘Enzalutamide was already being made available to some patients pre-chemotherapy before receiving its licence. 'This has been via the Cancer Drugs Fund in England and the Peer Approved Clinical System in Scotland. ‘This early access means that there is now real-world evidence of the drug’s effectiveness, leaving Nice and the Scottish Medicines Consortium with no excuse but to get on with the process of making it more widely available. A doctor at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured) said the drug was cost-effective because it improved quality of life, reduced the need for palliative radiotherapy and GP visits, and cut down emergency hospital care . ‘We also hope that the fact that men have been accessing pre chemotherapy enzalutamide before it received its licence heralds a much needed step change in how a drug’s effectiveness is established, so that we have a faster, more effective appraisal process in the future.’ Sandy Tyndale-Biscoe, honorary chairman of Tackle the charity, said ‘It is great to have such a treatment for prostate cancer patients with advanced disease, where treatment choices are so limited.’ The drug, also known as Xtandi, was developed by British scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London.","Drug extends life by at least five months in men who have advanced cancer .

"Real Madrid host Barcelona on Saturday in the first Clasico of the season. The two most successful sides in La Liga have played out many memorable games over the years and here, Sportsmail picks the top 10. 10. At No 10 it’s Real Madrid and Barcelona’s first ever Clasico Spanish Cup final all the way back in 1936 in a game that took place a month before Civil War broke out Spain. Madrid took a two-goal lead but Barcelona came back strongly and only an incredible late save from Ricardo Zamora prevented a last-minute Barca equaliser. For many years the most expensive goalkeeper in Spain, Zamora still gives his name to the annual award for the best stopper in La Liga. Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-1 in the 1936 Spanish Cup Final thanks to goals from Eugenio and Lecue . 9. Nothing summed up the never-ending conspiracy theories about the referee being either a Barca or a Madrid fan than the Clasico Cup final of 1968. It was won 1-0 by Barcelona thanks to a first-half own goal from Madrid’s Fernando Zunzunegui. The main protagonist, however, was referee Antonio Rigo. A suspected Barcelona fan, he turned down two clear penalty appeals in the second half provoking a shower of glass bottles to be thrown on the pitch. Madrid fans sarcastically sang the referee’s name when the trophy was awarded. Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the 1968 Spanish Cup final thanks to an own goal from Fernando Zunzunegui . 8. One of the most famous images from the history of the Clasico has to be Raul putting his finger to his lips and silencing the Nou Camp after equalising in a 1999 league fixture. Raul had scored the first goal but Barca had taken the lead through Rivaldo and Luis Figo. The Spain captain had the last word with the equaliser with just five minutes left of what was the last meeting in the 20th century. Raul goes past Pep Guardiola in 1999 in a game that ended 2-2 . Raul scores a late equliizer for Madrid before celebrating by putting his finger to his lips . 7. Three years later Figo was the main attraction at the Nou Camp as he returned to his old club wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He had been back before but this was the first time he had been brave enough to take any corners. Missiles rained down on him – including the famous pig’s head – and the referee, Luis Medina, stopped the game for 16 minutes. Barca won 2-0 with current coach Luis Enrique scoring one of the goals. Luis Figo returned to the Nou Camp in a Real Madrid shirt after leaving Barcelona and was abused . Figo was subjected to abuse from Barcelona fans and the match was halted after missiles were thrown . 6. In December 2003 David Beckam played his first Clasico at the Nou Camp for Real Madrid and helped them end a 20-year-run without a win at the home of their great rivals. Patrick Kluivert scored for Barcelona but Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo gave Real Madrid the points. David Beckham helped Real Madrid to their first win at the Nou Camp for 20 years in 2003 . 5. Ronaldinho worked a miracle in November 2005 when he brought the Santiago Bernabeu to its feet after one of his greatest individual performances. He scored twice and Samuel Eto’o once in a 3-0 win for Barcelona. Madrid were awful but their supporters showed their class with the appreciation of Ronaldinho’s brilliance. Ronaldinho and Sammuel Eto'o helped Barca to a 3-0 win at the Bernabeu in 2005 . 4. He didn’t get the ovation but he did get a hat-trick at the Bernabeu in March 2007. Leo Messi took on Madrid single-handedly and came away with a point. Ruud van Nistelrooy scored twice and Sergio Ramos got the third for Madrid but Messi – yet to really explode as a striker under Pep Guardiola – managed to score all three on his full debut in the fixture. Lionel Messi was Barcelona's hat-trick hero in 2007 but the points were shared in a 3-3 draw . 3. In joint third place two recent cup finals. Jose Mourinho turned up to end Barcelona’s reign in Spain and in his first season he inflicted a telling blow with 1-0 win in the 2011 Spanish Cup final. He had to wait until the 103rd minute before the goal came but with Ronaldo heading in an Angel di Maria cross the white half of Valencia’s Mestalla stadium could celebrate a famous win. Back in the same stadium last year Madrid and Barca were heading for a draw when the Cardiff Express Gareth Bale ran from the halfway line – leaving the pitch at one point – to get a glorious winner. Cristiano Ronaldo was Real Madrid's match winner back in 2011 when they won the Spanish Cup final . Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring during the Spanish  Cup final against Barca in 2014 . 2. Last March Barcelona’s season was falling off the edge of a cliff when they went to the Bernabeu and beat Real Madrid in a 4-3 thriller to put them back in the title race. Messi scored yet another hat-trick to make himself the all-time top scorer in the fixture, passing Alfredo Di Stefano’s record and taking his own haul to 21. Messi scored another Clasico hat-trick as Barcelona edged out Real 4-3 in a thriller last season . 1. Top of the pile for sheer quality of performance has to be the 6-2 win for Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu in May 2009. In one of the single greatest team performances in this fixture, Barcelona destroyed Real Madrid. It was the first time Guardiola had opted to play Messi in a central position with Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto’o playing wide. It worked like a dream and Madrid were humbled. Thierry Henry celebrates after scoring  Barcelona's fourth goal against Real in 2009 .","Barcelona have won 107 of the 260 meetings with Real Madrid .

"The Queen is planning to make a major foreign visit to Malta next year - and bring her three heirs, including toddler Prince George, with her, it can be revealed. The historic family trip is being mooted for next November when the sovereign, who will be 89, attends the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) for the first time since 2011. It would be the first time a monarch and her three heirs - in this case Charles, William and George - have travelled abroad together. Scroll down for video . The Queen is planning on bringing her three heirs, Princes Charles, William and George, on a foreign trip to Malta next year as she attends the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting . Concentrating: The Duke of Cambridge proved a whizz at table football when he joined a group of teenagers for a lunchtime match during his visit to Malta - and scored the winning goal . Last year Prince Charles stepped in to represent his mother at the biannual CHOGM gathering in Sri Lanka after the Queen decided to scale back on long-haul travel given her age. The success of the trip led to expectations that Charles, who is the longest serving heir apparent in British history, would represent the Queen more regularly at such large-scale events. But aides have apparently convinced the Queen that the three-hour journey by air to Malta is 'just like an internal flight'. And the monarch herself has something of a soft spot for the Mediterranean Island where she and Prince Philip lived for several months during the early days of their marriage. Speaking during a whirlwind trip to the island by Prince William yesterday, Malta's Prime Minister Dr Joseph Muscat said the Queen was 'very keen' to make it happen. Dr Muscat said: 'The invite is out for Her Majesty to attend and we are waiting for her to reply. 'I believe Her Majesty will attend, we are awaiting confirmation.' He also revealed: 'I spoke to her in Glasgow at the opening of the Commonwealth Games and she said she was looking forward to coming over. 'I believe there may be more than one member of the family coming- we'd like to have all the family here.' His wife Michelle added: 'They are more than welcome. It's a very nice island and very safe.' William also indicated to Malta's president that he would love to bring George and his new brother or sister over. Prince William enjoyed the trip around Valletta's Grand Harbour on his visit to Malta this weekend . The Duchess of Cambridge, who is eight weeks pregnant, was forced to pull out of her first solo overseas engagement to Malta after suffering from Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe ante-natal sickness . Malta's President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca said: 'Prince Wiliiam said he was looking forward to returning to Malta and I told his royal highness that we look forward to welcoming all his family including baby George.' She formally invited the whole Cambridge family at a spectacular fireworks show to celebrate Malta's 50th anniversary of independence from Britain on Saturday. She said: 'Permit me to take this opportunity to invite and host all the family of Your Royal Highness, including Baby George, in the near future.' Pointing to that address, Malta's high commissioner to London, Norman Hamilton, said they hoped the Queen and Prince Philip would come to CHOGM and that the invitation had been made for Prince Charles and the Cambridges to join her. 'I think her advisers have more or less confirmed to her that it is almost like an internal flight,' he said. He added: 'They will be well taken care of. It's a special place for her -- she has fond memories of being here. 'And you can see the love and affection for William and the family. It depends if the Royal family wants to extend it.' Prince William yesterday represented his grandmother at a series of official events on the island after his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was forced to pull out of what would have been her first solo royal tour due to her continuing severe ante-natal sickness. As well as attending his first public Mass, William viewed the nation's two spectacular Caravaggio paintings, went on a boat trip around its Grand Harbour - sailing on the same boat his grandmother did when she stayed on the island in 1949 - and played video games with a group of disadvantaged young children. His last engagement of the afternoon, before flew back on a scheduled flight to London, was a quintessentially English garden party at the home of the British High Commissioner, Villa di Giorgio. He told ex-pat Peter Robinson, 71, that he had spoken to his wife earlier that morning and she was feeling 'a little better.' 'But we both agreed that the hot weather would have been too much for her,' he said. Malta voluntarily became part of the British Empire in 1800 but achieved self-rule after the Second World War. Following a constitutional referendum in 1964, the island became fully independent, retaining the Queen as its Head of State.","The Queen plans to bring Princes Charles, William and George to Malta .

"Olivier Giroud certainly isn't the most technically-gifted Frenchman to have played for Arsenal. There are numerous contenders for that accolade: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira would all be worthy recipients of that honour. Giroud doesn't possess the Gallic flair of his fellow countrymen. No-one can dispute that. Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud holds off pressure from Crystal Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon . Giroud taps home his 11th goal of the seaosn to give Arsenal a 2-0 lead at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Left foot - 34 . Headers -13 . Right foot - 3 . Inside box - 47 . Outside box - 3 . However, his importance to this period of the Arsene Wenger era is just as important than those of his predecessors. He notched his 11th of the season against Crystal Palace - his 50th in total for the Gunners - on Saturday afternoon. Considering he missed three months of the season with an ankle injury, that's an impressive return. But the goals only tell part of his contribution. Giroud is a throwback. Your archetypal English No. 9 - the sort of forward Arsenal haven't seen since, perhaps, Alan Smith. You're unlikely to see Giroud beat four men on the way to scoring a worldy. While he might not be especially technically gifted, Giroud thrives on the physical side of the game . Arsenal's Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez tussles with The Eagles' winger Wilfried Zaha . Puncheon slides in with a strong challenge on The Gunners' German playmaker Mesut Ozil . Zaha bursts forward with the ball as Arsenal's Sanchez (right) and Nacho Monreal (left) give chase . What you will see, though, is Giroud putting his head where it hurts. Two minutes into the second half at Selhurst Park, there he was blocking a Wilfried Zaha cross by the right-hand touchline. In the 74th minute, he sprinted more than half the length of the pitch to prevent Joel Ward from supplying a cross. He does that nasty side of the job - not because he has to, but because he wants to. Supporters love him for it. Giroud enjoys the battle. He gets off on it. Questions marks were raised over Giroud's place in Wenger's plans following the summer capture of Danny Welbeck. The England international made clear he wanted to occupy Arsenal's central striker role. You can only wonder what Giroud was thinking. Injured; knowing his place in the side was under threat. Arsenal's anchorman Francis Coquelin holds off Puncheon as the pair tussle in midfield . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck controls the ball ahead of Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak . What happens on his first match back from injury? He scores. He's not looked back. On Saturday, Welbeck played but started on the right; Giroud taking centre stage. The Frenchman looks to have won his personal duel with the former Manchester United striker. Indeed, he was left fighting for his Gunners future last summer after falling out of favour with Wenger for his highly-publicised flouting of club rules after bringing a woman back to the team hotel the night before a match. Ask those behind the scenes at Arsenal's London Colney HQ and they'll explain once you've lost Wenger's backing it's virtually impossible to get it back. Giroud is the exception to that rule. And that's testament to his temperament and determination. The Frenchman clung onto his Arsenal career and refused to let go. He may not have the 'je nais sais quoi' of his countrymen before him - but, for now, he's Wenger go to guy. Monreal slides in to tackle Zaha, but the winger skips over the challenge and heads the ball on . Following their 2-1 win at Selhurst Park, Arsenal are third in the Premier League table with 48 points .","Olivier Giroud netted his 11th goal of the season against Crystal Palace .

"Monaco still want Arsene Wenger to return to the club, despite the Frenchman only signing a new contract with Arsenal in May . Arsene Wenger has revealed that Mesut Ozil heard a crack in his ruptured left knee before half-time in Arsenal’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on October 5. The Arsenal midfielder bravely battled through the pain barrier and played the full 90 minutes before German team doctors confirmed the full extent of his injury when he reported for international duty. In an exclusive interview with beIN Sports, which will be broadcast on Thursday and again on Saturday, Wenger said: ‘He had a little problem just before he went out at half-time. He had a little pain with his knee, he felt a crack. Mesut Ozil heard a crack in his left knee during the first half at Chelsea, Arsene Wenger has revealed . Ozil has been ruled out until 2015 with the ruptured left knee injury - adding to Arsenal's injury concerns . Wenger has been overseeing training with a reduced squad due to the injury problems the club have . Olivier Giroud - ankle - three months . Mesut Ozil - knee Injury -three months .

Nacho Monreal - back - Close to return . ‘I said to our physio to keep an eye on him and if there was anything wrong with him, tell me because when you’re 1-0 down, you want to keep your offensive players on the pitch. ‘I am deeply shocked. He wasn’t involved in a collision with anybody. ‘It was just after making a pass with the outside of his foot that he injured his leg so it’s very hard to believe that you can damage your ligament with just making a simple pass and it’s very difficult to take that he will be out for a while.’ Wenger has a lengthy injury list as he heads into this weekend’s fixture against Hull in the Barclays Premier League at the Emirates, but the Arsenal manager insists it is just a coincidence. He added: ‘I am not a great believer in coincidences but this time it really is coincidence. Ozil took a lot of criticism for an abject performance on the left wing as Arsenal lost 2-0 at Chelsea . Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas outshone the big-money signing from Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge . ‘You cannot say our injuries are preparation mistakes. The big injuries we have are really accidental. ‘Scientifically we are quite good. We have been hit hard after seven games. I would never have thought we would have had so many bad injuries.’ Wenger also apologised to Jose Mourinho earlier in the week for shoving the Chelsea manager during their fiery exchange on the touchline at Stamford Bridge. And the Arsenal manager claims Manchester City are the stronger team, but admitted the defeat at table-topping Chelsea was ‘traumatic’. Wenger has apologised for his touchline spat with Jose Mourinho during Arsenal's defeat by Chelsea . But Wenger thinks Manchester City are a better side than Mourinho's men .

Already they are nine points behind Chelsea after just seven games and four behind champions City. The Arsenal chief added: ‘That’s an old, ridiculous debate - I honestly never understand what is Plan A and Plan B and C. It’s a debate of another age. ‘I’ve watched the Chelsea game again and we were guilty of not taking the first chances which were there for us and guilty of making a defensive mistake on their goal, but there was very little between the two teams on the day. Ozil gets a hug from Chelsea boss Mourinho after the match at Stamford Bridge . ‘I think we came out angry and frustrated but also coming that we have an important part to play in this championship. ‘We can only look at ourselves and think if we want to get something out of the big games we cannot afford to make the mistakes we made on the two goals. ‘It was traumatic for me. The way we lost was very difficult to take. The quality of the team is to make the maximum with what you produce on the day and that’s where we failed.’ Wenger agreed that Arsenal had a 'massive' gap to make up on early leaders Chelsea . Wenger also claimed City are stronger going forward as he prepares for Saturday’s clash with last season’s beaten FA Cup finalists Hull. He added: ‘I believe that maybe going forward, City are a bit more complete. ‘City are more offensive. Chelsea defensively are better but it’s very difficult to say who will be in front but what we want to do is be in front of both of them. ‘It is massive, the nine points (gap) after seven games, I agree completely, but it is not lost.’ Eden Hazard scored from the penalty spot after Laurent Koscielny's foul on the Belgian playmaker .

"More than 20 British sports pupils were rushed to hospital with severe dehydration, diarrhoea and vomiting just hours after arriving in Dubai for a training camp. The 23 children aged between 11 and 16-years-old and their coach were treated en masse at the Saudi-German Hospital after arriving from Country Durham for a coaching trip. It is thought the illness which swept through the sports camp was a sickness bug picked up in the UK, as three of the students had been suffering from a viral infection prior to their arrival. The 23 children aged between 11 and 16-years-old and their coach were treated en masse at the Saudi-German Hospital after arriving from Country Durham for a coaching trip . The hospital had to bring six doctors, a team of nurses and 24 extra beds in to A&E. 'Half of those admitted had to be put on hydration fluid drip,' said Dr Ali Ziaee, head of the emergency department at the hospital. 'Their situation has now stabilised but the majority has to stay hospitalised for now.' The Dyke House College team from Hartlepool were taken in three ambulances – including a bus ambulance used for mass casualty incidents – from the Premier Inn in Silicon Oasis. Police were also sent to the hotel before the group was admitted to the hospital in Al Barsha on Saturday morning. The team from Dyke House College in Hartlepool (pictyred) were taken in three ambulances – including a bus ambulance used for mass casualty incidents . A total of 46 students and three coaches arrived on Thursday for a seven-day training camp. The symptoms first appeared in an 11-year-old boy who started vomiting about 6pm on Friday. But overnight many more of the group became unwell. Danny Evans, 38, one of the coaches, said: 'We decided to wait first thing at breakfast but things were worse than we thought.' He said that the group had thought they had food poisoning, and had a takeaway pizza on Thursday evening, a catering company lunch on Friday and dinner out in Mirdif on Friday. But Evans added: 'They did not eat all at one place, but at various outlets.'","Coach and 23 children aged 11 to 16 were taken en masse to Dubai hospital .

"Ronald Koeman wants football, rather than his strained relationship with counterpart Louis van Gaal, to be the focus when Southampton take on Manchester United. Monday evening will see a fascinating clash between apprentice and master at St Mary's, where Holland great Koeman takes on the man he spent time coaching under at Barcelona. However, their relationship took a downward turn 10 years ago when the pair worked together at Ajax, with manager Koeman feeling undermined by technical director Van Gaal. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: My relationship with Ronald Koeman is private . Ronald Koeman (pictured) and Louis van Gaal have had a frosty relationship for more than 10 years . Manchester United manager Van Gaal refused to discuss his relationship with Southampton boss Koeman . The United boss referred to him as 'that boy' in his autobiography, also describing his former protege as 'weak', but the frosty relations appear to have thawed in recent years. That said, neither were keen to talk about their relationship in the build-up to Monday's game, although Koeman interestingly backtracked on his initial insistence that things were now 'good'. 'I don't say good, it's correct - maybe that's the best word,' he said. 'When he was the national coach and I was the coach of Feyenoord, we had contact about the international players, but there are too many questions about him.' The pair spoke regularly in the build-up to the World Cup, with Koeman's Feyenoord side providing five players Van Gaal took to Brazil. Furthermore, the United boss also asked how best to implement the three-man central defensive system not only subsequently used by Holland, but United as well. Both sides are likely to revert to an orthodox four-man defence on Monday, but Koeman expects them to approach the game with a similar philosophy. The pair worked well together though at Barcelona when Koeman (right) became Van Gaal's assistant . Van Gaal (right) and Koeman had run-ins with one another during their playing days in Holland . 'We are both Dutch managers, we like to play offensively, we like to dominate the game, but for different reasons,' he said. 'It's not my job (to control how United play). Manchested United play a different system. 'In the last few games they played 4-4-2 with a diamond in midfield and maybe they will change for Monday, we will see. 'Still the manager likes to play attractive football, to score goals and create. 'Sometimes for lots of reasons you can't do that, but that's not my problem.' What is of concern to Koeman, though, is Saints' injury-hit midfield. Morgan Schneiderlin, Jack Cork and James Ward-Prowse are absent for the visit of United - even defender-cum-midfielder Toby Alderweireld is a doubt. It could mean a first Premier League start for 19-year-old Harrison Reed, alongside Steven Davis and Victor Wanyama. The latter had an on-off first campaign following his £12.5million move from Celtic, but has kicked on impressively this term. 'He is an important player,' Koeman said of the Kenyan. 'In the beginning he did it well and it was difficult for him because he had a different pre-season to the rest of the players because he had to play for the national team of Kenya, but little by little he is taking his place in the team. 'He's very strong. He wins his battles in midfield, he scores goals and that's the difference between now and last season. 'Morgan and him have a good relationship, they connect well in midfield, and Victor is maybe the strongest, most physical midfielder what we have in our team. 'He's doing well, he's a good professional and I'm happy to have him in our team.' Koeman wants the focus to be on the football - not his feud with Manchester United manager Van Gaal .","Southampton host Manchester United in Monday Premier League's clash .

"The globally renowned pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson hates Obamacare, believe marriage is reserved for one man and one woman, wants voters to reject politicians who vote to raise America's debt ceiling and says he's no 'fan of political correctness.' When he told an overflow crowd Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference that his time at the podium was up, a chorus of 'Noooo!' erupted. A political committee formed to draft him into the 2016 presidential race has raised more money than the much-ballyhooed 'Ready for Hillary' PAC that aims to form a nationwide organizing effort to send Hillary Clinton to the White House. Carson is a soft-spoken anti-Obama figure. He's also the GOP's best hope at succeeding the current president with an African-American of their own. Convention-goers cheered for columnist, retired neurosurgeon and potential presidential candidate Ben Carson at the Conservative Political Action Conference . Not what the doctor ordered: 'I miss what medicine used to be,' Carson said. 'I don't miss what it has become' under Obamacare . The group angling to persuade neurosurgeon Ben Carson to make a White House run brought activists to support him in large numbers . To Republican strategists eager to reclaim the mantle of diversity from Democrats, electing a black president with conservative values promises to turn the Obama legacy on its head and spare the party's far right wing from charges of institutional racism. Carson, now retired after a career in surgery, told his audience that President Barack Obama has ruined the practice of medicine and brought the nation to the brink of financial disaster. 'I miss what medicine used to be,' he said. 'I don't miss what it has become.' 'We want the healthcare in our hands,' Carson said, scorning the Affordable Care Act. 'We can easily do this. We have lots of alternatives.' Applause lines momentarily gave way to groans when he tried to put America's $17 trillion in accumulated debts into perspective. 'Do you know how long that would take to pay off at $10 million a day? 4,700 years.' 'That is absolutely absurd,' said the always-soft-spoken Carson. 'We are killing the next generation.' On legislators who continually vote to raise America's debt limit? 'Get them out of office.' Stars and stripes: A Philadelphia CPAC attendee has converted a Cadillac into a roving monument to veterans, terror-fighters, first responders and tea party groups . Activists checking into the Gaylord Convention Center hotel near Washington, D.C. got key cards sponsored by the 'Draft Ben Carson' committee . Third rail? 'No one gets to change the definition of marriage,' Carson declared . The crowd went wild. On a less-attended weekend day at CPAC, they nearly eclipsed Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's audience in size. Paul's audience was far louder, too. But unlike Carson's most die-hard devotees, they didn't bring campaign signs. Evangelical Christianity plays a large role in his thinking, and in the operation of the the 'National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee.' Carson, a professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, is looking like Republicans' answer to Barack Obama's first-black-president mantle . Attacking liberal commentators' accusations of rhetorical 'poison' on the political right, he mused about what they meant: 'Could it be the poison of putting what God says in front of anything man says?' He wanted to play golf in retirement, Carson explained, but 'I think the good Lord had a different plan for me.' 'You know,' he told convention-goers, 'I still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.' 'No one gets to change the definition of marriage.' 'Of course gay people should have the same rights as everyone else,' Carson said, wading further into one of America's most volatile political minefields, 'but they don't get extra rights.' The draft-Carson PAC, which has already put operatives on the ground in Iowa, lists prayer – not donations – at the top of its wish list for Carson supporters. Still, more than $2.8 million came in the doors during its first six months of activity. That's more than the 'Ready for Hillary' PAC raised in the same period. His supporters are out in full-force at the annual CPAC event. National Journal reported Thursday that Carson's face appeared on key cards given to the first 2,000 people to check in at the convention's hotel. But if they don't prevail, Carson told them, party unity must. 'After the primaries, if your guy doesn't win, whoever wins – you can call them a RINO or a Tea Bagger – just vote for them!' he said.","Carson is a soft-spoken but world-renowned neurosurgeon .

"New South Wales state premier Mike Baird says a planned state funeral for Phillip Hughes has been called off. Hughes died aged 25 on November 27, two days after being struck by a short-pitched ball from Sean Abbott during a domestic first class match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. More than 5,000 people, including former Australia team-mates and players from around the world, attended a funeral service in Hughes' hometown of Macksville, New South Wales last Wednesday. Tributes continued to be laid out for fallen cricket star Phillip Hughes at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Hughes died last month after being struck by a short-pitched delivery at the Sydney Cricket Ground . The coffin of Hughes is carried down the aisle during his funeral service in Macksville last week . Baird said on Monday the planned state ceremony had been cancelled after consultation with Hughes' family and Cricket Australia. 'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, that a State Memorial Service would no longer need to be held,' Baird said in a statement. Hughes has been named the honorary '13th man' for what is expected to be an emotion-charged first test between Australia and India at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson said Hughes' death would be in the minds of all players. 'It's going to be an emotional morning ... for me going out there bowling, the first spell might be the most difficult,' Johnson said. The number 408, the Test Cap number of Hughes, is displayed on the field at the Adelaide Oval . The Test shirt of Australia captain Michael Clarke with the number 408 hangs in the dressing room . Cricket Australia said spectators at the Adelaide Oval will be asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the match begins. Hughes was 63 not out when he was struck by a short-pitched delivery in Sydney last month. The Australian players will also wear Hughes' test cap No 408 on their shirts.","A planned state funeral for Phillip Hughes has been called off .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has called on striker Diego Costa to get in shape as he seeks to end his scoreless run. The Brazil-born Spain international hit the ground running after signing from Atletico Madrid in the summer, scoring seven goals in his first four Blues appearances.

Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick punches the ball away as Costa tries to put him under pressure . Mourinho's men suffered their first defeat of the season at Newcastle on Saturday, with Costa again failing to trouble the scorers. But Mourinho told several national newspapers: 'For me, the problem is not the goals - they will come as a consequence of his condition. 'He has to improve his condition. He was injured and had many doubts because he went a long time without training. 'Obviously that must have an effect on a player in the way he runs, the way he moves and in his co-ordination.

"Charged: Jared Ehlers is accused of stealing and destroying a fossil . A Utah man accused of prizing a fossilized dinosaur print from a rock and then throwing it in the Colorado river could face up to 20 years in prison. Jared Ehlers was indicted on four charges over the theft of the 190 million-year-old print, believed to have been left by an Allosauraus in what is now the Sands Flats recreation area of Moab. Dive teams have been searching for the three-toed print, which was a popular tourist attraction, since Saturday, after police were tipped off that it had been thrown from a bridge. Ehlers is accused of taking the scientifically important fossil, which was roughly 1ft by 3ft in size, on February 17. It was first reported missing by Kent Green, a guide who had been taking tourists to see the tracks in the sandstone on February 18. Green, whose Moab Cowboy Country Adventures tour company regularly takes visitors to the prints, was horrified to hear the priceless fossil had been thrown in the river. 'Why in the heck would somebody do that? Why wouldn't they just leave it where somebody could find it?' he told the Desert News. The sandstone containing the print was loose and it appeared as if the fossil had been pried out with some sort of tool, paleontologist Rebecca Hunt-Foster said. The footprint was one of 20 left by what is believed to have been an Allosaurus, one of the most dangerous carnivores of the Jurassic period. Important: The 190 million-year-old fossil was left in the sandstone of Moab by an Allosaurus . A spokesman for the Bureau of Land . Management said: 'When fossils like these are taken, we lose . irreplaceable scientific and educational opportunities to explore some . of the natural history that makes Utah's public lands so special.' The . section of sandstone where the track was taken is known as the Dinosaur . Trackway, after prints from several species of dinosaur were discovered . there in 1989. Several . tour operators and off-road groups who use the park offered a $7,000 . reward for the return of the fossil or information about what had . happened to it. Ehlers, who runs a construction business, allegedly came forward on Saturday, and told police where he had dumped it. His reasons for allegedly taking the print and then throwing it away are not yet known. Paleontologists . hope that dive teams using sonar will be able to find the fossil. Because it has an element of limestone, it is hoped the ancient print . will survive. Predator: The Allosaurus was one of the most dangerous carnivores in the Jurassic period . Ehlers is facing prosecution under the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, which was passed to prevent fossils from theft and vandalism. He faces one count each of theft, depredation, removal, and destruction of government property. The most serious count, destruction of evidence, has a maximum sentence of 20 years, and the others carry prison terms of five and ten years.","Jared Ehlers faces charges of stealing and destroying Allosaurus footprint .

"I am determined not to do my usual Christmas party trick of putting on nearly a stone during December. That doesn't mean living like a monk for the next four weeks but I am going to counter the effects of excessive booze and food calories by upping my work-outs with some High Intensity Training (HIT) home and gym sessions. Clearly your appearance for home sessions is not a worry and you can go sans make-up for that, but at the gym a lot of women would think that’s not acceptable. And I'm one of them. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This December Binky is determined not to pile on the pounds so has been keeping her fitness levels up along with co-star Spencer Matthews . I know there will be some gym purists out there who will say it’s ridiculous to wear make-up for a work-out session – but with the possible exception of an all-female aerobics class or a sweat inducing bikram yoga session I would definitely opt for a subtle non-make-up, make up look. For an hour’s open-plan gym session I would opt for some foundation cover, light eye make-up and a nude lip as you can see in the video below for MIC:FIT – Made In Chelsea’s fitness video which has been released this week. Binky knows that some may sneer but she says she can't go to the gym without a little bit of make-up . The hour-long video has me doing torturous work-out sessions with me, Spencer Matthews, Oliver Proudlock and Lucy Watson. My prep for the work-outs is five minutes of stretches, 15 minutes of light base make-up prep (more of that later), and to take one or two Forza Raspberry K2 supplements for an energy boost in the mornings and help with fat burning. As you can see in the footage I had opted for a light oil free foundation – Shiseido Pureness Mattifying Compact Oil-Free – this will breathe better with my skin when getting hot, and sweat won’t form underneath so it’s less likely to smear and won’t create break-outs or spots. If you are going for particularly heavy cardio work then you may prefer to wear a tinted moisturiser or BB cream like Bioderma Sensibio AR BB Cream instead of foundation – but because my work-out session was under harsh studio lights (and I was being filmed!) I opted for foundation. For a workout session Binky usually opts for a light coverage of foundation, subtle eye make-up and a nude lip . Binky says that with her beauty tips you can run as much as you like without worrying about your make-up running too . Also don’t forget that during summer months it’s good to wear a tinted sunblock for that run in the park to protect from the sun damage – I particularly like the Eucerin Tinted Sun Face Creme. Clearly it’s best to go little and light on the whole look for the gym – you will look a tad ridiculous if you’ve put the full Saturday night war-paint on, but a bit of powder blush like Dior Rosy Glow Healthy Glow Awakening Blush to give your cheeks some colour is acceptable – (don’t overdo it though as you are likely to get red cheeks from working out anyway). In the MIC:FIT video I am also wearing Givenchy Noir Couture Waterproof 4 in 1 Mascara, and yes I admit it I’ve got fake lashes on. Clearly it’s not worth putting lashes on for the gym, but I had just had mine done professionally and there was no way I was taking them off. In one of the other videos I had applied quite a heavy bit of contouring – but this was just for the cameras, as it'd be way too much for a regular gym work-out. Binky enjoys a post workout smoothie with (L-R) Spencer Matthews, Oliver Proudlock and Lucy Watson . I know there will be a hardcore clan of gym-bunnies out there who will think my gym make-up tips are bonkers, but most women are likely to concede that they would use a concealer to cover up the odd pimple or blemish – and Eucerin DermoPURIFYER Cover Stick – is perfect for that, containing salicylic acid which will attack the bacteria that forms spots as well. Finally, whether you wear make-up in the gym or not, it is essential that you cleanse your skin thoroughly afterwards, as well as moisturise. Leaving sweat in your pores, especially under make-up, will cause break-outs. So if you do apply make-up for a gym session, using a multi-tasking cleanser like REN Rosa Centifolia Foaming Cleanser afterwards, which cleanses, tones and purifies the skin in one step. Follow up with a redness-reducing moisturiser such as La Roche-Posay Rosaliac UV Legere Fortifying Anti-Redness Moisturiser.

"Liverpool and Manchester City have it all to do in their final group matches if they are to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League. The two Premier League sides know they need to pick up positive results to reach the last 16, although games elsewhere can affect their progression.

LIVERPOOL (vs Basle at Anfield, Tuesday December 9) Only a win against Basle  on Tuesday will do.

"A man behind the wheel of a loaded semi-trailer who was spotted driving on a highway with two tyres missing told police his truck would be 'okay' despite obvious defects. The driver was pulled over last Tuesday after a policeman saw the B-double semi-trailer on the Newell Highway at Daroobalgie in central NSW. It was missing two tyres and two chains holding the axle in place, according to the Daily Telegraph. The driver of a B-double semi-trailer was pulled over by police on the Newell Highway at Daroobalgie in central NSW last Tuesday after the truck was spotted missing two wheels . The loaded semi-trailer was missing two tyres and had two chains holding the axle in place . When the officer initially contacted the driver on the two-way radio to notify him of the missing tyres, the man said it would be okay as he was going to stop in Dubbo - 150km away - to get it fixed. The driver's log books showed he had missed several rest breaks and had critical fatigue on a trip from Melbourne to Queensland. The vehicle was one of nearly 10,000 trucks and trailers inspected by police and Roads and Maritime Services inspectors over a seven-day operation last week. Police issued 796 defect notices, 129 infringements and 119 breaches of registration, weight, licence, and secure and adjust load matters. Nearly 10,000 trucks and trailers were inspected by police and Roads and Maritime Services inspectors over a seven-day operation across NSW last week . Police issued 796 defect notices, 129 infringements and 119 breaches of registration, weight, licence, and secure and adjust load matters . Over the seven-day operation, police found issues of speed tampering, fatigue and drug taking among drivers . They found issues of speed tampering, load management, fatigue and drug taking among drivers. 'To hear of one driver undergoing a drug test at Coolac with a negative result, only for that driver to test positive later in the day at Marulan, suggests that drug use is a problem for some drivers,' Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander, Assistant Commissioner John Hartley said. 'To see continuing evidence of speed tampering is particularly disappointing. 'Speed tampering is not only dangerous to the driver and other motorists, but it also places the operator and directors of companies at great risk of prosecution, which is evident in recent court outcomes where penalties have been over a million dollars in some circumstances.' Officers also found some load management issues with trucks on the road . Police conducted 1,861 random drug tests resulting in 22 drivers testing positive for the presence of drugs in their system . Police also conducted 3,478 random breath tests for alcohol with no positive results, and 1,861 random drug tests resulting in 22 drivers testing positive for the presence of drugs in their system. Officers from Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia also took part in the operation, where a range of issues concerning heavy vehicle and load compliance were identified in those states.","Truck driver was pulled over on the Newell Highway in central NSW .

"Centre Matt Williams choose the perfect stage to score three tries in Wellington’s win over unbeaten Millfield in a heavyweight Daily Mail Schools Trophy clash. Watched by England schools coaches John Fletcher and Peter Walton, Wellington sped to a 41-27 success under the Iffley Road floodlights in Oxford on Wednesday evening. The London Irish academy player continued a fruitful autumn where his pace and swerve has helped Wellington to five wins in this merit table-based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. The only blip came against Dulwich who held the Berkshire school to a 13-13 draw. Matt Williams of Wellington scores a try under the posts at Oxford University's Iffley Road Sports Ground . London Irish youngster Matthew Williams scored a hat-trick to help Wellington past Millfield . Williams, an academic scholar in the lower sixth, was in the England under-16s last season and is expected to be competing for further honours this campaign. He is part of a quick backline including full-back Tom Parton, who also contributed a try against Millfield, and wing Tom Papke who scored two tries in last Saturday’s 43-0 win over Harrow. To finish a hectic week for Wellington they play at Eton on Saturday. Besides the pace of Williams and co, Wellington were also well served by goal-kicking No 8 and captain Will Wilson who amassed 21 points. Wellington’s draw against Dulwich leaves them in the chasing pack behind the unbeaten leaders in the Grammar School at Leeds who edged out RGS Newcastle, 24-21. Hull-based Hymers College are another unbeaten team. They posted a fifth win in a narrow 23-17 success at home to Durham.

"Manchester City and Liverpool have been alerted to the possible availability of Real Madrid midfielder Isco as James Rodriguez closes in on a move to the Bernabeu. The Monaco midfielder starred for Colombia at the World Cup and is on the verge of sealing a dream £60million move to Carlo Ancelotti's side. But his arrival will throw the future of Isco into doubt, with Brendan Rodgers and Manuel Pellegrini both keen on a summer move for the talented playmaker.

"The husband of the 36-year-old Brooklyn teacher charged with having repeated statutory trysts with one of her high school students wants a divorce, it has been revealed. A source told the New York Post that Jimmy Lathrop, 39, is now looking for a lawyer to help him divorce his wife Erin Sayar, who is accused of statutory rape . He was seen yesterday at Brooklyn Criminal Court, wearing a fedora and glasses, and walking several steps ahead of his wife, who looked disheveled in a bright pink track suit. Hard times? Pictured leaving Brooklyn Criminal Court yesterday, Erin Sayar, left, and husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, did not walk side by side; a source tells the Post he's looking for a divorce lawyer . Married mother: Erin Sayar, 37, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse . Silent: Sayar was released from jail for now but she faces four years behind bars for alleged sexual encounters with the high school football player; she's pictured returning to her Brooklyn home . The source told the Post: ‘He’s very angry, he’s very embarrassed,’ adding that Mr Lathrop is out looking for a divorce attorney. ‘I don’ think this marriage will last,’ the source told the newspaper. Mother-of-one Sayer, who is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at Brooklyn's James Madison High School, appeared in court yesterday for arraignment. Sayar was released on $10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct. Kevin is still a student at the high school. As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student. Sayar - who is facing more than four . years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office . while his teammates were using the weight room next door. Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (center) as she left court last June with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her . Consequences: Sayer has been placed on 10-years probation and may have to sign as a sex offender for the rest of her life . A chaotic scene unfolded outside the courthouse as reporters and camera crew surrounded Sayar and her husband, Jimmy Lathrop, as they left after the woman was released from jail. The pair refused to speak with reporters. Sayar remained silent and smirked . slightly at times as she walked dressed in a pink-hooded sweatshirt, . black pants and white sneakers with pink shoelaces. Instead, Sayar got into a sedan and returned to her home. Mr Lathrop also dismissed news crews wearing a top hat and his wedding ring. The parents of the 16-year-old also filed a $10million lawsuit against the married English teacher. According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention. Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in . sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going . to her office — and the door was locked. 'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell ""Go to class!"" and ""Get out of the hallway!"",' Reid said. The lawyer representing Eng is . claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him . the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'. But other students said he was proud of the affair. The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November. Illicit: Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, allegedly had sex with student Kevin Eng when she was meant to be tutoring him . Allegations: She pleaded guilty to having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School . After hacking Eng's Facebook account, . the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so . much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'. Sayar replied: 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. 'We had weight training every day in . sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going . to her office - and the door was locked' Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January. The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.","Alleged affair uncovered when 16-year-old's girlfriend hacked his Facebook account .

"Repairing a road sign should be a simple enough job. But not for one council – which says it has to consult with 22 organisations before it can even begin to put it back up. As a result, the sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth by the side of the road for more than two years. Somerset County Council had to consult 22 bodies before starting repair work on a damaged sign just outside the village or Tarnock, in Badgworth . Local MPs have been campaigning on behalf of the residents of Tarnock in Somerset to have it fixed. But Somerset County Council said it had a statutory duty to consult with nearly two dozen bodies before reinstating the sign, which marks a junction leading to the village of Mark on the A38. Among the 22 organisations being consulted over wires and pipes are Virgin Media, Orange, the National Grid and Wales & West Utilities. The situation was described as ‘barmy’ by the leader of the Commons, William Hague last month. Asked about the issue by Tessa Munt, Liberal Democrat MP for Wells, he replied: ‘It does sound fairly barmy if they have to consult so many people.’ Mrs Munt, who brought up the problem in the House of Commons, said: ‘There has to be a quicker way.’ House of Commons leader William Hague (left) called the situation 'barmy' after Tessa Munt, Liberal Democrat MP for Wells, raised the issue . But Somerset County Council said fixing the sign was not a top priority. ‘We have a legal obligation to gather relevant information before we carry out work,’ a spokesman said. He added: ‘We agree with William Hague. It does sound barmy, but it’s what councils have to do. ‘That’s not the issue here. We’re not waiting to hear back from anyone, it’s just a case of priorities.’ He went on: ‘This isn’t a sign that has any road safety benefit so it has to wait while we do things that we have to consider higher priority. ‘We’ve not been made aware that this is causing a problem and it’s somewhat surprising that it’s a subject that has been discussed in the House of Commons.’ However, the council could avoid having to repair the sign at all – as from next year, excessive speed limit signs and other ‘unnecessary clutter’ will be removed from British roads in the biggest shake-up of traffic signage since the 1960s. New guidelines to be issued to councils will end the need for road signs that repeatedly remind drivers of speed limits. Ministers were ‘alarmed’ to learn that the number of road signs had doubled from two million in 1993 to more than 4.6 million today. Paul Watters, the AA’s head of roads policy, said: ‘Road signs are placed to warn, inform, regulate and direct drivers but they have multiplied almost uncontrollably over the last few decades.’ He added: ‘Getting the balance right will be difficult – sign clutter is a problem but we should not cut back on signs that stop drivers speeding or parking badly.’ The road sign debacle is not the first time this year that Somerset council has come under criticism. In August it emerged that it was home to Britain’s biggest earning council boss, who reportedly earned £318,500 a year for a four-day week. Peter Lewis, who is no longer employed by the council, was also said to have channelled his income as Director of Children’s Services in a way that potentially allowed him to avoid paying tens of thousands in income tax and national insurance.","Somerset County Council reportedly has to consult 22 bodies to fix sign .

"New child protection policies could see Santa banned from taking present requests  on his lap after parents and activists call for increased levels of regulation during the festive season. Queensland parents on social media sparked the debate, expressing concerns regarding the tradition of young children posing for photographs or whispering their wish list on Santa's lap in the lead up to Christmas. Hetty Johnson, spokesperson for child abuse prevention organisation Bravehearts, has demanded that shopping malls update their protection policies, leaving commentators divided over whether the practice should be reconsidered, or whether the issue is an example of political correctness taken too far. Scroll down for video . New child protection policies could see Santa banned from taking present requests on his lap after parents and activists call for increased levels of regulation during the festive season . Ms Johnson said, 'What we would like to see is shopping centre owners updating their child protection policies,' reported the Courier Mail. 'The directive would be for children to stand beside Santa, unless parents or children request to sit on his knee. Shopping centres have duty of care to protect children on premises.' One 'Santa', who has had over a decade of bringing the 'Ozzie Santa'  experience working for Singing Telegrams with the Sydney Children's Hospital, Channel 9, and Channel 10, said that while he understands that parents might be concerned, children are never forced to sit on his lap. 'The little ones tend to be a bit frightened, because they don't know who I am but they soon figure out that I'm the person who gives presents,' he said. 'From my own personal experience, what we're having is a tradition that parents have taken from their own childhood that they want their kids to have,' he said. 'Parents get the children to stand next to me or try to put them on my knee. Sometimes they cry and are quickly taken off.' 'The experience does vary, so while they generally sit on my knee, it's personalised depending on what the parents want and how the children react.' Charmaine Ohl, 32, used to work as a photographer for a Christmas experience company, and  has a two-year-old daughter. Every state in Australia requires checks and certification for those who work with minors, including Santa's, youth group leaders, and church volunteers, among other professions . Charmaine Ohl, 32, said that she grew up sitting on Santa's lap and had never had a bad experience . The full-time mother and receptionist, from Rockhampton in Queensland, said that she grew up sitting on Santa's lap and had never had a bad experience. 'When I worked as a Santa photographer, they never force kids to sit on Santa's lap. Kids just won't do what they don't want to do,' she said. 'All the 'santa's' are police checked, it's perfectly safe. All the workers are checked, no one has a criminal history,' Charmaine said. Every state in Australia requires checks and certification for those who work with minors, including Santa's, youth group leaders, and church volunteers, among other professions. In NSW particularly, updated laws were introduced in 2013 mandating that anyone working or volunteering with children had to have a Working With Children. The ID checks and application processed is managed by the RTA and was implemented to address gaps in who was able to access children. Leah Bromfield, Deputy Director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection, said that parents should have the right to assume that this minimum standard has been met for every person who dons a Santa suit. 'Typically, at a minimum a National Police Records or 'Working With Children Check' will be required to ensure that people working or volunteering with children do not have prior convictions that would make them a risk to children's safety,' she said. 'Child protection don't need to get involved, it's up to parents to decide what is best for their child. Parent's need to be able to make decisions, and choices are being taken away in a lot of different situations,' said Charmaine. 'Ozzie Santa', from Singing Telegrams, said that children are never forced to sit on his lap . 'I actually want my daughter to sit on Santa's lap, but she doesn't like Santa and that doesn't bother us. If children start crying, the helpers sympathise, they don't force the issue,' she said. 'The whole experience is already very varied, and it's been like this for generations. I went and asked other parents and they all felt the same way I did.' In April this year, a 77-year-old man from Adelaide was charged with five aggravated accounts of indecent assault for abusing five girls while he worked as a shopping mall Santa in 2012. William John Graham Webster worked at Southgate Plaza in Morphett Vale and Kalara Reserve in Davoren Park where the prosecution alleges he used his position as 'Santa' to assault the girls. Mr Webter's legal council said that the evidence did not 'make sense' because several parents did not intervene to stop the alleged abuse while it was happening in front of them, reported Adelaide Now. 'It just does not make sense that a mother would sit around and watch a person fiddle with their daughter’s vagina for five minutes and not do anything,' said Heath Barclay. 'The risk would be of inappropriate touching of the child, which would need to occur in the brief time the child was on ""Santa's"" lap for the photo, under the observation of the parent, with the potential to be caught on film, and with the potential for the child to speak out,' said Ms Bromfield. 'We know from the work of researchers like Professor Stephen Smallbone that child sex offending is often opportunistic and perpetrators will choose circumstances in which the chance of detection is low,' 'Theoretically, the Santa photo would seem to me to be a low-risk scenario, largely due to the heightened risk for detection.' Charmaine said that parents were observant and looking after their kids while the photo was being taken. 'We need to stop bubble wrapping kids, we're not stupid. We know what's right and wrong,' she said. 'I do wonder about the legal stance of dictating what people can and cannot do with their own children, and I'm incredulous as to what some people say in the modern world,' 'Santa' said. 'Having said that, most kids sit on my knee. The only people who actually sit on my lap are office workers at Christmas parties.'","Child protection activist Hetty Johnson has called for shopping malls update their protection policies so that children stand next to 'Santa' and not on his lap .

Selfless: Natalia, who was fighting an inoperable brain tumor, died last month . Still going: To date Natalia collected more than 600 blankets and even found the strength to head back to the Drop Inn Center for her birthday in October . Helping out: Donations are still pouring in and Natalia’s family plans to visit a homeless shelter soon to give back . The Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged for the  girl to team up with a world-class chef, and together they created the recipe for Natalia's Soup of Love. She then helped deliver batches of it to a local homeless shelter. The little girl, who passed away last month, struggled through chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in September of 2013 with a rare and very aggressive brain tumor, described as a high grade bithalamic glioma. Proud parents: Byron (left) and Kelly Marsh-Welton couldn't be prouder of their daughter, Natalia Marsh-Welton . Living without: 'I know everybody misses her because of all the good things she has done when she was still alive,' Natalia's younger brother Malakye Marsh-Welton said . Bonds: Instead of going on a dream vacation, Marsh-Welton used her wish to give back and created a soup to serve to the homeless. On the right, she shares a tender moment with her younger brother who misses her deeply . Doctors concluded that because of where the tumor was located, it was inoperable. Natalia fought the cancer with radiation and multiple types of chemotherapy until inevitably conventional medicine ran out of options. One of the side effects of the treatment was that she found it very difficult to stay warm. Natalia's wish was for the homeless to have a blanket and a cup of soup. 'I want to make soup for the homeless because I was remembering how cold I was,' Natalia said. 'I hope my wish is a success.' Volunteers met Natalia at a drop-in center  to hand out soup and blankets. Natalia also got help from Panera Bread, which donated bread bowls in which soup was served. Close to 500 blankets were also donated. Her wish was unusual because often the organization helps people meet their idols or experience something unique, however Natalia simply wanted to give back to the community. Mommy's girl: “I hope that people use her as an inspiration. Maybe it won't be soup and blankets, maybe it will be care packages for soldiers or toys for kids,” Kelly Marsh-Welton said . Queen of hearts: The Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged for the 10-year-old girl from Cincinnati to team up with a world-class chef, and together they created the recipe for Natalia's Soup of Love . Thoughtful: Natalia struggled through chemotherapy and could never stay warm, which is one of the side effects. She wanted the homeless to have a blanket and a cup of soup . 'To have a kid at that age that's so full of love for other people, she gets excited about helping and volunteering. That's all a mom can really ask for,' mom Kelly said. 'I know everybody misses her because of all the good things she has done when she was still alive,' Natalia's younger brother Malakye Marsh-Welton said to WLWT. Natalia collected more than 600 blankets and returned back to the homeless shelter for her brithday in October. Looking after Natalia has meant the family's finances have suffered and their credit  cards are maxed out. The family are hoping that they may be able to continue to raise donations in memory of their daughter. http://www.gofundme.com/SupportNatalia . 'Though she has left this earth I assure you that she lives in the hearts and minds of all who love her and the thousands of people she's touched,' the family said in a statement.

"British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations. He's done it before can he do it again? No, not that… the goal on the comeback or on the debut. Luis Suarez will combine his debut and his comeback this Saturday and he will do it in the biggest fixture in world football – theClasico. Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return to competitive action. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic, Suarez scored twice in his first match back. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Barcelona back in training ahead of their El Clasico clash .

Saturday's game at the Bernabeu could be the first time Suarez, Neymar and Messi are deployed together . How Barcelona may line up against Real Madrid . That afternoon a Sunderland side still reeling from the mismanagement of Paolo Di Canio and under the temporary stewardship of Kevin Ball were the opponents. It wasn't the Sunderland team beaten by eight goals by Ronald Koeman's Southampton, it was an even worse version and Suarez took full advantage. He tapped in a Daniel Sturridge cross in the first half and lifted his shirt to reveal the words 'Welcome Benja' to mark the birth of his son Benjamin. So confident was he of scoring again he wore a different 'Welcome Benja' shirt under his Liverpool shirt in the second half and duly scored again from another Sturridge assist. One of the advantages for him that day was that although he was coming back from a long lay-off he was returning to very familiar surroundings. He had built-up a good understanding with Daniel Sturridge and when the SAS got going again, it was as if Suarez had never been away. That will not be the case this time. SNM is a fledgling threesome and apart from training sessions, there has been no opportunity for Barcelona to play Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi together. What they have been able to do however is ensure that the system employed by the team fits perfectly with the incoming Suarez. Messi has played ever so slightly deeper and whoever has played on the right of the front three, where Suarez can expect to be used if he starts the game, has been given license to run into the centre-forward territory which will suit the Uruguayan perfectly.

"Dogs were man’s best friend as far back as the Ice Age, claim scientists. A new study has shown that dogs and humans first bonded between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago. That was when wolves, ancestors of domestic dogs living today, were first tamed by ancient hunter gatherers, according to genetic evidence. Early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators. Pictured is skull of a 26,000-year-old Ice Age wolf from the Trou des Nutons cave in Belgium. Researchers believe early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators . The findings challenge a previous theory that dog domestication happened some 15,000 years ago in eastern Asia, after the introduction of agriculture. In reality, the history of the bond between dog and man appears to go back much further, to a time when fur-clad humans were living in caves and hunting woolly mammoths. Scientists used DNA analysis to establish what populations of wolves were most related to living dogs.

DNA from domestic dogs most closely matched that extracted from the fossil bones of ancient European Ice Age wolves, as well as modern wolves. There was little similarity with DNA from wolves, coyotes and dingos from other parts of the world. The Finnish and German team wrote in the journal Science: ‘Conceivably, proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defence from large competing predators at kills.’ Dog domestication of a ‘large and dangerous carnivore’ was likely to have occurred partly by accident, possibly after wolves were attracted to hunter camp sites by the smell of fresh meat. The research contradicts earlier studies which suggested that early farming brought wolves sniffing around villages, leading to them forming relationships with humans. ‘Dogs were our companions long before we kept goats, sheep or cattle,’ said Professor Johannes Krause, one of the researchers from Tubingen University in Germany. The scientists analysed a particular type of DNA found in mitochondria - tiny power stations within cells that generate energy. Unlike nuclear DNA found in the hearts of cells, mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from mothers. This makes it a powerful tool in tracing ancestry.

"GIVE SNOWDROPS A CHANCE . Snowdrops will be pushing their little noses up out of the ground pretty soon. Early varieties such as Galanthus elwesii may be budding or even carry open flowers. If you have snowdrops growing where evergreen herbaceous plants such as epimediums or pulmonarias grow, it may help to clear away some of the leaves to give the snowdrops space. Do this tactfully, removing only moribund or unsightly foliage. Take care not to walk on the ground where you know snowdrops are planted. The emerging shoots are vulnerable and could be crushed. Snowdrops will be pushing their little noses up out of the ground pretty soon. Early varieties such as Galanthus elwesii may be budding or even carry open flowers . Take special care with epimediums. The wiry stems must be cut, rather than pulled. If you try to pull the leaves off, next spring's flowers will come away with the stems and leaves. PROTECT YOUR HOLLY . Birds are getting hungry now and holly berries are magnets for winter thrushes. One doesn't want to rob the poor things but if you plan to gather your own holly for Christmas decorations, it may be wise to protect a small part of your tree with fleece until you've gathered what you need. If you buy your holly, birds may pinch the berries from that, too, especially if you leave it somewhere tempting. Stand holly branches in a can or bucket of water to keep them fresh and leave them out in the cold and wet until you need them for decorations. Birds are getting hungry now and holly berries are magnets for winter thrushes . PRUNE THOSE BLACKCURRANTS . Blackcurrants produce their best fruit on stems which grew from the base of the plant last summer. To maximise next year's crop, prune them now. On mature bushes — more than four years old — remove any thin, weedy stems. Then, beginning with the oldest, cut a third of all basal stems back to the bottom of the plant. Make sure you leave an evenly distributed number of stems, preferably with a hollowed-out centre of the bush. That will enable air to circulate more freely among the branches and for the fruits to receive maximum light. On young bushes, less than four years old, prune fewer old stems away and be sure to leave six-eight sturdy young stems on each plant.

"A British tourist has died after falling 90 metres from a cliff and hitting the rocks below in Sydney's northern beaches . The man, believed to be a 25-year-old British tourist, fell to his death after he climbed a fence at North Head near Manly at approximately 6.45am on Sunday morning. He walked with friends to the edge of the cliff to watch the sunrise, at which point it's believed he accidentally slipped. Although NSW Police Media are yet to confirm the man's identity, Nine News claim the fall victim was Welsh tourist Gareth Jones. Four 'distressed' witnesses, believed to be the man's friends, are being interviewed by investigators. Two of the friends allegedly climbed down the cliff to reach him with the use of ropes and ladders that are normally used by fisherman, but they found their friend was unresponsive, according to Nine News. Scroll down for video . A 25-year-old international tourist , climbed a fence at North Head near Manly at approximately 7.30am on Sunday morning, and walked to the edge of the cliff before slipping . Police from NSW Police Rescue Unit made efforts to retrieve the man's body, which was brought up from the cliff at 11.30am and placed into the care of authorities. 'It looks like a tragic accident and we feel for all of the people that were there and obviously our thoughts will be with his family when we inform them,' Inspector Belinda Caddy told Nine News. The clifftops at North Head are well known for the panoramic view they show of Sydney Harbour and skyline, and are a popular tourist destination on the northern beaches. The friends were sitting on the cliff's edge to watch the sunrise when tragedy struck, Inspector Nigel Taylor told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'When they returned to the lookout, the young fella has gone to have a closer look and fallen over the edge,' Inspector Taylor said. Police have also issued a serious warning to people who visit such lookouts and coastal areas. For their own safety, citizens have been told that they must never climb over fences and into restricted areas as they will be at risk of serious injury or death. Four witnesses, believed to be the man's friends, are being interviewed by investigators . 'It looks like a tragic accident at this stage,' a police spokesperson said . The incident comes after a spate of similar incidents in the past months, including a woman who fell to her death in the Blue Mountains while meditating with friends near the edge of a cliff. In November, Megan Moody, 38, fell to her death when she slipped off a 25 metre cliff at Tahmoor in south western Sydney. Her partner, Paul Vietch, witnessed her fall, and had taken out an Apprehended Violence Order against Ms Moody in the months leading up to her death. In the same month in South Maroubra, on Sydney's eastern beaches, two fishermen dropping a 20 meter line off a cliff were criticised for risking a similar fate.","25-year-old British male tourist was with four friends in Sydney's northern beaches .

"Even in the animal world the young can annoy their parents and this leopard cub shows felines are no exception. This is the moment a young male initiates a play fight as he jumps on his mother at the Kruger National Park in South Africa. The young leopard was spotted calmly walking alongside his mother before being overcome by an urge to play and pouncing on his unsuspecting parent. Scroll down for video . A young male leopard cub pounces on his mother in order to initiate a play fight at the Kruger National Park in South Africa . The leopards stand on their powerful hind legs as they wrestle and tussle among the long grass of the game reserve . The male cub attacked the older cat and tried to get her to join in the fun  - apparently unaware she was becoming quite aggravated. The pictures show the older animal initially looking rather annoyed and the two tussle for a short time before she defeats him. However, it would appear all is forgiven following the spat as the two lie down together side by side and the mother gives her cub an affectionate lick on the head. Play fighting is a very important part of growing up for leopards, which are fundamentally solitary creatures, as it teaches them essential fighting skills and encourages them to feel a sense of dominance.

"George Osborne today tore into the Lib Dems, accusing his coalition partners of risking 'chaos' in the economy. The Chancellor called on the Lib Dems to lay out plans for 'hefty' income tax rises after the election to deal with the deficit. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg hit back, and said the Tories had to 'come clean' about closing colleges and libraries, and cutting police budgets to make their figures add up. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne warned the Lib Dems' economic plans would wreak 'chaos' by imposing 'hefty' tax rises . The Tories are also furious that Vince Cable hailed the Autumn Statement as 'excellent' in a meeting for the Cabinet before criticising it in public. Tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of Mr Osborne's mini-Budget, in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises, but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books. The Lib Dems sought to insist scrapping the 'slab' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007, while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £10,600. Both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads, housing and flood defences. But the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £91billion has caused bitter divisions. The Tories say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts, with welfare bearing the brunt. But the Lib Dems argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes, including a mansion tax on £2million homes. Mr Osborne insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the Lib Dems would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall. 'It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think,' Mr Osborne wrote in The Sunday Times. 'While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts. 'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone. 'If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Tories had to 'come clean' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone . In a direct pitch for voters to give the Tories an overall majority in 2015, Mr Osborne insisted both Labour and the Lib Dems were a risk to the economy. The Chancellor added: 'The battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week. There's a clear choice: a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives.' However, Mr Clegg hit back, claiming it was not possible to tackle the deficit through spending cuts alone. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I think it is impossible to balance the books, shrink the state, deliver unfunded tax cuts and protect the public services that people treasure, supporting the police, supporting the NHS, the schools and colleges. 'I do think the Conservatives need to come clean. How many colleges will be closed? How many police need to be taken off our streets?' With five months to go until the general election, there are increasingly bitter divisions in the coalition between the two parties. Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Last week Mr Osborne claimed the Lib Dems signed up to government spending plans in private but now 'slag them off' in public. After the Chancellor presented the details of the Autumn Statement to the Cabinet on Wednesday morning, Mr Cable described it as 'excellent'. But later that day he said he 'did not recognise' the Chancellor's plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19. He also said: 'We do have differences in emphasis. The Tories would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable.' 'He told everyone how good he thought it was, and then went out and criticised it,' said a Cabinet source.","Bitter divisions in the coalition over cuts to come after 2015 election .

"A Tory MP caught playing a computer game during a meeting in Parliament is to escape punishment – but the whistleblower who exposed him could lose their job. Nigel Mills admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush and promised not to do it again after footage emerged of him playing on his taxpayer-funded iPad. But while he will face no further action, the person who filmed him looks likely to lose their job after Commons authorities launched a mole hunt to find the culprit. Caught in the act: This is Tory MP Nigel Mills playing Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad last Monday during a crucial committee hearing on the future of pensions . A Commons spokesman said the footage, taken over Mr Mills’ shoulder, broke parliamentary rules. ‘This was a breach of the filming rules for House of Commons Committee Rooms, and will be investigated by the Serjeant at Arms,’ the spokesman said. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee last Monday. However, he spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen as he tried to complete levels of the popular game. Distracted: The MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire was spotted closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen with his finger as he attempted to complete levels of popular app the Candy Crush Saga . Could one of these be the Candy Crush whistleblower? Footage  shows these two people were alternately sitting behind the MP - although it is possible the incident was filmed by someone hidden from view . Mr Mills, 40, who is defending a majority of just 536, apologised unreservedly for falling ‘short of what is expected of a Member of Parliament’. He had initially said he would merely ‘try’ not to be diverted by the game again, but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said: ‘I guarantee it will not happen again. It is a fantastic privilege to represent Amber Valley and I hope constituents will continue to support my campaigns.’ Footage of the committee meeting shows a male and a female sound technician sitting behind Mr Mills who both appear to be using mobile phones, but it is not clear if one of them was responsible for filming him or whether another person off camera captured his gaming on film. MP Nigel Mills was seen enjoying a game of Candy Crush on his iPad during a hearing in Parliament . Commons rules state that: ‘No one should photograph, film or sketch or have their voice recorded anywhere within the Parliamentary Estate without permission. ‘Anyone who attempts to do so, or to market, publish or transmit such material will be referred to Black Rod or the Serjeant at Arms. This could prejudice their future admission to the Houses of Parliament.’ Yesterday pictures emerged of Mr Mills – who was one of 90 MPs given expensive iPads as part of an agreement to use less paper in meetings – using his iPad in three other Commons committee meetings in the past month. Addictive: Candy Crush is incredibly popular - with more than 700 million games played on mobile devices . Gail Dolman, a Labour councillor in his constituency, said: ‘I think it’s disgusting. He’s an MP and I find it very worrying.’ But David Cameron – himself a self-confessed games addict – described him as a hardworking MP. ‘I know him well, he fights very hard in his constituency for people in Derbyshire, he works very hard in Parliament,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘I’m sure he will be embarrassed and he will work even harder in the future.’ Mr Cameron previously admitted to being addicted to mobile games Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Asked what level the PM had reached on Candy Crush, his spokesman said: ‘On that line of questioning, Game Over.’ Tory MP Graham Evans, who was sitting next to Mr Mills, said he had not noticed him playing the game during the meeting. He said: ‘We all look at our iPads. Perhaps we should all pay more attention. Nigel played a full part in that meeting, he is a bright lad.’ Sir Edward Leigh, Tory MP for Gainsborough, suggested critics should ‘get a life’. ‘I survived nine years as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and I just about managed not to go to sleep and not to play computer games but my God, it was boring.’ he told the BBC. ‘So if Nigel has to keep himself awake by playing computer games, good on him.’ The Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds 'addictive' and is said to love Fruit Ninja on the iPad . David Cameron is likely to be furious that one of his MPs got caught playing games at work - although the Prime Minister himself is known to a fan of 'chillaxing' on his iPad. The Prime Minister, a fan of Apple's trendy tablet computer, is said to be obsessed with the cult game Fruit Ninja, in which players swipe their fingers across a screen to slice through moving images of pieces of melon, orange and pineapple. Mr Cameron is thought to have taken up Fruit Ninja after completing the hit game Angry Birds. In a separate interview the Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds 'addictive', but denied it was taking up too much of his time. He said: 'It is quite addictive, but I want to reassure you I don't spend a huge amount of time on it. 'Sometimes on these long flights, when you have done all your  work, you have had all your conversations and prepared all your speeches, you need something to relax with. 'Sometimes I watch a bit of television, sometimes I play a bit of Angry Birds.' A book published in 2012 revealed how the Prime Minister liked to wind down away from work. It was said that Mr Cameron's friends gave him a karaoke machine, which is now at No 10 and he invites friends over for game of snooker. There is a machine that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister in the 2010 General Elections. The book, Cameron: Practically a Conservative, serialised in The Times told how Mr Cameron flicks through the papers early on a Sunday morning and spends his time at his computer. His afternoon consists of 'a crap film on telly, play with the children, cook, have three or four glasses of wine with lunch, have an afternoon nap, play tennis,' according to a friend quoted in the newspaper. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and a family friend, told the authors: 'He is the model of how to have a clear divide between the world of work and then relaxation so you can clear your mind. There are very few people who have such a finely developed capacity to do that.'","Nigel Mills was supposed to be listening to pensions experts give evidence .

"It may have been 200 years ago, but plans for a re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo are reportedly being adjusted to avoid creating any tension between the British and French. The re-enactment of the historic defeat of the French forces, led by Napoleon Bonaparte in the battle on June 18, 1815, is due to take place next year. The battle was fought near Waterloo, which is now Belgium, and saw 25,000 French troops killed or wounded as the Duke of Wellington led Allied troops to victory, along with General Blücher from Prussia. Adjustments to a re-enactment of the 200 year anniversary of the Allied victory at the Battle of Waterloo, due to take place next year, are reportedly being made to avoid creating tension between the French and British. The battle, which saw 15,000 of Napoleon's troops killed or injured is captured in this painting from 1815 . Wellington's victory over Napoleon's 72,000-strong army however was fairly close, as 15,000 of his own troops were left dead or wounded after the fighting. He acknowledged this when he described the Allied win as a 'near run-thing' when the battle ended almost 23 years of war. And while the re-enactment will be kept historically accurate, it is claimed some adjustments have been made to ensure it is not too damaging to relations between the two countries, the Sunday Times reported. Instead of being held on just one day the staged battle will take place over two days - with day one ending with a stronger French side. The next day 80,000 people will watch the Allied army - a coalition of British, Dutch, Belgian and German soldiers - counterattack and achieve victory. This will represent the end of hours of bloody fighting which took place in 1815. Napoleon may be played by Mark Schneider, an American, and around a third of his troops are likely to be from the UK. Frank Samson, a Frenchman, is also reported to be in the running to play Napoleon. Etienne Claude, director-general of Waterloo 200 - the group organising the re-enactment - said the battle was not a defeat of the French but 'a defeat of Napoleon.' He said: 'The spectacle of the first day is not to win or lose by the French army. It's part of the historical reality.' Mark Schneider (left), an American actor who has played Napoleon dozens of times is rumoured to be in the running to play Napoleon (right) in the re-enactment to mark 200 years since the Battle of Waterloo . Mr Claude said there are also plans for a VIP battlefield ceremony, which will see President Francois Hollande invited along with descendants of the Duke of Wellington. Other proposals thought to be under consideration include head of government marking the occasion during a routine meeting of EU leaders due to be held a week later. However some believe the re-enactment should not be a 'watered down' version of history. Vince Law, whose great-great-great grandfather served as one of Wellington's foot soldiers said he thought the bicentary of Tralfalgar 'took political correctness too far.' The adjustments will not be the first time Britain has avoided damaging French pride through staging historical events. In 2005 a re-enactment of the Battle of Trafalgar saw a sea battle between red and blue teams take place, representing the French and Spanish navies and the Royal Navy. The battle was one of the most decisive naval victories, with 22 ships lost by the Franco-Spanish fleet, and none by the British.","Re-enactment to mark 200 years since Battle of Waterloo will place in 2015 .

"Criticism: Thomas Docherty, Labour’s shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘This is a zombie government completely out of ideas' MPs were last night accused of working ‘part-time’ after it emerged they will only have to spend two full days a week in Parliament until the election. From this week, they will be allowed to leave Westminster to begin their weekend as early as Wednesday afternoons because of a lack of legislation to pass. Backbench and opposition MPs have accused the Government of presiding over a ‘zombie Parliament’ with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats unable to agree on major new laws. Despite the logjam, the Coalition will go on until May because of a law creating fixed-term parliaments of five years. The Government Chief Whip Michael Gove informed all 303 Tory MPs in a note last month that there will be no major legislation on Thursdays for the foreseeable future. It means the politicians, who are paid £67,060 a year, are now expected to attend Parliament for just two-and-a-half days from 2.30pm on Mondays to the end of business on Wednesdays. Thursdays will be treated as a one-line whip, meaning attendance is not required. Departmental questions and backbench debates will continue to be held in the Commons, but few are expected to stay behind. With no crunch votes to stay for, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are also likely to return home to campaign for votes ahead of next year’s election. John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, accused the Coalition of creating ‘part-time MPs’. He said: ‘The Government is nervous about the election. What they are trying to do is give their MPs time off to fight off the electoral challenge. It is to encourage part-time MPs out electioneering. It shows the Coalition government has run out of steam and cannot agree on anything.’ Thomas Docherty, Labour’s shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘This is a zombie government completely out of ideas. They are doing the parliamentary equivalent of twiddling their thumbs.’ Two-day week: From this week, MPs will be allowed to leave Westminster to begin their weekend as early as Wednesday afternoons because of a lack of legislation to pass. Above, the Houses of Parliament . Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, described it as a ‘farcical situation’. He said: ‘We need a general election, but we cannot have one. So we’re going to have to go through another six months of this charade of Coalition. ‘The Lib Dems are basically trying to ride two horses at the same time – one being part of government and the other being against the government. It makes for a farcical situation and it is no way to govern.’ Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to introduce the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in a deal with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The commitment – which was enacted in September 2011 – was supposed to guarantee stability following the formation of the Coalition. Critics say that the five-year term is too long and has led to the impasse, but a backbench attempt to repeal the act was rejected earlier this year. Sir Edward Leigh, Tory MP for Gainsborough, said the legislation was ‘a hash job’ and ‘never thought through properly’. He told a backbench debate that it was ‘a constitutional aberration’ – and that it ‘could and does result in zombie government’. The Commons only met on 162 days during the 2013/14 session, compared to most people’s average working year of 224 days. A Tory spokesman said: ‘As advice to Conservative MPs made clear, if there is a three line whip then MPs will be required to be in Parliament, as has always been the case. And just as has always been the case, if there is not a three line whip, they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead.’","Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are unable to agree on legislation .

"Paris could become a ‘semi-pedestrianised’ city in plans set out by the mayor to tackle traffic and pollution. Anne Hidalgo said she wanted to ban diesel cars from the city centre by 2020, while some neighbourhoods would become pedestrian only. She said: ‘In the four central districts, apart from bikes, buses and taxis, the only vehicles allowed will be residents’ cars, delivery vehicles and emergency vehicles.’ Restrictions: Anne Hidalgo said she wanted to limit the traffic on some of the most polluted streets, such as the Champs-Elysees (pictured above), to ‘clean vehicles’. She said 60 per cent of Parisians do not own a car . Paris experiences periodic pollution spikes, forcing the authorities to impose temporary speed limits or even ban vehicles on certain days. Miss Hidalgo, 55, told the Journal de Dimanche that the proposed scheme would start at weekends but could quickly be extended. She also said she wanted to limit the traffic on some of the most polluted streets, such as the Champs-Elysees, to ‘clean vehicles’. She said 60 per cent of Parisians do not own a car. Ms Hidalgo, a member of France’s ruling Socialist Party, said financial incentives would be available for the purchase of more environmentally friendly cars. Bikes are expected to become the favoured form of transport, with cycle lanes ‘doubled by 2020’ as part of a plan that will cost more than £90million. The French capital is the most popular tourist city in the world, with Britons the biggest visitor group, and they frequently complain about the traffic problems. Solution: Bicycles are expected to become the favoured form of transport, with the number of cycle lanes set to be ‘doubled by 2020’ as part of a plan that will cost more than £90million, according to Ms Hidalgo . Pollution increases over the summer forced the city council to impose temporary speed limits on motorists, to ban vehicles with specific number plates from being used on specified days. Ms Hidalgo said she only wanted to see ‘clean vehicles’ in the city, saying: ‘I want diesel cars out of Paris by 2020 and if possible beyond the outer ring road. ‘Today, 60 per cent of Parisians don’t have their own car whereas in 2011, it was 40 per cent. It’s moving quickly’.","Anne Hidalgo said she wanted to ban diesel cars from the city centre .

"Joe DiMaggio's love letter to Marilyn Monroe has sold for $78,125 at a Beverly Hills auction. Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills says the letter, written by the baseball great after Monroe announced she was divorcing him, was sold Saturday to an undisclosed buyer. The letter during their brief, volatile marriage was among 300 items, dubbed 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives,' that went on the block. A handwritten letter from Monroe to her third and final husband, playwright Arthur Miller, sold for $43,750. Monroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed the collection of letters to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. Also up for auction was an old prescription pill bottle from a pharmacy in Bedford. The collection of belongings - which also includes her supposedly-favorite black coat, circa mid-1950s, photographs and other memorabilia - were until now kept by her mentor and coach Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982. Scroll down for video . Once married: Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio were married in 1954 for nine months and DiMaggio wrote Marilyn a touching letter begging her to take him back . Sold: Joe DiMaggio's love letter to Marilyn Monroe has sold for $78,125 at a Beverly Hills auction to an undisclosed buyer . Insightful: This letter was written to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio after she announced she wanted a divorce. In the letter the baseball star begs for his wife not to leave him . Private collection: Over 200 personal belongings of Marilyn Monroe went up for auction in Los Angeles . Intimate: The collection gives a rare insight into the life of the late screen goddess . Personal: Among the items is a prescription bill bottle from a pharmacy in Bedford, New York . For Miss Monroe: Numerous phone messages that were taken at the Beverly Hills Hotel . Bling: The belongings, such as this necklace, were left to mentor and coach Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982 . 'We are all in awe of this opportunity to offer such a rare collection and glimpse into Marilyn Monroe’s life,' said Martin Nolan, Executive Director of Julien’s Auctions. 'You can’t help but get emotional on several levels when you have the chance to read the letters and view some of the photographs and witness Marilyn’s own attempt at correspondence.' The collection is a strange glimpse into the late screen goddess' private world. Arguably the most insightful item is a letter from Joe DiMaggio, written after the baseball star learned his wife wanted a divorce. Monroe made the announcement during a press conference in 1954, nine months after their wedding. 'He writes this amazing letter, beautiful handwriting, very impressive,' Nolan told CCTV. 'But his first and foremost number one concern was he truly loved Marilyn, but he was concerned for her welfare, he felt she looked as though she was about to collapse. 'He didn't like to see her crying. And then he expressed his love, he expresses his regret and apologies if he had anyway hurt her. 'And he is begging her to come back to him. So it's a true love letter.' The most expensive item at the auction is said to be Monroe's favorite - a coat she wore consistently in the mid-1950s. The piece originally sold as part of her estate in 1999, but was expected to fetch at least $120,000. Favorite: This coat is said to have been Monroe's go-to and she wore it consistently . The auction included love letters, photographs, personal items, personal records and documents and other memorabilia . Classic: A three-panel sterling silver custom-made Cartier frame, gifted to Marilyn Monroe by Nedda and Joshua Logan. Inside is a picture taken by Cecil Beaton in 1956, along with a letter from him describing her . 'My darling': One of many love letters sent to Monroe by husband Arthur Miller . Autograph: This slip is believed to be from an item Monroe bought at an auction . Nude: This painting of Monroe was done by Earl Moran, believed to be dated 1946 . 'My Darling, my darling, my poppy': This is a note Monroe was writing back to Arthur Miller but never finished .

"Tony Abbott has endured another awkward grilling on live television after calling Sunrise host David 'Kochie' Koch the wrong name on two occasions. The Prime Minister appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Monday to face questions over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan. But just like his interview with Karl Stefanovic on rival program Today last week, the dialogue with Kochie didn't go so well. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Monday to face questions over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan . The interview started with Kochie quoting the new opinion poll results and saying Mr Abbott was 'now as unpopular as Julia Gillard at her lowest'. 'Well Chris, sorry David... We're not the first government that's had a rough patch in the polls. We're getting on with delivering for the Australian people,' Mr Abbott said. As the Prime Minister listed promises and policies the Liberal government had delivered on in its first year, Kochie interrupted and told him people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken. 'The public feels like you have lied to them consistently over your first term,' Kochie told the PM. The interview started with Kochie quoting the new opinion poll results and saying Mr Abbott was 'now as unpopular as Julia Gillard at her lowest' As the Prime Minister listed promises and policies the Liberal government had delivered on in its first year, Kochie interrupted and told people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken . 'They didn't think they'd get a $7 co-payment or have to pay university fees… all things that you've broken since then. 'Do you need to apologise to the public and say ""Yeah I've let you down, I did lie to you, I did break a lot of promises but hey I'm going to rebuild from here?"".' After repeated questions from Kochie asking if the Prime Minister would apologise to the public, Mr Abbott slipped up on his name again. 'Well Chris, Kochie, I do not accept the accusations that you’re making. I just don’t accept them,' he said shaking his head. 'I think there are a lot of things that people have said and frankly a lot of these so called commitments were commitments other people had attributed to us post the election.' Sunrise host Kochie repeatedly asked Mr Abbott is he was going to apologise to the public over his broken election promises . Mr Abbott had a radio interview with the ABC's Chris Uhlmann prior to Sunrise, which may explain the slip-up. In last week's interview on Channel Nine, Mr Abbott took aim at the Labor party saying they were trying to sabotage the government's budget and he wished they weren't 'in such a feral mood'. Karl Stefanovic hit back by saying he was exactly the same in Opposition. 'With respect you were fairly feral in Opposition weren't you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and ... why would (Bill Shorten) do anything different when it worked for you?' Stefanovic asked. 'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse. 'No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.' It comes a just week after Mr Abbott came under fire from Channel Nine's Karl Stefanovic .

"As the saying goes - 'you are what you eat' and as summer sets in Aussies are firing up the barbecues which naturally begs the question - which steak sums up your personality? Most people would order a steak without realising they can be psychoanalysed but new research shows your preferred type of meat tends to exhibit distinct personality traits. With 68 per cent of Aussies most likely to cook steak on the barbie this summer - Daily Mail Australia reveals the seven ‘steaketypes’ that outline key characteristics you are likely to have, based on your choice of meat. Anthony Puharich, of Vic’s Premium Quality Meat and Victor Churchill, explains why the cut of steak you love to eat can sum you up in a heartbeat in recent statistics from Meat and Livestock Australia. Scroll down for video . Rump is the number one choice for Australians with 46 per cent preferring the cut of meat . The Rump steak is the choice of those who have a favourite routine. It represents people who are dependable and reliable (46 per cent of Australians) 'Rump is a more predictable meat because it's one of those cuts that most people are familiar with and gravitate towards as it's a no-brainer.' 'Most pubs have a good rump on the menu.' T-Bone lovers are salad dodgers who are exuberant and humble . The T-Bone steak is preferred by the salad dodger.

"Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, last night called for the introduction of state-run food banks after being 'shocked' by the hungry in Britain . The Archbishop of Canterbury was warned not to become a ‘political pawn’ last night after calling for state-backed food banks. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he had been left more shocked by the plight of Britain’s hunger-stricken poor than those suffering in African refugee camps. His comments came before the publication of a wide-ranging report, backed by the Archbishop, that calls for the Government to do more to eradicate hunger. But yesterday senior Tories criticised the clergyman for supporting the ‘nationalisation’ of food banks. In addition, the MPs’ study found that families’ lack of money was not the only problem. The all-party Commons group on hunger warned that some parents spend far too much money on cigarettes, alcohol, takeaways and other ‘non-essential items of expenditure’ because they lack basic budgeting skills. Many more cannot cook even the simplest meals for their children – leaving them to go hungry. The MPs call upon teachers to do more to report parents from chaotic households so they can receive help from ‘troubled families’ units. However, they conclude: ‘We should not leave the duty resting with schools. Parents have duties, and these duties are not abated by the chaos resulting from their lifestyle.’ The report, Feeding Britain, is released today. Chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, the all-party group calls for: . The Archbishop wrote in the Mail on Sunday how hunger ‘stalks large parts’ of the country. He added that he found the plight of a British family who resorted to using a food bank ‘more shocking’ than terrible suffering in Africa because it was so unexpected. Last night former Cabinet minister David Mellor said: ‘He’s fully entitled to make points about food banks. Where they get it wrong is talking about the Government having to do food banks. A report into hunger in Britain found that families' lack of money was not the only barrier to buying food, and that many spent money on alcohol and cigarettes instead (pictured, a woman works in a food bank) ‘My understanding of religion ... is it’s about religious responsibility. 'I don’t remember any part of the Gospel where people were told to queue up outside Pontius Pilate’s office and tell him to give more money to the poor. [The Archbishop] should allow himself to be aware that he shouldn’t be used as a pawn in a political game.’ Tory business minister Matt Hancock stressed that food bank dependency had risen under the Coalition in part due to greater awareness. ‘Before we came to power, food banks were not allowed to advertise their existence,’ he said. ‘One of the reasons for the increase in use is because more people know about them.’ David Mellor said the Archbishop risked becoming a 'political pawn' after he called for the state to intervene and run food banks . Damian Green, the former immigration minister, said: ‘We have a welfare state now, but what they’re saying is the welfare state should take over food banks, should nationalise food banks.’ The all-party report also discloses the ‘unpleasant truth’ that some children are hungry when they get to school because of the ‘chaotic conditions in their homes’. ‘A large proportion of primary schools that submitted evidence to the inquiry said they had witnessed children arriving at school hungry because their parents could not, or would not, wake them up to make them breakfast, or bring them to the school breakfast club,’ the report says. Another factor behind parental poverty is the addictions that many families face. ‘Budgeting support is terribly important, but ... is often not enough to equip families to kick their addictive habits when addiction is being fed and defended by some very powerful lobbies,’ it warns. The report says some parents are so tempted by cheap alcohol in supermarkets, and the plethora of betting shops on high streets, that they spend money on these rather than food for their children. ‘A family earning £21,000 a year, for example, where both parents smoke 20 cigarettes a day will spend a quarter of their income on tobacco,’ it adds. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg backed the report, saying he agreed with introducing ‘yellow cards’ for benefit claimants.","Justin Welby last night called for state to take over running food banks .

"World No 1 Serena Williams backed the searing Perth conditions as perfect preparation for her Australian Open title bid but the weather proved too hot for Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who was thrashed in Sunday's Hopman Cup opener. Williams will pair up with John Isner for the United States in the mixed-team event in Western Australia this week as the 18-time grand slam singles champion bids for a sixth title at the Melbourne showpiece later this month. Temperatures in Perth are expected to reach 41 degrees Celsius and Williams, who won the last of her Australian Open titles in 2010, said she was looking forward to the warm feeling in Monday's opener against Italy after a cool winter at home. Serena Williams said she was determined to win in Melbourne, where here last title came in 2010 . The World No 1 took time out before the Hopman cup in Perth to see some of the Australian wildlife . 'If anything it's going to help me for Melbourne,' Williams told reporters on Sunday. 'Perth is one of the most hottest places I've ever played, so it will be really good for the preparation in Melbourne, which is always super hot. 'I haven't won in Australia for several years, but there's also a lot of other people who want too. I'll just have to do my best.' With Flavia Pennetta, Czech Lucie Safarova and Bouchard as opponents in the round robin matches at the Hopman Cup, Williams will have no dearth of quality opposition. Eugenie Bouchard struggled in the intense conditions, picking up four games during an emphatic defeat . Lucie Safarova plays a shot in her dominant win, and said afterwards that it was the best possible start . 'The women's field is excellent here. It's going to be great,' the 33-year-old said. 'More than anything it's a great time to get match play and not get stressed out too much. 'Usually I'm really stressed (in knockout tournaments), so this will be really good for me.' The 27-year-old Safarova showed she had adjusted quickest to the conditions in Perth as she breezed past world number seven Bouchard 6-0 6-4. Bouchard looked off the pace as her preparations for the Australian Open in Melbourne took a blow . Safarova and Bouchard joined Adam Pavlasek and Vasek Pospisil for the doubles, which the Czechs won . 'It's the best way I could imagine and I started really strong and was pressuring her from the first point,' said the world number 16. 'I had a really hard and good off season in Florida and another week at home in Czech and I came here, it's the fifth day here, so I've had time to adjust to the hot conditions.' Safarova later teamed up with Adam Pavlasek, who lost his singles match to Vasek Pospisil, to win the mixed doubles and lead Czech Republic to a win over Canada.","Serena Williams aiming for a sixth title in Melbourne later this month .

"Australian Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett is making his return to competitive swimming, announcing that he will compete at the national titles next year. The 34-year-old revealed his comeback to The Sunday Telegraph, just two months after he was first pictured back at training with his former coach Denis Cotterell. Hackett will race at the titles in Sydney in 2015, and is living on the Gold Coast training after quitting his job at Westpac. The triple-Olympic gold medallist has previously denied that he was using his base on Queensland's glitzy strip to mount a comeback to competitive swimming, or that he is charging toward the 2016 Rio Olympics. Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett, pictured here training back in October,  has announced his return to competitive swimming . According to the Telegraph he is now training alongside friend and ironman Ky Hurst, and swimming six days a week under Cotterell while mentoring some of the younger members of the team. Hackett told the newspaper he is wary of staging a 'fantasy' comeback as former rival Ian Thorpe did unsuccessfully, and said it would be disrespectful to suggest he could do successfully what Thorpe could not. '(Thorpe) didn't make comebacks look overly attractive, it was probably more of a deterrent,' he said. He also said it would be disrespectful to claim he could master a comeback while Thorpe, who he could not beat in his prime, could not. Hackett added that his age was also a potential hurdle, but he is in a better place mentally and physically than he has been for a decade. Hackett is in his best shape in years, and said he is feeling better than he has in a decade. He is pictured left in 2008 and right in October 2014 . The swimming star stopped short of admitting he was embarking on a full comeback, saying he currently is happy swimming for his club . 'I probably haven't felt this good since 2003 or 2004 ... This year I've just really got my passion back for it,' the former Olympian told the Telegraph. The 34-year-old also revealed that his body has responded better than expected to intense training, and he has regained fitness levels surprisingly quickly. Hackett said his focus is on competing in a club relay with his teammates, he would be happy to go further if circumstances allowed. When asked by journalist Todd Balym whether he would consider competing for Australia if his times allowed, Hackett didn't shoot the idea down. Hackett, here training in October, previously denied any return to the pool saying his focus was simply to keep fit . He won three gold medals during his swimming career, before his retirement in 2008 . The swimmer admitted he would 'never say never' to racing in the relay team for his country again. Just two months ago Daily Mail Australia published what Hackett's manager Chris White believed to be the first images of the swimming star in the pool since his retirement in 2008. Hackett told Daily Mail Australia at the time he was just enjoying his return to the water after a tumultuous six years since his retirement. 'I'm thoroughly enjoying being back on the Gold Coast,' he said, 'and I'm keen to remain fit, enjoy a healthy lifestyle and re-establish myself with the community here,' the 24-year-old said. 'Swimming is the ideal mix for both.' He would not be drawn into speculation regarding his future in the sport, other than to say the training regime back in October was just part of his goal to 'remain fit.'","Grant Hackett has announced his return to competitive swimming .

"The mother of a British jihadist who was jailed for 12 years for going to Syria to join a group linked to Al-Qaeda says she was betrayed by the police and courts over her son's long prison sentence. Yusuf Sarwar, a student from Birmingham, left a note telling his mother he had gone to Syria  fight against 'Allah's enemies' in May last year. His mother Majida Sarwar showed the note to the police, and her son, who travelled to the war zone to join Islamic extremists with former postal worker Mohammed Ahmed, was arrested on his return this January. Scroll down for video . Yusuf Sarwar (pictured) and Mohammed Ahmed, both 22, fled Britain for Syria to 'do jihad', but Sarwar's mother says she was betrayed by the police and courts following her son's 12-year sentence . At her son's court case, a judge praised 'brave' Ms Sarwar for telling the authorities about his plans, but now she says she was betrayed by the legal system. Speaking to the Observer, Ms Sarwar said: 'This is not justice. They said I was doing the right thing, that when my son came back they would try to help, but this terrible sentence – all they have done was to set me against my son. 'The police say ""mothers come forward"", you can trust us, we will help. But now they will see what happened to my son. What kind of person would go to the police if they think their son will get 12 years in prison? Nobody wants to do that. I did not want that. 'My husband just sits silently most of the time, crying a lot.' The family were told that the 22-year-old, whose grandfather served with the British Army, might expect a two-year sentence, they said. Ms Sawar said her son wanted to come home and that she would have met him in Turkey but was warned not to by the Foreign Office and the police. 'My son is not a terrorist, he didn’t make bombs, he didn’t kill anyone, he tried to help. He did a stupid thing and when he realised this he wanted to come home,' she said. Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later. It read: 'Make sure you don't get any authority involved its (sic) a kuffar (infidel) government. 'I will try to intercede for you but don't rely on my intercession for if Allah allows me to intercede make sure to perfect yourselfs (sic). 'Make sure to keep me in your dua (prayers) as I am doing the best deed in Allahs eyes in'shaa' Allah. 'I will be going to Sumya (Syria) Ash sham which I will help the oppressed and fight Allahs enemies there. 'Taliban, Al Quada (sic) etc are not bad the West portrays them as bad. 'The group I will be joining is Kataib Al Muhajireen which is part of Al Nusra. In 'shaa' Allah . 'WE WOULD STAND UP AND NEVER WOULD LET ALLAHS RELIGION BE DEMONISED' On Friday, Woolwich Crown Court heard the pair ordered books Islam For Dummies, The Koran For Dummies and Arabic For Dummies from Amazon ahead of their trip. Ahmed also told his childhood friend Sarwar: 'I cannot tell anyone I'm going to do jihad. Lol. I'll get arrested' just before they left Birmingham and joined rebels in Aleppo. The men were arrested on their return to the UK and pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. Judge Michael Topolski QC said: 'They willingly, enthusiastically and with a great deal of purpose, persistence and determination embarked on a course intended to commit acts of terrorism.' After eight months fighting in Syria, they were arrested on at Heathrow Airport in January because their worried families  tipped off counter-terrorism detectives. The judge said they believed in 'violent Islamist extremism' and praised the 'extraordinarily brave' mother who reported her  son to the police. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'Without the mother's actions, the police would not have been in a position to be waiting for the men on their return.' The judge said they had made a careful plan 'to join the ranks of the Islamist forces', adding 'before travelling, you both went to some trouble to fabricate cover-stories'. The judge said both men 'intended to be martyred on the battlefield in Syria' and plotted 'to attack Assad's forces, with the obvious risk that these intended attacks may have resulted in both military and civilian losses'. He also discussed a note written from Sarwar to his mother, which hailed the Taliban. 'Its contents provide an insight into the true purpose of your journey. 'This was not a spontaneous response to travel to a humanitarian crisis. Without any doubt, it shows you were travelling to Syria intent on jihad'. Sarwar (left) and Ahmed, both from Birmingham, fled to the war-torn country in May last year after contacting Islamic extremists online . Reference books: The pair bought Islam for Dummies, The Koran for dummies and Arabic for Dummies from Amazon ahead of their Syria trip, where they spent eight months fighting in Aleppo . He said the sentences were designed to 'punish, deter and incapacitate' and 'both of these defendants are fundamentalists who became interested in and then deeply committed to violent extremism'. He said he could not be sure the defendants planned to launch attacks in Britain, but noted 'the retention of the disk, containing detailed instructions of how to make an IED, is a deeply disturbing feature'. He handed both men a jail term of 12 years and 8 months, to be followed by five years on extended license. They will be also be subject to counter-terror notification requirements for 30 years. The court heard the men fled to Syria claiming it was a university trip elsewhere but after returning to Britain they told officers they had been doing humanitarian work but a camera containing 'thousands' of images, including some of them posing with guns on the front line, was found in their luggage. Traces of 'military-grade explosives', including TNT and nitro-glycerine were on the men's clothes and trainers. Sarwar's family reported him missing to police in May last year after they found a hand-written letter from him in which said he had left to join a terrorist group called Kataib al Muhajireen (KaM) - later renamed Kateeba al-Kawthar - 'to do jihad'. Family: Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later . Ruse: The pair said they were travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University (pictured at Heathrow) but they then went on to Syria . Officers also found social media and email conversations between the pair and Islamic extremists. Over Skype, Ahmed talked to a Swedish national who was fighting with KaM. He told the fighter: 'I come to join KaM,' to which the Swede replies: 'Inshallah (God willing)'. Ahmed later asked a Danish Islamic extremist: 'Would the brothers in Yemen accept me?' The families of both men had put pressure on them to return to the UK once they discovered where they were. Days earlier he had told his family he was travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University, where he was a part-time computer science student. It prompted a search of the men's homes, which revealed an online conversation between Ahmed and a Swedish national fighting with the KaM, during which Ahmed said he wanted to join the terrorist group. West Midlands Police said the men showed the mind-set to go and join the jihad in Syria, before carrying out research, buying equipment, and finally travelling their via Turkey. Ahmed, who was born in Bangladesh, moved to Britain as a child, while Sarwar, who is of Pakistani descent, was born in Britain. An initial search of their homes revealed images of Islamic propaganda on both of their computers, including images of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) flags, shaheed (martyr) literature and several texts which are linked to the jihadi mindset.","Mother of British jihadist Yusuf Sarwar says she was betrayed by the police .

"Miro doesn't know it yet, but his life is about to change. The one-year-old Numbat has lived at Perth Zoo since birth under the watchful eyes of keepers, who have had to met his challenging diet requirement of 20,000 termites a day. Very few people have seen a numbat other than on Western Australia's animal emblem or in photos, and with good reason. The small marsupial is well camouflaged, fast and endangered. 13 Numats, including one-year-old Miro (pictured) are set to be released into their natural habitat after a life living at Perth Zoo as a part of the world's only Numbat . There are less than 1000 numbats left in the wild as the species is threatened by loss of habitat and predators including foxes and cats. But for the first time since the world's only numbat recovery program started in 1987, a group of numbats will be released into Dryandra Woodlands where the original breeding stock was captured. On Friday, Miro and 13 other numbats will make the state's western Wheatbelt their new home and take with them a radio tracking collar and the promise of boosting the population. Department of Parks and Wildlife researcher Tony Friend said once the numbats had established their home range, which can be up to 50ha, they'll stay there for the rest of their lives. Dr Friend said numbats were solitary and sensible creatures, taking siestas at midday and staying out of each others way until breeding season. There are less than 1000 numbats left in the wild as the species is threatened by loss of habitat and predators including foxes and cats .

Numbat keeper Vicki Power said people have flown to Perth just to see the elusive creature, which is one of Australia's truly diurnal marsupials, meaning it's only active during the day. 'It amazes me that they persist as a species when you think about how small and vulnerable they really are,' Ms Power said.

"Nigel Farage has been branded 'silly and dangerous' after blaming immigrants for clogging up Britain's roads for him missing an event charging Ukip supporters to meet him. The Ukip leader said he arrived too late for a £25-a-head drinks reception in Port Talbot because the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'. And he vowed to continue speaking his mind, warning he will not be 'brow beaten' into becoming a 'vanilla' politician, despite a storm of criticism over his suggestion that breastfeeding women should sit in a corner. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was challenged on BBC Sunday Politics Wales about why he missed an event charging party members £25 to meet him . Ukip held its first ever Welsh National Conference at the weekend, with Mr Farage delivering a speech to activists on Saturday. But he had been due to mingle with paying guests at a reception on Friday night. Around 100 Ukip members paid £25 each for tickets for the event at the Orangery in Margam Country Park, Port Talbot. But the leader failed to turn up, hours after complaining that his chauffeur and security is paid for by Ukip and not the taxpayer. In an interview broadcast yesterday, Mr Farage blamed immigration for there being too many cars on the roads to make the 180-mile journey from London to Port Talbot in south Wales. And he hit back at criticism that the no-show was further evidence of his party lacking professionalism. He told BBC Sunday Politics Wales: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be. 'In all these years in Ukip that's probably about the third event out of a thousand that I haven't made in time.' Mr Farage complained that the M4, linking London to south Wales, was the 'not as navigable as it used to be' Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn said it was right that Mr Farage led from the front . A senior Ukip figure has appeared to suggest that Nigel Farage is a 'control freak' in the way he runs the party. Patrick O'Flynn said policy decisions were a 'sort of collective operation' but Mr Farage is the 'dominant figure' in the party. The economic spokesman announced that Ukip could look at introducing a luxury goods levy - quickly dubbed the WAG tax - at the party's annual conference but was slapped down within hours by the leader. He told BBC One's Sunday Politics 'that one didn't make the cut, no'. Mr O'Flynn added: 'It's not just Nigel Farage, but clearly we have a party leader who leads, which is a bit of an innovation in contemporary politics.' He added: 'I remember Tony Blair in my days as a journalist saying to me you are either a control freak or you have lost control. 'And, if you have to decide which side of that fence to go on then having control is probably the right option.' Asked if that meant it was the 'Nigel Farage show', he replied: 'Well, Nigel Farage is the dominant figure in the party who has transformed us from a 3 per cent party to a 18/20 plus party.' Owen Smith, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, said: 'Remarks like these are what makes Farage so dangerous. 'It is clearly absurd to suggest heavy traffic on the M4 is caused by immigration, but through the laughter at his silly comments you can hear Ukip's dog-whistle politics of division.' Last week it emerged that Ukip pays £60,000-a-year for Mr Farage to enjoy the services of a chauffeur. Mr Farage was also challenged about whether he has regrets about any of his more outspoken comments. On Friday he trigged a row when he suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so. He has previously complained about people not speaking English on trains and said people would not want a group of Romanians living next door. But he was unrepentant, telling the BBC: 'I look at politics. I look at the incredibly bland people that are now in politics who dare not give an opinion on any issue for fear of criticism. 'Is it any wonder the public don't know their names, don't know what they stand for. 'You know we have finished up with vanilla politics, right across the United Kingdom. 'I am going on, saying it as I see it. It's just me. But I am not going to be brow beaten by you and everybody else into becoming like the rest of them.' Meanwhile Mr Farage has been accused of recruiting 'toffs for the top' of Ukip after a candidate in a key target seat expressed fury that he had been ousted in favour of a star of the TV programme Gogglebox. Andrew Michael, a wealthy, retired hotelier who features on the Channel 4 programme, has been parachuted in as Mr Farage's candidate in Hastings and Rye, where the sitting Tory MP holds a wafer-thin majority. Now the deposed candidate has given vent to his anger in a leaked email to local party members in which he condemns Ukip's policy of recruiting defecting Tory MPs and celebrities. Ralph Atkinson calls on Ukip members to bombard Mr Farage with complaints about his treatment, and claims that his party boasts 'standards of democracy lower than the unelected European Commission'. Mr Michael, 55 – whose Gogglebox appearances with his wife Carolyne and two of their four children have included discussions about whether Ukip is racist – was selected for the seat last week shortly after Mr Atkinson was removed in a coup which he says was orchestrated by the party's head office. Last week Mr Farage complained about not having taxpayer-funded travel and security, which is given to other leaders like Ed Miliband. He told LBC: ' You look at all the other leaders of political parties, they of course, all have the state provide them with, you know, the means to get around, and with security. The state doesn't provide Ukip with anything.' He said he had written to the government asking for state help with his security bills, but it had been refused. He suggesed he should be given the same level of protection as 'any former Northern Ireland Secretary'. 'I'm not having an argument over it, the fact is we don't get help. Do I need (a) security? Yes. And do I need to be driven around from place to place? I think I probably do. 'I mean, I came up here early this morning, I'm off to Swansea in a minute to give a speech. I think I do actually need...so there is a team, there are two guys who are with me and take me round the place. 'And if that's being interpreted by one national newspaper as somehow I'm now living high on the hog, in this luxury 4 x 4 car, all I would say to the newspaper that writes stuff like that is, come and spend a week with me, you'll be half dead by the end of it.'","Ukip leader was expected at a drinks reception in Port Talbot on Friday .

"Mary Goble, 99, was forced to crawl up stairs to her home after the lift at her block of flats broke down . A 99-year-old great-grandmother has been forced to crawl up two flights of stairs to her flat for two weeks because the lift is broken. Mary Goble, who is disabled after contracting shingles, says she has been left a prisoner in her own home as she waits for the repair work at the nine-storey building in Birmingham, West Midlands. The great-grandmother-of-eight attempted to leave the house to buy groceries, but after realising she would have to go up the stairs on her hands and knees, she has vowed not to go out again. She said: 'I went to go and get some food in but when I got back realised I would have to crawl upstairs on my hands and knees. 'I had to pull myself up knee by knee, it's outrageous - these stairs are very steep. 'I was in pain and when I got to the top I was exhausted. It nearly knocked me out.' The partially-sighted widow, who lives alone, was left with limited mobility in her hands and arms after she developed shingles. She believes the lifts at Beech Hill House in Bartley Green, Birmingham, are more than six decades old. She added: 'This lift should've been dealt with a long time ago. They should've realised that, with a lift that's 60-years-old. It is dangerous. 'I normally wake up in the morning and think ""I must do something and get out, buy some flowers or go to the shop"". 'But if you go out you've got to crawl back up the stairs again. 'The only way people can get in and out is up and down the stairs. Other people have complained to the housing department about this. 'I feel for the others living here. Most of them are aged 45 or over and some are disabled.' Residents were told in a letter  from the Bartley Green housing team that the lift was broken. Work by Birmingham City Council's contractors began last Wednesday but tenants were warned repairs could take up to a fortnight. The broken down lift (left) and the stairs, which Mary Goble had to crawl up on her hands and knees . Bartley Green housing team wrote: 'As you may be aware there has been a major fault with the lift in your tower block, which has resulted in a limited lift service to the tenants. 'We apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused. 'An Otis technician will be onsite from Wednesday preparing the lift for the essential repairs. 'The engineer has estimated that it may take up to two weeks for the repairs to be completed, however due to the work already completed this should be reduced. 'Please be aware that when the full installation starts there will be no lift service for the duration of the installation period, and the overall completion date is estimated as December 12, 2014. The block of flats at Beech Hill House in Bartley Green, Birmingham. The council says the repair work could take about two weeks to complete. Mary Goble says she will not be able to leave the flat in that period . 'Again we apologise for the inconvenience this will cause and assure you that all is being done to ensure the lift is back in service as soon as possible.' Birmingham's former Tory cabinet member for housing Councillor John Lines  said: 'This is the twenty-first century what are we talking about? Can't they fix a lift for pensioners?'

"Clifton College needed two second-half tries to break Marlborough’s hold on one of the sport’s oldest contests. A 17-0 win earned Clifton the bragging rights in the 150th anniversary of the fixture and also maintained a push for honours in this season’s Daily Mail Schools Trophy. When Clifton and Marlborough first met in 1864 the game was an unruly 20-a-side and the afternoon, according to reports, featured a mass brawl. A Clifton forward claims the ball from a line-out during their 17-0 victory over Marlborough . Marlborough won that contest but had to give way this time, following last season’s 22-10 win, as Clifton’s speedy backs settled the issue in the second half after a penalty by Fred Owsley had brought an early lead. Tries by wing Will Slatton and centre Tom Costley broke Marlborough’s hold on territory and possession. Costley converted both tries. To mark the 150th anniversary the main pitch at Marlborough was renamed ‘The Hamersley’ in honour of Alfred St George Hamersley, a former pupil and England international of the 1870s who was a pioneer of rugby in New Zealand after he emigrated to work as a lawyer. Success for Clifton was a fifth win out of six this season and keeps them in the hunt for honours in this merit table-based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. As half-term nears, four teams have broken away in the race to succeed Woodhouse Grove, the inaugural winners last year. While Grove, rebuilding a new team, have fallen away in winning only three games from six, the Yorkshire flag has been taken up by unbeaten Grammar Schools of Leeds. The Clifton and Marlborough players stand together after the Daily Mail Schools Trophy tie . A 22-10 win over Bradford GS brought the Leeds team a sixth win to complete an excellent first two months. They should be tested next month in tough Yorkshire derbies against Woodhouse and Hull-based Hymers. Hymers lost their unbeaten record at Barnard Castle, the Durham school recording a 22-0 win including four tries. Second-placed Wellington College, who host Sherborne on Saturday, are the form team having recorded three wins in seven days by beating Harrow (43-0), Millfield (41-27) and Eton (31-10). Abingdon, who are in third place, have their toughest test of the campaign so far on Friday when they go to Sedbergh who have only lost once so far, on the first weekend to Whitgift. Fourth-placed Kirkham will also have their unbeaten record tested on Saturday away to Tonbridge. The Preston school’s latest triumph was a 34-7 win over Denstone College, No 8 James Robinson scoring two tries.","Tries by Will Slatton and Tom Costley guided Clifton College to victory .

"District JudgeTerence Richard Peter Hollingworth, 63, has been forced to quit after allegedly making a racist remark about an Asian woman victim . A judge has quit after allegedly making a racist comment about an Asian crime victim in court. Terence Richard Peter Hollingworth had asked lawyers to fetch the harassment victim so he could finish sentencing her ex-boyfriend. Prosecutor Rachel Parker said she was unsure whether the woman in question, Deepa Patel, could attend at short notice due to work commitments. The district judge allegedly replied: ‘It won’t be a problem. ‘She won’t be working anywhere important where she can’t get the time off. She’ll only be working in a shop or an off-licence.’ When Miss Parker asked the judge to clarify his comments, he added: ‘With a name like Patel, and her ethnic background, she won’t be working anywhere important where she can’t get the time off. So that’s what we’ll do.’ At this point Miss Parker withdrew from the case at Preston Magistrates’ Court and told the judge: ‘I am professionally embarrassed. I cannot prosecute this case.’ The Crown Prosecution Service made an official complaint after the incident on October 30, and Mr Hollingworth resigned four weeks later from his part-time job as a deputy district judge. The 63-year-old remains an immigration judge for the Asylum and Immigration Chamber – but is not hearing any cases while he is investigated over his alleged comments. He could yet face the sack from this second role, which pays more than £120,000 a year. Miss Patel, a 22-year-old from Preston, is currently working in an office. She told The Sun: ‘I was born and bred in this country... it’s shocking and disgusting for anyone to say that, especially a judge. ‘He’s the one making legal decisions and deciding people’s freedom and he’s saying stuff like that – it’s ridiculous. ‘You would assume that people of this day and age, especially a judge, wouldn’t be racist. ‘I’m more upset than angry, especially since I had already gone through so much by going to court. I’ve had counselling because of what happened with my ex, so to hear this went on is even more upsetting. I’m glad that I wasn’t in the room at the time, I don’t think I would have coped.’ He made the comments at Preston Magistrates Court after being told a prosecution team could not bring forward the case as 22-year-old Deepa Patel  was not in court . She added it was ‘outrageous’ that Mr Hollingworth is still an immigration judge. ‘He needs to resign altogether,’ she said. Miss Patel’s ex-boyfriend Parvan Singh, 23, was later jailed for 20 weeks. A court heard he had breached a restraining order, as well as the terms of a suspended sentence imposed in August for beating Miss Patel. A spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed that Mr Hollingworth – who lives in a rural village in Derbyshire – had resigned his part-time role. They added that his immigration chamber’s president is ‘considering the matter’.","Judge Terence Richard Peter Hollingworth’ made a racist remark about harassment victim .

"Maria Miller, the former culture secretary, and Jeremy Hunt met officials from Google a total of eight times between them . Coalition ministers have met Google executives 54 times since the General Election – an average of more than once a month. David Cameron held talks with the internet giant six times and Chancellor George Osborne five times over the past four years. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey attended a total of 14 meetings, while former culture secretaries Maria Miller and Jeremy Hunt met the firm eight times between them. The total of 54 meetings between June 2010 and March this year was disclosed in Whitehall department records. The revelation will add to fears about the powerful US technology firm’s close links to the Government and ability to influence policy on contentious issues such as online child safety and copyright violation. A music industry leader worried about Google’s hugely popular search engine providing access to piracy websites claimed the £223billion company came as close as possible to ‘sleeping with the Prime Minister’. Google has been accused of using complicated cross-border accounting practices to avoid paying its fair share of corporation tax in Britain. Last year it paid just £20.4million to the Treasury – after earlier admitting that its total UK revenues are £3.3billion. Google and other major internet firms have also been criticised for taking too long to delete terrorist propaganda, including beheading videos. Child protection charities have argued that the online search giant must do more to block access to child abuse images and prevent children from viewing pornography. In May 2012 the Mail revealed that Tory ministers had been meeting Google an average of once a month since the election. The new figures show there has been no slowdown in Google’s meetings with Coalition ministers who have discussed topics including data protection, supporting internet businesses and protecting children online. It has emerged that Google is developing products aimed at under-13s, who have until now been largely off limits for technology firms because of strict US laws about collecting personal information from youngsters. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey attended a total of 14 meetings with the tech giant. Since the general election ministers have met with Google chiefs 54 times, more than once a month on average . One controversial area government ministers discussed with Google on several occasions was online copyright infringement. This is of particular concern for British record and film companies, who have accused Google of profiting from internet pirates. Months after taking office, Mr Cameron praised Google in a speech to promote the new centre for British technology firms at ‘Silicon Roundabout’ in east London. He pledged to review the UK’s intellectual property laws to ‘make them fit for the internet age’. Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart told GQ magazine: ‘I’ve always called that statement by the Prime Minister the “Googlesburg Address” because it seems to have informed the whole process since then.’ Mr Cameron’s intervention resulted in the Hargreaves Review, which recommended relaxing Britain’s tough copyright laws. Alison Wenham, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music, which represents indie record labels, said: ‘Google was as close to sleeping with the Prime Minister as they could get.’ Mr Cameron has regularly been criticised for being too close to Google and other wealthy internet firms accused of paying little UK tax. This summer he appointed Joanna Shields, a former executive for both Google and Facebook, to the House of Lords. Among Lib Dems, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has met Google bosses once and Business Secretary Vince Cable five times since the election. David Cameron, who met with Google representative six times, has long praised the internet giant which has been criticised for paying little tax in this country (pcitured, the firm's headquarters in California) A Google insider said only a tiny fraction of its meetings with ministers were at its request, and argued that the firm has regularly been criticised by the Government in recent months. Tory sources pointed out that last week Mr Osborne announced a new levy – nicknamed the ‘Google Tax’ – on multinational companies that shift profits to countries with lower tax rates. A Tory party spokesman said ministers regularly meet a wide range of business leaders, adding: ‘In relation to meetings with Google, there have been a series of meetings over the last year to put pressure on Google and other online firms to take action to deal with child abuse images on the internet and child sexual exploitation online. These meetings have already made good progress. ‘More recently, there have also been meetings with Google and other online firms on the need to take more action to tackle extremist and terrorist material.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘We removed more than 35million links to pirated content from our search results in the last month alone. 'According to Ofcom just 8 per cent of infringers in the UK use Google to find unlicensed film and 13 per cent to find unlicensed music.’","Ex-culture secretaries Maria Miller and Jeremy Hunt had eight meetings .

"An Englishman’s home has long supposedly been his castle. But a council has ruled he cannot make it look like a wooden fort – even if he claims it is a vital defence necessary to make his children feel safe. That is what happened at this terrace house in North London, where owner Andy Martin (who is in fact Australian) installed a 6ft 5in fence around his front garden, without planning permission. Fenced off: Neighbours complained that the wooden barricade around the front garden made the house look like a sinister fortress . Mr Martin is an architect who has worked for rock star Noel Gallagher and a number of fashionable restaurants. But his wooden stockade for his own home did not win acclaim from neighbours, who claimed it made the house look like a sinister and ‘aggressive’ fortress, was out of character with the street, and could actually be a magnet for burglars – who could hide behind it. After Mr Martin was told to apply for retrospective planning permission, his barricade was rejected. He will now have to take it down, yet is mystified at the opposition. Mr Martin, an Australian architect, has been told to remove the fence . Mr Martin, who bought the property for £620,000 in 2012, talked about his home in The London Magazine last year, describing it as ‘the ugly house’. But he claims that the palisade he erected around it early this year was actually a thing of beauty, and that the area would be improved if more homeowners followed his lead. Asked why he had built the barricade, Mr Martin said it was created to protect his family. ‘We had some problems with someone being chased into our house late at night, and it’s put my young children in a situation where they are quite nervous now,’ he said. ‘It’s really helped for them. It gives us a lot more security. 'It gives us two lines of defence before entering the house. I’m not sure why it has been so radically opposed.’ Mr Martin claimed there were ‘four or five others’ in the area, adding that having a street full of such front fences would be ‘very beautiful’. He added: ‘In my opinion that street is a little bit of a disaster. 'It feels like a car park – people pour concrete in their front yards. It’s not a great example of streetscape.’ Mr Martin put the fence up around his house to make his children feel more safe after someone was 'chased into the house' late one night . 'Modest': Mr Martin said the fence was an improvement on the street in North London where he lives . But neighbour Paula Garcia, 43, said: ‘It’s like a little prison, not a house. ‘To change the look of the road is not nice. When the milkman or builders come over they always ask, “Why are these people doing this?” ’ IT worker Dilip Hirani, 52, described the fortress house as ‘an eyesore’ and said: ‘I don’t know what they are protecting. 'They must be running around naked or something.’ Writer Shyama Perera, another neighbour, said: ‘It ruins the look of the street and I’m worried others will follow suit. 'It’s not appropriate.’ In Mr Martin’s belated planning application, he described his fence as ‘a modest’ construction. His application concluded that ‘the fence improves the front forecourt area and is a neat design response to what was just a concrete driveway with minimal landscaping’. But the planning application was rejected last week by Brent Council, which said it had ‘a significantly unacceptable visual impact’. A spokesman for the council said that planning permission was required for a fence or wall to the front of a property which would be more than one metre, or 3ft 3in, high. e.kent-smith@dailymail.co.uk .","Andy Martin built the fence to make his children feel more secure at home .

"Clare Atkinson, 29, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer one and a half weeks ago . Clare Atkinson was in high spirits when she visited her local GP with stomach cramps, having just returned from a nine month trip around Australia with her partner. But the remainder of the 29-year-old's travel plans were instantly cut short only three weeks ago, after a couple of blood tests led to the detection of a growth in her liver. Ms Atkinson, who formerly worked as a journalist for the ABC in Sydney, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer within weeks of the discovery. With doctors unable to predict how much time she has left, Ms Atkinson is determined to make the most of her life, proposing to her partner of four and a half years, Lewis, 28. 'It wasn't a proposal in the true sense,' Ms Atkinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'If I hadn't been diagnosed I'm not sure we would have gotten married yet because we had other things that we wanted to do first like travelling and buying an apartment. 'It's one of those things that I always thought I'd be able to do and because the doctors don't know what kind of time frame they're looking at, it was something that I could do when other things had been taken away from me. 'It will be a nice distraction, something to look forward to and think about instead of thinking about the chemotherapy… It's an opportunity for us to celebrate our life together and just forget about it for one night.' The former ABC journalist, who displayed no symptoms other than stomach cramps, proposed to her partner of four and a half years, Lewis (left), whom she plans to wed in January next year . Amelia Freelander (left), set up a donations page where $9000 has already been raised for Ms Atkinson's wedding since the page was set up four days ago . A donation page for the couple's January wedding, which was secretly set up by Ms Atkinson's close friend Amelia Freelander to help them as they direct their savings to medical costs, has already raised almost $9000 since it was set up four days ago. 'I had a list of our friends and colleagues to contact to tell them the news and each person was so shocked and one of the things they all said was ""what can we do? How can we help her right now?"" and I said ""well, actually one of things that she talked to me about was that she and her partner were hoping to get married"",' Ms Freelander told Daily Mail Australia. But Ms Atkinson, who still shows no symptoms of her cancer other than occasional mild stomach pain, has also taken it upon herself to use her story as an example and encourage others to undertake regular blood analyses. 'If I hadn't happened to go in and get a blood test I never would've have found it and I'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late. It could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time,' Ms Atkinson said. Ms Freelander (right) with Ms Atkinson and George Negus at a Christmas party said she set up the donations page for her friend after their mutual friends kept asking how they could help . 'If I hadn't happened to go in and get a blood test I never would've have found it and I'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late. It could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time,' Ms Atkinson, who lives a healthy lifestyle, said . 'I never really realised something was wrong, I just went to my GP with stomach cramps I'd had and I went in thinking I had indigestion problems or something minor.' But two blood tests revealed the journalist had poor liver results, leading to a CT scan that showed a huge growth in the vital organ. 'That was the first time that we knew something was wrong, but at that point not even my doctor realised how bad it was and still thought it could be a benign tumour or a weird growth. It just snowballed from there,' Ms Atkinson said. Ms Atkinson's first indication of a problem came after two blood tests showed poor liver function . A CT scan then showed a huge growth in her liver. Soon after, she underwent keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing. A laparoscopy, in which a camera was inserted into her stomach, finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer . She was immediately admitted to hospital where she underwent numerous CT scans and MRIs as well as keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing. A laparoscopy, in which a camera was inserted into her stomach, finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer. 'But it's a secondary liver cancer which means it's starting somewhere else and spreading to my liver,' Ms Atkinson explained. 'But they don't know where the source is yet or whether they'll ever know. If they know the source the chemotherapy can be more targeted and there's more chance of it helping or being successful.' Despite only learning of her exact diagnosis one and a half weeks ago and preparing to undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next Monday, Ms Atkinson says she can't help but feel somewhat grateful. She will undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next week, however doctors have been unable to determine how much time she has left . 'As you'd expect the first few days [after being diagnosed] were pretty emotional, but there are mixed emotions. 'You feel a sense of despair that you can't describe, but there's also an element of gratefulness that you have time to do more things – it's not like I'm in pain or had any symptoms or anything, which is why it has come as such a shock. 'I feel as normal as I ever did, I just have it in the back of my mind now that this is growing inside of me.' Ms Atkinson encourages anyone affected by cancer who is seeking counselling, support or even financial assistance, to contact the Cancer Council.

"Professional athletes continued to protest the Eric Garner and Michael Brown grand jury verdicts over the weekend with messages written directly on their clothes and shoes. Just days after making headlines for raising his arms in support of Brown along with several teammates before a November game, St. Louis Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt scrawled the names of slain black teens on his game day shoes Sunday. He included Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and others in a trend that appears to be catching on with big league athletes amid a national groundswell of solidarity with victims of what many see as an unjust legal system. In memoriam: St. Louis Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt wrote the names of slain black teens on his game day shoes Sunday . Honored: Brit included (though did, unfortunately misspell) the names of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin as well as other teens on his shoes before a game against the Washington Redskins . It's a trend that Britt seems to have helped start. The 26-year-old wrote on his wrists 'Mike Brown' and 'My kids matter' before the November 30 game he began by raising his arms. He would later dedicate the night's win to the slain 18-year-old. More professional athletes were wearing 'I Can't Breathe' messages Sunday in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner. Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose wore the message on his T-shirt during warmups before Saturday night's home game. Growing movement: Britt had previously dedicated a game in November to Michael Brown and wore these messages on his wrists . Also with St. Louis: Rams offensive lineman Davin Joseph wrote the 'I can't breathe' message on his shoes on Sunday . Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi sported the 'I can't breathe' message on Sunday, as well . Meanwhile, in Detroit: Wearing a Detroit Lions shirt with 'I can't breathe' written on the front, running back Reggie Bush runs through pre-game warmups in an NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Detroit on Sunday . Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush and Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi warmed up in shirts with the message before NFL games Sunday. St. Louis Rams offensive lineman Davin Joseph wore the message on his cleats. The slogan refers to Eric Garner, who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold while he was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury decided Wednesday it would not indict the officer. A video of the arrest showed Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe.' Gaining momentum: Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose wears a shirt reading 'I Can't Breath' while warming up for a game against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday . St. Louis Rams players, Stedman Bailey (12), Tavon Austin (11), Jared Cook, (89) Chris Givens (13) and Kenny Britt (81) raise their arms in awareness of the events in Ferguson, Missouri as they walk onto the field during introductions before an NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders in St. Louis .","The Rams wide receiver honored Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin on the shoes he wore in a game against the Redskins on Sunday .

"Manchester City will win the Premier League again this season if all referees are as benevolent as Andre Marriner was at the Etihad Stadium. Marriner appeared somehow to miss what can only be described as a flying karate kick by Eliaquim Mangala on Everton’s Samuel Eto’o as the City man jumped in for an aerial ball. Sometimes players are defended when they catch opponents but there can be no excuse in this case - it should have been a red card.

After a delay, Marriner did show Mangala a yellow card, which should mean the FA cannot act on the clear video evidence. Next came the champions’ penalty when James Milner and Phil Jagielka came together just inside the Everton penalty area. Milner went to ground and was scrambling to get to his feet to continue playing when Marriner awarded the penalty.

"A Christmas card which openly mocks people living on council estates appears has been hastily withdrawn after just one day on sale after customers accused Clinton Cards of being prejudiced and insulting. The 'Council Estate Christmas Card' was being sold online by the card company and was described as 'funny' and 'great for sending at Christmas time.' But the apparent humour was lost on dozens of customers who took offence at the card, which listed 'never actually been seen doing any work in his whole life' as a reason why Santa must live on a council estate. Clinton Cards has been accused of openly mocking people who live in council estates after it released a card listing reasons why Santa would live on an estate, including 'he has a record for breaking and entering' and 'He drinks alcohol during working hours.' The card, which was on sale for £2, has now been withdrawn . The £2 card featured Santa, a tower block and the words '10 reasons why Santa Claus must live on a council estate' on the front. Among the 'reasons' listed inside the card are: 'He can get hold of all the latest designer gear but never pays a penny for it!' and 'He has a record for breaking and entering.' The card was listed online on Saturday but was removed from sale on Sunday morning after a number of people complained about the offensive content. A weblink to the card now brings up an error page saying 'Whoops, our bad...' A spokesman said the card had been 'immediately withdrawn' and it was a 'mistake' that it had ever been released for general sale. Darryl Birch, 32 and a computer programmer, saw the card online on Saturday evening. He said: 'I was appalled by it to be honest. It is degrading and offensive. I certainly won't be going to Clintons for my Christmas cards this year.' Grandfather-of-two Paul Thornbury, 66, said: 'I have lived on a council estate most of my life. 'It's disgusting. It is one big stereotype. We are not like that. People shouldn't find this funny. It is tasteless. The inside of the card lists the '10 reasons' why Santa could live on a council estate, which angered customers . The card was on sale on the Clinton Cards website, and was listed as 'great' for sending to people at Christmas . 'My daughter told me about it. She was just as upset as I am. I imagine most people will feel this way really.' But on the Mumsnet website opinion was divided, with one mother defending the card by saying: 'I live on a council estate and I absolutely love it.' Another wrote 'I see tons of jokes about middle class/upper class people all the time, yet no one bats an eyelid.' A petition, signed by more than 100 people, has been launched on Change.org, calling for the card to be withdrawn immediately. It said: 'Christmas is a time for empathy and giving not judgement and vilification.' Other people posted their 'disgust' at the card on Twitter, which also listed 'He uses various wild animals to pull his sleigh', as another 'council house characteristic' inside the card. Medical politician Eric Rose wrote: 'I've seen some horrible Xmas cards but this one from Clinton cards is the worst. Please RT if u agree'. Prospective MP for the Green Party for Bath, Somerset Dominic Tristram also tweeted: 'Justified outrage about this 'humour' from Clinton's Cards (@ClintonsTweet) on Twitter this evening. Appalling.' Customers posted comments about their reaction to the card on Twitter after it was seen on sale on Saturday . Dozens of complaints were left on Facebook and Twitter accusing Clinton Cards of demonising working class . Patrick Hurley accused the card company of 'predjudice' and 'snobbery' while others claimed the company was promoting a 'hate-filled message.' Suzanne Williams wrote: 'Live in social housing? Clinton Cards thinks you're a scrounger and a criminal.' 'When did it become ok to laugh at people who live on council estates?' wrote Beverley Clack. 'This card from @ClintonsTweet plumbs new depths.' Customers also complained on the company's Facebook page. Belle Sebastian wrote: 'Disgraceful! 'I live on a council estate - never have I been in trouble with the police, I don't drink, I worked full time for the council until I became very sick this year so I attend university whilst I recover. 'I cannot believe that your company has allowed this vile prejudice - I'm sure a number of your employees live on estates since you only pay minimum wage...' The company's website lists job vacancies for Christmas temps in a number of locations with a salary of £4.96 to £6.50 per hour. The Living Wage Foundation say the current UK living wage is £7.85 an hour. Kerry MacLeod wrote: 'I am appalled by Clinton's decision to demonize a certain section of our society. Clearly they lack awareness of why we have Council Housing and why people are unemployed or too sick to work. 'I wonder how many of their own staff live in council housing or are on Housing Benefit or top up benefits because their wages are so low. This is shameful and disgraceful.' Clinton Cards said the card had been withdrawn immediately and apologised for any offence it had caused . Other 'reasons' listed inside the card include: 'He only works once a year' and 'He drinks alcohol during working hours.' A spokesman for Clintons, which has 415 branches, said: 'A card in our range has been withdrawn immediately. It is in no way reflective of our views and we apologise without reservation. 'We are investigating how this offensive card got through our quality control procedures, which we will review and tighten as a result of this incident.

"A glamour model whose lingerie photographs were sold to porn and erotica companies to use online is suing her photographer. Nicole Forni, a professional model from Cleveland, Ohio, claims that she only agreed to pose for the provocative pictures on the condition that they were not sold on for any 'adult-oriented' purposes. But after the shoot she and her family found the images used on websites for sex guides in Germany and Spain, an escort website in Switzerland, as well as gracing the cover an erotic e-book entitled Horny Housewives of Dubai: Episode 4. Scroll down for video . 'Horny Housewives': Nicole Forni (right in Cleveland) found herself gracing the cover of an erotic e-book (left) set in Dubai . Legal documents presented to a Manhattan federal court this week also claim that a Pittsburgh strip club, a seduction guide publisher, the dating website Cougar911 and numerous websites selling webcam sex shows also used the pictures of Forni. The model is demanding $75,000 from Joshua Resnick, who took the photographs, alongside the slew of sex-related companies who allegedly used them. The legal document says Resnick approached her with an offer of taking the photographs, which she could use in her portfolio in lieu of being paid for them. It then details how Forni travelled to Resnick's studio in Columbus, Ohio, where she lay down on a white bed and posed in a lacy black ensemble. It says she was promised that no obscene use would be made of them before the shoot, and signed the model release afterwards. But it fells how her family members soon broke the news to her that the photographs were doing the rounds of erotic websites, including Playboy, and were even being made into wallpaper. Shocked: Forni said her family first told her how the pictures were being used . Swiss escorts: The shoot, which lawyers say Forni put strict conditions on, led the model to becoming the face of superescort.ch in Switzerland . Her lawyers claim that Resnick is guilty of fraud not breaking their agreement, which he did not incorporate into a written model release form, which she signed. Michael O'Shea, the attorney representing Forni, said the pictures were meant to be a 'Victoria's Secret-style' shoot which would allow her to retain her 'dignity'. O'Shea told the New York Post: 'She was mortified... there’s a certain level of dignity that people live with, and this guy violated that dignity and trust for a few bucks.' In the lawsuit, originally filed in Ohio, Forni's attorneys said they want the sites and publishers who used the images to take them down. A lawyer for Resnick told the Post that the allegations against him are 'baseless'. Far and wide: This Brazilian sex site was also running the image of Forni, alongside others allegedly including Playboy maagzine.

"Numbers of people in Britain needing weight loss surgery has rocketed in the past decade and includes children as young as 13. File photo . The number of people in Britain needing weight loss surgery has rocketed in the past decade and now includes children as young as 13. Figures show those undergoing gastric band surgery or a similar procedure have risen 16-fold in 10 years. And with new guidelines meaning a million more people may be eligible, experts have warned the obesity crisis will lead to a major financial strain on the NHS. Gastric band operations, which reduce the size of a patient's stomach so they physically cannot eat too much, cost the health service around £6,000 per procedure. In 2003, 509 people were offered a weight loss procedure, including gastric bypass, gastric bands, gastric balloons or bubbles or stomach staples. But since 2011, more than 23,000 people were given bariatric surgery. These include 570 people under 25. In total, 62 children under 18 were given gastric bands and among them were 17 morbidly obese children under the age of 16. On the other end of the scale, 234 pensioners also had surgery to lose weight. The research, from the Government's Health and Social Care Information Service (NICE), parallels the massive rise in people being classed as obese and suffering from Type 2 diabetes. Now, NICE, up to a million more people could be offered weight loss on the NHS. About a million people already qualify, but funding decisions are made by NHS organisations meaning around 9,000 operations happen a year. Experts have warned the obesity crisis will lead to a major financial strain on the NHS. Gastric band operations cost £6,000 per procedure . Professor Mark Baker, Centre for Clinical Practice Director at NICE, said: 'The financial implications of obesity are huge – 10 per cent of the NHS budget is used to treat diabetes and its complications alone. 'It is a major issue, if not the major issue, for the health service in the coming years.' Last year, 6,500 weight loss procedures were performed in the UK and NICE has recommended that all patients with a BMI of 35 (severely obese) or over who have recent-onset type 2 diabetes should be assessed for surgery. Dr Rachel Batterham, Head of Obesity and Bariatric Services at University College London Hospital Trust, who was involved in developing the guidance, said: 'We know that surgery can make a real difference for people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 'The health benefits of weight loss surgery are so great that it should be considered as part of the treatment for obese diabetics. 'The earlier you have the surgery in your diabetes course, then the more likely you are to have remission or a really good improvement.'","Gastric bands reduce patient's stomach size so they cannot overeat .

"Help: Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint, pictured, employs her husband, Phil Cole . MPs have been accused of using their families to earn extra money from taxpayers after it was revealed more than a quarter now employ relatives. The bill for family members on the public payroll has risen by 50 per cent since the general election to reach almost £3.8million. Cabinet Ministers and senior Labour MPs are among the 167 MPs who now have wives, children or even parents on the public payroll. The relatives enjoy salaries as high as £49,999 for office duties, with several benefiting from generous pay rises in the past four years. Among senior Tories enjoying the perk of employing relatives are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. In the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal, Parliament’s standards watchdog called for a ban on politicians hiring loved ones to work in their constituency offices or in the Commons. But MPs attacked the ‘incendiary’ plan and when the new expenses regime was introduced in 2010, MPs were allowed to hire one relative, with the details declared on a register. New figures reveal a sharp increase in the practice. In 2010 there were 137 MPs employing family members but the figure soared to 167 last year. The total pay bill has rocketed from £2.4million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14. It means that the average salary paid to family members has risen by a third, from just over £17,101 to just over £22,400. MPs who have given their relatives payrises include Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Dugher, whose wife Joanna earns up to £34,999 after moving up three pay bands when she became his office manager. His Tory counterpart, Mr McLoughlin, employs wife Lynn works as a senior parliamentary assistant and she has moved up a band to earn up to £44,999. Ipsa, which took over responsibility for MPs’ expenses and allowances, gives staff salaries in £5,000 bands. Veteran left-wing Labour MP Dennis Skinner raised the pay of his partner Lois Blasenheim, who is his senior parliamentary assistant, to up to £39,999. Tory Christopher Chope’s wife is in the top pay bracket, receiving between £45,000 and £49,999 a year for working as his office manager. She has moved up one band. Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn pays his wife Sally up to £24,999. Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint employs her husband Phil Cole as her senior parliamentary assistant on a salary of up to £39,999. Mr Fallon pays his wife Wendy up to £19,999 and Mr Grayling’s wife Susan earns up to £39,999. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb’s wife Beatrice is on up to £19,999, while the wife of Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude receives up to £14,999. Nadine Dorries employs daughter Jennifer as her senior parliamentary assistant on up to £34,999. She previously employed another daughter, Philippa, on up to £44,999. MPs are still allowed to employ more than one family member if they did so before the new rules were introduced. The only MP to do so is Tory Laurence Robertson whose partner Anne Marie Adams earns up to £44,999 as his senior parliamentary assistant, while his estranged wife Susan can earn up to £29,999. Benefits: Among the senior Conservatives enjoying the perk of employing relatives are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right), Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon . The public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for nonexistent jobs. Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later. Ipsa said: ‘We have introduced a number of restrictions and safeguards to regulate MPs employing family members or other connected parties. ‘And, crucially, we think the public should know about these arrangements — which is why we publish all the details including the name, job title and salary range of all connected parties employed by MPs.’","Relatives of 167 MPs enjoy salaries as high as £49,999 for office duties .

"Rampaging protesters yesterday threw petrol bombs at police and set shops on fire as a march in Athens to commemorate the anniversary of the police killing of a teenager turned violent. Riot police used teargas and water cannon to beat back protesters in the bohemian Exarchia neighborhood, where about 200 black-clad youths hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at them. A cloud of smoke billowed into the sky from the clashes. At least two shops were set on fire, and dozens of others damaged. Police said they detained nearly 100 demonstrators. Scroll down for video .

About 100 people were arrested during the unrest . The clashes erupted after about 6,000 protesters marched to commemorate the 2008 police shooting of Alexandros Grigoropoulos - a killing that led to two weeks of the most violent rioting Greece had seen in decades. This year's protest was in solidarity with a jailed self-proclaimed anarchist who witnessed the death of Grigoropoulos and who is now on hunger strike demanding he be allowed to attend university classes. Nikos Romanos, 21, was sentenced to prison for robbery in October and began his hunger strike on November 10. He is in critical condition in hospital. The protests come at a sensitive time for the government, which is negotiating to make an early exit from an unpopular European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout programme that has meant years of austerity for Greeks. At a shrine at the spot where Grigoropoulos was shot dead, mourners left roses and notes. 'I'm leaving this red flower, red like your blood spilled on the pavement,' read one note. A banner was unfurled reading 'When the state murders, resistance is demanded.' The government had appealed for calm in the days leading up to the protest and submitted an amendment to parliament allowing prisoners to follow university courses via distance learning. But Romanos has insisted on attending classes in person. A group of protesters, all wearing masks to obscure their faces, clash with riot police in Athens .

His parents have also appealed to authorities, saying Greece would soon 'mourn its first dead political detainee'. Doctors have said his health is failing. He was jailed with three young men following a February 2013 bank robbery in which they took a hostage as they tried to escape. Police released doctored mug shots of the four at the time to remove signs of severe facial bruising caused during their arrests, leading to an outcry.

"Children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates as part of a Government drive to tackle red tape. The imminent move will scrap the law that has long banned those aged under 16 from buying any confectionery containing alcohol. But alcohol-misuse campaigners warned yesterday that drinks companies may take advantage of the change to create ‘alco-choc’ drinks for youngsters – exposing them to spirits from a young age. Scroll down for video . Children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates and alcohol-laced sweets after a change in the law . Ministers are including the plans as part of the Deregulation Bill, a much-trumpeted move to remove unnecessary red tape, which is currently going through Parliament. They argue that the liqueur ban makes business difficult for corner shops, insisting that stores will benefit next Christmas – when sales for boozy chocolate treats are at their highest – without any negative effect on youngsters. Critics have often ridiculed the ban, arguing that pounds of chocolates would have to be eaten before anybody could get drunk and three years ago the Government stopped requiring vendors of liqueur-filled chocolates to hold a licence to sell alcohol. But there are concerns that alcohol firms may use the new law to market products specifically for children, familiarising them with the taste of spirits. Lord Clive Brooke (pictured) of the all-party parliamentary group on alcohol misuse wants to block the change . Labour peer Lord Brooke, the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on alcohol misuse, said he would be opposing the law change because lifting the ban would create an unwholesome new opportunity for alcohol companies. He said almost 4,000 school-aged children had been taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning last year, adding: ‘Bit by bit children get used to it and they are hooked before you know it. 'We have had a higher proportion of children being treated in accident and emergency in the last 12 months.’ Labour MPs condemned the move as ‘foolhardy’ and said that such a step should have been made in a health context, so that its full implications could be examined, rather than in a ‘red tape-slashing’ Bill. Labour spokesman Chi Onwurah added: ‘You wouldn’t want bourbon or vodka in children’s chocolates, even if it is in too small amounts to cause damage.’","Children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates after a change in the law .

"The brother of a care home worker, who could be jailed for cruelly abusing dementia sufferers, says he had to turn her in 'before she killed someone'. Jeremy Koralewski, 28, has revealed he  lost everything after witnessing his sister, Siobhan Koralewski, terrorising  victims at the family-run Roundstone Care Home in Filey, North Yorkshire. She was found guilty on five counts of neglect and ill-treatment when she appeared at Teeside Crown Court in November and is due to be sentenced at the end of the month. Jeremy Koralewski, right, with his partner Jennifer Price, has revealed he has lost everything since reporting his sister for her cruelty to patients at the family-run care home where he worked as a chef . Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was found guilty of subjecting dementia patients to physical abuse at care home . 'I may have lost everything, but someone had to protect the poor old people my sister terrorised,' Mr Koralewski told the Sunday Mirror. He noticed a change in her behaviour a few years after their parents, Margaret and Raymond, took over the home in 2004 - where they employed him as a chef and their daughter as deputy manager. The home housed 12 dementia patients and promised them 'specialist treatment', but the residents ended up being subject to a catalogue of horrendous physical abuse. Mr Koralewski's partner, Jennifer Price started working at the home in March 2012 and would come home with stories of some of the things she had witnessed. He claims she would accuse patients of faking dementia and would get angry at incontinent patients. But as his sister and the aunt to their five children the pair hoped it would stop. Margaret Koralewski, 67, was cleared of all four charges against her but has cut contact with son . The final straw came in July 2012 when Siobhan decided to 'take revenge' on 88-year-old resident Kenneth Pinkney after he lashed out at her 67-year-old mother. During the trial, the jury heard how she danced around him 'waving her breasts in his face' before hauling him out of his chair and biting him between the legs. Ms Price told the court: 'When Siobhan was dancing around in front of him she took her top off. She had a vest top on underneath. 'She said ""Do you like that you dirty old man?"" She was waving her breasts around in his face. 'Siobhan pulled Mr Pinkney out of his chair by the legs. She sat on top of his stomach, holding his arms down, and started bouncing up and down on his tummy,' Ms Price continued. Mr Koralewski said the elderly man was screaming for his daughter, as he often did when he was upset, and tried to get up. But Siobhan moved down and bit him between the legs. They anonymously wrote to the Care Quality Commission to ask for advice, and did not name Siobhan or the home, but the watchdog said it needed more information. The couple were unsure what to do, and after noticing Siobhan's behaviour getting worse, they advised one patient's son to remove his father from the home after showing him the CQC letter. The police arrived at the couple's home that night, in November 2012, and the home was closed the next day, where his sister and mother were arrested. Mr Koralewski said: 'My mum snapped at me and my dad called me a f****** let-down. It was painful. Their first concern should have been protecting the patients, not my sister.' During the seven day trial, the jury also heard how Siobhan forced another dementia sufferer Elizabeth Hall, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea. When Ms Hall screamed she did not want it, the 30-year-old put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before forcing her to move. Ms Price told the jury she would also see Siobhan preparing mixtures of leftover drinks for Ms Hall, 59, who suffered from Down's Syndrome, learning difficulties and dementia. She explained: 'She was making a drink of all the drinks Liz had left - three or four drinks of tea she would not drink during the day. Jeremy Koralewski, right, with his partner Jennifer Price, leaving court during his mother and sister's trial . 'Liz was crying because she did not want to drink her drinks. Siobhan put her hand over her mouth and said 'shut up'. 'Siobhan then did what she often did to get Elizabeth to move - held onto the belt of her trousers and pulled them up. 'She was like 'wedgie-ing' them so they had no option but to walk up the stairs. Elizabeth was screaming,' Ms Price added. Prosecutor Nicholas Askins said: 'Halfway up the stairs, Elizabeth refused to walk any further. 'So Siobhan pulled her upstairs by the waist. At the top of the stairs, Elizabeth fell to the floor and curled into a ball. 'Siobhan then pushed her along the floor hard with her foot to her bedroom door.' The court heard on another occasion, she stuffed toilet paper in her mouth to make her shut up. Another victim was dementia sufferer Joan Normington, aged 92, who Siobhan - described as a 'Darth-Vader character' was seen to 'frogmarch' to her room on a number of occasions. Once, she pulled Mrs Normington out of her chair by the wrist and dragged her to her room. Deputy care home manager Koralewski, 30, (left) was allegedly 'taking revenge' on 88-year-old dementia sufferer Ken Pinkney after he broke her 67-year-old mother Margaret's (right) shoulder while agitated . Margaret Koralewski, 67, was cleared of all four charges against her during the trial last month. Neither she or her husband have spoken to their son in the two years since the arrests were made. Mr Koralewski said: 'They've lost us and their five grandchildren, but they don't seem to care.' He concluded that he had no choice to make the decision he did and he hoped the residents are now in safe hands being 'treated with the dignity they deserve'.","Jeremy Koralewski has 'lost everything' since reporting sister for abuse .

"After duping Irish and Canadian authorities with horrific tales of being a child sexual abuse victim, serial troublemaker Samantha Azzopardi is returning home to Australia this week. The 26-year-old from Sydney, who has used more than 40 aliases, was considered a flight risk and so devious Canadian authorities decided to keep her locked up until she boarded a flight back to Australia on Tuesday. A Canadian Border Security Agency officer will escort Azzopardi on the flight, the Calgary Herald reported. Samantha Azzopardi is returning home to Australia this week after duping Canadian and Irish authorities . The 26-year-old from Sydney (pictured in Canada) fabricated horrific tales of being a child sexual abuse victim . 'Ms Azzopardi has a long history of impersonating others, lying and committing fraud,' hearing officer Rhonda Macklin, at immigration proceedings in Calgary, said. When Azzopardi  (pictured) was found wandering the streets of Dublin, Ireland, last year she led authorities to believe she was a teenage sex-trafficking victim from eastern Europe . When Azzopardi was found wandering the streets of Dublin, Ireland, last year she led authorities to believe she was a teenage sex-trafficking victim from eastern Europe. Azzopardi drew pictures apparently showing herself being raped, forcing Irish police to release the photo of her in a bid to find her identity. Irish authorities spent $375,000 on the investigation before discovering she was an Australian con artist and not a child. Just six months after Azzopardi was deported from Ireland she managed to obtain an Australian passport and return to Ireland where she working as an au pair. On September 16 this year Azzopardi, using the alias Aurora Hepburn, walked into a Calgary clinic claiming she was 14 and had been a victim of an abduction, sexual assault and torture. Canadian authorities spent $157,000 on their investigation before realising Azzopardi was the woman the Irish media dubbed a 'Walter-Mitty-like con artist', referring to the daydreamer character in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty created by author James Thurber that has been played by Danny Kaye and Ben Stiller in Hollywood films. Azzopardi was charged with public mischief in Calgary and faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison, but after pleading guilty she was sentenced to the two months she had already served in custody.

"Breona Moore, 22, who was sent to prison in April for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh has died from natural causes . A western Pennsylvania woman who was sent to prison for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from a Pittsburgh hospital has died. Twenty-two-year-old Breona Moore of East McKeesport died late last week at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, officials said. Montour County Coroner Scott Lynn told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Moore died of natural causes. Moore was serving a 2 ½- to-five-year sentence at Muncy state prison after pleading guilty in April to kidnapping a 3-day-old boy from Magee-Women's Hospital at UPMC. Moore, who was 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, had told friends for weeks that she was pregnant, prosecutors said. On Aug. 23, 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore walked into the mother's hospital room and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test. Instead, she placed him in a handbag and carried him out of the hospital, prompting a frantic search for the missing child that lasted for several hours. Police found Moore holding the baby, who was not harmed, in a janitor's closet in a downtown office building. At her sentencing in June, Moore told the judge she became depressed after a doctor told her she would be unable to have children of her own. She apologized for her actions and to the baby's mother, even though she was not in the courtroom. 'I hope I will be as blessed as you some day,' Moore said. 'There are no words to say how remorseful I am.' In August 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore had walked into a mom's hospital room at Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test .

"Tony Blair is backing Chuka Umunna to become the next Labour leader, it was claimed today. The former prime minister is said to think the shadow business secretary is the 'natural heir' to his New Labour project. It comes after he took an apparent swipe at Ed Miliband, complaining that too few of today's party leaders have experience of life outside politics. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair is said to be backing Chuka Umunna as a Labour leader, believing he is the 'natural heir' to his own legacy . Many Labour MPs expect Mr Miliband to be ousted as leader if he fails to become Prime Minister in May next year. Several potential successors are already said to be jockeying for position. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and health spokesman Andy Burnham are seen as frontrunners. But bookies have Mr Umunna at 6/1 to become the next Labour leader. He has repeatedly insisted he is loyal to Mr Miliband, but is seen as certain to enter a leadership race in the future. He speaks to Mr Blair often, and is in regular contact with other New Labour veterans, including Lord Mandelson, Tessa Jowell and Lord Adonis, the Independent on Sunday reported. A friend told the newspaper that Mr Blair sees Mr Umunna as a 'natural heir' to his New Labour legacy. In particular, Mr Umunna has been outspoken in defence of immigration and has repeatedly criticised Ukip. The stance has 'drawn further admiration from Mr Blair who is in total agreement', according to the source. Mr Umunna returned to his attack on Ukip today, accusing Nigel Farage's party of a 'fundamental con'. Mr Umunna stepped up his attacks on Ukip again today with an appearance on the Andrew Marr Show . He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I think we've got to be very clear: I want a firm and a fair immigration policy and I think it's very important that we have control but I don't think 'othering' people and blaming people over there, at the moment eastern Europeans, is the way to go. 'I actually think that is a fundamental con and it lets politicians of all political persuasion who haven't done the things they should have done over the decades, off the hook. I don't think it's in keeping with our British values and I won't have any truck with them.' Last week Mr Blair appeared to criticise politicians, like Mr Miliband, who have spent their entire careers in Westminster. The three-times election winner said the 'gene pool' of political leaders had suffered because too few candidates have 'real-life experience'. He suggested that too many graduates went straight from university to a job as a political researcher, before then becoming an MP – a path that may sound familiar to Mr Miliband. The current Labour leader was elected to the Commons nine years ago, having done little after his philosophy, politics and economics degree at Oxford – apart from working in the Treasury as a special adviser. Ed Miliband, pictured visiting a Nissan plant in Sunderland last week, is thought likely to stand down if he fails to become Prime Minister in May next year . Writing in the New York Times, Mr Blair, who worked as a barrister before becoming an MP, also complained that Westminster fails to attract the best candidates because politicians are not paid enough. Mr Blair, who did not refer to Mr Miliband by name in his latest comments, wrote: 'At the very time when leadership is needed, the gene pool of political leaders has shrunk. 'How many leaders and, for that matter, followers in a parliament or congress have real-life experience in responsible positions outside of politics? 'Today it is very common for a young person interested in politics to graduate from university, go to work for a politician as a researcher or political analyst, and then transition straight into an elected position.' The former prime minister said of his time as a barrister: 'I learned about business and about people in a way that was greatly beneficial when I later came to govern. 'In particular, I learned the difference between academic political ideas and policies suited to 'real world' application.'","Ex-PM wants shadow business secretary to be next Labour leader .

"The number of deaths linked to the use of so-called legal highs in England have increased eightfold in three years, new figures show. In 2009 12 people died after taking the drugs, compared to to 97 in 2012. Think-tank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), which revealed the statistics, has called on the Government to grant police more powers to close shops selling the dangerous drugs. Figures show deaths associated with legal highs have increased eightfold, rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012 . The group say the UK has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in Europe, and said police and courts should be given new powers to close the 'head shops' which sell many of the substances. The CSJ is asking the Government to implement legislation similar to laws introduced in Ireland in 2010, which saw the number of head shops in the country fall from more than 100 to less than 10. The number of people receiving treatment for using legal highs has more than tripled, soaring from 738 in 2009 to 2,339 last year . The organisation also revealed that the number of people in treatment in England for taking legal highs has jumped by 216 per cent over the last five years, rising from 738 in 2009/10 to 2,339 last year . CSJ director Christian Guy said: 'This is yet another wake-up call to the dangers of so-called 'legal highs'. 'Legal highs are destroying lives - it is time to get tough on those making a living out of selling them. 'The UK is already the addicted man of Europe with some of the worst rates of heroin, crack and alcohol abuse - tackling legal highs needs to be a priority.' In the past five years the number of people in treatment for use of mephedrone, which was banned in 2010, rose by 95 per cent. For GBL and GHB use, which was banned in 2009, figures rose by 75 per cent. The number of people in treatment for the use of ketamine, which became illegal in 2006, has increased by 40 per cent.","Think-tank calling for more police power to shut down shops selling drugs .

"Two white police officers who were fired for slamming a black woman's head into a counter in custody will not face criminal charges - after a grand jury decided to clear them. Ricky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham were caught on camera in June 2013 brutally manhandling Keyarika 'Shea' Diggles, 25, in Jasper County, Texas, after she had been arrested for an unpaid traffic ticket. They are seen coming at her from behind, bashed her forehead on the desktop and then dragging her off to a dark 'detox' cell with her handcuffs on. Scroll down for video . Ricky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham were caught on camera in June 2013 slamming the head of Keyarika 'Shea' Diggles, 25, into a counter in Jasper County, Texas. They have been cleared of criminal charges . Diggles was on the phone to her mother when she was manhandled by the officers. She had only been arrested and taken to custody for an unpaid parking ticket . The pair were sacked from the force following the incident but almost 18 months later, they have both avoided an indictment. The revelation follows the decisions not to charge the police officers involved in the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner. News that they would not be indicted sparked protests against police brutality around the country. Cade Bernson told My Fox Houston the decision was appalling. 'I think it sends a terrible message to the public,' he said. 'It sends a terrible message to minorities and women that the law doesn't seem to apply equally to civilians as it does to police officers.' The victim was on the phone to her mother, asking for $100 to cover an unpaid fine, when one of the officers cut off the call. Diggles then starts to remonstrate with Grissom, Officer Cunningham comes from behind her and attempts to handcuff her, but not before he pushes her forward and slams her head onto the countertop. Grissom and Cunningham were fired from their jobs following the incident 18 months ago, but a grand jury has decided not to indict them . The two men then wrestle Diggles to the floor before dragging her by her ankles into a jail cell. At one point Officer Cunningham yanks Diggles' shoe off her foot - causing him to loose his balance and fall onto the floor unceremoniously. Initially, Diggles was charged with resisting arrest but that was dropped on the Monday following the ordeal according to Bernsen. Diggles settled a civil rights lawsuit against the city and the officers last December for $75,000. And less than a month after the incident, Jasper’s city council voted to fire Cunningham and Grissom. Both Cunningham and Grissom have refused to comment on the matter. Their firing came 15-years since another hate crime in Jasper, which is a town of 8,000 people two hours northeast of Houston. After Diggles fell to the ground, the pair dragged her to a 'detox' cell while she was wearing her handcuffs . In 1998, James Byrd Jr. was tied to the back of a pickup truck by three white men and dragged for miles until he was decapitated. There followed clashes between the New Black Panthers and the Ku Klux Klan. In 2012, the majority white Jasper City Council fired the town's first black police chief after 16-months. A call by the station to Jasper County District Attorney was not returned.","Ricky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham were caught on camera in June 2013 brutally manhandling Keyarika 'Shea' Diggles .

"President Barack Obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in American society as racism and bias. He also is urging patience, saying progress usually comes in small steps. In an interview with BET, the president described his conversation with a group of young civil rights activists, including a leader of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, he hosted last week in the Oval Office. His comments come after New York Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested that the United States is confronting 'centuries of racism,' after a week of protests that shook major cities across the country. Speaking from experience he said he feared for his son's safety when dealing police officers, adding: 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.' President Barack Obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in American society as racism and bias (file picture) Obama said he told them that 'this is something that is deeply rooted in our society, it's deeply rooted in our history.' America has made gains, he said, and that 'gives us hope' of making more progress. 'We can't equate what is happening now to what was happening 50 years ago,' Obama said, 'and if you talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, they'll tell you that things are better, not good in some places, but better.' Obama said he is advising young people to be persistent because 'typically progress is in steps, it's in increments.' In dealing with something 'as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society, you've got to have vigilance but you have to recognize that it's going to take some time and you just have to be steady so that you don't give up when you don't get all the way there,' Obama said. New York has become the center point of the demonstrations demanding justice for black men who have died at the hands of white policemen in recent weeks. 'We have to have an honest conversation in this country about a history of racism, we have to have an honest conversation about the problems that have caused parents to feel that their children may be in danger in their dynamics with police, when in fact police are there to protect them,' Mayor De Blasio told ABC News. New York mayor Bill de Blasio, pictured with his wife Chirlane McCray in April, has said that the US is facing 'centuries of racism' following protests in the city last week . 'Our police keep us safe, and yet there's been not just decades of problems, a history of centuries of racism that undergird this reality.' De Blasio, who is white and married to a black woman with whom he has mixed-race children, added: 'We have to retrain police forces in how to work with communities differently, we have to work on things like body cameras that will provide a different level of transparency and accountability. 'This is something systemic and we bluntly have to talk about the historical racial dynamics underlying (it).' Speaking from personal experience, de Blasio told ABC that he feared for his son's safety in dealing with the police. 'What parents have done for decades with children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful, when they have a connection with a police officer, when they have an encounter with a police officer,' he said. 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country. 'And with Dante, very early on, my son, we used to say, look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cellphone, because we knew, sadly, there is a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color.' He continued: 'There's that fear that there could be that moment of misunderstanding with a young man of color, and that young man may never come back.' New York has been the focal point of demonstrations in the past week following the decision by a grand jury not to indict the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner .

"Hospital patients are so confused by NHS complaints procedures that many do not bother to speak out at all, a report warns today. Thousands are put off lodging a formal grievance by baffling systems or concerns that their gripes will lead to reprisals against a loved one, say watchdogs. A review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) also pointed to poor complaint handling, slow investigations and patients not being taken seriously as key areas of concern in hospitals. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Hospital patients are so confused by NHS complaints procedures that many do not bother to speak out at all, a report warns today . It said complainants were met ‘too often’ with a defensive culture rather than one that listens and is willing to learn. But it is also worried about ‘very few’ complaints over adult social care and primary care, which could indicate the lack of an open culture in which concerns are welcomed. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: ‘A service that is safe, responsive and well-led will treat every concern as an opportunity to improve, will encourage its staff to raise concerns without fear of reprisal, and will respond to complaints openly and honestly. ‘Unfortunately this is not happening everywhere. While most providers have complaints systems in place, people’s experiences of these are not consistently good. ‘We know from the thousands of people who contact the CQC every year that many people do not even get as far as making a complaint as they are put off by the confusing system or worried about the impact that complaining might have on their or their loved one’s care. ‘More needs to be done to encourage an open culture where concerns are welcomed and learned from.’ The CQC received more than 18,000 complaints about poor care last year – 50 a day – while written complaints about the NHS to the Health and Social Care Information Centre topped 75,000. Healthwatch England recently estimated that 250,000 incidents went unreported last year because people felt unable to complain for various reasons. Warning: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘One of the biggest lessons of the tragedy at Mid Staffs is the need to listen and act on all complaints . The Patients Association last month found half of complaints were not handled well and warned the culture of secrecy in the NHS has barely changed since the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, in which hundreds of patients died due to neglect. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘One of the biggest lessons of the tragedy at Mid Staffs is the need to listen and act on all complaints. ‘So as part of our drive to confront poor care we’re making sure people know how to complain and transforming complaints handling – now a crucial part of the CQC’s tough, independent inspection regime.’ Terrible experience: Labour MP Ann Clwyd broke down in the Commons as she described how her husband died in hospital ‘like a battery hen’ The CQC’s inspection teams are now being told to take complaints handling into account during inspections in England. The latest report follows a review of the NHS complaints system last November by health experts and Ann Clwyd, the Labour MP who broke down in the Commons as she described how her husband died in hospital ‘like a battery hen’. Welcoming the report, she said: ‘I want the many thousands of people who wrote to me in the course of my review to know that change is expected as a result.’ Richard Lloyd of Which? said: ‘For too long the views of health and social care users have not been heard, so it’s good the regulator is taking steps to improve complaints handling and put patient feedback at the heart of what it does. ‘We now need greater detail on how complaints will trigger action from the regulator, to give people confidence it’s worthwhile speaking up and that something can, and will, be done.’","Care Quality Commission (CQC) review highlights poor complaint handling .

"Police have warned of the danger of posting 'gun selfies', after noticing an influx of photographs on showing firearm owners with their rifles on social media sites. Concerns arose when officers from the Victorian Police force spotted photos which had identifying markers, such as licence plates, work logos, or house windows which may aid criminals in targeting homes with guns. The warning comes after a Mexican man died in July while attempting to take a selfie with a loaded gun, and the trend of gun selfies known as  'Hernandezing', for the former US football player whose 'gun selfie' was released showing him holding a firearm allegedly used in a murder. Police have warned of the danger of posting 'gun selfies', after noticing an influx of photographs on showing firearm owners with their rifles on social media sites . Senior Sergeant Andrew Armstrong from the Victoria Police Licensing and Regulation Division labelled the trend 'reckless' and said that gun owners needed to be aware of the consequences of posting photos with their guns. 'This behaviour is concerning. Some criminals trawl social media networks looking for easy targets and items of interest – including ammunition and other weaponry,' Senior Sergeant Armstrong said. 'It’s easy enough to gather personal information through public profiles or unsecure accounts,' he said. 'Licence holders need to be responsible. Any public display of firearm ownership including stickers on vehicles or house windows can encourage unwanted attention from thieves.' Senior Sergeant Andrew Armstrong from the Victoria Police Licensing and Regulation Division labelled the trend 'reckless' Sergeant Armstrong said  that gun owners needed to be aware of the consequences of posting photos with their guns . The spate of 'gun selfies' has also spread throughout the US, picking up interest on social media sites after former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez posted a selfie with his handgun. Hernandez was charged with murder just before the image was released, showing him touting a Glock .45, the gun the prosecution believed to be the murder weapon, reported Huffington Post. The image prompted a spate of copycat images, with people posting similar selfies holding guns, uploaded with the hastag 'Hernandezing'. In July this year, a Mexican man accidentally shot himself while attempting to take a selfie with his gun, dying later from the bullet which went through his forehead. Oscar Otero Aguilar, 21, from Mexico City, was holding a loaded gun he had borrowed while trying to take a photo, when the gun went off, reported Business Insider. When Parliament House in Canberra introduced sentries with machine guns, tourists flocked to take selfies with the guards, prompting commentary on the fascination with guns. Oscar Otero Aguilar, 21, from Mexico City, was holding a loaded gun he had borrowed while trying to take a photo, when the gun went off, killing him . Police have warned of the danger of posting 'gun selfies', after noticing an influx of photographs on showing firearm owners with their rifles on social media sites . Police are also concerned with the way gun owners store their firearms, with Sergeant Armstrong pointing out that the offense is a regular occurrence in the state. 'Some licence holders are becoming too complacent,' he said. 'With the responsibility of owning a firearm comes the responsibility of storing one. If your firearms can be easily accessed you need to improve your security.' 'Penalties range from around $8000 or 12 months imprisonment to $35,000 or four years imprisonment depending on the category of firearm.' Victorian Police are reminding gun owners to take extra precautions over the festive season, especially if owners are planning on going away on holiday. 'We know that the majority of licence holders comply with storage conditions however, there are still a significant number who don’t,' said Sergeant Armstrong. 'There’s a simple solution to this problem – better storage, security and common sense. We want to promote a safer Victoria and ensure firearms don’t fall into the wrong hands.'","Victorian Police are warning of the danger of posting 'gun selfies' after noticing the trend on social media .

"The House of Lords refused to share catering services with MPs because they were worried about the quality of champagne, it has been claimed. A plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both Houses of Parliament was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly, according to a former Commons chief. While the Lords and MPs share IT, cleaning and archive services, reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far. The House of Lords refused to merge catering contracts with the Commons because they 'feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service' A group of MPs is examining the way the House of Commons is run, following the row over John Bercow's plan to install an Australian woman as Clerk. But one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines. Former Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack revealed the tensions between the two Houses of Parliament when the committee took evidence. He insisted that 'joint services must be a good idea' and they already exist in ICT and the running of the estate. 'Nevertheless, there are historical differences between the Houses.' He said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated Pugin Room, complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets, belongd to the Commons or the Lords. Sir Malcolm added: 'The person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service, and it was eventually thrown out in the House of Lords because the Lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.' Former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, chairman of the Commons governance committee, was taken aback by the claim, asking: 'Did you make that up? Is that true?' Governance committee chairman Jack Straw expressed astonishment at the revelation about champagne from former Commons Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack (right) The Lords and Commons already share IT, cleaning and archive services, but catering was seen as a step too far . But Sir Malcolm insisted it had happened. 'Yes, it is true, he said. 'It should not be beyond the wit of man, Chair, to brigade the services together and deliver them differently. Former Lib Dem minister David Heath, who sits on the committee, remarked: 'You can never underestimate the capacity for self-parody in this place.' Since 2010 the House of Lords has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £265,770. It is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer. The stunned MPs returned to the topic later, when DUP MP Ian Paisley wondered whether the Lords' fears about the quality of champagne in the Commons was justified, the Observer reported. 'I feel compelled to ask: were they right about the champagne?' Mr Paisley said. Sir Malcolm insisted: 'I don't think they were; we were very careful in our selection.' The champagne row caused such a storm that MPs raised it again at a later hearing of the committee, as they grilled Lord Rogers, who stood down as Clerk of the Commons this year after reports of rows with Mr Bercow. Lord Rogers warned of 'suspicion' between the two Houses over the prospect of joint working. 'You also need to look at where it will really make a difference. 'It would be very difficult to get a joint catering service. I must be very careful for a number of reasons what I say here.' Mr Paisley asked if he was referring to the dispute over champagne, but Lord Rogers refused to get drawn into it. 'No, I am not going into the quality of the champagne. People are very possessive about some services. Catering is an absolute classic.' However, a Lords spokesman said: 'The House of Lords would not reject a merger of catering services with the House of Commons simply on the supply of champagne. 'The House of Lords catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the House of Commons, and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the House of Lords. All alcohol sold in the House of Lords is sold at a profit.'","Peers rejected plan to merge contracts over fears about their bubbly .

"Julie Bentley warned young girls must be taught about pornography . The leader of the Girl Guides has urged parents and teachers to start informing young girls about pornography. Julie Bentley, the leader of GirlGuidingUK warned that if myths surrounding sex are not dispelled, youngsters will grow up thinking representations of intimacy in pornography are realistic. Her comments come days after it was revealed that children as young as seven face playground sexual taunts. Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Desert Island Discs, Ms Bentley - who, predictably, chose Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves as one of her records - spoke of the dangers of easily accessible porn. 'When I was a teenager, I wasn't aware of pornography. 'Today, regretfully, pornography is so accessible on social media that my view on this is that it isn't going to help them by pretending it's not there. 'If they're accessing it and seeing it, then we have the responsibility of telling them that isn't a true representation of a relationship between two people,' the Sunday Telegraph reports. Ms Bentley added she had grown frustrated with preconceived ideas of feminists as women who hate men. 'Some people like to interpret (being a feminist) as ""she hates men""... I'm actually pretty happy with the world and love men.' Last week a survey carried out among Girl Guides found that children as young as seven felt subjected to sexual taunts in the playground. Almost half of those aged between 11 and 16 who took part in the annual Girl Guides Attitudes Survey said that teachers had dismissed complaints of sexual harassment. Chief Denise King said: ‘This shocking research shows we must act to stop sexual harassment being normalised by our society. ‘We want to ensure all girls live in a safe, fair and equal society that lets them reach their full potential. Seven out of 10 girls aged between 13 and 16 said that those who reported incidents of sexual harassment risked being bullied or teased (file image) 'We’re calling on all politicians to take a stand.’ Earlier this year the organisation launched a manifesto demanding compulsory school lessons in body confidence. The historic youth movement for girls said it was making its intervention into politics because ‘young women still believe they are too often treated like second-class citizens.’ Claiming that three quarters of teenage girls believe sexism affects most areas of their lives, the Guides said that there is ‘overwhelming evidence of inequality for girls in the UK.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged his support for the movement’s Girls Matter equality campaign.","Julie Bentley said girls must be taught about myths surrounding sex .

"A deadly 10ft shark usually found in the Caribbean has been found washed up on a picturesque beach in north Wales. The dead Mako shark was discovered on Friday by fishermen on Barmouth Beach, on the edge of Snowdonia park, leading families and young children to gather round the animal. Mako sharks, which attack by lunging up from deep water to rip chunks of flesh from their prey, killed three people between 1980 and 2010. The 10ft Mako shark was found washed up on Barmouth Beach, north Wales, on Friday . Children and parents were seen touching the deadly predator after it was found on the beach 20 miles north of Aberystwyth . Gwion Liggett, was one of the first to see the shark after it washed up on the popular holiday beach, with word soon spreading throughout the coastal hamlet. He said: 'When I arrived at the beach around sunset there was a huge crowd gathering around it. 'I was surprised it wasn't just a fisherman's tale. 'I was taken aback not just by how long it was but also how wide - it is a serious shark.' Mako sharks are the fastest shark in the world and normally feed on squid and fish such as mackerel, tuna and swordfish. They are a threatened species and are usually found in tropical waters between California and Chile, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. There were 42 recorded Mako shark attacks on humans over 30 years, with three people killed as well as 20 boat attacks. An average Mako will grow up to 10ft in length, swim in excess of 30mph and can weigh up to 21stone.

There were 42 recorded Mako shark attacks on humans over 30 years, with three people killed as well as 20 boat attacks . 'It has got that feeling of Jaws and Amity Island,' Mr Liggett, who has taken his partner and primary school age children to see the predator, said. 'A lot of people will be hesitant to get back in the water after this. Maybe it is fortunate it has happened at this time of year so people can have some time to get over it. 'If it had happened in summer then I think a lot less people and holidaymakers would be in the water. 'I overheard some local kids talking about becoming Marine Biologists after seeing this creature. A huge shark on the beach is big news in little Barmouth.' The shark is still lying on the beach and no one has come to collect it despite the Harbour Master letting the relevant authorities know about it. Trophy hunters have been pulling razor-sharp teeth from the dead shark since it was found on Friday.","Huge Mako shark found washed up on north Wales beach by fishermen .

"Banish the bucket, sponge and hose. Japanese giant Nissan has developed the world’s first  ‘self-cleaning car’ which it predicts will make car-washing ‘obsolete.’ Its UK engineers are testing innovative ‘nano-paint technology’ which repels dirt before it gets a chance to take hold on the paintwork. Scroll down for video... Nissan has been testing nanopaint technology that repels dirt before it sticks. Here you can see the split on the car, with the nanopaint being used on the right but not on the left, showing how it stopped dirt sticking . For drivers who would rather run a mile than wipe down their dirty vehicles with a sponge or wince at the high cost of a car-wash, it means salvation may soon be at hand. It is set to be an option on future models but is being tested in Britain on the new Sunderland-built Nissan Note which went on sale in October priced from £12,100 to £17,100. No price has yet been set but it is likely to be around £450 ($750) – or similar to a metallic paint option. A Nissan spokesman said: ‘The Nissan Note is first car to trial paint which could make car washes obsolete. ‘Washing a car can be a chore - and a costly one at that. In response, Nissan has begun tests on innovative paint technology that repels mud, rain and everyday dirt, meaning drivers may never have to clean their car again.’ Scientists have developed ‘super-hydrophobic’ and ‘oleophobic’ paint, which repels water and oils. It has been applied to the all-new Nissan Note supermini  to create what it calls ‘the world's first self-cleaning car’. Nissan says it is the first to apply the trade-marked technology called Ultra-Ever Dry on automotive bodywork . A Nissan spokesman said: 'By creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment, it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car's surface' Nissan says it is the first carmaker to apply the trade-marked technology called Ultra-Ever Dry® on automotive bodywork and will be testing it ‘in the real world’ over the coming months at its European Technical Centre at Cranfield in Bedfordshire. Explaining how the dirt-repellent coating works, a Nissan spokesman said: ‘By creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment, it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car's surface.’ The Note already features a ‘wash and blow dry' function on its rear view camera. This uses water and compressed air to automatically keep the lens free of dirt and ensure the Notes' safety sensors work in all conditions. A spokesman said: ‘So far, the coating has responded well to common use cases including rain, spray, frost, sleet and standing water.’ Chief marketing manager Geraldine Ingham said; ‘The Nissan Note has been carefully engineered to take the stress out of customer driving and Nissan's engineers are constantly thinking of new ways to make families' lives easier. ‘We are committed to addressing everyday problems our customers face and will always consider testing exciting, cutting edge technology like this incredible coating application.’ Nissan employs 8,500 people in Britain, including 7,300 at the Sunderland factory, 950 at the Cranfield Technical Centre and 50 at Nissan’s European design centre at Paddington in London. So far the coating has responded well to common use cases including rain, spray and standing water .","Nissan has unveiled its nanopaint technology that stops a car getting dirty .

"Talk about stealing someone's thunder. NSW Police were forced to shut down the 23rd annual Tropfest Film Festival when terrifying lightning strikes put spectators at risk. However, Sydney's ferocious rain and cracking thunder could not dampen the festival-goers' enthusiasm, as a number of determined spectators returned in ponchos to sit in the soggy grass and watch the exhibition. It was a display of great bravery, as earlier festival-goers had been warned 'we're about to be hit by lightning!' Scroll down for video . A comparison of the 2013 and 2014 Tropfest crowds: A record-breaking crowd of 95,000 attended the festival at Centennial last year (inset), whereas many spectators were 'washed away' when the festival was temporarily closed down on Sunday night . The crowds were lashed with heavy rain before NSW Police were forced to evacuate the crowds due to extreme weather and dangerous lightning . Spectators were offered an early show when Sydney's 'storm week' continued, with dark and foreboding clouds leering overhead . 'Granny Smith' was announced the 2014 Tropfest winner; a dark comedy directed by Julian Lucas and produced by Nicholas Cox. Each of the short films were required to incorporate the signature item: a mirror. After Lucas's win, the Melbourne filmmaker revealed that he was close to tears about 6pm while on the phone to his dad. 'I was freaking out big time, when that rain was coming in and when that notice came up on the screen that things were cancelled,' he told AAP. 'I could see the crowd exiting and I just thought, `you put so much time and effort into this' and I know it's an outdoor festival, but you just don't think it's going to happen. 'That's the least of your worries, the weather.' When they arrived, people at the festival were offered an early show, when the sky darkened, lightning cracked across the sky and an intense storm closed in. At around 5.30pm, NSW Police and Tropfest organisers announced that the festival, held in Centennial Park in Sydney's east, was 'closed due to very extreme weather conditions'. 'Granny Smith' was announced the 2014 Tropfest winner; a dark comedy directed by Julian Lucas and produced by Nicholas Cox . Several hundred spectators persisted and returned, wearing ponchos, to watch the short film entrants . Film fanatics were even warned not to wait in the event tents due to the danger of being struck by lightning, with people warned to move away from metal objects . Spectators tried to withstand the storm but struggled when they were unable to take shelter, warned by officials to avoid trees and even tents as the vicious storm continued. 'Move away from all metal objects! Do not stand next to the sides of the tent, we're about to get hit by lightning,' a spokesman warned the crowd from inside a tent at the festival, according to SMH. The event was closed for more than an hour, meaning many spectators packed up their blankets and picnic baskets and returned home. 'Can't make it to #tropfest tonight, but have poured of bucket of water over my head and set up a few leaf blowers to replicate the experience,' tweeted musician Brendan Maclean. However, Tropfest prevailed, with organisers tweeting: 'Nice try #SydneyStorm. We're back!' By the time the event was re-opened, a slightly lack-lustre crowd remained of just 'several hundred'. Most film fanatics opted to watch the television broadcast on SBS from their cosy and, more importantly, dry couches. Crowds enjoyed themselves nonetheless - although some might have been wishing they were sitting on their warm, dry couches at home . The crowd was a sorry sight at the 2014 Tropfest Film Festival, considering the hype and expectations . A very different sight: In 2013, the first year at the new venue Centennial Park, the festival drew in a record-breaking crowd . Not a person in sight after Centennial Park was evacuated by NSW Police . A fan on Twitter explained the situation perfectly, with @pixelbender83 tweeting: 'I came. I saw. I got drenched. I left. I returned home. I returned! #Tropfest 2014.' In 2013, Tropfest drew a record crowd of more than 95,000 people at the Sydney site alone. On average, Tropfest attracts a live national audience of around 150,000 people, with people also attending in other capital ciites around Australia. It was terrible luck, as the festival had been moved from February to December this year after Tropfest had been affected by rainy conditions in previous years. Only one festival has been cancelled due to wild weather, but Tropfest was notably 2012 . After studying weather patterns, the festival's organisers had decided that December was a much safer option. It was a dark and gloomy sight at Tropfest Short Film Festival at Sydney's Centennial Park . Host Adam Spencer jokes 'First time for everything: #ImBlowdryingMyPants' Musician Brendan Maclean is clearly not envious of the drenched crowd at Centennial Park! 'If you look it up, statistically Sydney has almost double the rainfall in February than it has in December, so I'm not going to pretend that didn't have something to do with it either,' Tropfest founder John Polson told AAP at the time. The soaked spectators kept their sense of humour, taking to social media to make light of the intense Sydney storm, with a tent at the event jokingly offering free flotation devices to prevent fans from washing away. Siobhan Kennedy tweets for help as the flood rose around her at Tropfest . Hopeful Tropfest entrant Dmitri Golovko pleads with brave film enthusiasts to attend, despite the wild weather . Pool noodle, anyone? Reef Reels were happy to help out in any way they can . Tropfest and NSW Police both announced that the festival was closed due to dangerous lightning strikes . Adam Spencer, who hosted the event alongside SBS' Marc Fennell and Jeannette Francis, tweeted a photo to show that to his amusement, he had needed to blow-dry his pants. 'I assume #tropfest is short for tropical storm festival' pointed out Andrew Peake in a tweet. 'It is like they are doomed by the weather,' said Tropfest judge, Margaret Pomeranz. Not defeated!

"The couple whose picturesque proposal on a remote peak sparked an unexpected social media manhunt has been identified. A striking image of a man kneeling in front of his new fiancée atop Munra Point, Oregon, with a dramatic cloudy backdrop, was snapped by a passing walker, unbeknownst to the two sweethearts. When posted to social media and internet forums, the image prompted hundreds of internet vigilantes to track down the happy couple, now identified as Alex Gensitskiy and Katie Verkovod.

Gensitskiy and Verkovod, both from Washington, met at church camp in early 2013, according to local news station KATU. In an account of the proposal posted on a crowdfunding page for their honeymoon, Gensitskiy described his nervousness as he climbed the slope. He said: 'As we ascended the mountain my heart beat as fast as a drum. Boom, boom, boom...

Together: The couple are now planning a honeymoon to south-east Asia following their wedding in July . Gensitskiy later explained that he was actually hoping that nobody would notice them during the fateful ascent, so he would have a clear stage to pop the question. He told KATU he was thinking: 'Oh man, I hope they don’t come up to us or anything... I’m about to propose! You know, I don’t want people around!' Responding to the photograph's popularity, Verkovod said: 'I was kinda shocked, because I wasn’t expecting taking a picture because we didn’t have our phones'.

"A minute's silence will be held tonight in memory of a mother and her newborn baby who were found dead in Bristol, before a ceremony to celebrate 150 years of Clifton Suspension Bridge takes place. There had been calls for the ceremony to be cancelled after the bodies of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter Zaani Tiana were found in the city last week. But organisers decided the celebration of the bridge, which was designed in 1829, will go ahead with a silence before hand to allow people to pay their respects to mother and daughter. A minute's silence will be held tonight in memory of Bristol mother Charlotte Bevan and her daughter who were found dead last week, before a ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton Suspension Bridge begins . Police began an urgent search for Miss Bevan, 30, and her child after she was seen on CCTV walking through the hospital before she left the maternity ward at St Michael's Hospital on Tuesday. She was wearing slippers and her daughter was wrapped in a blanket as temperatures plunged to near freezing in some areas. Miss Bevan's body was found in Avon Gorge the next day, close to Clifton Suspension Bridge. Zaani Tiana, who was just four days old, was found hours later on a cliff face. It has been claimed Miss Bevan, who was suffering from depression and schizophrenia, had stopped taking her medication so she could breastfeed her baby. She may also have been concerned that the authorities were going to take away her child as she had been closely monitored during her pregnancy. Charlotte Bevan (left) was seen on CCTV walking out of St Michael's Hospital in Bristol with newborn Zaani . Flowers have been left on the road opposite Clifton suspension bridge, near to where Miss Bevan was found . Flowers have been left on the road overlooking historic Clifton suspension bridge in memory of Miss Bevan and Zaani. Calls had been made to cancel celebrations, which start this evening, to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton suspension bridge. After the minute's silence there will be a firework display launched from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge. On Monday there will be a special procession to stage a re-enactment of the opening ceremony 150 years ago, finishing at the new Suspension Bridge Visitor Centre. A ceremony will be held to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton suspension bridge, which is maintained by painters like Arthur Heal (left) and sees air balloons pass over it (right) for the annual Bristol balloon fiesta . A statement, issued by the Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust, said: 'Having thought very deeply about this, it is felt that the planned event should go ahead. 'The loss of Charlotte and Zaani, as well others who have previously died in the Avon Gorge, will be marked by a minute of quiet and reflection prior to the start of the firework display at 7pm. 'We will set up a collection with the proceeds going to a charity, which we hope to discuss with Charlotte's family at an appropriate time.' The project to build Clifton Suspension Bridge began in 1754 when William Vick, a Bristol wine merchant, left £1,000 in his will to the Society of Merchant Venturers, a guild which managed the port at Bristol. Once this investment grew to £10,000 it was to be used to create a stone bridge connecting Bristol to north Somerset . By 1829 around £8,000 had been raised and a competition was launched to find a designer for the bridge . However no winner was found and after a second round Isambard Kingdom Brunel, 23, was chosen to be project engineer. On June 21, 1831, a ceremony was held to commemorate the start of the works - which were not to be completed for almost 30 years. By 1843 only the towers of the bridge had been completed and the project was abandoned. Brunel died in 1859, never able to see the finished work from his design. Colleagues of Brunel at the Institution of Civil Engineers decided the bridge would be a fitting memorial to the engineer and they started to fundraise for the project. Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge was being demolished at the time and its chains were brought in to use at Clifton. Work was started again and the bridge was eventually completed in 1864. It spans 702ft and sits 245ft above the water. The bridge was originally designed to carry horse drawn carriages and pedestrians but has remained so strong it is now capable of carrying a million cars a year. Clifton suspension bridge was originally built for horse drawn carriages but now carries 1million cars a year . Who was Isambard Kingdom Brunel? Isambard Kingdom Brunel was a respected Victorian engineer who transformed public transport . Brunel was a mechanical and civil engineer whose work on bridges and tunnels across Britain helped the development of the railways gather pace. He also built dockyards and steamships, making a huge contribution to the development of public transport. Prior to leading the Clifton Suspension Bridge project, Brunel had  been appointed resident engineer on the Thames tunnel but almost died when the roof collapsed and the tunnel flooded in 1827. He later held a banquet there to restore people's confidence in the project. In 1829 he won a competition to become project engineer of Clifton Suspension Bridge and work started two years later. Brunel began to be associated with Bristol docks in 1832, which he helped modernise. In 1833 he was appointed as chief engineer to Great Western Railway and began work to start modernising Bristol docks. Three years later work had restarted on the Thames tunnel and Brunel was appointed engineer at Great Western Steam Ship company. The SS Great Western, proposed by Brunel years earlier, sailed from Bristol to New York in 15 days in 1838. As part of his design for the Great Western Railway Brunel needed to organise digging a tunnel through solid stone in Bath. This became known as Box Tunnel and construction began in 1836 and was opened in 1841. He was also the engineer for Hungerford's suspension bridge and was appointed engineer of South Devon Railways. Brunel also designed the Royal Albert Bridge in 1855 for the Cornwall Railway.","Celebrations start today for 150th anniversary of Clifton Suspension Bridge .

"A new Yorkshire challenger is emerging in the Daily Mail Schools Trophy this season following the success last year of Bradford-based Woodhouse Grove. While the champions have slipped up once in three games, Grammar School at Leeds (GSAL) are the early unbeaten leaders this time around. Four tries from centre Tom Gorman was the highlight of the Leeds team's latest success over Durham, 46-10, in the merit-table based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. This demolition followed on from wins over St Peter's (York), 59-7 and Ampleforth 66-7. Clifton prop Haydn Thomas scores after a determined forward drive against King's School Taunton . Gorman is part of a squad who have been playing together throughout their secondary school years. Their biggest success so far was winning the national under-15s cup three years ago, against St Joseph's, which included a hat-trick from the centre. John Mackenzie, director of rugby ay GSAL, rated the win over Durham to be the best this season. 'The conditions were pretty poor so we had to adapt and play a little bit tighter than we had in the previous games. It was a very pleasing performance,' he said. Gorman was backed up by two tries from wing Chris Bridge while the forward effort was led by lock Harry Francis and captain Sam Ward at hooker. Clifton's Tom Beck in try-scoring action against Bryanston - the No 8 scored three tries in a 28-20 win . Grove, who had their unbeaten record in the competition taken by St Peter's, regained form by beating QEGS Wakefield, 20-0. Epsom College, also unbeaten in three games, are leading the southern challenge. They are maintaining the good form which brought an outstanding 2013-14 season. A win over Cranleigh, 28-7, featured two tries from flanker George Mount. Another outstanding individual effort came from Clifton College's versatile Tom Beck. The No 8 or centre, who captains the Bristol academy, scored three tries in a 28-20 win over Bryanston. Bradford-based Woodhouse Grove are the reigning champions but have lost one of their first three games . Clifton, who had also beaten Pate's GS and King's College Taunton, spoiled the good start by losing on Tuesday evening to Kingswood School of Bath, 30-10.

"The USS Arizona is one of the nation's most hallowed sites, an underwater grave for more than 900 sailors and Marines killed when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and sank their ship in 1941. Now, it's the scene of alleged rampant mismanagement. An internal report from the National Park Service, which operates a visitors' center for a memorial at the battleship, said tour companies sold tickets with the knowledge of park officials even though tickets are supposed to be free. Under fire: Caretakers at the Pearl Harbor memorial in Hawaii are under fire for allowing tour companies to sell tickets to the free memorial and for letting the museum fall into disrepair . Details of two reports about mismanagement at the monument came to light just a month before survivors of the Pearl harbor attacks gathered . Another pointed to substandard maintenance, including scuffed museum walls that languished unrepaired and bird feces that wasn't cleaned. The revelations in documents released last month come just before crowds gather at Pearl Harbor on Sunday for an annual ceremony remembering more than 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers killed 73 years ago. 'To watch the desecration of a very sacred, very important place was very disheartening,' said John Landrysmith, a former park service guide and 41-year-old Iraq War veteran. He quit his job earlier this year after feeling his supervisor was punishing him for questioning the ticket policy and believing the park service failed to act on his complaints. He intends to file a whistleblower retaliation lawsuit against the park service. Park superintendent Paul DePrey said the park service was trying to accommodate the tour companies, which bring busloads of people each day. 'It was not intended for a huge glut of tickets that were going to just the tour companies,' he said 'We tried to work that system the best we could. It was not successful.' The practice stopped when they realized it didn't comply with park service policy and wasn't working as intended, he said. A new ticketing system starting next month, DePrey said, will do a better job laying out the terms and conditions of the permits commercial tour companies operate under. The park service will also start scanning tickets to get data on how they are being used. Report: An internal report from the National Park Service, which operates a visitors' center for a memorial at the battleship, said tour companies sold tickets with the knowledge of park officials even though tickets are supposed to be free . The problems outlined in the reports are centered at the visitor's center, which anyone visiting the Arizona and the memorial must pass through. The $56-million complex, rebuilt four years ago, explains events leading up and during the attack with the help of museum exhibits and movie screenings. Visitors then board boats to the white, open-air memorial that sits atop the Arizona's rusting hull. There are only 4,350 boat tickets available each day. That amounts to less than 1.6 million tickets a year, even though the park service says 1.8 million people visit Pearl Harbor annually. A September 2013 park service report said there was 'at minimum' no transparency in the way tickets were distributed. The report, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the nonprofit group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, outlined how park service employees gave walk-in tickets intended for independent visitors to commercial tour companies who then sold them. Tickets were also given to Pacific Historic Parks, a nonprofit that runs a gift shop and raises money for the memorial. The organization gave some to people spending $7 to rent an audio tour from the nonprofit, and gave others to companies that would lead clients to the audio tours, the report said. There were rarely enough tickets for independent visitors while this was going on, the report said. Veterans who survived the Pearl Harbor attack are gathering for the 73rd anniversary of the Japanese bombing that launched the United States into World War II. About 100 Pearl Harbor and World War II survivors are expected to attend Sunday's ceremony. Many of them arrived well before the sun came up. Gilbert Meyer is attending his 10th ceremony. However, the 91-year-old USS Utah survivor says it's getting harder to travel to Hawaii from San Antonio, Texas. Many of Meyer's comrades arrived with the help of canes, wheelchairs and motorized scooters. They were greeted with purple orchid lei. A moment of silence was held at 7:55 a.m., the moment the bombing began in 1941. F-22 fighter jets executed a missing-man flyover. Survivor: Delton E.

Walling (center) speaks with Chief Petty Officer Rex Parmelee before the start of a memorial service for the 73rd anniversary of the attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl harbor on the island of Oahu at the Pacific National Monument on December 7 Hawaii . DePrey said visitors pay the companies for the transportation they provide to Pearl Harbor from Waikiki hotels and other places not for the tickets. Yet the report said uniformed commercial tour drivers were observed standing about 15 feet in front of the park service information desk -- in full view of the park ranger -- offering tickets to visitors who were already at Pearl Harbor. Another anecdote said two visitors reported being sold tickets for $39 each by a tour company even though they drove their own rental car to the visitor's center. A separate internal report listed a slew of maintenance issues. Photos from the report show peeling paint in the museum and accumulated bird droppings. Some maintenance problems persist. Visitors to the museum today will see silver duct tape securing a black ribbon with the words 'Exhibit Temporarily Unavailable' to an empty glass case that once held model of the Arizona. The exhibit's been down for a year. Outside, an orange plastic fence surrounds a muddy spot where a water catchment basin isn't working as intended. The fence has been up since last December, the park service said. The park service is trying to keep the facility in as good condition as it can, DePrey said. 'I'm not happy when I see aspects of the facility that are in poor condition. It's not something that I or my maintenance or the park rangers are proud of,' DePrey said. 'But we are realistic that these things will happen from time to time.' Kathryn Holt kisses U.S.S.

"MPs have been accused of increasing their family income by hiring relatives and giving them pay rises. New figures show the bill for family members on the public payroll has soared by 50 per cent since the general election to hit almost £3.8million. Several Cabinet ministers are among almost 170 MPs who declare that they have a relative on their staff, with their wages funded by the taxpayer. Scroll down for video . New figures reveal a sharp increase in the cost of MPs' employing relatives, up from £2.4million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14 . In the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal, Parliament's standards watchdog called for a ban on politicians hiring loved ones to work in their office in the constituency or in the Commons. But MPs attacked the 'incendiary' plan and threatened to get around the ban with a 'wife swap' arrangement, with spouses switching to work for backbenchers. When the new expenses regime was introduced in 2010, MPs were allowed to hire one relative, with the details declared on a register. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is now responsible for policing MPs' claims, has revealed a sharp increase in the practice. In 2010 there were 137 MPs employing family members but the figure soared to 167 last year. The total pay bill has rocketed from £24million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14. It means that the average salary paid to family members has risen by a third, from just over £17,101 to just over £22,400. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's (left) wife Susan earns up to £39,999 while Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) pays his wife Lynne up to £44,999, latest figures show . Sir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the parliamentary standards committee, told the Sunday Times: 'It is just a handy way of boosting their income really isn't it? A 50% increase — they have had a good pay rise. 'Given that it is family members — in most cases spouses — in effect it is boosting family income and MPs are in reality effectively giving themselves an increase by increasing the pay of the family member who is working for them. 'It highlights really that given these people do not go through a competitive recruitment process, the present system is not really very acceptable.' Sir Alistair did not call for a ban, but said there must be more scrutiny of the money being paid out. Senior MPs who pay relatives include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, whose wife Lynne earns up to £44,999, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon who pays his wife Wendy up to £19,999 and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's wife Susan earns up to £39,999. Ipsa does not publish exact pay details, but gives salary bands in £5,000. Records show two Tory MPs pay their wives the most. Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint (left) pays her husband Phil Cole as her senior parliamentary assistant on up to £39,999. Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn pays his wife Sally up to £24,999 . Peter Bone's wife Jeannette receives between £45,000 and £49,999 a year for working as her husband's office manager. Christopher Chope's wife Christine is in in the same salary bracket. Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn pays his wife Sally up to £24,999. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint pays her husband Phil Cole as her senior parliamentary assistant on up to £39,999. Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher's wife Joanna earns up to £34,999 after moving up three pay bands when she became his office manager. Ipsa said: 'We have introduced a number of restrictions and safeguards to regulate MPs employing family members or other connected parties. 'And, crucially, we think the public should know about these arrangements — which is why we publish all the details including the name, job title and salary range of all connected parties employed by MPs.'","Almost 170 MPs have spouses, children and relatives on public payroll .

"Two members of the Government’s paedophile inquiry today faced resignation calls from victims who were allegedly sent threatening or insulting emails after they criticised the investigation. Lawyers for abuse survivor Andrew Lavery have complained to Home Secretary Theresa May over messages from a panel member  - including an email sent two days before they were due to meet. They claim Graham Wilmer threatened him after a social media row between another abuse victim and the panel member’s son, who tried to confront critics against his father’s place on the inquiry. Holding a paedophile inquiry: Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) has received a complaint from the lawyer of an abuse survivor over messages from a member of her panel into child sex abuse claims . Mr Lavery's lawyer Alison Millar told the Observer that the 'private communications with our client, a man who is deeply traumatised by his experience of abuse, certainly seem ill-advised to us'. Meanwhile former child protection manager Peter McKelvie has complained about an apparently inappropriate email from panellist Barbara Hearn - about whom he has previously raised questions. Last week, the Mail reported how 23 victims of alleged historical child abuse had told Mrs May, 58, they were withdrawing support from the Government’s inquiry, claiming it was ‘not fit for purpose’. Mrs May set up the inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an Establishment cover-up of a murderous paedophile ring around Westminster in the 1980s. Gone: Mrs May has struggled to put in place a chairman retaining the confidence of victim groups. Fiona Woolf (left) and Baroness Butler-Sloss (right) quit amid concerns about their close links to certain figures . But she has struggled to put in place a chairman retaining the confidence of victim groups. Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss have quit amid concerns about their close links to certain figures. The latest developments will trouble Mrs May. A source close to the inquiry told the Observer that the emails should not have been sent, leaving the panel members’ fates in doubt. A crunch meeting on Friday between Mrs May and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims was told that the allegations against panel members were being probed by an unnamed QC. Mr Lavery - who has previously spoken of abuse at a Catholic boarding school - was first in contact with Mr Wilmer in summer last year, claimed to have received ‘unsolicited communications’ from the panel member after speaking out about the inquiry. Complaint: Lawyers for abuse survivor Andrew Lavery have contacted Home Secretary Theresa May over messages from panel member Graham Wilmer (pictured) - including an email sent two days before a meeting . The abuse survivor was most concerned about an email sent by Mr Wilmer ahead of a meeting last month, which said he was ‘looking forward to meeting’ him and had been studying his tweets. The message said: ‘The insults you have issued about me, I have no problem with - you are entitled to your opinion. However, what has been said about my son, Rory, is a different matter.’ Mr Lavery's team said that after the email, he 'did not feel comfortable about attending the meeting'. But Mr Wilmer has denied that he intended the email to be threatening, according to the Observer. Mr McKelvie said he was worried that Ms Hearn used to work at the National Children’s Bureau, where a Paedophile Information Exchange member had a job as a consultant in the early 1970s. He also has concerns about her alleged connections with social work managers from Islington Council in north London, where there is known to have been sexual abuse in children’s homes. Fiona Woolf said in October that she had no choice but to quit as chairman of the inquiry after accepting the victims had lost all confidence in her ability to conduct the investigation impartially. It followed sustained pressure over her links with the former home secretary, Lord Brittan, who is facing claims that he failed to act on a dossier of paedophile allegations in the 1980s. Her departure was a huge blow after the previous chairman, Baroness Butler-Sloss, also had to quit because her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general during the same period. Mrs Woolf's links to Lord Brittan came under scrutiny because he is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about his handling of child abuse allegations.","Lawyers for abuse survivor Andrew Lavery complain to Home Secretary .

"A British-born father and three of his sons, all accused of being Islamist extremists with ties to al-Qaeda, have been exiled by Theresa May because of the threat to national security. They are believed to be the first British family to be collectively stripped of their citizenship since Mrs May took over in 2010 and the father said the decision was 'tearing our family apart'. The father admitted his daughter had gone to fight in Syria with her husband, a known jihadist, but denied the terrorism allegations levelled at him. Scroll down for video . A British-born father (left with his two granddaughters and his fourth son) has been stripped of his British citizenship because of the threat to national security. Right: One of his exiled sons, who is in his twenties . The 51-year-old father from Newcastle had his citizenship revoked, along with his three sons aged in their twenties, under the British Nationality Act 1981 while they were in Pakistan. His wife and their fourth son, a disabled teenager, have not been exiled but could not return to Britain because they wanted to remain with the rest of the family. 'We are innocent of all the allegations but our situation prevents us from answering the allegations,' the 51-year-old told the Sunday Times. 'We are British through and through. The best of British values don't contradict Islamic values. To this day, English is the only language we speak. Home secretary Theresa May has exiled a British-born father and three of his sons all accused of being Islamist extremists . 'We as a family have been abandoned by the British [government] and this is tearing our family apart.' He denied 'ridiculous' claims that he was linked to both al-Qaeda and Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), saying that would be like being involved in the Conservative and the Labour party. But he revealed that his daughter, 22, was now living in Syria with her three children and 'abusive husband' who was treated like a VIP by jihadists. He said he saw a picture of his daughter, who still has British citizenship, posing with a heavy sub-machine gun. The family will be appealing the decision after a legal attempt to reinstate their citizenship was thrown out by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). They all have Pakistani passports, but said they feel like outsiders in the country and were desperate to 'return home'. A spokeswoman from Liberty, the human rights body, said the family were victims of the UK's secret courts. In his judgment, Mr Justice Mitting acknowledged the impact on the private and family life of the wife and youngest son who both remain British citizens. But he said the move was 'justifiable' because of the 'threat to national security'. Mrs May said her decision was based on an assessment by MI5, the security service and the claims that they were linked to terrorist groups. A letter sent to the family in 2011 and signed by the Home Secretary said their citizenship would be revoked because 'it would be conducive to the public good'. The father denied claims that he was linked to both al-Qaeda (pictured) and Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba . A British-born family have been stripped on their citizenship for alleged links to terrorism, amid claims they are the victims of the UK's secret courts, pictured is the Royal Courts of Justice . 'My decision has been taken in part reliance on information which, in my opinion, should not be made public in the interests of national security and because disclosure would be contrary to the public interest,' the letter adds. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases. 'Since May 2010 there have been 27 people who have had their citizenship revoked and for the overwhelming majority this was because of terrorist activities.'","British-born father and three of his sons have been stripped of citizenship .

"Shoppers who have bought presents through the Marks & Spencer website face an anxious wait for their Christmas orders due to problems plaguing the firm’s delivery service. The retailer warned customers that deliveries could take up to two weeks. The brand has also been forced to suspend its next-day-delivery service. The delays, caused by a backlog of orders following Black Friday last week, have hit the retailer today - ‘Manic Monday’ - which marks one of the busiest shopping day of the year. Customers have been told deliveries from Marks and Spencer may take weeks following a surge of orders on Black Friday . The Castle Donington distribution centre in the east Midlands which opened last year has been unable to keep up with demand. When the centre opened, Marks & Spencer said that it would be able to handle 1million items a day. Disgruntled shoppers took to social media to complain about the service provided by Marks & Spencer. One shopper, Sue Smith, wrote on the Marks & Spencer Facebook page: ‘Thirteen WORKING (ie, Mon-Fri) days wait for free/standard delivery. You’re having a laugh - we’ve had orders from China delivered quicker than that and at a similar cost too.’ Another Twitter user @gazbroc wrote: ‘@marksandspencer poor service from M&S who supposedly prides itself on delighting it’s customers !!ordered Xmas tree 24th nov STILL WAITING!’ A Marks & Spencer spokesperson said: ‘Our customer is always our top priority and that is why we’ve extended some of our delivery options. The vast majority of orders are delivered on time. If we do miss a delivery date, we will do all we can to rectify it for the customer.’ Today, stores are offering deeper Christmas discounts than last year as they attempt to shift unsold stock on one of the biggest days of the year for on-line shopping. The details have been revealed by accountants Deloitte which will see hundreds of millions of pounds spent by bargain hunters in search of the perfect Christmas gift on ‘Manic Monday’. Industry experts predict that up to £750million will be spent online today, which is £520,000 a minute, which would be around 40per cent higher than last year. Scots are expected to spend in the region of £63 million, following on from a combined £128 million spent on so called ‘Black Friday’ and ‘Cyber Monday’. An estimated £750million will be spent online today in what is known as Manic Monday (file image) Deloitte said the success of ‘Black Friday’ in terms of online sales and getting shoppers through the door has changed the way retailers and consumers view the run-up to Christmas. It seems shoppers who have suffered a six year cost of living squeeze are refusing to make purchases unless retailers can promise them a bargain. The firm said it is the fourth year in a row that Christmas discounts have come earlier and been larger than the year before. However, Deloitte warned shoppers that some retailers appear to have bought stock in specifically to offer pre-Christmas discounts and create the impression of bargains. It said: ‘An unseasonably warm autumn has left many retailers, especially in fashion, trying to clear unsold winter stock as they enter the most important trading period of the year. ‘For many, the discounting season kicked off with the Black Friday weekend, the biggest ever seen in the UK. However, all is not as it seems, with some retailers buying in stock specifically with pre-Christmas discounting in mind.’ Consumer business partner at Deloitte, Jason Gordon, said: ‘At the moment we are seeing marginally deeper pre-Christmas reductions than last year, and the success of Black Friday has demonstrated the UK consumers’ appetite for a bargain. ‘However, retailers need to be careful not to create a consumer that is only willing to buy heavily discounted items, especially as a lot of the products reduced on Black Friday were ‘bought for sale’.’ Deloitte research found there is already a wide spread of discounts across the market, ranging from eight per cent to 78per cent. It said they are likely to grow in number and size, with discounts of up to 90per cent anticipated after Christmas. Weekends remain the key days for retailers when it comes to the timing of promotions, with the last weekend before Christmas set to be pivotal both in-store and online, thanks to the growth of click and collect. Mr Gordon said: ‘Christmas falls on a Thursday this year, so retailers could wait until early that week to make their final big pre-Christmas discounts, but we predict they will come before that, on the final weekend. After Christmas further discounts are expected on Boxing Day. Shoppers clamber over each other on December 26 last year in Selfridges (above) 'Looking beyond Christmas, at the current sales velocity we will have noticeably deeper discounts from Boxing Day.’ Historically, Manic Monday has been busier for web stores than Black Friday, however that seems unlikely this year. Internet sales in the UK on Black Friday were an estimated £810million, which was almost 50per cent higher than expected by the industry. Amazon is releasing a number of ‘lightning deals’ today. Fashion brand Asos is offering 20 per cent off Asos branded items, while Body Shop is offering 40 per cent off when you buy three items, and 30 per cent off when you buy two. Currys PC World are offering savings up to £500 on certain large-screen TVs, and up to £200 on large kitchen appliances. M&S offered a 50 per cent-off ‘gifting weekend’ sale with deals that are still available today and there is also up to 70 per cent on selected sale items. Topshop is also offering savings of up to 65 per cent.","Retailer warned deliveries could take weeks after surge in online sales .

"Alan Whitehead, Labour MP, said motorists who want to drive could be forced to join 'car clubs' in an article examining Britain's infrastructure problems . Owning a car could be ‘outlawed’ to force people on to public transport, a senior Labour MP has suggested. Motorists who want to drive could instead be forced to join communal ‘car clubs’ where the cars are shared by drivers and used only when needed. Dr Alan Whitehead, a Labour MP for Southampton Test and a member of the Energy and Climate Change select committee, said the increase in car ownership would lead to ‘something approaching a national traffic jam before 2040’. He claimed that radical action would be needed to avoid national gridlock. In an article in the Guardian, Dr Whitehead wrote: ‘We need to consider doing something serious. What we need is a considerable expansion of public transport over the next period and a shift from car to bus, train, bike or even feet. The big problem is how to do it.’ He went on to suggest that ‘outlawing’ car ownership was better than banning car use altogether, preferring ‘regulation rather than prohibition’. Dr Whitehead added: ‘What if the Government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present (hopefully with an increasing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles) but outlawed individual ownership? He warned the rise in car ownership would lead to ‘something approaching a national traffic jam before 2040’ ‘People would then lease cars individually or as part of a club and the running costs would be included in the lease arrangements. No one would be prohibited from using a car, but the playing field of choice would instantly be levelled.’ But his suggestions were last night described as ‘bonkers’ by transport minister Robert Goodwill, who said Labour had waged a ‘13-year war’ against motorists.","Dr Alan Whitehead said owning a car could be 'outlawed' to force people to use public transport in article in article examining UK traffic issues .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott is finishing the year with disasterous results in public opinion polls, with the latest showing voters rate Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as stronger, more trustworthy and more competent. Mr Shorten leads the prime minister as the country's preferred leader by a margin of 47 per cent to 39 per cent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll. The Opposition Leader is considered to be 'more trustworthy, competent and open to new ideas' than Mr Abbott. Scroll down for video . Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is seen as more trustworthy and competent that Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the latest Fairfax-Ipsos opinion poll . The result is a marked decline from a survey conducted just four weeks ago, in which the two leaders were level pegging on 41 per cent each. On a two-party preferred basis, the latest poll shows Labor leading the coalition 53 per cent to 47 per cent - slightly behind a recent latest Galaxy poll, which put the opposition ahead of the government 55 per cent to 45 per cent. The latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll, a survey of 1401 voters taken by phone December 4-6, come after what Mr Abbott conceded was a 'ragged week for the government.' The government's image has taken a battering due to the stalling of important budget measures in the Senate and the Coalition's election defeat in Victoria after just one term. The Fairfax Ipsos poll results suggest the government's problems run deeper than just having a tough week. It is the government's worst approval rating since coming into power in September 2013. Despite the poll numbers Mr abbott has declared 2014 'a year of achievement' for the Government. According to the poll, Mr Shorten leader Mr Abbott in six out of 11 key attributes. The study found Mr Shorten is considered to be more competent, more strongly supported by his party, stronger, more trustworthy and is preferred for his stance on social policies. Mr Abbott scored ahead of Mr Shorten on economic and foreign policies, and on 'vision for Australia's future.' Two-party preferred support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Coalition government has plunged to 47 per cent compared to Labor's 53 per cent in the latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll. It follows what Mr Abbott conceded was a 'ragged week' for the government . There are concerns that Mr Shorten is more easily influenced by minority groups. The result represents a huge drop since the government's election in September last year, when the Coalition secured over 53 per cent of votes are preferences were distributed compared to Labor's 46.5 per cent. The new figures come after a week Mr Abbott admitted was difficult for the government, which included embarrassing back downs on a number of policies. 'I'll be the first to admit that last week was a bit of a ragged week for the government… and I read with great interest the assessments some of you have offered of the government's performance over the weekend,' Mr Abbott said at a press conference last Monday. He later added: 'Obviously I take responsibility for everything, the buck stops here… I take full responsibility.' Treasurer Joe Hockey has been a focus of the government's budget troubles, and polling shows his standing among voters has plummeted. In a recent Galaxy poll, voters asked for their preferred treasurer gave Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull 41 per cent of support while Mr Hockey gained just 22 per cent. Communications Minister Malcom Turnbull strongly outpolled Joe Hockey as preferred treasurer, receiving 41 per cent support to Mr Hockey's 22 per cent in a recent Galaxy poll of votes. Mr Hockey insists he has no fears of being replaced in the post . Mr Hockey told the ABC he wasn't worried about being replaced as treasurer, despite conceding some of his colleagues 'aren't too happy' with his proposed budget saving options. The government has been slammed for a number of policies and actions in the last week including university reforms, their planned $7 GP co-payments and allegations that Defence Minister David Johnson spent thousands of dollars on food and wine.","New poll delivers further bad news to Prime Minister Tony Abbott .

"In a market saturated with fizzy drinks, fancy re-hydration or sports drinks and a variety of tasty juices, the most healthy of all, water, hardly gets a look in. This probably explains why new research has revealed that less than one third (29%) of Australians actually drink the correct amount of water each day, leaving the rest at risk of dehydration. And with summer right on our doorstep, keeping hydrated in the hot weather is essential. Less than a third of Aussies drink the recommended amount of water per day, leaving the rest at risk of dehydration . The study by Thermos Australia also found that not drinking enough water often had a noticeable affect on performance . The study by Thermos Australia also found that not drinking enough water often had a noticeable affect on performance with 80 per cent who failed to drink the recommended amount feeling an impact on their body. And for those that did feel an impact, almost three quarters (69%) noticed feelings of dehydration when they failed to guzzle enough water, around 57 per cent got headaches and 44 per cent experienced exhaustion. Most wouldn't think it but according to a study from the University of Barcelona, being dehydrated by just two per cent impairs performance of the simplest of tasks, like throwing a ball. It only takes one to two per cent loss of body water to cause mild dehydration, impacting tasks that require attention and psychomotor, which is the relationship between cognitive functions and physical movements. And surprisingly drinking less water can also have an affect on your mood and make you a lot less productive. Being dehydrated by just two per cent impairs performance of the simplest of tasks, like throwing a ball . With soft drinks (pictured left), juices (pictured right) and sports drinks taking over the market, water has been forgotten with less than a third of Aussies actually drinking enough each day . Findings show over a third (37%) of those who suffer health issues experience low mental awareness, while a further 30 per cent said they slip into a poor mood without the right consumption of H2O each day. 'Dehydration, no matter what level, is dangerous and this research highlights there are serious side effects that ultimately could be prevented by consuming more water,' says Paul Fitzgerald, Marketing Manager at Thermos Australia. 1.  Keep it cool . If you prefer your drinking water to be cold, store it in a Genuine Thermos Brand Hydration Bottle as it keeps contents cold for up to 18 hours, no matter what environment you’re in. 2.  Be mindful of intake . Make a conscious effort to drink more water throughout the day even if you don’t feel thirsty and keep a water bottle by your side to serve as a reminder to consume more. 3.  Plan ahead . If you know you’re going to have limited access to water during your day (like tradesmen or those on the road) get organised in the morning and take a large bottle of water from home. 4.  Add some flavour . If you don’t like the taste of water try adding a squeeze of lemon or lime (or both) into your bottle. 'Even if you're not exercising or exposed to harsh environments, consciously drinking more water is something we all need to turn our minds to.' 'Poor health is a serious issue and there is a need for greater awareness among the general public about the importance of proper hydration, especially as we head into summer,' he said. 'The number one way to increase our water intake, according to 39% of the nation, is simply making an effort to think about drinking more water.' A tip to drink more water is to record how many glasses you've consumed throughout the day according to experts . Just under a fifth (19%) of Aussies said they would consume more water if they could keep it colder for longer . 'This may sound obvious but how do we put this into practice? Keeping a water bottle by your side can actually remind you to drink more water.' 'Another tip is to record how many glasses you've consumed throughout the day,' said Mr Fitzgerald. The Thermos study also found nearly a quarter (21%) of Australians would drink more water if it tasted better and a further 21% would if they felt thirstier throughout the day. Just under a fifth (19%) of respondents said they would consume more water if they could keep it colder for longer, while 16 per cent said they would drink more water if they had better access to it throughout the day. 'We are very fortunate to live in a country with superior water availability, however if being out and about during the day is limiting your water intake, plan ahead and take water with you from home,' added Mr Fitzgerald.","Less than one third of Australians drink enough water each day .

"A chestnut pony found on the brink of starvation after suffering years of cruelty is now healthy and looking for a new home. Boyd was found emaciated and infested with lice, but rescuers have now transformed him into the picture of a healthy horse. He was rescued by the Blue Cross after he was found on a farm in South Wales in April 2011, with barely any hair remaining on his body and was nervous of almost all human contact. Boyd, pictured with his trainer, was found emaciated and infested with lice, but he is now healthy and happy . He was riddled with worms and left to wander in a concrete yard with no food or shelter. Vets feared the pony, aged 18 months, would not survive, but after three years of intensive rehabilitation, Boyd is almost unrecognisable. Kath Urwin, manager of the Blue Cross Rehoming Centre in Burton, Staffordshire, said: 'We have put in a lot of time to help Boyd gain confidence and become the healthy, happy horse he is today. 'We are delighted that our efforts have developed him into a wonderful horse and hope to see him finally settled in a home of his own soon. 'We've seen many animals in extreme need but we'll never forget the day that 18-month-old Boyd came to Blue Cross. 'He was underfed, weak and infested with lice. The terrified pony's muscles were severely wasted and he was riddled with worms. The chestnut pony, pictured in 2011, was found emaciated on a farm in Wales with barely any hair on his body . 'Boyd's condition was so critical that it was going to be a battle to keep him alive. 'He had been living in squalor, left to roam in a cement yard without any proper food, shelter or veterinary care.' She explained the rescue team first treated Boyd's lice and worms before beginning a 'long, uphill process' of building up his strength and teaching him to trust again. She added: 'After his traumatic past, it took him quite some time to adapt to life at the centre. 'He didn't have much confidence, so his training progressed slowly, but surely. Then, towards the end of last year he had a real breakthrough and his training came on in leaps and bounds. 'Sadly, we often never get to find out what happens to the owners who let animals get into this state, because prosecutions are handled by the RSPCA - all we know is that his previous owners handed him over willingly to RSPCA inspectors. 'We had to be very patient with Boyd, gradually getting him used to being handled and led out and about by the team here at the centre. 'He's a completely different pony to when he arrived all those months ago and he's progressed so well that he's now ready to be rehomed.' Blue Cross helps over 40,000 sick, injured and unwanted pets every year.

"A speedy start from Kirkham GS has fired the Preston school up among the pacesetters in the Daily Mail Schools Trophy after the first month of the season. The confidence from three good wins will be tested on Saturday when Lancaster RGS, who toppled their local rivals 16-13 last season, meet at Fylde in a warm up fixture to a league game against Loughborough Students. Brothers Alex and Pat Sanderson plus Richard Wigglesworth all started their rugby careers at Kirkham before moving up the ladder to the full international team. Kirkham Grammar School's quick start has fired the Preston school up among the pacesetters . And the England connection is maintained in the present Kirkham team by Tom Carleton, the son of John, who was a member of the 1980 Grand Slam-winning team. Carleton junior has so far scored in each of Kirkham’s three games, including a hat-trick in the 53-0 win over Wirral GS. The full-back also scored one in the wins over St Ambrose (59-7) and Sandbach (51-16). He has been backed up goal-kicking wing Michael Forrest, who scored two tries against St Ambrose, and centre Owain Davies, who bagged two against Wirral. Head coach Aled Trenhaile hopes Kirkham will maintain their early-season form to post a better return than last season when a good start tailed off and the team only ran up six wins from 13 games. Kirkham winger Michael Forrest makes a break during their latest match . Kirkham centre Owain Davies is brought down by a number of opposition players . ‘We are enjoying the rugby at the moment and let’s hope it continues,’ he said about a fixture list which gets tougher in this merit table-based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. Kirkham are among the chasing pack, alongside Millfield, Abingdon and Epsom College, behind leaders Grammar School at Leeds who remain unbeaten after five games following an away win over Lancaster RGS last Saturday, 29-14. King’s School, Worcester, are another unbeaten team following four tight games, the last a 19-8 win over Colston’s. This followed wins over Trent College (9-7), Solihull (20-13) and St Peter’s of York 12-3. Next task is an Anglo-Welsh clash at Monmouth tomorrow. (Sat Oct 4) Two key matches will take place next Wednesday (Oct 11) involving four traditional heavyweights in Wellington’s clash against Millfield, at Oxford’s Iffley Road ground, and Sedbergh’s trip to King’s Macclesfield with the game being staged at the town’s rugby club.

"New rates: Chancellor George Osborne announced changes to the current tax credit system, which was introduced in 2003, in his Autumn Statement . A promise by the Tories to ensure all policies are family-friendly has been broken by making the ‘couples penalty’ worse, campaigners said last night. The current tax credits system, introduced by Labour in 2003, can encourage parents to live apart, or pretend to do so, because they can claim more credits if they do. But new rates of the benefit for next year, announced by George Osborne in the Autumn Statement, will actually increase the size of this penalty for many couples, according to the Marriage Foundation. It said couples with one child who stay together now will not be eligible for up to £7,295 a year – a rise of £80. And a mother working more than 40 hours a week could miss out on as much as £11,059 if she has three or four children. Harry Benson, of the think-tank, said this penalty threatened family stability and encourages fraud. He added that it failed the Government’s ‘family test’, a promise announced in October to put the family at the heart of all policies. The foundation last year found there were 240,000 more claimants of lone parent tax credits than there were lone parents. Mr Benson’s new analysis, on the changes following the Autumn Statement, show that the new rates mean the couple penalty has got worse for certain groups. Couples with one child who stay together lose out on as much as £7,295 a year. The losses are particularly high if the mother works for more than 40 hours a week. In that scenario, she could lose as much as £11,059 if she has three or four children. Mr Benson said: ‘The introduction of tax credits in 2003 brought with it the perverse side-effect of paying thousands of pounds more to couples who live apart than together. ‘As well as discouraging couple formation, this “couple penalty” also discourages the formal commitment of marriage, thereby threatening family stability. ‘The “couple penalty”’ encourages fraud. Official figures show that at least half a million people are pretending to live apart. ‘For most typical scenarios, the ‘couple penalty’ has risen consistently under both Labour and Coalition governments.’ Broken promises: Marriage Foundation, a think-tank, said that the new tax credit plans failed the David Cameron's ‘family test’, a pledge announced in October to put the family at the heart of all policies . He added: ‘The Prime Minister’s new family test requires all policy to be scrutinised for its impact on the family. In his announcement, Mr Cameron specifically mentioned the incentive to live apart. ‘New rates of tax credit for 2015/16 mean that the “couple penalty” will actually increase under different scenarios. ‘This policy fails – or falls well short of – three of the five points in the “family test”. It negatively influences family formation, transitions to parenthood and marriage, and deters couples from reducing their risk by getting married.’","Current tax credits system was introduced by Labour government in 2003 .

"One young woman's first experience of a music festival ended in tears on Saturday when she left the event with blood-soaked clothes and four stitches in her head. Sarah Watts Glidden was attending the Adelaide Stereosonic festival at the weekend, dancing in the crowd with her friends while listening to electronic artist Uberjakd play his set. Out of nowhere, the 19-year-old was hit with a flying glass bottle leaving her with a nasty gash on her forehead from which she was quickly losing blood. 'I didn't see anything at all but just felt and heard the big smack on my head,' Ms Glidden told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Sarah Watts Glidden was at Stereosonic music festival in Adelaide on Saturday when she was hit by a glass bottle, presumably thrown into the crowd by another partygoer . The wound was 'gushing' and 'squirting' blood, and resulted in Ms Glidden being given four stitches in her head . 'I can't recall what I was thinking but I put my hand on the wound and blood was gushing absolutely everywhere.' Covered in her own blood the teenager said she was rushed out of the crowd by two of her friends - Ashley and Stacey - when the trio were fortunate enough to bump into first aid officers. They took Ms Glidden to the medical tent but paramedics had trouble stopping the bleeding, estimating she had lost more than half a litre of blood due to the injury. A medic put four stitches in her head on the spot, and the 19-year-old will likely be left with a permanent scar from the injury. The teenager was attending the second day of the two-day festival, and had planned to take it easy as she was heading overseas the next morning . However she was left covered in her own blood and will likely have a permanent scar from the injury . The paramedic that treated the teenager said the injury caused arterial bleeding, while Ms Glidden's friend Ashley said 'at one point when I took my hand off (the wound) that it legitimately squirted'. 'Looking back on it it's terrifying. I was really just having a great time and out of no where it happened,' the Adelaide woman added. 'I guess because of the shock I didn't notice any pain to start off with, it was really the sound and the feeling that hit me. 'Seeing the blood down my arm and legs made me understand the seriousness off it. During the time I was pretty light headed and dizzy as well.' Paramedics had trouble stopping the bleeding and estimated Ms Glidden lost more than half a litre of blood . The injury has ruined her family holiday to Bali, and means she wont be able to participate in any activities she was looking forward to . Ms Glidden said Ashley saw the bottle that hit her - identifying it as a small container of Jack Daniel's whiskey. Aside from ruining her first music festival experience, the injury has also put a dampener on the woman's overseas holiday. Ms Glidden had decided not to drink and instead drove herself to the event as she was heading on holidays with her family the next morning. On Sunday morning she left for a trip to Bali with her family to celebrate her brother graduating high school, but she will no longer be able to take part in many activities she was looking forward to doing. Mr Glidden (left) said she was simply enjoying herself with friends when the bottle 'came from nowhere' 'I can't really swim as I can't get any of their water on the laceration,' she revealed. 'I won't be able to wash my hair, we are going to Water Bom Park (a water amusement park) but I'll again have to watch or go in areas where I can't get wet.' In a post to Facebook Ms Glidden urged others to think about their actions when taking glass into festivals - something that is banned at such events due to its potential to cause such harm. 'Please please please, think twice about what you smuggle. And if you're gonna do it - put the glass in a bin,' she wrote. 'If you're going to throw something then you're simply an idiot. Please consider the repercussions of your actions,' the post concluded.","Sarah Watts Glidden was at Stereosonic music festival in Adelaide .

"Tasmania's speedy teenager has done it again; after smashing the country's 100m under-18's record in September, Jack Hale has come up with a new jaw-dropping record. The 16-year-old scooped up a gold medal at the All Schools Track and Field Championships in Adelaide on Saturday, sprinting 100 metres in 10.13 seconds. Although a 3.4 metre per second tailwind meant Hale couldn't claim the time as a new record, the time was the fastest run by any Australian this year, regardless of wind. Scroll down for video . Jack Hale, 16, took out gold in the 100m under 18's event at the All Schools Track and Field Championships in Adelaide on Saturday . When compared to Australia’s fastest ever sprinter, Patrick Johnson, whose fastest time was 9.93 in 2003, the difference is a matter of milliseconds – 0.2 to be exact. But the 16-year-old is also not too far off the standard set by world champions of the likes of Usain Bolt, who’s all-time fastest in the 100 metre sprint remains 9.58, achieved at Berlin in 2009. His time was also less than half a second slower than favourites such as Carl Lewis and Linford Christies, whose fastest times remain 9.86 and 9.87 respectively. Hale, who was already ranked 1st in Australia's youth and ranked 6th in the world by the International Association of Athletics Federations for his 10.42 second run in October, told Fairfax that although he was happy with his new time, he'd prefer to have achieved it legally. The Tasmanian teenager sprinted 100 metres in 10.13 seconds - the fastest time run by any Australian adult or youth this year . Although a 3.4 metre per second tailwind meant Hale couldn't claim the time as a new record . 'It was a strong wind but hopefully I can go somewhere near that with a legal 2.0 … I have to do it legally then I'll be happy,' he said. 'I am extremely pumped. The start was horrible; it's the first time very I have had someone to chase down which makes me happy and pushed me to a lot quicker time.' Running neck-to neck with his competitor Rohan Browning in the first 60- metres or so, it wasn't until the last moment that Hale threw himself over the line first, with only 0.05 seconds to spare before Browning came second. The teen has been set as Australia's next big hope at the Olympics since September when he first smashed the country's 100m under-18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds at a race meet in Hobart. The crowd watched on in amazement as a star was born on the track when Hale, who until this year only competed in long jump, also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record.

Hale's trainers were also impressed with his amazing performance calling it 'sensational' and 'beyond what we were expecting'. Brian Rowe, from Athletics Tasmania, told ABC Hale was already 'very talented' for achieving such a great time so early on in the season. The teen first smashed the country's 100m under-18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds in September . 'A young fellow, 16-year-old, comes out of the winter, does a bit of winter training for the first time, already very talented, and is more than capable, although 10:44 is a bit beyond what everyone was expecting. 'To achieve that so early in the season, at what many would say were the school sports, is absolutely astounding, and an outstanding performance by a young man who has only been known as a long jumper. Hale is part of a new crop of talent, some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in Oregon.

"Cabinet Minister Eric Pickles branded threats by NHS chiefs in Devon 'un-British' Heavyweight Tory MP Eric Pickles has spoken frankly about his battle to shed the pounds. The burly Cabinet Minister revealed he had been on a diet since April and even disclosed that his body mass index (BMI) was 32, and falling. Sources last night said the Local Government Secretary had lost more than two stone in the past six months. His frank remarks surprised friends, because Mr Pickles famously prefers not to discuss his weight in public – despite being regularly mocked by friends and foes alike for his 'well-upholstered' appearance. The comments came as he condemned NHS chiefs in Devon for threatening to ban smokers and heavily overweight people from routine operations unless they quit tobacco or lose weight. Mr Pickles, 62, branded the plan 'anathema' and un-British. He said: 'The NHS is in our DNA. The idea that you would say 'You will not survive, you've had your chips, you are too fat, you smoke too much…' It's not the kind of Britain I recognise.' Speaking on BBC radio, he added: 'I'm a biggish guy. Admittedly, there's an awful lot less of me than there was on April 16 when I started this process of losing weight.' Asked whether he would fall foul of the Devon NHS plan to deny routine operations to anyone with a BMI of 35 – the index is a way of measuring people's weight relative to their height – Mr Pickles replied: 'Not now, thank God. It's 32.' He added: 'It's really hard to diet. I have not really mentioned it but I have decided to do something about it. I walk 8km [five miles] a day, I watch what I eat. It does work.' A source said Mr Pickles had avoided the now-celebrated 'five-two' diet used by Chancellor George Osborne to reduce his girth. The source added: 'Eric simply watches what he eats, he skips a starter at a meal – that sort of thing. And he walks a lot. He's lost over two stone.'

"Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was arrested in Mathura on December 7 for allegedly raping a 25-year-old female executive on Friday night in Delhi, could be a serial rapist, authorities revealed. The 32-year-old allegedly told police that he was arrested in a rape case some years ago from South Delhi’s Mehrauli area, and was out on bail. The vehicle in which the rape allegedly took place, a Swift DZire car, was first recovered from Yadav’s house in Mathura’s Chanderpuri Mohalla. Scroll down for video... The Swift DZire car in which the incident reportedly took place . Protestors from the All India Students Association (AISA) demonstrate outside Delhi Police headquarters after the crime came to light . The man himself was nabbed on Sunday evening in Anand Van, a remote village in Mathura two kilometres away from his house. He has since been brought to Delhi. “Yadav was questioned at the Highway Police station after he was nabbed from Chandrapuri Mohalla. After sustained interrogation, he broke down and admitted that he had raped the 25-year-old girl when she was returning from a party in Vasant Vihar in south Delhi to her home in Inderlok in North Delhi on Friday night,” police sources said. They added that the accused also disclosed that he was involved in a separate rape incident in Mehrauli area. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Madhur Verma said: “We are verifying details of the previous case with the concerned police station."" “After raping, and then threatening the victim not to report the incident, Yadav went to his ancestral house in Chandrapuri Mohalla on Saturday morning. His wife was not expecting him home at that time and, seeing him in a dishevelled state, asked him if he was the rapist news channels had been reporting on. He lied to her, saying he was being framed in a false case. He told her they would have to leave immediately. But before they could flee, several teams of Delhi Police arrived and Yadav took off on his own,” police sources added. The chase . Meanwhile, after registering a case of rape on Saturday morning, police began scanning Yadav's mobile phone details as he had made a call to his victim’s phone to threaten her. However, the number registered to Gaurav’s name included a false address on the SIM registration documents. “With the help of technical surveillance, police scanned the call details record (CDR) and found phone numbers of Yadav’s relatives and friends, all of whom stay in Mathura. Later, police discovered the address of his ancestral home where Yadav stayed during his holidays with his 28-year-old wife, two daughters and a son,” the sources added. After reaching Chandrapuri Mohalla, Delhi police grilled Yadav’s relatives for details on his possible hideouts. A raid was conducted at his house, but he had fled by then. His family members were also quizzed by Delhi police and local police personnel without success. Drama unfolded on Sunday evening when the police announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone willing to disclose information about Yadav's whereabouts. Soon enough, a villager approached them with the tip off that Yadav was hiding in Anand Van. “A team immediately left for the location and after spotting them, Yadav started running. He entered a house and locked the door from inside. He refused to come out and began screaming. He called out to villagers that he was innocent and was being  framed. The drama ended after 20 minutes when the police finally broke open the door and nabbed him at around 7pm,” police sources said. The story . DCP Verma said that the rape incident came to light at 1.25am on Saturday after the victim, who works with a finance company in Gurgaon, made a call to the Police Control Room (PCR). “She told us that she had booked the cab from her smart phone through Uber and the driver arrived around 15 minutes before his reported time. On the way, she dozed off in the cab as she was tired after a long day at work. The driver saw her sleeping and took the cab to a secluded spot near Buddha Garden and Ridge area and forced himself on her. The victim tried to fight back, but he overpowered her. He reportedly told her that if she shouted for help, he would insert a rod in her genitals, and reminded her of the December 16, 2012, gang-rape in the city,” said the police.","Shiv Kumar Yadav told police he raped woman, 25, after she fell asleep in his taxi .

The crash happened just before 10.30pm on Friday when a silver Citroen Saxo hit a 44-tonne lorry at the West Wiltshire Trading Estate (pictured) in Westbury, Wiltshire . It is believed the friends were on their way to popular nightclub Club Ice in Quartermaster Road, pictured . Wiltshire Police, who were understood to have received information from other drivers who were at the scene at the time of the collision, said that the manner of driving of the Citroen car would form part of their investigation into the cause of the tragic crash. A spokesman declined to comment on rumours that the car had been travelling too fast for the conditions or that it was being driven 'inappropriately.' He also said that police were trying to discover whether the young men had been heading towards Club Ice nightclub or whether they had been on the trading estate for a different reason. It is the third fatal smash in Wiltshire in less than a month. On November 15, passenger Max Lewis, 19, died in a collision between a car and a van near Melksham, while a week later, 21-year-old Max Pearson was killed when his car hit a tree in the Savernake Forest near Marlborough.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal must have feared his injury curse had struck again at Old Trafford after record signing Angel di Maria was asked to play on by Argentina having been stamped on the foot by Nani. Di Maria crumpled to the ground in agony after Nani, still a Manchester United player but on loan to Sporting Lisbon, caught him with a reckless challenge after 18 minutes. With Van Gaal watching anxiously from the stands, Argentina surprisingly asked Di Maria to continue after he had finally got to his feet after being stricken for a couple of minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to see Nani speak about his United future after Argentina clash . Nani left Angel di Maria on the floor with a late challenge during an international friendly at Old Trafford . The former United winger went in late on the new Manchester United signing in the first half . Di Maria looked to be in pain, but carried on after receiving treatment at Old Trafford . United's injury list has already lengthened during the international break with David de Gea (finger) and Daley Blind (knee) joining Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Radamel Falcao, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo on the casualty list . It was only after an hour that Di Maria was finally replaced by Carlos Tevez even though Argentina manager Gerardo Martino afterwards admitted he had received a 'tough blow'. Martino said: 'It cut the skin a little bit, it was a tough knock. 'We have had a look at it though and we don't think it is anything serious. We took an X-ray and looked at the images and we are evaluating it. But in spite of that, we do not think it is serious.' Di Maria added: 'It was just a blow.

"A mesmerising video has emerged of a a man walking on a tightrope dressed in an LED suit. In the footage, captured in Mortero de Astrana, Spain late last month, the man shows impressive balance as he makes his way along the rope in total darkness.

The video is as much intriguing as it is mesmerising as the LED suit clashes brilliant with the darkness . There are a few hairy moments for the daredevil as he treks along the tightrope . His suit contrasts with the night sky, giving the appearance of a glowing stick-figure walking into space. But if you look closely enough, you can just about make out his face.

"Delhi is in the news yet again for a rape incident - but the abduction and kidnapping of women and girls are reported nearly twice as much in the Capital. According to the Delhi Police, a woman is kidnapped or abducted on average every two hours. At the same time, the police register a rape case every four hours. “This data primarily includes kidnapping of minor girls. Places like Outer, North-east and East Delhi witness the most cases of kidnapping and abduction. Minor girls are abducted by human traffickers for flesh trade as well,” a deputy commissioner-level officer told Mail Today. This year there have already been over 1,500 cases of rape reported to police and over 3,500 abduction cases . According to the data, the police registered 1,686 rape cases in Delhi this year till November 15. The number of abduction cases stood at 3,589 in the same period. The police claim that the high figures of crime against women are due to the streamlining of the FIR registration process. “The high rate of crime against women in Delhi can be attributed to the fact that the registration of rape, molestation and other crimes against women has increased as an outcome of increased awareness of general public,” Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary had said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. According to the Delhi Police, 40 cases of crime against women are registered daily on an average. As many as 13,230 cases of crime against women have been registered so far this year in Delhi. The figure stood at 11,479 cases in the same period last year. “In Delhi, Commissioner B.S. Bassi has issued various guidelines so that cases of crime against women are registered without any delay. In cases of rape and kidnapping, DCPs monitor each case personally,” a police officer said. Besides kidnapping and abduction, molestation cases are also much higher than sexual assault cases. The Delhi Police has registered 3,832 cases of molestation so far this year in Delhi. More than 2,600 cases of domestic violence were registered, and 141 dowry deaths reported in the same period.","Police sources say minor girls are often abducted by human traffickers .

"Calls for a re-think of Britain’s controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid have received a substantial boost. The influential Financial Times newspaper says the UK should focus on the quality of projects rather than how much money is spent. It said at the weekend that at a time of intense pressure on public finances, it was right to question David Cameron’s ‘rigid’ target – an argument made repeatedly by the Daily Mail. Scroll down for video . Jumping for joy: Yegna, dubbed Ethiopia's Spice Girls, were given £4million in British aid . The FT concluded that the target – first dreamed up in the 1960s – had ‘little relevance’ today and had been introduced by the Prime Minister to help the Tories shed their ‘nasty’ image. The FT’s stance follows the revelation last week that Britain will spend £1billion more on foreign aid than expected over the next two years following upward revisions to UK growth. It will give a boost to many Tory backbenchers, who are unhappy that the aid budget has been ring-fenced at a time when other elements of public spending are being hugely pared back. This year, £11.5billion was spent by the Department for International Development on overseas aid – meeting the 0.7 per cent target. The target is to be maintained in future years even though the Chancellor has suggested public spending will fall to 35 per cent of GDP by 2020. The FT said at the weekend that at a time of intense pressure on public finances, it was right to question David Cameron’s ‘rigid’ target on foreign aid . Critics have questioned whether many projects funded by overseas aid represent value for money. (Huge billboard in the centre of the Ethiopian capital Addia Ababa advertising British Aid funded girl band Yegna . Critics have questioned whether many projects funded by overseas aid represent value for money. Last year, it emerged UK taxpayers had picked up a £4million bill to fund Ethiopia’s own Spice Girls, who released a string of videos that aimed to empower women in the African country. In its leader column, the FT said: ‘Britain spends £12billion a year on overseas aid. This is a far larger sum than is disbursed by any other EU state. ‘Among the world’s big nations, only the US spends more. It is hugely to the credit of David Cameron’s government, and his Labour predecessors, that Britain maintains a noble aspiration to assist the world’s poor. Peter Bone (pictured), Tory MP for Wellingborough, claimed ‘the Financial Times are spot on' ‘But at a time of intense pressure on public finances, it is reasonable to question the rigidity of the UK’s commitment to international development spending.’ The paper pointed out the target was set 50 years ago by the World Council of Churches. ‘Meeting it has helped to soften the Tories’ “nasty party” image; but in an era of tight budgets it brings painful obligations,’ it said. ‘A particular concern is that it wrongly puts the priority on the quantity of money that Britain spends on aid rather than the quality of its projects.’ The aid has ‘certainly benefited’ the UK’s international reputation, the paper concedes. ‘However, the doctrinaire commitment to the 0.7 per cent target should be reconsidered. It is a number based on outdated growth models and has little relevance today.’ The FT said that Britain wants to remain a major world power by spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, at the same time as spending 0.7 per cent on foreign aid and squeezing the full amount of public spending to 35 per cent. ‘Something has to give,’ it said. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘The Financial Times are spot on. What is needed is to concentrate on quality, rather than making this political gesture.’","FT says it's right to question PM's ‘rigid’ target in current financial state .

"Workers on a cherry-picker were pictured putting fairy lights on the Christmas tree outside Downing Street this afternoon . In homes across the country this weekend people have been busy putting up their Christmas decorations, and it seems that Downing Street is no exception. Workers were pictured this afternoon using a cherry-picker to hang fairy lights and other decorations on the tree outside Number 10, with a big switch-on scheduled for tomorrow. The tree itself, a 20ft Nordman fir which took ten years to grow, was hand-picked by farmer Colin Griffith after he won a competition back in October. Mr Griffith, who owns Dinmore Hill Trees at Festive Farm in Wellington, Hereford, won grower of the year at the British Christmas Tree Growers Association awards. Runner up Rob Morgan, from Swansea, will have the honour of providing a smaller 11 and a half foot tree for the pillared room inside Downing Street, while Brian Taylor, also from Hereford, will provide the wreath for the door. The lights outside Number 10 will be turned on for the first time this season in a ceremony tomorrow afternoon which all the growers will attend. Last year's tree was provided by Andrew Ingram and decorated with hundreds of LED fairy lights, along with silver and white baubles, topped off with a large silver star. It is not yet known whether the same decorations will be used this year, though they have been used every year since the coalition came to power in 2010. Nordman Firs - such as the one outside Number 10 - are the UK’s most popular Christmas trees and originate from the mountains on either side of the Black Sea, primarily in Turkey and Georgia. The tree itself is a 20ft Nordman fir, the most popular kind of tree in the UK, which took ten years to grow . The Christmas tree pictured outside Downing Street last year. It is not known whether the same silver-themed decorations will be used, but they have been used each year since the Coalition took office . Then and now: The decorations on the Downing Street tree changed after the Labour party were ejected, from the gold and bronze theme (left) to the blue and silver used today (right) They are favoured for the dark green, glossy needles and neat, conical shape which makes them easy to decorate. The needles are also slow to drop off, even after the pine has dried out. This is different to the Norwegian spruce that usually adorns Trafalgar Square which is sent over every year from Oslo as a token of thanks for our assistance during the Second World War. It typically stands between 60 and 70ft tall, and and is chosen months, or even years in advance. The tree, dubbed 'the queen of the forest,' is cut down during a special ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the British ambassador to Norway and the Mayor of Oslo. Tree grower Colin Griffith (pictured) hand-picked the tree from his stock after winning grower of the year at the British Christmas Tree Growers Association awards in October .

"Bayern Munich have four men in UEFA's Team of the Year from 2014 as the regular candidates dominate an all-star XI, which includes no British players. The XI was voted for by 8.6million fans after a year in which Real Madrid claimed the top European club honour.

David Alaba has not been shown a yellow card in any of his last 89 Bundesliga games, including all 24 in 2014. Diego Godin was part of 18 clean sheets in La Liga in 2014; no player kept more. Philipp Lahm made 1,042 touches in the Champions League in 2014; only Toni Kroos (1,224) made more. Angel di Maria made more assists than any other player in the top five European leagues in 2014 (20). Toni Kroos made more passes than any other player at the 2014 World Cup (544).

Champions League finalists and Madrid rivals Ramos and Diego Godin make up the centre of defence, supported by Bayern full backs Philipp Lahm and David Alaba. Toni Kroos signed for Real Madrid in the summer but it was his performances with the Bundesliga giants that earned him his place in the XI, as with Di Maria and the Galacticos. The Argentine signed for Manchester United in a £60m deal last summer, and gets the nod ahead of fellow flying left-footer Gareth Bale. Arjen Robben had a fine year with Bayern Munich. The Dutch winger is often criticised for his play-acting and attitude, but the 30-year-old is still a frightening prospect for European defenders. Franck Ribery usually supplements Robben on the left, but in this squad there is only one man who was going to fill that berth; Cristiano Ronaldo. The Real Madrid and Portugal star scored 61 goals for club and country, including a penalty in the victory in Lisbon against Atletico. He is of course joined by La Liga, and indeed Ballon d'Or rival Lionel Messi, who broke record after record despite Barcelona failing to hit top form in 2014.

"Former Prime Minister John Howard has slammed actress Cate Blanchett over the 'outrageous' speech she made at Gough Whitlam's state memorial service. The Oscar-winning actress was one of several speakers at the late former prime minister's memorial, where she praised Whitlam for introducing free university education and health care. 'I am the beneficiary of free, tertiary education,' Blanchett said. Scroll down for video . Actress Cate Blanchett speaks at the state memorial service for late former prime minister Gough Whitlam . Former prime minister John Howard (left) hit out at Blanchett (right) for praising Whitlam over free education . 'When I went to university I could explore different courses and engage with the student union in extracurricular activity. 'It was through that that I discovered acting.' But Mr Howard has hit out at Blanchett and refuted her claim that Whitlam was responsible for making education free, the Herald Sun reported. 'That speech of Cate Blanchett's was outrageous. Cate Blanchett is a talented actor, I admire her talent, but to suggest that Whitlam introduced free university education is wrong,' he said. Mr Howard said he received a university scholarship for three years, 11 years before Whitlam came to power . Mr Howard said he went to university in the 1950s and 1960s and received a scholarship for three of the years he studied, 11 years before Whitlam became prime minister in 1972. Mr Howard said he won the scholarship when his marks improved, and he took the place of someone whose marks had slipped. 'The last three years of my university education were completely free and that was 11 years before Whitlam came to power,' he said. 'This idea that it just arrived (with Whitlam) is complete nonsense and it ought to be called out more frequently.' Blanchett said the opportunities given to her through free university education led her to become an actress . Mr Howard said Commonwealth scholarships paid for 70 per cent of students' tuition fees before Whitlam came to power. In her speech last month, Blanchett said that while she wasn't even in school by the time his prime ministership ended, she is the beneficiary of his legacy. 'I am the product of an Australia that wanted, and was encouraged, to explore its voice culturally,' she said. 'I am the beneficiary of good, free healthcare, and that meant the little I earned after tax and rent could go towards seeing shows, bands, and living inside my generation's expression.'","Actress Cate Blanchett praised Whitlam over university education .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel today gave a pep talk to U.S. troops in Afghanistan during his fourth and final visit to the war-torn country as the Army handed over a top Taliban commander to Pakistan. Speaking to hundreds of soldiers, the 68-year-old said America aimed to 'work our way, essentially, out of a job as we transition from the combat role we've had over the last 13 years' in Afghanistan. Instead, the country's military will focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops in the war, which does not appear to be ending any time soon, he said. Hagel's holiday-season speech at tactical base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan came as the Army handed over three Pakistani detainees to Islamabad, including a senior Taliban commander. Scroll down for video . Final visit: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel today bid farewell to U.S. troops in Afghanistan during his fourth and final visit to the war-torn country. Above, Hagel walks with American soldiers at tactical base Gamberi . Speech: Speaking to hundreds of soldiers, the 68-year-old aid America aimed to 'work our way, essentially, out of a job as we transition from the combat role we've had over the last 13 years' in Afghanistan . Smiling with soldiers: Instead, the country's military will focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops in the war, which does not appear to be ending any time soon, he said . U.S. forces in Afghanistan made the transfer of Latif Mehsud - a close confidante of the ex-head of the Pakistani Taliban and long-wanted by the Pakistani government - on Saturday afternoon. The move underlines the improving relations between America, Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the latter having previously demanded that Afghan officials hand over militants operating in its territory. During his visit on Sunday, Hagel said the Afghan army and police forces have made a lot of progress in the war since 2001 - but at the cost of much U.S. blood and treasure. 'We don't want to see that roll back downhill,' said the politician, who is making way for his likely replacement, Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter. Hand-over: Hagel's holiday-season pep talk came as the American military handed over top Taliban commander, Latif Mehsud (pictured), to Pakistan . He went on to explain how the soldiers on the remote base in Laghman province in Afghanistan's wild east are the vanguard of the transformed U.S. mission to focus on training Afghan forces. This noncombat mission aims to ensure that the reason for invading Afghanistan in the first place - al-Qaida's haven for plotting the September 11 attacks - never recurs. It also aims to avoid the kind of unraveling of security that happened this year in Iraq; large swathes of which have been taken over by militants fighting for the Islamic State (ISIS). The Gamberi base - which includes soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment - has been deemed exemplary of America's new mission by President Barack Obama. It will be one of four 'Train, Advise, Assist Commands' across the country, while several training establishments in  Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, will also be used by U.S. forces. But despite the noncombat focus of the mission, U.S. special operations forces will continue, mostly in conjunction with Afghan forces, to hunt down al-Qaida remnants or other terrorists. They will also take on the Taliban if they are deemed to pose a threat to American troop security. Speaking to the U.S. troops, Hagel warned the soldiers there is no room for complacency and no reason to think that their training and advising work will not present its own risks. 'The job's not done,' he said. 'This is still a dangerous country in many ways.' The soldiers' mission with NATO allies  will assume a new name on January 1: 'Resolute Support.' Meanwhile, the combat mission, Operation Enduring Freedom, will finish at the end of December.

Animated speech: He went on to explain how the soldiers on the remote base in Laghman province in Afghanistan's wild east are the vanguard of the transformed U.S. mission to focus on training Afghan forces . This new phase will not last long, however, if current plans hold. Virtually all U.S. troops will be gone two years from now as President Barack Obama completes his final term in office. The hope is that the Afghans can hold off Taliban militants who, it is feared, could allow a return of al-Qaida or other extremist groups if they were to regain power in Kabul. On Saturday, General John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that he has Obama's permission to keep up to 10,800 American. troops in the country at the start of 2015. That is around 1,000 more than previously planned. As a result, there will be little, if any, net drop in U.S. troop numbers between now and December 31.

As a result, there will be little, if any, net drop in U.S. troop numbers between now and December 31. Above, Hagel during the news conference . By the end of 2015, however, the U.S. troop total is to shrink to 5,500, and to near zero by the end of 2016, according to the plans. In an interview, Campbell said the Afghans are not only capable of providing their own security but are eager to do so. 'They totally have the security. They want to own it. They are proud that they have that back' as a sovereign nation, he said. He added that part of his challenge is to build confidence among Afghan troops, partly by reminding them that their firepower is superior to that of the Taliban.

In relation to Mehsu's and the other two detainees' transfers on Saturday, the U.S. did not name the prisoners involved, but two Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed Mehsud was among them. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. said in a statement  that the transfer happened Saturday. 'Yesterday, acting on behalf of the United States Government, we transferred custody of three Pakistanis held in U.S. custody in Afghanistan to Pakistan,' it said.

'This followed consultations between the United States and Pakistan and after receiving appropriate assurances. We cannot comment on the identities of the detainees.' The military said the Afghan government was not involved in the transfer. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry referred all questions to the Interior Ministry, which could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Mehsud was not in Afghan custody at the time and that they were gathering information about his release. Mehsud was captured in October of last year by American forces. He was a driver for the former Pakistani Taliban head, Hakimullah Mehsud, and eventually became a trusted deputy to the militant commander, who was killed in November of last year in an American drone strike. Newly-elected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani visited Pakistan in November. The visit was seen as an attempt to repair ties with Pakistan, which has long had a rocky relationship with Afghanistan. Former Afghan president Karzai repeatedly accused the Pakistani government of harboring militants who launched cross-border attacks. Part of the reason for the improved ties has been a military operation launched in June by the Pakistani military in the North Waziristan tribal area, something long demanded by the United States. North Waziristan is home to both local and al-Qaida-linked militants.","Chuck Hagel spoke to soldiers at base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan .

"An Australian citizen, who has awaited trial from behind the bars of a Russian prison for more than two years, could face a minimum of 15 years in jail for the supply of poppy seeds. Roman Shilov, whose wife and the baby daughter live in Brisbane, was detained by Russian authorities on charges of drug trafficking in July 2012, according to the ABC. He has never met his daughter. The Australian and Russian citizen has been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk, despite the Australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport, a letter from Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has revealed. Roman Shilov, whose wife and the baby daughter he's never had the chance to meet live in Brisbane, was detained by Russian authorities on controversial charges of drug trafficking in July 2012 . 'Regrettably, Russian authorities have not accepted this advice and remain committed to having Mr Shilov remain in detention,' Ms Bishop wrote in a letter to the Shilov family's local MP. The letter also noted that the Russian Government was refusing to recognise Mr Shilov's dual nationality which in turn 'seriously limits the ability of the Australian Government to provide consular assistance'. Mr Shilov had returned to Moscow three years before his arrest to assist his father with his spice trade business which supplied up to 20 per cent of the country's poppy seed market at the time, the ABC reported. Poppy seeds are currently classified as narcotics by the Russian government. The Australian and Russian citizen, who has been detained without trial for two and a half years, has now been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk despite the Australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport . One of the charges laid against Shilov and his father by Russia's Federal Drug Control Service is the importation of 47 tonnes of narcotics. The ABC reported that this shipment was made up entirely of poppy seeds and the Service had even admitted that only 0.001 percent of it could be extracted as narcotics. Evgeny Shilov, Mr Shilov's brother who also lives in Brisbane, told the ABC that the minimum 15 year sentence was worrying and expressed concern over his brother's detainment. 'It seems very, very unfair that he's been put away from day one and hasn't been let go,' he said. Evgeny Shilov, Mr Shilov's brother who also lives in Brisbane, told the ABC that the minimum 15 year sentence was a worrying one and expressed concern over his brother's long term detainment .

The Department of Foreign Affairs told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'Where there have been concerns expressed about his [Mr Shilov's] health or welfare in prison, the Department has made representations to Russian authorities. 'Consular officials are also in regular communication with the man's family and his legal advisers about his case.'","Roman Shilov has been detained by Russian authorities without trial since July 2012 .

"A French man who captured an 'evocative' scene of two dogs drinking from a pond has been named the Royal Horticultural Society's Photographer of the Year. The photograph, which features the animals standing next to a series of abstract sculptures, was taken by photographer Alain Jouno as the sun set over the Parc Botanique de Haute Bretagne, in Brittany.

Tranquil: Scottish photographer Robert Fulton was highly commended by judges for this atmospheric photograph, titled Island Mist . The winning photographs beat thousands of entries from around the world, with stand-out shots including scenes of snow-covered gardens and close-ups of flowers. A winner was also chosen in each of the five adult categories - plants, abstracts and details, celebrating gardens, seasons and wildlife. Two were selected from under-18s entries, which had to depict something plant, garden or wildlife-related. rass sprinkled with morning dew, butterflies and buzzards were among the subjects captured in the photographs highly commended by judges. Of the overall winner, judge Chris Young, editor of The Garden magazine, said: 'Alain's brilliant image is more than the sum of its parts. 'The serendipity of the sunset, the abstract sculptural forms, the dogs drinking the water and the mist beyond create an incredibly evocative image.' He added: 'This is a well-composed photograph that truly reflects a moment in a garden's time.' Mr Jouno, who won £2,000 and a year's gift RHS membership for his photograph, said: 'It's hard to believe I have won, because I am only a modest amateur photographer. Crisp: This shot of the snow-covered RHS garden Wisley, in Woking, taken by Sarah Longes, was named winner of the seasons category . Runner-up: The View, by Christine Fitzgerald, which features four children gazing out across a garden, came in second place .

"Tony Blair’s charities have received millions of pounds from some of his closest friends, it emerged today. The former prime minister set up several foundations and initiatives after leaving Number 10 in 2007. Now details have emerged of the wealthy businessmen and women who helped launch them and keep them afloat, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair's charities have received substantial funding from his close friends, including Haim Saban (left) who has given £415,000 to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. The two men are pictured with former US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice . Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, pictured with his wife Elena, gave the Foundation £320,000 . Since quitting Downing Street seven years ago, Mr Blair has secured donations from the world’s super-rich to bankroll several good causes, including the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. Italian businessman Paolo Pellegrini and his wife Henrietta gave £1million to the Africa Governance Initiative, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The money was used to establish smart offices overlooking Hyde Park. Bill Gates, the Microsoft mogul who is worth more than £50billion, and his wife Melinda gave £500,000 to Africa Governance Initiative last year. The couple are known to be good friends with Mr Blair and his wife Cherie. Bill and Melinda Gates, close friends of the Blairs, £500,000 to Africa Governance Initiative last year, according to reports . The Swedish Postcode Foundation, based in Stockholm, gave £750,000 to the to Africa Governance Initiative. Meanwhile Hollywood media mogul Haim Saban gave £415,000 to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, it was reported. His wife Cheryl donated £650,000 to a women's charity run by Mrs Blair. The Foundation also received £320,000 from Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk. Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close friend of Lord Mandelson, gave £300,000 to help set up Breaking the Climate Deadlock, set up by Mr Blair in 2008. Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close friend of Lord Mandelson, gave £300,000 to help set up Breaking the Climate Deadlock, set up by Mr Blair in 2008 . The funding was revealed in documents filed by the charities on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Blair’s business dealings since leaving office have often come under scrutiny. Last week he appeared to not rule out working for President Putin as he defended making millions from advising some of the world’s worst despots. Mr Blair used an interview with Vanity Fair to defend the considerable wealth he has accrued since leaving office while insisting his main aim was to improve the world. The 61-year-old has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders, including the ex-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Kazakhstan president Nursulstan Nazarbayev. After detailing Mr Blair’s work for several questionable world leaders, the author of the profile and interview, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison, wrote: ‘And is there anyone he wouldn’t work for? ‘For instance, would he work for Vladimir Putin if Putin called asking for advice? Blair smiled, and switched the topic to Kazakhstan.’ Later she wrote: ‘He paused and then added, “I’m not holding my breath for the call from Putin.” ‘But if it came, I asked? “It won’t come, so let me not either praise or insult”.’ He insisted the Russian leader was never likely to seek his services. Mr Blair, who insisted that ‘whatever criticisms people have of me, they’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid’, said there were no conflicts of interest between his charity role and lucrative work as an international advisor. But he stressed that he was now a ‘private sector individual’ not a government representative and should not be bound by the same rules.","Blair set up network of charities after leaving Downing Street in 2007 .

"Sex abuse campaigners have slammed a judge's decision to let a man who admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl walk free after only eight days in custody, saying race played a hand in the final sentence. First-time offender Trent Maralunga, from the remote Northern Territory town of Maningrida, received a 16-month suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with person under 16 on April 8. Maningrida is located 500km west of Darwin. He was granted bail eight days after he was arrested in April and the judge let Maralunga - who had a girlfriend at the time of the offence - walked free from the court on the same day he was sentenced. Being found guilty of having sexual intercourse with a minor can attract a sentence of up to 16 years in jail in the Northern Territory. NSW Rape Crisis chief executive Karen Willis said the sentence sent the wrong message to offenders and coupled with previous cases it also showed sex crimes against indigenous people were not treated with the same seriousness as those involving those who were non-indigenous. Trent Maralunga, 23, only served eight days for having sex with a girl known as TH who was 13 at the time . In his November ruling, Judge Graham Hiley told the state's Supreme Court that the victim, TH, was 'willing for you [Maralunga] to have sex with her'. He also noted Maralunga - who was 19 years old in April - did not force himself on TH or cause her any physical harm. 'So I regard your offending on this occasion as towards the lower end of offending for this kind offence,' Judge Hiley said. Maralunga was sentenced alongside another man who was involved in the same incident, Ziggy Williams. Sex abuse campaigner Karen Willis said the sentence of Maralunga sent the wrong message to offenders and said: 'My guess is that if this girl was a white female the outcome would be different' Williams - who was 22 years old at the time of the offence - was handed a six-month sentence for the less serious charge of indecently dealing with a person under 16, with some of it suspended. He did not have sex with TH but he exposed his penis to the 13-year-old with the intention of having intercourse, but was stopped by the girl who said he was 'too old'. A third man was also involved in the incident, which took place in a house that no one was living in at the time. He cannot be named because he was 17 years old at the time of the crime. The man pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with a minor and was given a sentence of 18 months, with some of it suspended. Williams had only been in custody for four months when walked free on the same day he was sentenced, while the other man had been held in custody for seven months and was released the next day. In his ruling, Judge Graham Hiley of the Northern Territory Supreme Court said the girl had been 'willing' to have sex with Maralunga . While Judge Hiley said Maralunga's punishment for having sex with a minor needed to 'warn all men that they must not have sex with people under the age of 16', Rape Crisis New South Wales' chief executive officer Karen Willis said this sentence did the exact opposite. 'Firstly any concept of having sex with 13-year-old child... is a crime,' Ms Willis told Daily Mail Australia. 'All children deserve to be safe and have a life free of violence, and the criminal justice system is one tool we have in protecting children. The other and far bigger is the adults in this country.' Ms Willis also believed the victim's cultural background played a part in the judge's final ruling. 'Another thing that is disturbing about this is that the girl and the offenders were [indigenous],' she said. 'My guess is that if this girl was a white female the outcome would be different. 'I think that we really need to move away from concepts of a person’s cultural background when it comes to crime. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there was similar examples of discriminatory sentencing in NSW. 'If a child is sexually assaulted, there has to be desperate justice involvement because it is a serious crime.' But Ms Willis said the policing of sex crimes against children and domestic violence had gone through significant changes in the Northern Territory. 'They occupy more police resources than any other crime and they are the crimes we're not seeing an increase in. Police have undertaken training and procedural processes to change this. Northern Territory police are doing a great job,' she said. Ms Willis told The Australian previous cases demonstrated sex crimes involving non-indigenous victims ended with more severe consequences in court than those with indigenous ones. In 2007, six of nine men involved in a case where they raped a 10-year-old girl living in the indigenous shire of Aurukun in Queensland did not have convictions recorded against them. Only three men were handed suspended sentences but a appeal later saw a majority of them serve time in prison.

"Francois Hollande was facing ridicule across France yesterday (sun) after posing in a ‘Borat-style’ traditional Kazakh fur hat and coat. The hapless Socialist president had done everything possible to stop the photo being published, but now it has gone viral across the internet. It shows the 60-year-old head of state standing next to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan. Internet hit: The photo of Francois Hollande alongside Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev has been widely shared and mocked on social media . While Mr Nazarbayev is in a conventional blue suit and tie, Mr Hollande is wearing a white embroidered coat with fur trim, and a furry hat. The clothes were a present from Mr Nazarbayev, who posted the photo on his official Instagram page on Friday, but it was quickly removed at the request of a furious Mr Hollande. Elysee aides said they had insisted that the image of the French president was not distributed. Now, however, it is all over social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, with commentators saying Mr Hollande looks like the Sacha Baron Cohen character, ‘Borat’. Comparison: Twitter users immediately likened the French president to Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat character . ‘Mr Hollande is being ridiculed by almost everybody,’ said a Socialist party source. ‘Frankly, he doesn’t look very presidential in the photo’ ‘Mr Hollande is being ridiculed by almost everybody,’ said a Socialist party source. ‘Frankly, he doesn’t look very presidential in the photo.’ It was in January that photographs of Mr Hollande wearing a crash helmet provoked the biggest crisis of his career. They showed him sneaking out of a love nest close to the Elysee Palace following a night of passion with Juliet Gayet, a 42-year-old TV actress. The images directly led to Mr Hollande kicking his official first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, 49, out of the Elysee Palace. Many commentators believe that any hope of Mr Hollande being re-elected as president again in 2017 are now all but over . Other photos he would rather forget: Francois Hollande poses for the camera during a visit to a school last year, and right, is targeted by a woman throwing flour during a speech in 2012 . Ms Trierweiler has since written a kiss and tell book which has poured ridicule on Mr Hollande, whose popularity rating is now at a pitiful 12 per cent. He was portrayed by Ms Trierweiler as a lying love cheat and a hypocrite Socialist who secretly despises the poor. Meanwhile, the French economy is in crisis, with the unemployment rate spiralling well above three million. Many commentators believe that any hope of Mr Hollande being re-elected as president again in 2017 are now all but over.

"Western Sydney players set off for the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco on Sunday night but doubts still linger over the A-League side's participation because of a pay dispute. Wanderers players from their weekend loss to Adelaide left Sydney bound for northern Africa after initial suggestions the group may not travel. The issue stems from the club's offer to pay players just 10 per cent share of the minimum $US1million ($A1.2m) they made for qualifying for the tournament. Western Sydney Wanderers players react after their team lost to Adelaide United on Saturday. Now the players are of to Morocco for the FIFA Club World cup but there's doubt over whether they'll play because of a pay dispute . There's doubt over whether Western Sydney players (pictured in white)will participate in the FIFA Club World Cup due to a pay dispute . A spokesperson for the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said the players left for Morocco as a 'sign of good faith' and were essentially allowing the club some more time to come to the table. The footballers are seeking 50 per cent of any money made from the tournament, in line with what had been negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The sticking point with the club is that the wording of the agreement only extends to the Asian Champions League - a point the PFA steadfastly argued against in a statement on Sunday night. 'In the course of these negotiations, the club made it clear to the players that its interpretation of the CBA was that the obligation to share 50 per cent of prize money did not apply to the FIFA Club World Cup,' PFA chief executive Adam Vivian wrote. 'The club has insisted on sharing only 10 per cent of its guaranteed payment of US$1,000,000 with the players, a percentage which is without precedent. 'This technical interpretation by the club defeats the letter as well as the spirit and intent of the CBA.' Western Sydney Wanderers players (pictured in white) are disputing their pay at the FIFA Club World Cup. The club is offering them 10% of the share they made for qualifying for the tournament while the players want 50% . While the PFA is hopeful of bringing Wanderers officials to the bargaining table in the coming days - the side's first match of the World Club Cup is against North/Central American champions Cruz Azul on December 13 - the Western Sydney sign is expected to struggle in Morocco regardless. Domestically, Tony Popovic's men have no wins and three draws in their nine matches this season. The Wanderers' were defeated 2-0 Saturday night . Adelaide           W/Sydney .

The Wanderers' latest defeat came in Adelaide on Saturday night, with goals to Marcelo Carrusca and Fabio Ferreira. The statistics damned Western Sydney far more than the 2-0 scoreline. Shots: 26-1. Possession: 80 per cent to 20 per cent. Passes: 786 to 210. The Wanderers were joined on the losers' list by the other NSW clubs - each losing on home soil. Sydney FC fell victims to a late Perth Glory comeback to lose 2-1. Melbourne Victory scored three goals in 11 minutes to defeat Central Coast, before the Phoenix put Newcastle to the sword with three goals in six minutes. Capping the round, Melbourne City earned their first home win as a re-branded side, in a lacklustre 1-0 result over Brisbane Roar.","There's doubt over whether Western Sydney players will participate in the FIFA Club World Cup due to a pay dispute .

"Nile Ranger was reportedly questioned by police after an argument with girlfriend on the motorway . Ex-Newcastle United player Nile Ranger has been questioned by police after he had a row on the middle of the motorway, it has been reported. The former Premier League footballer is said to have been driving along the M55 near Preston on Friday night when he got into an argument with his girlfriend - who was in a separate car. It is believed police were called to the busy carriageway in Lancashire to speak with the couple, who had been shouting at each other with their windows down. A witness, who nearly crashed into them, told the Sunday People that Ranger, 23, was in his Mercedes in the middle lane and his girlfriend was in the first lane in an Audi. They claim they had stopped to argue for a couple of minutes before the cars started moving - only to stop minutes later where the dispute resumed. 'We nearly crashed into them and a taxi nearly went into them too,' the motorist said. 'At first we thought it was one of those bash-for-cash insurance scams. We thought they were trying to get people to crash into the back of them. 'We were shouting out of the window for them to get into the hard shoulder. That's when we rang the police.' Ranger, who now plays for Championship club Blackpool, and his girlfriend eventually pulled over where he told the witness they had split up and were arguing over her giving back his keys. The onlooker, who did not even recognise the footballer, told the paper the incident lasted about 20 minutes and she was going to London but had not given his key back. The controversial player, who was fired by Swindon Town FC earlier this year after he was caught on CCTV punching a woman, took to Twitter today. The footballer is believed to have been driving along the M55 near Preston when the row erupted on Friday . He tweeted: 'Media are bloody desperate lol...itching to mess me up...lol #desperado,' which was followed by a second post: 'Lol... Next thing I know I'm gonna spill some milk for my cornflakes. And be in the media for that.. 'NILE SPILLS MILK FOR HIS CORNFLAKES'. The player, who was once paid £5,000-a-week to play for Newcastle United, was arrested on suspicion of rape last year but was cleared of the charges in March. Ranger represented England at under-19 level on 11 occasions, scoring six goals . A formidable talent on the pitch has given Nile Ranger opportunities most youngsters can only dream of. But the striker, who represented England at under-19 level, has had his promising future hampered by a string of brushes with the law. Ranger previously has spoken of how he got embroiled in gang culture while growing up in London. He served an 11-week sentence in a young offenders' institution when he was 15 after he took part in an armed robbery. But despite saying 'I never want to go back', the striker found himself again facing charges in 2011, after a 33-year-old man was found outside a Newcastle pub with a broken jaw. In October 2012 he was finally cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm relating to the incident, after a court heard his actions were in self defence and he had been the victim of racist taunts. But he was also handed a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting assaulting two police officers who were trying to arrest him in connection with the fight. Before that case was even resolved, Ranger was given a six-month conditional discharge after admitting a charge of being drunk and disorderly, and sentenced to 120 hours community service after admitting pulling his then-girlfriend's hair during a row. In the meantime, he was also rapped by the FA and his then club, Newcastle United, for posing with a replica gun in a photograph that was subsequently published in The Sun and making homophobic remarks on Twitter. In January last year, Ranger was arrested on suspicion of rape. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in March this year. He refused to apologise to a woman after writing off her parked car while swerving to avoid a fox in May 2013. Ranger found himself in more car-related trouble this year when he was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay compensation to the driver of a taxi he broke the window of. He was again fined for criminal damage in July after repeatedly kicking a jammed door at his penthouse suite in Swindon, where he played in the 2013-14 season. CCTV showed him damaging 'a lift door, wall and glass panel', and also appeared to show him hitting his girlfriend in the face three times. In May, Ranger was cleared of being drunk in charge of his sports car after he was found asleep behind the wheel on the M4 in Wales.","Ranger said to have been driving along M55 near Preston on Friday night .
