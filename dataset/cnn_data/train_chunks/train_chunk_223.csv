"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minnesota to Las Vegas this month was ordered Wednesday to undergo therapy and to live apart from his parents, for now. According to Nancy Peters, spokeswoman for Hennepin County's Fourth Judicial District in Minneapolis, a judge said the boy's parents should be allowed unlimited visits and phone calls with their son. Judge Joseph Klein also ordered the mother to have her 9-year-old boy evaluated for special education services, Peters said. Crew members aboard a Delta Air Lines flight on October 3 became suspicious of their child passenger and then found that he had no ticket or boarding pass. He was placed in a foster home as authorities began an investigation. 'He's got a behavioral problem' The Transportation Security Administration has said the boy went through security at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although it has not explained how he did so without a boarding pass. An airport spokesman said video shows the boy chatted with a Delta agent when he reached the gate and moved toward the plane when the agent became distracted. Last week, the boy's father tearfully told reporters he had previously asked for help to address the boy's behavior problems, but no one responded. Drawing a sweatshirt's hood tightly to his face to obscure his identity, the father said he tried to ask assistance from police and social service officials because of his son's previous indiscretions, including allegedly stealing a vehicle just days before the flight. ""I've been asking for help. No one stepped up to help,"" the dad said, head bowed.

"(CNN) -- A teenager accused of killing 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in Westminster, Colorado, pleaded guilty to all counts, a spokesman for Colorado's courts said Tuesday. Austin Reed Sigg was 17 at the time of the killing and was charged as an adult. He lived about one mile from Ridgeway's home. A judge accepted his plea, and sentencing is set for November 18 and 19, said spokesman Rob McCallum. Sigg was accused of strangling Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing some of her body parts in a crawlspace under his family's home. Police found parts of her body at a park five miles away five days after the bespectacled blonde girl disappeared while walking to Witt Elementary School on October 5. A break in the investigation came when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed.

"(CNN) -- Love him or hate him, Kanye West will always be himself -- especially when he's burying the hatchet with Jimmy Kimmel. The 36-year-old Grammy winner appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on Wednesday to discuss the feud the two got into a few weeks ago. Kanye West and Twitter: A brief history . It all started with Kimmel's parody of West's recent interview with BBC Radio 1, during which he spoke at length about feeling artistically boxed in and the status of hip-hop as the new rock n' roll. (That's where West's now legendary quote, ""I'm the No. 1 rock star on the planet,"" came from.) Kimmel, who admitted Wednesday that he'd only seen a few portions of West's viral interview, latched on to the rapper's reference to leather jogging pants, which he says he invented before they became fashionable. For his late-night program on ABC, Kimmel re-enacted that portion of the interview with little kids. ""I wanted to clear this up. I really felt bad about all of this stuff, I did,"" Kimmel told West. ""The main reason I did (the sketch) is because I like to see kids curse ... Most people maybe even think that this is some publicity stunt that we cooked up."" But of course, West doesn't do publicity stunts, ""period,"" he said. ""Everyone out there ... needs to know that I've never done a publicity stunt in my life. Anytime I've went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy ... it was always what I thought was the truth. I don't follow rules of normal celebrity."" In the end, West explained, Kimmel became a sort of scapegoat for all the other members of the media who've published ""bogus"" information. Kanye West: I'm the No. 1 rock star on the planet . ""A combination of me knowing you, but also, me not knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch, I was like, well this is the one person I know,"" West said. ""So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every single bogus skit, every single rumor -- everything that people think is OK to treat celebrities like zoo animals, or act like what they're saying is not serious."" West said his frustration admittedly escalated after his initial phone call with Kimmel about the sketch. ""It elevates sometimes,"" West said. ""At a certain point, egos flare up, and we just kind of took it back to high school for a little bit."" For Kimmel, it was odd to be in a feud with West, someone he's gotten to know well enough where he has found himself defending the artist's reputation. ""A lot of times, I think you bring it on yourself, this misunderstanding about you. I don't know if you know this, but a lot of people think you're a jerk,"" Kimmel told West. ""I often, in my own personal conversations, say, 'No, I know this guy, he is not a jerk.'"" Kanye and Kim take Paris . Yet to West, likability is apparently immaterial. ""I'm not running for office, I'm just here to make good music,"" West said. ""When I did that interview, I was really vocal about a lot of the things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years when I was put in the classification of 'just a celebrity.' For me, I'm a creative genius, and there's no other way to word it. I know you're not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times, but my intention is always positive. ... I want to help the world."" Kimmel pointed out those sorts of statements are what critics use against West, but to him, ""to say that I wasn't a genius, I would be lying to you and to myself."" ""I could care less about any of these cameras, in all honesty. All I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. That's the reason why I went so crazy,"" West said. "" I'm totally weird, and I'm totally honest, and I'm totally inappropriate sometimes ... I'm just going to give y'all the truth, and y'all going to learn to love it. You're going to love me, you're going to hate me, but I'm going to be me."" And since he was sharing his truth, West told Kimmel that he did find a bit of joy in his profane Twitter spree. ""As I was writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me. I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time with my position, because as soon as you're a celebrity you're not allowed to say anything anymore,"" West said, adding with a laugh, ""You should've seen the second set of tweets."" Kimmel responded with a laugh, ""Let's save them for next time.""","Kanye West appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- An airline passenger accused of slapping the toddler seated next to him on a Minneapolis-to-Atlanta flight in February pleaded guilty to assault Wednesday in federal court. Joe Rickey Hundley, 61, will be sentenced on January 6, according to his attorney, Marcia Shein. Hundley was seated next to Jessica Bennett and her 19-month-old son in row 28 when Delta Flight 721 began its descent into Atlanta. When the baby began to cry, Hundley allegedly told Bennett to ""shut that (N-word) baby up,"" according to an FBI affidavit. ""(He) then turned around and slapped (the child) in the face with an open hand, which caused (him) to scream even louder,"" the affidavit continued. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. Shein said in a February statement that her client was in distress and grieving during the flight after learning the day before that his son was in a coma, after overdosing on insulin. Hundley was headed to Atlanta to decide whether or not to take his son off life support. He died the day after the flight. Shein said Hundley ""had paid a terrible price for his hurtful words but asks only that people understand that he was not doing well that night and spoke hurtful words he would have not otherwise have said.""

"(CNN) -- After you've had a major showdown between good and evil, killed off a major character and broken ratings records, what do you do for an encore? That's one big question on the minds of the legions of fans of ""The Walking Dead"" going into the fourth season premiere on Sunday. Last season, the show ranked as the No. 1 scripted show on television, a first for cable, and certainly something no one would have predicted for a series about a zombie apocalypse. The show returns with new showrunner Scott Gimple and without the latest victims of the walkers: Andrea, Merle and Milton. (There's also the promise of a spinoff set in a different location during the apocalypse, due to arrive in 2015.) Executive producer Gale Anne Hurd spoke to CNN about what to expect this season. CNN: After all of the events of last season, where do we find our survivors now? Hurd: The survivors have essentially taken residence in the prison and realized that, at the moment anyway, that is the safest haven. They need to integrate new members. CNN: And where is Rick's head at now? Hurd: As we like to say, Rick spent a little time in ""Crazytown"" last season. But he's always someone who will step up if necessary. This season, he's in a very different place. He realizes that perhaps the most important role in the zombie apocalypse is that of a good father. He needs to raise Carl not to be a trigger-happy child soldier, and his baby, Judith, he's taking that responsibility very seriously. CNN: Last we saw the Governor, he massacred many of his followers from Woodbury and drove off to parts unknown with a few loyalists. Will we find out what became of him? Hurd: We definitely get a sense that he is out there. No one has forgotten and forgiven what he's done. Some people have moved on. As to what he's up to, as the season develops, we'll certainly get some insights into that. I can't say when we'll find out, but we'll find out. The Governor is pretty formidable. We know he's out there, and he's not one to give up a grudge. CNN: With a good number of the original main characters deceased, we're seeing the possibilities of new characters emerging, like the Woodbury survivors now living in the prison. Hurd: Some of the people are already significant characters in the comic book, people like Tyreese. We didn't have enough bandwidth last season to spend much time getting to know him. Now we have the time to do that. We will also explore those who used to live in Woodbury. CNN: Will we learn new things about the nature of the walkers? Hurd: What hasn't changed is they haven't developed into super-fast walkers. We have very much the same rules for them, but some of them are more desiccated than ever. They're more ravenous than ever, and there are a lot more of them. We'll get to see how that plays out very quickly. CNN: What is showrunner Scott Gimple bringing to the new season? Hurd: Scott Gimple has been in the writers' room since season two. So he's someone who is very deep into the show. He was a fan of the comic book from the time it came out, and it's celebrating its 10th anniversary. What he focuses on incredibly well is the juxtaposition between the epic scope of a zombie apocalypse -- which people will see very quickly in the first episode of the new season -- and making sure that with our characters this season, we'll see how they handle escalating threats, as well as what decisions they make, both for themselves, the people they love and their allegiance to the group. CNN: Of course, there are a few characters in particular that hold a lot of interest for the fans. What's the status of Glenn and Maggie's relationship? Hurd: They're the example of love among the ruins. As long as love exists, there's hope. We'll see if their relationship strengthens in times of calm, or is it strongest in times of crisis? Do they see the world from the same perspective or will different outlooks create conflict between them? CNN: And of course, Daryl Dixon's following has taken on a life of its own. Will Daryl fans be satisfied this season? Hurd: There's no question. Daryl, as brought to life by Norman Reedus, is someone who -- I think all of us have encountered characters with a dark, brutal past who seem to be broken. We want to see them be able to interact and communicate with other people, and we'll see if this is possible with Daryl.","""The Walking Dead"" returns as the No. 1 scripted show on TV .

"(EW.com) -- The craziest thing about Charlie Sheen's tiger-blood-soaked, ""WINNING!"" meltdown — er, ""melt-forward""? Now that the crazy is nearly two years in the past, the ex-""Two and a Half Men"" star is actually ashamed of his behavior. (Well, some of it, anyway.) When David Letterman asked last night if Sheen ever feels embarrassed when he thinks back on the spring of 2011, the actor answered the question quickly and matter-of-factly: ""Of course. Have you seen some of those interviews? That stuff's out there forever, man."" That said, Sheen still seems proud of his very public crackup's sheer audacity. ""I booked a 21 city tour in 33 days with no act!"" he crowed at one point during the Letterman interview, sounding equally incredulous and boastful. He also didn't miss a chance to take a swipe at his old sitcom, even as he revealed that he'd like to return to the show for its last episode: ""I am dead,"" Sheen said, referring to the convenient subway accident that killed off his character at the beginning of season 9, ""but so's the show."" How's that for a violent torpedo of truth? As funny as Sheen's quip is, it's not entirely accurate — CBS entertainment president Nina Tassler told TV critics last week that the network wants to bring Men back for an 11th season next fall, though a renewal has not yet been finalized. (Cast member Angus T. Jones is expected to stick with the show as well, even though he loosed his own Sheen-ian Men slam last fall.) And despite Sheen's wishes, it seems unlikely that Men creator Chuck Lorre — the man Sheen once called a ""sad silly fool,"" an ""a-hole p---y loser"" and a ""low rent, nutless sociopath"" — would welcome his ex-star back into the fold. After all, the ghost of Charlie Harper has already appeared on ""Two and a Half Men;"" he was simply played by Kathy Bates instead of Sheen. Watch a clip of Sheen on ""Letterman"" here.

"(CNN) -- Egypt is reconsidering its ties with countries that haven't been supportive of the government that the military installed after ousting the country's first democratically elected president, the interim president said. Speaking in his first televised interview since Egypt's powerful generals put him in office, Adly Mansour singled out Turkey and Qatar for criticism. Both those regional neighbors have condemned a crackdown last month by Egyptian authorities on supporters of the ousted president Mohamed Morsy that left hundreds of people dead. Life during chaos: Egyptians talk about coping . ""Our patience is running out regarding the Qatari stance,"" Mansour, 67, said in the interview aired by state television Tuesday. ""The Turkish reaction has reflected short-sightedness and personal interest, not realizing the amount of cooperation between the two countries,"" Mansour said, according to an account of the interview published by state-run media outlet Al-Ahram. Tensions with Turkey . Unlike Qatar, which initially welcomed the military's installation of Mansour and his administration, Turkey has been critical of the forced change of government in Cairo from the start. ""Neither ourselves nor the people of Turkey expected the stance of the Turkish government, which shouldn't have reacted based on the perspective of one faction,"" Mansour said. ""We hope for better relations with Turkey, but we do not accept interference in our internal affairs."" Egypt demonstrator: Why we are willing to die . Mansour said that he and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy are ""strategically reviewing our foreign relations to differentiate between our real friends and those who should not be classified in that category anymore."" He said that the positions of the United States and the European Union remain unclear, but that he is starting to see indications that they will support the unelected transitional government. 'No force can turn back the clock' Mansour also denied that the overthrow of Morsy in July had put Egypt on a path back toward the police state seen under former ruler Hosni Mubarak, who lost his grip on power amid widespread protests in early 2011. A court released Mubarak, 85, from prison last month, but authorities had him placed under house arrest at a military hospital while he awaits a retrial on charges of inciting violence against protesters during the demonstrations in 2011. Opinion: What Mubarak's release means . ""No force can turn back the clock, neither to the former regime or the one before it, Mansour said Tuesday. He said that what followed the 2011 uprising -- the election of Morsy and the Islamist party he was aligned with, the Muslim Brotherhood -- ""was an attempt at creating a clone of the former regime but with a religious tone."" The military removed Morsy from office a year into his tenure amid large-scale street demonstrations against his government. Critics accused Morsy of authoritarianism and trying to force the Brotherhood's Islamic agenda into the nation's laws. But his supporters point out he was democratically elected and repeatedly offered Cabinet positions to secularists and liberals. Police 'applied restraint' Mansour, a judge who heads the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, defended the actions of security forces in the deadly crackdown on Morsy supporters at two large sit-ins in Cairo last month. ""I know the police faced a lot of criticism in dispersing the sit-ins, which were not peaceful, but they tried to pursue all peaceful stages and there was no response,"" he said. ""Still, they applied restraint and committed to the international standards and legal means of clearing the sit-ins."" The violent clearance of the camps, the bloodiest day in Egypt's recent history, was condemned by many countries. Egyptian authorities followed it by declaring a one-month state of emergency and arresting more Muslim Brotherhood officials. In his interview Tuesday, Mansour defended the decision to impose the state of emergency and a curfew. ""There was no other alternative to confront the organized danger the nation was facing,"" he said.","Adly Mansour expresses frustration with Turkey and Qatar .

"(CNN) -- Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn suffered a ""complex knee injury"" when she crashed during the opening day super-G at the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria on Tuesday, doctors said. The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association said the four-time Alpine World Cup champion was airlifted from the race course in Schladming, Austria, to a hospital. She was evaluated and released, according to the U.S. Ski Team. Vonn, 28, does not need immediate surgery on the ""complex torn ligament"" in her right knee, said Dr. Christian Kaulfersch, who is treating her at the Schladming Hospital. U.S. team officials are considering whether she should fly back to the United States or remain in Europe for treatment, he said. Days earlier: Victorious Vonn closes on World Cup record . The U.S. team's website reported that Vonn will be out for the rest of this season, but is expected to return for the 2013-14 World Cup campaign and next February's Winter Olympics in Sochi. Vonn suffered a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee and a lateral tibial plateau fracture, according to ski team medical director Kyle Wilkens. Vonn wrote in a special column published in The Denver Post that the women's super-G runs might be postponed Tuesday because of weather. Vonn's injury 'career-delayer,' not 'career-ender' ""I've been trying to be patient and stay calm, but it's pretty tough with the way the weather has been,"" Vonn wrote. ""It snowed a lot Sunday night, there was no training possible Monday on the race hill, then it rained most of Monday afternoon and evening."" The heavy snow meant Monday's free skiing session, in which she could learn about the race course's terrain and conditions, was canceled, she wrote. ""None of our staff has been on the hill,"" she wrote. ""We don't know what shape the hill is in. We don't know anything about it."" Vonn was very familiar with the hill since it is where the World Cup finals were held last year, she wrote, ""but it always feels a little awkward when you don't get a chance to free ski the hill before you race. It's tricky to know the terrain when all you have to go on is course inspection the morning of the race."" Vonn, who won the downhill gold in the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, is just three wins behind Annemarie Moser-Proll's record of 62 World Cup wins. She was coming back from an intestinal illness that hospitalized her in November. Watch: Vonn interviewed in 2010 . World Cup leader Tina Maze won gold in Tuesday's super-G ahead of Lara Gut of Switzerland and third-placed American Julia Mancuso. The Slovenian continued her dominance this season as another big rival, two-time Olympic champion Maria Hofl-Riesch of Germany, also crashed out of the race. ""This is very important for me, it is my first speed medal,"" Maze said on the FIS website. ""I came here as one of the top favorites and proved my good shape. I knew it would be a long day today and was ready for it, even after all the postponements. Slovenia is such a small country and I am very happy and proud I can take this gold medal back with me."" Mancuso won the fifth world championship medal of her career, and her third in the super-G discipline -- one of two ""speed events"" along with the downhill, compared to the ""technical"" slalom and giant slalom races. ""I think that might've been one of the most difficult races I've ever been in. It was a really long course. I didn't know I'd be so tired at the end of the run,"" the 28-year-old said.

"(CNN) -- A quarter of a century advantage is nothing new to Kimiko Date-Krumm. The 43-year-old may be in the twilight of her career but these are still golden years for the evergreen player from Kyoto. Date-Krumm defied a 24-year age gap to defeat British teenager Laura Robson 6-4 6-4 on home soil at the Japan Open. In 1996, the Japanese retired from tennis after losing to 16-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis at the Chase Championships in New York. But after returning to the circuit in 2008, Date-Krumm is now doling out defeats to the next generation of tennis starlets. This season the veteran has reached the third round of the Australian Open and Wimbledon's All England Championships. At the start of the year, the world No. 54 revealed the secret to her longevity was a simple life and a lot of sleep. But Date-Krumm, who is married to German racing driver Michael Krumm, is no slouch. She ran the 2004 London Marathon in an impressive three hours and 30 minutes, has raised funds to build a school in Laos and holds coaching sessions for children around the globe. The next challenge for Date-Krumm is facing 22-year-old compatriot Misaki Doi in the second round of the Japan Open. Djokovic doffs hat to Nadal . In Shanghai, Novak Djokovic is on a mission to defend his Masters title this week but regaining the world No. 1 spot is not top of his agenda. Rafael Nadal took over the top ranking Monday but Djokovic is philosophical about wrestling back top spot before the season is out. ""The rankings are there for a reason,"" Djokovic told the media in China. ""He has been playing some fantastic tennis since his comeback, and he deserves to be No. 1, definitely he's the most successful player this year. ""I can affect only what I can affect, and that is to play the best tennis that I possibly can in the moment and to try to take one tournament at a time."" Momentum is in Djokovic's favor. The Australian Open champion defeated his Spanish rival at last week's China Open. ""I'm in a good place right now,"" the 26-year-old continued. ""Something that makes me very happy is that I managed to regroup and mentally find my concentration and determination after the U.S. Open final loss against Nadal."" At the ATP event in Shanghai, heavy rain forced Tuesday's round of matches to be moved indoors. Once under the roof, French ninth seed Richard Gasquet was knocked out by Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-3 6-4. Australian wildcard Lleyton Hewitt lost 6-4 6-2 to Italian Andreas Seppi, who goes up against fifth seed Roger Federer next. The Swiss star is competing in his first event since the U.S. Open, and warned in Shanghai: ""My game's been coming back.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A congressional investigation has exposed gaping holes in security eight years after the September 11 terrorist attacks, a government report says. An investigator used fake documents to obtain a U.S. passport, a congressional report says. An investigator used a false identification to obtain a U.S. passport and then used the passport to get an airline boarding pass and go through an airport security checkpoint, according to the Government Accountability Office. The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said its undercover investigator conducted four tests of the passport issuance system and ""easily"" obtained passports every time. Individuals with ""even minimal counterfeiting capabilities"" can obtain genuine U.S. passports, which can be used to travel overseas, open bank accounts and prove U.S. citizenship, the GAO report says. In the ""most egregious"" case, it says, the investigator used the Social Security number of a man who died in 1965 to obtain a Social Security card. In another case, he used the Social Security number of a 5-year-old child and obtained a passport, even though his counterfeit documents and application indicated he was 53 years old. ""A U.S. passport is a key to virtually anywhere in the world,"" said Sen. John Kyl, R-Arizona. ""It is very troubling that in the years since the September 11 attacks someone could use fraudulent documents to obtain a U.S. passport."" Kyl and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on terrorism, requested the test. To perform the test, the GAO designed four scenarios. In each, an investigator simulated the actions of a malicious person involved in identity theft, then created fake documents using ""off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials."" The investigator used the counterfeit documents to obtain a genuine Washington, D.C., identification card. For three of the tests, the undercover investigator submitted passport applications and supporting materials at U.S. Postal Service locations that accept passport applications. For the remaining test, it submitted the application and materials to the State Department's regional passport office in Washington. ""State and USPS employees did not identify our documents as counterfeit in any of our four tests,"" the GAO report says. The State Department ""issued a genuine U.S. passport in each case."" ""All four passports were issued to the same GAO investigator, under four different names,"" it says. The tests occurred between July and December of last year. A State Department spokesman was not immediately available for comment. But the GAO said in the report that State Department officials ""agreed that our findings expose a major vulnerability"" in the passport issuance process. State Department officials said the department's ability to verify the information submitted ""is hampered by limitations to its information-sharing and data access with other agencies at the federal and state levels."" Some agencies won't share information because of privacy concerns, or because the State Department is not a law enforcement agency. Also, the department, like other government agencies, has difficulty verifying birth certificates because there are thousands of acceptable formats for them.","Congressional investigation reveals gaps in verification process .

"(CNN) -- Roy Pickler lay on the floor, dripping with sweat, as trainer Bob Harper quipped, ""You look like you got run over by a reindeer."" Pickler's job as a professional Santa was a constant joke on the latest season of ""The Biggest Loser."" With his long white beard and protruding stomach, the 63-year-old looked every bit the part he played. By the time he was voted off the show, Pickler had lost 88 pounds. During his elimination interview, he donned a Santa hat and told viewers his toned physique wouldn't stop him from bringing Christmas joy to children. ""The world is going to have to change their acceptance of what Santa looks like,"" Pickler said. ""Santa is a role model, and kids don't want to have a role model that's fat."" Since 1980, obesity rates among children and adolescents have almost tripled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 12.5 million children age 2 to 19 are obese; that extra weight can lead to serious health problems, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and psychosocial issues such as peer discrimination or poor self-esteem. The epidemic has gotten a lot of attention in the past few years. Everyone from first lady Michelle Obama to Shaquille O'Neal is trying to figure out the best way to inspire kids to get and stay fit. Children learn healthy (or unhealthy) habits from those they admire. And Santa is one of the most recognizable figures in America. For at least a month every year, he appears on billboards, storefronts and TV commercials. Millions of kids stand in line to sit on his comfortably padded lap and whisper secrets in his ear. They write letters to him, sing songs about him and read stories about him. Photos: Santa over the years . We worry about the effect fast-food advertisements have on students in school. With all his free publicity, should Santa still be fat? ""Let's put it this way,"" registered dietician Beth Kitchin said with a laugh. ""I don't think Santa should be skinny."" There are a lot of other markers to consider in measuring health. Research shows that people can have a higher body mass index and still be healthy, Kitchin said. One can assume Santa is pretty active, wrangling hundreds of elves and nine reindeer every year. And his cheery disposition says a lot about his stress level, which could relate to low blood pressure. Of course, Santa does have a penchant for sugary treats. One fan estimated the big man eats more than 5,000 tons of cookies on Christmas Eve alone. If Santa isn't diabetic, Christmas magic really does exist. A 2009 study published in the British Medical Journal determined that Santa could very well be a ""public health pariah."" The light-hearted research by Nathan Grills of Monash University in Australia found a correlation between countries that recognize Santa and a high rate of childhood obesity. Santa's weight is a longstanding tradition, said Tom Kliner, founder of Santas Across the Globe and the Fraternity of International Real Bearded Santas. The character originated with St. Nicholas, who lived in Turkey during the fourth century. Nicholas was a wealthy young bishop who started giving away all his gold after his parents died. ""Back in those days, extra weight was a sign of wealth and affluence,"" Kliner said. Hollywood used to have a set of numbers -- waist circumference, face shape, beard length -- that Santas were supposed to adhere to, Kliner said. But around the world, the legendary giver comes in all shapes and sizes. Coca-Cola's Santa, whom many in America try to emulate, is very round: round face, round nose, round stomach. The Santa imitated in Europe is a thinner man with more squared-off features. Kliner said he sees Santa as more of a public figure than a role model. ""I've never seen anybody aspire to become Santa Claus."" Changing Santa's iconic image would be hard, said Meg Cox, author of ""The Book of New Family Traditions."" Comfort and security come with seeing the same character year after year. ""We carry these traditions forward from our childhood,"" she said. ""Some of us are pretty emotional about them. And yet I think there's nothing wrong with having a sense of play about it.""

""Having your own take on Santa might be the ultimate personalized Christmas."" It's possible our culture is already changing.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal to get a new sentencing hearing for the killing of a Philadelphia police officer 30 years ago. The high court rejected a request from the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office to overturn the federal appeals court decision declaring the death sentence unconstitutional for Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who was convicted in 1982 of gunning down a Philadelphia police officer. Abu-Jamal will be automatically sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole unless Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams seeks another death sentence from a new jury. Williams had no comment Tuesday. His attorneys, who have repeatedly argued that confusing jury instructions and the verdict form given to the jury favored a death sentence instead of life in prison, applauded the court's ruling. ""At long last, the profoundly troubling prospect of Mr. Abu-Jamal facing an execution that was produced by an unfair and unreliable penalty phase has been eliminated. Like all Americans, Mr. Abu-Jamal was entitled to a proper proceeding that takes into account the many substantial reasons why death was an inappropriate sentence,"" John Payton, director of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, said in a statement. Abu-Jamal's case will now return to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for final sentencing. In April, Abu-Jamal was granted a new sentencing hearing by a federal appeals court, sparking a threat by the prosecutor to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. In its 32-page decision, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals accepted defense arguments that the jury instructions at Abu-Jamal's original 1982 murder trial were unclear. The court's decision does not grant Abu-Jamal a new trial and his conviction of murder stands. In January, the Supreme Court tossed out a lower court ruling that nullified the death sentence for Abu-Jamal. The justices ordered a federal appeals court to revisit its earlier ruling granting a new sentencing hearing. The high court last year denied Abu-Jamal's separate petition for a new trial . Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of Officer Daniel Faulkner. Witnesses testified that Abu-Jamal shot Faulkner in the back and head after the officer pulled his brother over during a late-night traffic stop. Abu-Jamal, once known as Wesley Cook, was wounded in the encounter and later confessed to the killing, according to other testimony. He's been on death row at a state prison in southwest Pennsylvania, where he's been an outspoken activist from behind bars -- claiming there were procedural errors during his capital sentencing, and that too few blacks were on the jury. The case has attracted international attention, amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct. Abu-Jamal, a onetime radio reporter and cab driver, has been a divisive figure, with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial. Others counter Abu-Jamal is using his race to try to escape responsibility for his actions. They say he has provoked community unrest for years with his writings and advocacy.","Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of 1982 slaying, sentenced to death .

"Madrid (CNN) -- An oil tanker captain was acquitted Wednesday of the central charge in what's widely considered Spain's worst environmental disaster -- a spill that blackened hundreds of miles of coastline. Apostolos Mangouras, who was captain of the Prestige during the accident in 2002, was found not guilty of environmental crime. He was, however, convicted on a lesser charge of disobeying orders from Spanish officials who tried to save the ship. Mangouras was sentenced to nine months in jail. But Spanish legal experts said prison time is unlikely for someone sentenced to less than two years who has no prior criminal record. If he had been convicted of environmental crime, he could have faced up to 12 years in prison. Another Greek officer on the ship, Nikolaos Argyropoulos, was acquitted altogether. So was Jose Luis Lopez-Sors, former director general of Spain's Merchant Marine Department, the only Spanish government official charged in the case. The three were not in court for the verdict. The court ruled that a precise cause for the accident could not be established, so criminal responsibility could not be determined. ""No one knows with certainty what could be the cause of what happened, nor what should have been the appropriate response to the emergency situation created by the serious problem of the Prestige,"" the verdict reads. ""But no one can deny the structural problem, nor could they show during the trial where that problem occurred exactly or why."" The group Nunca Mais, whose name means ""never again,"" said it was studying the 263-page ruling. The group includes citizens and organizations that helped clean up the spill and served as a kind of class-action plaintiff in the case. Pedro Trepat, attorney for Nunca Mais, called parts of the ruling ""strange."" An appeal to Spain's Supreme Court is possible. 'Coast of Death' The Prestige issued an alarm on November 13, 2002, during a storm with gale-force winds off northwest Spain in an area known as the Coast of Death, famous for numerous shipwrecks. The ship reported it had a gash in its single hull and some of its cargo of 70,000 tons of fuel oil had started gushing out. Spanish authorities soon ordered the stricken ship to move farther off the coast. It struggled for days but on November 19, at 8 in the morning and about 145 nautical miles off the coast, it split in two and sank. Oil continued to leak from it, at the bottom of the Atlantic, in the ensuing days. Much of this oil, described by some as having the sticky consistency of chewing gum, blackened hundreds of miles of coastline in Spain and neighboring France. It was an ecological disaster, with dead and oil-laden birds as a painful reminder. It was also an economic disaster for Spain's vital fishing industry, which was brought to a standstill for months over health concerns. In 2003, the cost was estimated at about $5.7 billion. But the court Wednesday did not assign damages to be paid because the defendants were acquitted of the principal charge of an environmental crime, which carried the potential for payments of damages, Trepat said. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: The court did not assign any damages .

"(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's hopes of reaching the ATP World Tour Finals suffered a blow Saturday as the top seed crashed out of the Erste Bank Open in Austria. The Frenchman is ranked ninth in the Race to London, but at this stage would take one of the eight places on offer due to Andy Murray's season-ending back surgery. However, while Tsonga lost in the Vienna semis to Dutchman Robin Haase, his 10th-ranked compatriot Richard Gasquet earned a place in the final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow to boost his chances of grabbing one of the four remaining spots. Former world No. 5 Tsonga is seeking to catch up on points after struggling with injury earlier this season, missing three months as he sat out the U.S. Open. He could have moved above Swiss duo Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka by adding to his 2011 Vienna crown this weekend . ""I'm not in the best of shape and it showed out there,"" Tsonga told reporters. ""But I have to keep playing if I want to make London. ""I had my chances but he was too good. I just have to keep fighting and trying to win matches."" World No. 63 Haase, who won the Austrian Open clay event in 2011 and 2012, will take on German veteran Tommy Haas in the final of the indoor hard-court tournament on Sunday. Haas is ranked 12th in the ATP standings but has a big gap to make up on Tsonga and Gasquet. ""There's still a chance, but obviously I will have to play extremely well next week and also in Paris, maybe even win Paris,"" said the 35-year-old, who made his debut in the Vienna event in 1997 and won the title in 2001. He reached his third final this season, and 27th overall, after beating 44th-ranked Czech Lukas Rosol 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7-0) to take his record to 46-19 in 2013. Gasquet, the top men's seed this week in Russia, reached the final with a 6-4 7-5 win over Croatia's Ivo Karlovic. He will next play Kazakh qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin, who beat Italy's defending champion Andreas Seppi 6-1 1-6 6-4. Victory will put Gasquet above Tsonga in the ATP standings ahead of next week's events in Valencia and Basel, with the Paris Masters closing the regular season the following week. Fourth-ranked David Ferrer, who has already qualified for London, reached the final of the Stockholm Open with a 3-6 6-4 6-1 win over Latvia's Ernests Gulbis. The Spanish top seed will next play Bulgaria's Grigor Dmitrov, who beat France's Benoit Paire 4-6 6-2 6-2. Meanwhile, the WTA Tour announced Saturday that former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki and American Sloane Stephens will be the alternates for the season-ending championships in Istanbul next week. The duo can expect to be called up if any of the eight qualified players pull out of the tournament. The draw for the two groups will take place Sunday. None of that line-up are involved in this week's events in Moscow and Luxembourg. Luxembourg top seed Wozniacki, ranked 10th, will face Germany's Annika Beck in Sunday's final. The Dane, who has reportedly split with golf star boyfriend Rory McIlroy, defeated German third seed Sabine Lisicki while Beck went through when Stefanie Voegele retired in the second set of their semi. Former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur will contest the Kremlin Cup final against Romanian fifth seed Simona Halep. The Australian, who won the Osaka title last weekend, beat two-time grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2 6-4 while Halep defeated another Russian, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, 6-2 6-1.","Top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga loses in semifinals of Austrian tournament .

"(CNN) -- The sometimes ludicrous disguises and complex surveillance techniques used by East Germany's Stasi secret police to psychologically brutalize the population have been revealed, more than two decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain. From 1950 onwards, the Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of society and by the mid-1980s, a vast network of unofficial informants and full-time employees had been created. Some spouses spied on their partners, as did neighbors and friends. The ratio of 80,000 full-time agents to the 16 million people in the GDR was higher even than in Soviet Russia. Defying the KGB: How a forgotten movement freed a people . After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and Germany's reunification the following year, most of the Stasi archives were opened to the public. Citizens can request their Stasi files from the BStU, revealing the meticulous surveillance they had been subjected to during the Cold War era. Now the extent to which East Germans were being watched is documented in a new book by Simon Menner. ""People are fascinated by surveillance and secret services, but the public has little access to picture material showing the act of surveillance,"" the Berlin-based artist told CNN. Watch: East Germany's spying system . In his book ""Top Secret: Images from the Stasi Archives,"" Menner includes images that show the creative guises of Stasi personnel. ""Most people would probably laugh seeing these pictures now. They look almost ridiculous,"" he said, ""but they show a dark chapter of German history."" For more than two years, Menner, 35, went through thousands of images and documents at the archive of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of the former German Democratic Republic (BStU). ""These images offer a glimpse into another world, an extinct culture, but it was a brutal system that showed no sympathy for its people,"" he said. ""The fact that Stasi spies had to try to look like ordinary people just shows that they had completely lost the connection to their citizens."" The aliases of people that spied on them are also in the files and on request the real names can be uncovered. Last month Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, who is running against Angela Merkel in the race to be Germany's next chancellor released his Stasi file online, revealing that on his visits to the GDR a relative reportedly spied on him. According to Menner, thousands of bags of Stasi images and documents are yet to be archived.

"(CNN) -- Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan attempted to shoot a street scene in Brooklyn for the indie film ""Kill Your Darlings"" when they realized that the area they were using was right across from an elementary school. It was recess time. Tons of little kids eager for a boy-wizard sighting started lining up across the fence and yelling at Radcliffe. The actor formerly known as Harry Potter obliged. ""He said something like, 'Hey, it's really good to meet you guys, but we're making a movie over here and we're playing pretend, so I need you all to be quiet for a second so we can do this,' "" DeHaan told CNN. ""And they all hushed down, and we got to do the take. It was just kind of a magical moment with all these kids, 'OK, we'll be quiet during our recess so you can do this.' "" It's moments like this where Radcliffe weighs the pluses and minuses of his Harry Potter fame. ""Not enough people recognize that there are really good ways which it hangs over you,"" the actor said. ""People want to see Potter as a bad thing, and actually, it's not. ""If you manage it in the wrong way, I'm sure it could turn into a hindrance. But if you take the right attitude, then it could be the most amazing platform for a career that anybody could ever wish for, so I'm just going to try to capitalize on that if I can."" The eighth and final film of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" came out over two years ago, but even before then, Radcliffe started taking roles that he called ""slightly off the beaten path."" He played the lead in ""Equus"" in the West End and on Broadway -- with full-frontal nudity. He returned to Broadway in ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" -- singing and dancing. He did a horror film, ""The Woman in Black,"" where he portrayed an older man. And at the Toronto Film Festival, he was hard at work promoting three new films, including ""Kill Your Darlings,"" about the early days of the Beat poets and a murder case that united them. In all three of those films, Radcliffe had nude scenes, which served notice of his maturity, sparking stories about how he's all grown up now. A brief history of young adult literature . This, he noted, is something that keeps recurring whenever he, Emma Watson or Rupert Grint do anything adult. ""I see photos in 'The Daily Mail,' photos of Emma in a photo shoot, and it says, 'She's a far cry from Hermione as she shows she's all grown up now!' She's a 24-year-old woman! You wonder how long people can legitimately write that. Basically, we all just have to look old and haggard, but then they'll just write, 'Oh, what happened to Harry? Where did he go?' You can't win."" As for his own ""growing up"" stories, ""I'm aware that it's something people talk about a lot,"" Radcliffe said. ""I was having this conversation with Juno Temple (his co-star in the forthcoming ""Horns""), because you do a couple of these nude scenes, and you get labeled an exhibitionist, which isn't really fair, because you're just doing what's in the script. I've done it three times now (on film), so it's not like it's really a big deal anymore."" Just to curb the enthusiasm over his nude scenes, Radcliffe nixed one for the second season of his TV show, ""A Young Doctor's Notebook,"" in which he plays the younger version of Jon Hamm's character. ""I'd already done nude scenes in the first season, in the bath and a couple of other moments,"" Radcliffe said, ""but there was this one scene in the second season where somebody breaks into my bedroom at night and starts intimidating me. At one point, they were trying to make the young doctor more vulnerable, and they said, 'Would you do it naked?' "" Initially, Radcliffe said yes, because he likes to give writers and directors what they want, but then he had second thoughts, since the nudity wasn't in the script. ""I said, 'Guys, if it's not key to the scene, I don't think I should,'"" he said. ""It was one of those moments where I felt I could say that. 'Is it absolutely key for the young doctor in this scene?' "" In that case, no. But for a later gay sex scene with another partner in ""Kill Your Darlings,"" yes. A little more innocent is his kissing scene with DeHaan in that film, which they hope wins Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards. ""It's a pretty great kiss,"" DeHaan said. ""It's about a person who's really in love with another person, and they aren't allowed to. They don't feel comfortable expressing how they feel about each other. This is the one moment where they let their guards down and finally get to embrace their love for the other person."" At the crux of the film, Allen Ginsberg (played by Radcliffe) falls for Lucien Carr (played by DeHaan), who is attempting to discard past lover -- or stalker, depending on your interpretation -- David Kammerer (played by Dexter's Michael C. Hall). When Carr eventually kills Kammerer (""I got to kill Dexter!"" DeHaan laughed), his defense is that he wasn't gay. ""Homosexuality was criminalized at the time,"" DeHaan said, ""and it was almost like, if you felt you were being pursued in a way you didn't want to be pursued, and if you killed him in self-defense, then you could pretty much get away with murder."" Before the killing, Carr had enlisted Ginsberg to create a sort of manifesto, and it's out of this relationship that the writer in him is born. ""I think most creative people like Allen basically veer between ambition and anxiety, between self-doubt and confidence,"" Radcliffe said. ""I definitely can relate to that, even if I don't have the extremes of confidence he has. He was calling himself a genius in his diary, at the age 14! I would never have said that about myself, even to myself. But we all go through that, 'Am I doing the right thing? Is this what I meant to be doing?' Hopefully in less extreme ways and not under the magnifying glass of a murder investigation."" Radcliffe's own crisis of conscience came when he wondered if he'd be able to continue to grow as an actor. ""I felt like I had been learning a lot through 'Harry Potter,' and then it sort of plateaued at the end,"" he said. But now he feels he's proving to himself and everyone else that he's right where he belongs, making the kinds of ""weird, quirky"" projects that he enjoys, learns from and perhaps couldn't have been made without his participation. On top of all that, he actually gets to make new friends. (He'd like to set up a competitive Scrabble game between Hamm and DeHaan, ""which would be pretty awesome""). ""There's no pressure to do a big franchise or a big blockbuster,"" Radcliffe said. ""But if I said to you now that I don't want to do any action movies, tomorrow I'll get the best action script I've ever read. But I'm not going to be jumping into any young adult fantasy series anytime soon, obviously!""

"Missoula, Montana (CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday denied a motion to dismiss a murder case against a Montana newlywed bride accused of murdering her husband by shoving him off a cliff at Glacier National Park. The ruling followed a surprise appearance on the witness stand by Jordan Linn Graham, who faces first- and second-degree murder charges in the death of her 25-year-old husband, Cody Johnson. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Donald W. Molloy criticized the prosecutors for what he described as ""trial by ambush,"" but said the case will proceed to trial on December 9. Graham, 21, wearing a purple sweater and blue jean blouse, took the stand to testify that doubts about her marriage had escalated into a physical altercation during a trail hike. ""We went on a little stump part and we were in the middle of an argument and he thought I was going to run away,"" said Graham. ""Cody had grabbed me and I thought he was going to push me down,"" she said. ""My first instinct was to get him off."" Graham was indicted last month on charges she intentionally pushed her husband to his death in an angry rage. Her federal public defender Michael Donahoe has asserted in court documents that his death was an accident. Donahoe also accused the government of misconduct related to a series of interrogation interviews the FBI conducted. The part time nanny has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges including making false statements. She remains under house arrest. During her 15 minutes of testimony, Graham accused FBI agent Stacey Smiedala of making her uncomfortable by placing his hand on her knee during an interrogation. ""He held me for five minutes,"" she said. In cross examination, federal prosecutor Kris Mclean showed Graham an affidavit she signed about that unrecorded interview, which lasted an hour and 20 minutes: . ""Under oath you said, 'During the entire time I was in the room by myself with Agent Smiedala, he never took his hands off my knee,'"" McClean said, seeking to underscore the time discrepancy between her testimony and her signed affidavit. ""Yes,"" she replied. ""I guess to my knowledge I did not know it was going to be translated in that manner."" In his testimony about interrogation methods, agent Smiedala denied physically touching Graham's leg, saying he only tried to verbally console her after she broke down in tears after confessing. In a case that has gained national attention, Graham did not initially report the incident. She told local detectives that Johnson had vanished in a dark vehicle the night of July 7 with unknown friends. On July 11, according to an affidavit, Graham led a group of friends and relatives to a popular spot in the park called ""The Loop,"" where they discovered Johnson's body. Only after a FBI agent Smiedala showed her a surveillance photo of the couple entering the gates to Glacier National Park did Graham change her story and confess to pushing him off the ledge. ""She began to cry and I told her, ""I am glad you have been honest,"" the agent said. A polygraph was never conducted and Graham was released until a grand jury indicted her last month. Prior to her interrogation, Graham had signed a polygraph examination consent form and waived her right to remain silent without an attorney. Defense attorneys claimed failure to record the first hour and 20 minutes of the interrogation violated state law. Two subsequent interviews were recorded in which Graham allegedly cited the death as an accident and that she acted in self-defense. Judge Molloy said he would rule on the admissibility of her unrecorded statements at a future date. Prosecutors have theorized that Graham blindfolded her husband before pushing him to his death and then lied to cover up the crime, according to motions filed by the defense. Donahoe, the public defender, has criticized prosecutors for labeling Graham a sociopath, accused them of distorting statements she made, and contended they recorded only those segments of interviews that bolstered the government's case. Donahoe said federal attorneys have not disclosed any evidence of the premeditation alleged in the first-degree murder charge except for mentioning during a recent telephone conference that ""the government now believes Jordan placed a blindfold on Cody before pushing him off the ledge,"" court documents show. The theory is tied to a ""piece of cloth"" found near Johnson's body that investigators have sent for DNA analysis, according to court documents. The case is being prosecuted in federal court because the incident occurred in a national park.","Judge denies motion to dismiss murder charges against Jordan Linn Graham .

"New York (CNN) -- How much would you pay for a bloody sock? A man named Pete Siegal paid $92,613. Admittedly, it wasn't just any old sock. It was the sock worn by Curt Schilling during Game 2 of the 2004 World Series. He pitched for the Boston Red Sox against the St. Louis Cardinals on an injured ankle. ""It's a one-of-a-kind item,"" said Chris Ivy, director of Sports Auctions for Heritage Auctions. The stained white tube sock was sold at auction Saturday night at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion in New York. ""I expected anywhere from $75,000 to many multiples of that. It's the first bloody sock we've sold, and it came in just under what we expected to get for it. I'm happy with the sale,"" Ivy said. Although the auctioned item was worn in the World Series, the blood-stained sock that Schilling had worn five days earlier is arguably an even bigger part of Red Sox lore. That night, the right-hander underwent an impromptu operation so that he could take the mound against Boston's archrival, the New York Yankees, in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. A loss would have sent the Red Sox home for the postseason -- without a championship, as had been the case since 1918 -- while a win would put them on the verge of an unprecedented postseason comeback from a 3-0 deficit, assuming they could take Game 7. They made it thanks largely to Schilling, who was already hobbling after a subpar performance in the series' first game. As blood soaked his white sock, he held the vaunted Yankees lineup to one run and four hits over seven innings. The Red Sox ended up taking their fourth straight game the next day, pummeling New York 10-3, to advance to the World Series. There, they faced St. Louis. Despite his injuries, Schilling started Game 2 and helped lead the Red Sox to a 6-2 win. They ended up sweeping the Cardinals in four straight games, setting off a wave of euphoria in Red Sox Nation, and finally ending the ""Curse of the Bambino."" Siegal, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, said he and his business partners have bought many items over the years and hope to open a museum about the history of baseball. The bloody sock will be a welcome addition. ""It's a very historic item. We also bought, about 10 years ago, the contract that brought Babe Ruth from the Red Sox to the Yankees. That started the 'Curse of the Bambino,' and Schilling's sock had a lot to do with ending it. It's a great combination and it's an honor to have it. To have something that is involved with both is very historic,"" Siegal said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Schilling wore the sock during Game 2 of the 2004 World Series .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Wednesday in Egypt's restive Sinai region, killing 10 soldiers and injuring 31 others who were on their way to the capital on leave. State media reports said a suicide bomber set off the blast as two minibuses carrying infantry soldiers were passing by. Last month, a suicide bomber blew up a car in Egypt's Sinai, killing four security officers and wounding four others. And a bombing that targeted a military intelligence building bordering on the Sinai, wounded at least six soldiers. No claim of responsibility has been reported in Wednesday's attack. Islamist militants have become more active in the Sinai in recent years. The Egyptian revolution of 2011 that toppled strongman President Hosni Mubarak brought a resurgence of Islamists whom his military regime had repressed for decades. This included more moderate factions like the Muslim Brotherhood, which swept into power when Mohamed Morsy became President in Egypt's first democratic elections. But it also included extremists, some suspected of having affiliations with al Qaeda. In the Sinai, they called for the establishment of an Islamist caliphate. The Egyptian military began cracking down on them again. In July, when the military ousted Morsy in a coup, Islamist extremists in the Sinai saw it as an attack against Islam and have stepped up their assaults, particularly against soldiers and military installations. Egypt's Morsy says he's still the legitimate president . CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this story .","The soldiers were headed to the capital on leave .

""I've experienced aborted takeoffs, aborted landings, near misses and passenger deaths on three different flights."" Sure, his status as frequent-flier king earns him royal treatment. But the U.S. commercial airline system often leaves him stranded like millions of other travelers. To deal with potential gridlock from the 1 billion U.S. air passengers expected to crowd the skies by 2021, the FAA is overhauling its traffic system, which has remained largely unchanged for 30 years. The overhaul is called NextGen and components of the air traffic program are already in use or being tested at airports in several U.S. cities including Philadelphia, Houston, Seattle and Louisville, Kentucky. That's none too soon if you ask Stuker, who like many travelers believes the current traffic infrastructure is showing signs of stress. Stuker, who lives in Illinois and New Jersey, usually flies out of Chicago's O'Hare and Newark's Liberty airports bound for Los Angeles or Australia. He's spent countless hours on airport tarmacs waiting to take off -- only to return to the gate when the flight is canceled. ""When I'm sitting in first class, I can't complain,"" he said. But what really frustrates Stuker are flights that fail to arrive on time. ""It's the missing of connections which is so screwed up,"" said Stuker. ""The airline on-time ratings are so low -- even since 9/11 when air traffic went down."" In fact, from 1990 to 2008, the national average for all delayed flights increased from 41 minutes to an hour, according to the Brookings Institution. Millions of consumers are so frustrated with the airline experience that they're avoiding it, and delays are part of the problem. Some 41 million potential fliers chose not to travel by air from May 2007 to May 2008, according to Geoff Freeman of the U.S. Travel Association. That translates into $26.5 billion in lost spending that could have boosted a recession-dogged economy. ""The result is less travel, less spending, fewer American jobs,"" he said. But as the nation emerges from recession, air passenger traffic will explode, say experts. The NextGen overhaul is so complicated and massive that it's often compared to the space race of the 1960s. It will take until at least 2025 to complete and will have an estimated total price of $22 billion. However, long delays and additional costs are threatening to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project, according to the Department of Transportation. When it's done, technology and communication improvements in aircraft and at airports promise to save consumers time, money and headaches. A major pillar of NextGen involves tracking aircraft. Currently, aircraft are tracked by radar, a technology that dates to before World War II. NextGen aims to switch its tracking system to a technology that millions of travelers have had in their pockets for years: global satellite positioning, or GPS. Tracking aircraft by satellite is more accurate than radar. Currently, planes must fly zig-zag routes to stay close to ground-based radar tracking stations. With GPS technology called ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast), planes can be tracked while flying in straight-line routes. These routes are shorter. They save thousands of hours of travel time, millions of gallons of fuel and millions of dollars. ""There are some estimates that flights could be 10% to 20% shorter in the short distances and a few percent better in the long distances,"" said air industry consultant Michael Miller of Miller Air Group. Shorter routes use less fuel, which could cut airline costs. ""It could eventually bring down airfares, but not until the entire system is upgraded,"" Miller said. Southwest Airlines has been using the technology about a year and expects to save $60 million in annual fuel costs by 2020, when ADS-B is mandated for use nationwide. Alaska Airlines has been using GPS-based NextGen technology since the mid-'90s to enable planes to fly safely through mountainous terrain in low visibility weather. This technology, called Required Navigation Performance, allowed Alaska Airlines to avoid canceling low-visibility flights, saving it $15.8 million last year. On the ground, NextGen calls for new cooperative systems between airports, traffic controllers and airlines. Airlines sharing precise information about where their flights are on the tarmac and exactly when aircraft are expected to depart their gates can save up to 4½ minutes per flight in delays, said Mike Romanowski, the FAA's top NextGen official. Travelers may have more flights to choose from on certain routes because of NextGen. More accurate tracking with GPS technology ultimately would allow more aircraft to follow each other safely at closer range. ""But we're not just going to throw capacity where it doesn't make sense,"" warns the Air Transport Association's Tom Hendricks. ""We will be much more able to respond to that consumer demand."" This all sounds like good news to a frequent flier like Stuker, but he knows dealing with congestion won't solve the whole problem. ""Whether a person travels once a year or 300 times a year, it will make their ongoing travel more seamless,"" Stuker speculated. ""But you've still got the problems on the ground. You've still got the actual boarding of the plane and getting in line -- I mean, that's where the frustration comes from, you know?"" Stuker admitted he doesn't spend much time waiting in line these days, thanks to his mega-frequent flier status. When facing a tricky connection, he's greeted at the terminal by helpful golf-cart drivers who whisk him to his next flight. If the connection is really tight, the airline will actually escort Stuker directly from the plane to the tarmac where a vehicle will drive him to his next gate. ""They treat me like I own the airport,"" he said. But Stuker is quick to remind himself that he's not too disconnected from his coach-class traveler days. Increased capacity and demand could affect even him. Airports say they're watching developments carefully. Officials at the nation's busiest airport, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson, don't know when the FAA plans to unveil NextGen there. But they don't expect to see it reduce aircraft delays for many years. The clock is ticking. Takeoffs and landings at U.S. airports are expected to top 69 million in 20 years. Stuker said he expects to cross the 10-million-mile mark sometime in August. When NextGen takes hold, he'll still be dreaming of his favorite destination in the entire world: ""home."" If NextGen goes as planned, he'll get there quicker and arrive on time. This is part one of a three-part series of stories surrounding the FAA's ""NextGen"" overhaul of the U.S. air traffic system. Check back on Wednesday for more on the technology involved and how it might be used in other fields.

"(CNN) -- A new program that allows American fliers to avoid pre-flight pat-downs by submitting to one-off security vetting is proving successful, and is set to expand, says the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The scheme, known as ""Precheck,"" allows pre-approved passengers to pass through airport security much the same way they would have done prior to September 11, 2001. The green-lighted travelers pass through a different lane for security screening, without being made to take off their shoes or jackets, or remove their laptop and bags of liquid from their luggage. TSA spokesman Greg Soule said more than 540,000 people had used Precheck since it was introduced in four American airports late last year. It has since been rolled out to seven more, and will be available in 35 airports by the end of the year. While it is currently only available on Delta or American Airlines flights, it will soon be expanded to include U.S. Airways, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines. ""It's helping us to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to security, with a goal of providing the most effective security in the most efficient way possible,"" said Soule. See also: Budget airlines go long haul . The idea is that by removing low-risk, pre-screened people from the main security lines, security resources could be concentrated more closely on potential threats. ""We want to be able to focus on passengers we know less about,"" Soule said. Passengers in Precheck are passing through airports much more quickly, and the scheme may also reduce the costs of security screening as it expanded, he added. There are currently two ways into the program, which is only open to American citizens. Frequent fliers who meet certain security criteria -- which TSA would not disclose ""for security reasons"" -- may be invited by their airlines to join at no charge, provided they pass certain background checks. But U.S. citizens can also join by applying for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Global Entry program -- a ""trusted traveler"" scheme in which individuals sign up to be vetted in order to expedite the customs process on arrival into the country from abroad. John Wagner, CBP's executive director for admissibility and passenger programs, said applicants for Global Entry paid a $100 fee and were accepted into the program for five years if they passed the security vetting. CBP assesses their residence and employment histories, as well as any criminal record or national-security concerns, before interviewing the applicant and taking fingerprints. ""They're disqualified if there's any derogatory information,"" he said. See also: Goodbye maps, hello travel apps . He added that applications to Global Entry had increased about 50% since it was announced that members would be able to use Precheck, demonstrating the interest from passengers in the service. ""We've seen overwhelming support for this,"" said Wagner. Soule said the more pragmatic approach to security screening was also reflected in new approaches to young and elderly passengers. New protocols towards passengers aged 12 and under have been put in place that will reduce the number of pat-downs and allow them to keep their shoes on as they pass through security. A pilot program was in place in four airports trialling similar measures for those aged 75 and over, he said. Precheck passengers who displayed suspicious behavior would still be subjected to full security checks. Kate Hanni, executive director of airline consumer group Flyersrights.org, said she welcomed the Precheck scheme and urged it to be expanded to ""create a very large list of low-risk travelers that can move quickly through security."" ""We're thrilled. But it's sort of a 'What took you so long?'"" she said. ""We believe it should be expanded to every airport in the nation and they should stop treating every airline passenger as if they are terrorists."" The $100 fee to apply to use Precheck through the Global Entry pathway was not a concern, she said. ""As someone who travels very frequently, $100 for the speed with which you can move through security and retain your dignity is a small price to pay.""","Precheck scheme gives some U.S. flyers fast track through airport security .

"(CNN)  -- Spurred by the continuing political unrest in Iran, more than two dozen Iranian expatriate superstars are uniting to spread a musical message of non-violent resistance. Neda Agha-Soltan was gunned down on a Tehran street on June 20. The entertainers, poets, thinkers and actors are harmonizing on the song ""United for Neda,"" a call to action against human rights violations by the Iranian government against Iranians protesting the disputed outcome of recent presidential elections. The song was inspired by the plight of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year old Iranian woman who was fatally shot on the streets of Tehran on June 20. The ordeal was recorded on cell phone video and received international attention when it hit the Internet. ""When I saw links to Neda being shot, it was so disturbing to me,"" said Iranian-British recording artist Mams Taylor, who wrote and produced the song. ""It hurt me, angered me and touched me at the same time, to think that these people are so courageous to go and seek their freedom,"" said Taylor. While her death became a rallying point for justice, her name, ""Neda,"" in Farsi means ""the call/calling"" or ""voice"" -- a voice many people say cannot be muted. ""The saga is still going on in Iran, and all we can do is carry on and echo their voice,"" said Shoreh Aghdashloo, the Oscar-nominated actress from ""House of Sand and Fog"" who sang in the production. The video, much like the post-election protests, was a spontaneous response. From the studio to the street rallies in Los Angeles, California, the entire music video was filmed using a cell phone. ""With the big media ban and restrictions over there, we thought to commemorate and pay homage to what the protesters are doing over there,"" said Taylor. ""So we thought it would be appropriate to develop the video in the same kind of light.""  Watch the video and hear the song » . The song was recorded in both English and Farsi to reach Western and Iranian audiences. The English version of the video has drawn thousands of viewers since its YouTube release last week. The Farsi version of the song will be released Thursday. Iranian actress Shila Vosough played a key role in bringing the artists together. ""These artists all came together despite their varying political views,"" she said. ""They united, hand-in-hand, to send the kids in Iran a message of their love and support."" The political upheaval of the late 1970s forced many Iranian musicians, artists, actors and entertainers like Vosough into exile. Many of them left unwillingly, not knowing when or if they would ever return to Iran. ""I came to New York for a performance 32 years ago and have never been back to Iran since,"" said Iranian vocalist Sattar, who also sang in the video. Sattar, who has millions of fans around the world, wants the Iranian people to know their voices are being heard. ""As an artist, I see this as my responsibility -- to support Iranians with my songs and music,"" said Sattar, a one-time favorite of the Pahlavi royal family in Iran. In 1979, at the dawn of the Islamic Republic under much popular Western music was outlawed as ""un-Islamic."" For years, Iranians have been forced to make music underground, buying or swapping on the black market or downloading from the Internet. ""Music is a very powerful tool. It can move people and mobilize them around a cause, and this can be very threatening for leaders who want to silence the voices of their people,"" said Iranian singer Dariush. Dariush has been singing about love, peace, freedom and justice for the Iranian people since before he left 30 years ago. ""I encourage other musicians to come join the cause against human rights violations in Iran and other places around the world,"" said Dariush. Female singers were also banned after the revolution. For decades female vocalists like Googoosh, one of the most celebrated pop divas in Iran, were silenced and forbidden to perform or record in Iran. In 2000, Googoosh left Iran. Shortly afterward, she made a comeback on the international stage, performing in front of sold-out crowds at venues around the world. Her latest release, ""Man Hamoon Iranam,"" or ""I Am the Same Iran,"" is also dedicated to the young Iranians who died in the unrest. Scores of musicians have tuned into the cause, showing support both in performance and on the Internet. Just last week in Barcelona, Spain, the band U2 dedicated the song ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" to the Iranian people and performed under a green-lit banner as Farsi lyrics scrolled up the screen. The opposition in Iran has adopted green as its unifying color. Other Iran-related videos that went viral on YouTube are the remake of ""Stand By Me"" by Iranian singer Andy and American rockers Bon Jovi; Joan Baez's ""We Shall Overcome"" tribute; and Wyclef Jean's performance of ""Equal Rights and Justice."" ""I hope the Iranians realize that here in the West there are people supporting and backing their movement to seek freedom, and we would like to motivate them to keep going,"" said Mams Taylor. ""The world has lost many Nedas, most of them the world will never know,"" said Dariush. ""There are many Nedas out there whose voices can't be heard, there are Nedas in prisons that are being tortured, there are Nedas screaming in the streets --walking the fine line between life and death everyday. But she has become the symbol for all of them.""","Mams Taylor, other artists join together to produce ""United for Neda""

"(CNN) -- Investigators probably will have to use dental records to identify some of the eight people who were killed in a wreck involving a church bus and two other vehicles in eastern Tennessee, a Tennessee Highway Patrol official said Thursday. Some of the bodies in Wednesday's crash were burned or otherwise made unrecognizable, hindering authorities' ability to notify all of the victims' families about the deaths, highway patrol Sgt. Bill Miller said. ""The crash is so horrific ... it's probably the worst that I have seen in my career ... and I've worked in several, several counties in my"" 17 years on the job, Miller said. More from CNN affiliate WBIR . The bus, owned by a North Carolina church, was carrying a group of seniors on their way back home from a religious conference when one of its tires malfunctioned, sending the bus across a median on Interstate 40 and crashing into an SUV and a tractor-trailer, authorities said. Church bus was carrying seniors home from a jubilee . Eight people were killed: Six on the eastbound bus; one of three occupants of the SUV, and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said. Two of the 14 other people who were hospitalized after the wreck had been released by Thursday morning, said Travis Brickey, a representative of the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Two people were in critical condition; seven were in serious condition, and three were in stable condition, Brickey said. None of the victims' names was released. The church group -- about 18 people including the driver, Miller said -- was returning to the Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville, North Carolina, after attending the 17th annual Fall Jubilee conference in Gatlinburg.

The wreck happened about 2 p.m. Wednesday in Jefferson County, about 40 miles east of Knoxville, the Tennessee Department of Safety said. Miller said it wasn't clear exactly what happened to the bus tire, other than it malfunctioned or failed in some way. The bus swerved across a grassy median and struck the SUV before hitting the tractor-trailer, he said. The bus came to rest on its side, pinning some of its occupants, he said. More from CNN affiliate WATE . Video from the site showed smoke rising from the tractor-trailer. Some people walked out of the bus on their own, but emergency personnel had to extricate others, Miller said.

"London (CNN) -- British police have decided not to press any charges against the elderly couple who had been unknowingly cultivating a huge cannabis plant in their garden. The plant was seized Monday in Bedfordshire, central England. The police later posted a picture on Twitter with comments: ""Elderly couple bought shrub at car boot sale,"" adding that it was the ""biggest cannabis plant we had seen!!"" The police picture posted on Twitter shows a fully grown shrub with thick foliage in the front garden. A police spokeswoman told CNN: ""The plant was mistakenly bought by the elderly couple. We will not be pressing any charges. We have seized it and will dispose it."" She also said that unlike what has been reported in some newspapers there was no ""raid.""' ""The property was not raided,"" she said. The police tweet, however, led to many comical reactions including on newspapers sites that carried the story. A Mail Online reader commented: ""Don't buy 'pot' plants at car boot sales! Simples."" Cannabis is classified as a Class B drug in Britain under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The maximum penalty for supplying or producing cannabis is 14 years imprisonment and/or unlimited fine. The cannabis plant has psychoactive compounds with mood and behavior-altering properties. The plant is used both for making recreational drugs and medicine. Organized crime gangs have often used in-house cannabis farms to produce the high-strength ""skunk"" version of the drug.","British police: Elderly couple unknowingly cultivated cannabis plant in garden .

"New York (CNN) -- A cigarette smuggling scheme that cost New York state millions of dollars in sales tax revenue may have raised funds for militant groups, authorities said. Sixteen Palestinian men, some with ties to convicted terrorists, were indicted Thursday in the alleged scheme that spans New York, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and New Jersey states. Investigators say they uncovered $55 million in illegal cigarette sales. Although it is unclear where the illicit proceeds ended up, similar schemes have funded organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, according to Ray Kelly, commissioner of the New York Police Department. ""This case started because we were being vigilant about terrorism,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""We discovered that individuals who were on our radar for links to known terrorists were engaged in a massive raid on the New York Treasury in the form of cigarette tax avoidance."" One of the suspects had financial ties to Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind cleric serving a life sentence for a conspiracy to blow up New York City landmarks. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said authorities are still working to trace the ""astounding profits"" generated by the scheme. A family affair . Basel Ramadan, 42, of Ocean City, Maryland, ran the operation, authorities said. With his brother, Samir Ramadan, 40, they allegedly obtained cigarettes from a wholesaler in Virginia and smuggled the untaxed cartons to a storage facility in Delaware. The lucrative business of cigarette smuggling . Adel Abuzahrieh, 42, of Brooklyn, would allegedly drive from New York to the storage facility several times a week with tens of thousands of dollars in cash to be exchanged for untaxed cartons of cigarettes. The cigarettes were then distributed and sold. The state of New York lost more than $80 million in sales tax revenue, Schneiderman said. New York state imposes a tax of $4.35 per pack of cigarettes. New York City adds a tax of $1.50 per pack. In addition to lost revenue, officials were concerned about the suspects' ties to convicted terrorists. Links to convicted terrorist? ""The association of some of the suspects in this case to Ari Halberstam's killer, the 'Blind Sheikh,' and a top Hamas official concerned us gravely,"" Kelly said. Authorities said one of the ring's alleged distributors, Yousef Odeh, 52, had strong financial ties to Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian-born cleric known as the Blind Sheikh. ""Odeh also had a business selling baby formula. And one of his investors in the 1990s was Omar Abdel-Rahman,"" Kelly said in a statement. Another alleged distributor, Muaffaq Askar, was closely connected to Pashid Baz, the Lebanese immigrant who fired on a car full of Hasidic students on the Brooklyn Bridge in 1994, killing Halberstam. Baz referred to Askar as his ""Palestinian Uncle."" The 16 men arrested Wednesday were the Ramadan brothers, who were the alleged boss and treasurer of the enterprise, nine distributors, four resellers and one transporter. ""The proceeds from this alleged scheme can be used to fund a host of other criminal acts that threaten national security and public safety of Americans at home and abroad,"" said James T. Hayes Jr., special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. Money stuffed in garbage bags . Investigators said they seized three handguns from Basel Ramadan, as well as $1.4 million from his residence, some of which was stuffed into black plastic garbage bags. More than 20,000 cartons of cigarettes were also taken from defendants' homes, cars and storage facilities in four states, authorities said. At least $200,000 in cash was seized from defendants in New York City alone, officials said. Each of the suspects was charged with enterprise corruption, as well as other criminal acts in connection to the alleged untaxed cigarette scheme. If found guilty, each faces eight to 25 years in prison.","Officials: The cigarette scheme cost New York state at least $80 million in sales tax revenue .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia couple were charged Tuesday in the starvation death of their 3-year-old daughter, who weighed only 11 pounds, according to police. ""I saw the photos, they were extremely disturbing,"" Philadelphia Police Homicide Capt. James Clark said of the girl at a news conference Monday. Carlos Rivera, 30, and Carmen Ramirez, 27, brought their unresponsive daughter, Nathlayz Rivera, to Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia early Monday morning, where the child was pronounced dead at 1:59 a.m., according to Officer Jillian Russell. Rivera and Ramirez were arraigned Tuesday afternoon on charges of third-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child, according to Philadelphia District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson. Both parents are being held without bail, and their next court date is scheduled for September 25, Jamerson said. According to officials at the Criminal Justice Information Center in Philadelphia, Rivera and Ramirez do not have legal representation and it's unclear when they will. Four other children -- ages 9, 8, 7 and Nathlayz's 3-year-old twin -- lived at the couple's residence. The children were taken to a local hospital where they were examined and then transported to the Philadelphia Department of Human Services on Monday, Russell said. The mother told detectives that Nathlayz had Down syndrome, police told CNN affiliate WPVI. According to Dr. Nicole Avena, a weight loss specialist at the New York Obesity Research Center, a typical weight range for a 3-year-old girl of average height is between 30 and 35 pounds. But it is not unusual for a child with disabilities to have feeding difficulties, which can lead to weight loss if not appropriately handled by a pediatrician, Avena said.

"(CNN) -- A Thai Airways plane that skidded off the runway while landing at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Sunday night had its logos blacked out by workers after the accident. More: Thai Airways plane skids off runway, 13 injured . After touching down in Bangkok at 11:20 p.m., the Airbus A330-300 aircraft, which departed from Guangzhou, China, suffered a landing gear malfunction that caused it to slide off the runway, according to the airline. No passengers were reported injured during the actual landing, although 13 received minor injuries during the evacuation and were taken to hospital, the airline said. After the accident, workers on a crane painted over the Thai Airways logo on the tail and body of the aircraft in black. Known as the ""crisis communication rule,"" the practice of obscuring logos was a recommendation from Star Alliance -- of which Thai Airways is a member -- to protect the airline's image, an airline official initially said. However, Star Alliance denied the claims. ""The Star Alliance crisis communications policy does not state that logos are to covered,"" in the event of an accident, a spokesman for the airline group, Markus Ruediger, told CNN. Thai Airways later issued a statement ""clarifying"" its policy. ""Though Thai generally practices the de-identifying of an aircraft after an incident ... the company also clarifies that this is not a Star Alliance policy."" Established in 1997, Star Alliance is a global airline network with 28 member airlines. ""Standard practice"" draws criticism . Judging from the attention -- even derision -- Thai Airway's actions have attracted in this case, the effort to protect the airline's image seems to have had the opposite of its intended effect. Attention on Twitter quickly focused as much on the obscuring of the logos as on the accident itself. One tweet questioned whether this was the ""Most bizarre piece of corporate spin ever?"" ""Cover up that tail,"" another post joked. Landing gear malfunction . Thai Airways was investigating the cause of the accident on Sunday night, the airline said. ""After touchdown at Suvarnabhumi Airport, the landing gear malfunctioned and caused the aircraft to skid off the runway,"" said president of Thai Airways, Sorajak Kasemsuvan, in a statement on the company's website. ""Sparks were noticed from the vicinity of the right landing gear near the engine; the matter is under investigation."" Airbus said it is awaiting further information on the event before it can comment. ""We are dispatching a team of experts to support both the investigation authorities and Thai Airways,"" the company told CNN. Second incident in fortnight . The incident is the second in two weeks for Thai Airways. At least 39 passengers were injured after an Airbus A380 with 500 passengers from Bangkok hit severe turbulence during its approach into Hong Kong International Airport on August 30.

"(CNN) -- A few million iPhone users woke up to a new operating system this week, the much-heralded iOS 7, the biggest change in Apple's smartphone operating system since the phone was first released in 2007. It's a different look and feel, for sure. But for those who may fear having to learn some whole new way of using a phone, rest assured: Not much has been fundamentally altered. It's still very much the same operating system you've made a part of your life. That's really the news here: Apple is taking its users one baby step toward the next mobile platform. And while it may indicate something about where Apple hopes to bring smartphone interfaces in the future, this incremental step may say more about Apple's diminishing ability to make changes in our computing lives by decree. Back in the Steve Jobs era, Apple could force its dedicated user base to go anywhere Steven told them. The original, VW Bug-inspired iMac was the first major desktop that did not offer a floppy drive. Users grumbled and panicked, but they did as Steven told them, and now we live in a world where many readers don't even know what a floppy drive is. Then Steve took away serial ports, and so on, continually forcing new changes on Apple users for their own good. Consumers even lined up to purchase the iPad on Steve's command; they didn't have any real need for the thing but trusted that Steve knew best. The ongoing success of the tablet seems to suggest that he did. Apple's new operating system doesn't ask users to make such a leap of faith. Yes, the new iOS is brighter and more colorful and the icons are simpler and less three-dimensional. It looks like a new phone. And the fonts are more streamlined and communicative. Instead of using lines to separate things, font shapes and sizes are used more effectively to delineate items in lists -- making everything a bit more airy. Most significantly, the ""things"" depicted in the new OS look less like things. There are no little binders drawn on notebooks, no details on buttons, no leatherette address book and no shadows behind pages. If anything, Apple is weaning us off the metaphorical desktop, trying to bring us into a virtual universe where we no longer depend on the familiar anchors of the ""real"" world to relate effectively to our applications. On a smartphone, an address book is not really an address book, after all. It's an application that lets us search through data about our contacts. A notepad is not a pad with paper; it is a way of saving text. While the real world metaphors initially helped us understand what all these things were for, apps needn't be bound by the limits of real world devices. For the computing world to develop further, it needs to be freed of the obligation to do everything in ways that reflect real world processes. Perhaps surprisingly, Microsoft already accomplished this last year. With nothing to lose, the company worked with Nokia to develop a smartphone and tablet operating system called Metro that no longer has a desktop, as we traditionally think of it. Instead of depicting icons against a background, Metro breaks the screen up into tiles that deliver live feeds of whatever is happening in the apps. Streams of tweets, incoming e-mails or changing weather all flow from their tiles in real time. Meanwhile, the apps themselves, once opened, have almost no lines or grids in them at all. The incoming e-mail list (there's no in ""box"" anymore) is broken up with space, not lines. Everything is accomplished with innovative font selection and sizing. Microsoft's operating system represents the future of computing. It was also a market failure, at least in the short run. That's because Microsoft doesn't have the power or charisma to demand that users follow it into the unknown. People followed Steve Jobs because they believed in his vision -- even if they didn't know what it was. Microsoft doesn't enjoy that benefit of the doubt. But today, without Jobs, neither does Apple. That's why -- instead of dragging us kicking and screaming into the future Microsoft has already developed -- Apple is trying to lead us there one easy step at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Apple's new iOS represents incremental step into future .

"(CNN) -- Why should we care about what Sinead O'Connor says to Miley Cyrus? When a 1990s hitmaker tells a former Disney Channel darling to stop ""pimping"" herself (or allowing herself to be pimped), does that have any bearing on our lives?

"(CNN) -- A former Florida A&M football player fatally shot by police in Charlotte, North Carolina, was clearly seeking help after a car wreck -- and video from the squad car's dashboard camera will prove it, an attorney for the man's family said Wednesday. Officer Randall Kerrick shot the unarmed Jonathan Ferrell, 24, last month after a woman -- home alone with her 1-year-old child -- called 911 and reported that someone was trying to break down her front door. Ferrell had wrecked his car down the street and had simply gone to the nearest home seeking help, family attorney Chris Chestnut said. ""I completely understand her situation. She's at home by herself, 2 in the morning, with a baby. I completely understand that she was frightened,"" Chestnut said. ""But had she taken the time to just speak through the door and find out what was going on, rather than say, 'He's trying to rob me' or 'He's trying to beat down the door,' I think she would've had a different understanding."" The woman initially opened the door, Chestnut said, questioning why she would report a home invasion. Had Ferrell been an intruder, he would have burst into her home when she opened the door, he said. 911 call: A plea for help before police officer shoots unarmed man . But the attorney was quick to say he wasn't judging the woman or her actions. Still, he said, it was ""unconscious bias"" that led to Ferrell's death. According to the 911 tape, the woman told a dispatcher, ""I need help!"" ""There's a guy breaking in my front door,"" she continued. ""He's trying to kick it down."" Her reaction was understandable, Chestnut said, but Kerrick's was not. ""The onus isn't on the homeowner. The onus really here is on the officer, because it's the officer's job. He's a trained professional. She's a citizen. She can panic. An officer cannot,"" Chestnut said. Kerrick was charged with felony voluntary manslaughter, meaning he is accused of either using excessive force in self-defense or shooting Ferrell without the intent to kill him. Kerrick turned himself in September 14, the day of the shooting, and was released the following day on $50,000 bond. ""We are confident that at the resolution of this case, it will be found that Officer Kerrick's actions were justified on the night in question,"" his attorney, Michael Greene, said. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department did not concur, releasing a statement calling the shooting unlawful. ""The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,"" police said in a statement the day of the shooting. ""Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter."" The statement further said, ""It has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization."" Police used the words ""charged,"" ""ran"" and ""advanced"" in describing Ferrell's interaction with police. But Chestnut said the young man merely walked ""briskly"" toward them and surmised that Ferrell was relieved police had arrived to help him. An officer tried to subdue Ferrell with a stun gun but was ""unsuccessful,"" police have said. Kerrick opened fire after that. A video from a dashboard camera will show Kerrick committed ""cold-blooded murder,"" Chestnut said, demanding that the tape be released to the public. ""The public should see the video ... because it tells the story better than anyone,"" he said. About a block away from the shooting, Ferrell's car was wrecked so severely that ""he was lucky to have survived,"" Chestnut said. Police told local media that Ferrell had to crawl out the back window of the vehicle. Describing the incident allegedly caught by the dashboard camera, Chestnut said Ferrell was on the sidewalk when police arrived. Ferrell walked toward them, he said. ""Even if they suspected that he was robbing the house from the 911 call, most robbers run the other way when law enforcement comes,"" the attorney said. Two lasers hit Ferrell's chest before the 24-year-old raised his hands, ""like, wait,"" Chestnut said, further describing the tape. It wasn't clear if the laser were sights from the stun gun or a firearm. Without any verbal warning from police, four shots were fired, then there was a pause before six more gunshots, and another pause before the final two rounds, the attorney said. Ten of those 12 bullets hit Ferrell, killing him instantly, Chestnut said. ""That's not a scared officer. That's someone intending to kill,"" he said, saying he believes a jury will agree, as it's ""unprecedented"" for police to arrest one of their own so swiftly after a shooting. Family members have said Ferrell was a happy, outgoing guy, who loved Winnie the Pooh as a child. The former gymnast, football player and FAMU chemistry major was working two jobs at the time of the shooting, his mother, Georgia, has said. His fiancee, Cache Heidel, told CNN on Wednesday that Ferrell had been out with friends from one of those jobs, at Best Buy, the night he was shot. Heidel described Ferrell as someone who was always joking and finding ways to make people smile. His demeanor was so gentle and caring, she said, that she nicknamed him ""Sweets."" ""He's always a joy to be around. He cared so much for other people, more so than himself,"" she said. She said she hopes Kerrick is convicted and that her fiance's death will spur dialogue across the nation. ""That is a hope I have, that his death will resound for a country that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive and accepting everyone for who they are,"" she said. Chestnut, who said the family would file a civil suit, also expressed hope that the release of the police video would yield a teachable moment. ""There are other police departments, there are other officers, there are other people who can learn from this video, especially in the day of 'stand your ground,'"" the lawyer said. CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.","Attorney asks why police would think Jonathan Ferrell was robber when he approached .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities intensified their investigation Tuesday into a mystery at Los Angeles International Airport: Who's behind the explosions of dry ice in containers for two days in a row? For the moment, police say they don't believe terrorism is at work. No injuries have been reported in the explosions. ""This appears to be an internal job, maybe a labor dispute or a prank,"" said Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. ""But we do take this very seriously. This is along the lines of planting a pipe bomb. ""It's a destructive device. The detonation or possession of a destructive device is a felony,"" Downing added. The incidents demonstrated that LAX has vulnerabilities, Downing said. The airport is the sixth busiest in the world and third busiest in the United States, according to its website. ""I think it does reveal a vulnerability that we're gonna shore up and that is that you have cameras in public access areas,"" Downing said. ""We should also have cameras in restricted access areas to maintain the integrity of the security system."" Los Angeles police Detective Gus Villanueva said there's ""no nexus to terrorism at this point."" The FBI has been called in, though Los Angeles police are the lead investigating agency, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller. ""There's no established motive based on the evidence, and there is no articulated threat associated with the various incidents. Until a suspect or suspects are identified, it would be difficult to comment on motive,"" Eimiller said. When asked if the explosions were a prank, she said: ""There are many reasonable theories in a situation like this, and none have been ruled out."" Dry ice, which is carbon dioxide in solid form, is used as a refrigerant for meats and ice cream, especially when shipped in a box. When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor. The more recent incident occurred at 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, airport police said. CNN affiliate KCAL said the blast took place in an employee restroom, inaccessible to nonemployees. Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, Villanueva said. Police and bomb experts cleared the scene by about 9:45 p.m., KCAL reported. There were no injuries, and no flights were delayed. On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom at the airport, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said. No injuries were reported, and Terminal 2 resumed operations after a brief evacuation. The airport has nine terminals.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 28-year-old baggage handler accused in two dry ice explosions at Los Angeles International Airport pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of possession of a destructive device in a public place. Dicarlo Bennett of Paramount, California, continues to be held on $1 million bail, but a bail review hearing will be held October 23. The court entered the not guilty pleas on the defendant's behalf. Conviction on both charges carries a sentence of up to six years in county jail, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. A prosecutor told the court he is still obtaining surveillance video from the airport. Defense attorney Ben Wasserman told reporters after the arraignment that Bennett was removing dry ice from a plane's holding area because he was told the vapors were dangerous to an animal being transported in the cargo hold. ""His intent in taking the dry ice from the hold was not the intent to make a destructive device,"" Wasserman said. ""One of the other crew members said take the dry ice out or do something with the dry ice because the carbon dioxide is harmful to the animal, so he took the dry ice out. ""I just don't think that he should be charged with this offense, but hopefully we will be able to prove that,"" Wasserman added.

"(CNN) -- Regina Lopez ran up the stairs near her home in Long Beach, California. She hated her thighs. She hated her butt. If other early-morning exercisers had wandered by, they would have heard her whispering to the fat on her legs: ""Go away. You're going to go away."" Lopez pictured herself as a smaller person -- someone who was able to go shopping and buy the cute clothes she saw on the thrift store hangers. The mental image pushed her to do the beach stairs again despite the rising temperature. Bad habits from an early age . Lopez and her siblings lived primarily with their grandmother when they were young. Once a month, Grammita bought groceries with money from her pension and Social Security check. ""The first of the month I would chow down,"" Lopez remembers, because ""by the end of the month we would be barely having anything."" ""Growing up poor, living off rice and beans -- if we were lucky -- had a big impact on our eating habits,"" says Lopez's younger sister, Francine Hernandez. ""No one ever told Regina and I to 'eat your vegetables.' "" Lopez used to steal cookies out of her cousins' cupboards when she went to visit them. As the sisters got older, they started playing outside less and drinking more. They took money they earned working to splurge on the dollar menu at McDonald's. ""I developed an addiction to eating junk,"" Lopez says simply. These bad habits carried into adulthood. Lopez ordered fast food for lunch every day with her co-workers. She never exercised and hated vegetables. Once in a while she attempted to lose weight, sometimes dropping 10 or 20 pounds. But something always made her sabotage her efforts. She figured her obesity was hereditary -- her aunts were all ""short, chubby little ladies with big boobs. And that's what I was."" Creative by nature, Lopez expressed her growing unhappiness in journals. She'd draw photos of a fat woman crying, with word bubbles that said things such as ""I'm huge, and I hate myself."" What she hated most was shopping for clothes. She longed to buy the cute outfits she saw at swap meets or in stores but could only fit into what she calls the ""Golden Girl""-type dresses sold in her size: 22/24. At 4 feet 11 inches, Lopez weighed 224 pounds. Challenge accepted . Lopez talked with her Art Supply Warehouse co-worker Sarah Nelson often about losing weight. In November 2011, Nelson's mother underwent heart valve replacement surgery. It was the wake-up call Nelson needed to change her eating and exercise habits. The friends decided to start an office weight-loss competition. Lopez was embarrassed stepping up to the scale for the first time in May 2012 -- ""No one wants to show that they weigh 224 pounds in front of guys"" -- but the number that flashed on the scale simply reinforced her commitment. She and Nelson began walking on their 10-minute breaks and sharing healthy recipes they found online. Lopez also used the Lose It! app to track her calorie intake. She exercised six days a week, walking on the beach for four miles or running the stairs. It was hardest at social gatherings with her friends; they'd be drinking beer and eating burgers, while Lopez tried to stick with skinless chicken breasts and vegetables. ""My friends still love to have parties,"" she says. ""I'm kind of like an old lady. I come home, work out, eat dinner, watch 'Golden Girls' and go to sleep."" By the end of the challenge, Lopez had lost 49 pounds. She had also lost the competition -- the winner beat her by losing just 1% more of his body weight. ""I totally cried,"" she remembers with a laugh. ""I wasn't trying to be a sore loser, but I think I worked my butt off."" Before that fateful day, Lopez swore to Nelson she would celebrate the end of the competition with a large, cheesy pizza. ""I never got that pizza."" 'You are tiny' When Lopez showed up at her family's annual Thanksgiving dinner in 2012, she was wearing jeans for the first time in years. She was also wearing a top that was way too big for her, says Hernandez, her sister. Lopez went shopping a few months later and called her sister to tell her the good news: She now fit into a small shirt size. ""I said, 'Regina, I told you. You are tiny,' "" Hernandez recalls. ""It took me forever to get used to seeing Regina so small."" Since May 2012, Lopez has lost 97 pounds. She currently weighs 127 pounds -- just two pounds short of her goal weight. She still walks or runs or climbs stairs six days a week. And on Saturdays she ""treasure hunts"" at the swap meet, browsing through the $1 clothing tables. ""I literally always dreamed about buying clothes and feeling good because they fit,"" she says. ""Now it's my reality. It's an amazing feeling."" Nelson, who has also lost close to 50 pounds, says, ""Regina has always been beautiful inside and out. But now her health is better than ever. She looks wonderful."" Have you lost weight?

"(CNN) -- A smokejumper in Idaho died in a parachuting accident Friday, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Mark T.

"(CNN) -- The effects of the U.S. federal government shutdown are threatening to ripple out into the solar system. NASA's next mission to Mars, due to launch next month, is in danger of being delayed. ""We are just inside of seven weeks to launch and we are shut down,"" Bruce Jakosky, the head of the mission, said late Wednesday. The project, known as Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), aims to put a spacecraft in orbit around the Red Planet to study how it lost much of its atmosphere and became a desolate world. Scientists find evidence of supervolcanoes on Mars . MAVEN is currently scheduled to take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on November 18 and has a 20-day launch window. If it misses that opportunity, the team will have to wait more than two years for their next chance to launch, according to Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Large parts of the U.S. government began shutting down early Tuesday, and there is so far little sign of a solution to the political crisis that caused the stoppages. The shutdown has already had an effect on preparations for the Mars mission, with a launch dress rehearsal and mission readiness review canceled this week, Jakosky said. The mission has some margin for delays in its schedule, he said, but ""every day is gold. We hate to give up margin days."" Water discovered in Martian soil . When the shutdown started to become a real prospect, MAVEN scientists began talking to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland in the hope that their project would be exempt, Jakosky said. But it wasn't. Opinion: Shutdown a huge waste and cost to science . If the paralysis drags on, the setback to the project could be more than just a 26 month wait for the next launch window. ""The MAVEN mission is studying the sun's impact on the Mars upper atmosphere,"" Jakosky said. ""Launching in this window places them at a solar maximum, for the greatest impacts of the sun's effect on Mars' upper atmosphere. The next window, if they are forced to launch, would put the spacecraft's arrival at solar minimum."" NASA grounded by shutdown .","Seven weeks before the planned launch, ""we are shutdown,"" says project leader .

In an update issued Thursday evening, the council said 21 people were missing -- all of them in Bohol. The quake was centered about 620 kilometers (385 miles) south-southeast of Manila, near Catigbian, and its depth was 20 kilometers (12 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Philippines disaster council gave the quake a slightly higher rating: 7.2 magnitude. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . Landslides were reported in some areas. Nearly 3,000 houses were destroyed and another 16,000 were damaged in Bohol and Cebu, officials reported.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two steps forward, one step back. A surge of optimism on Monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a U.S. default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a White House meeting between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders. In a brief statement, the White House said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold ""to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress"" toward a solution. It was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to finish an agreement that could win approval in the Senate and the House. 7 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Negotiations heated up with the Democratic and Republican leaders signaling progress. Both Reid and McConnell took to the Senate floor to express optimism for a compromise on the twin priorities that they expected to be reasonable and acceptable to both sides. Reid's tone remained positive as night fell over the Capitol. ""We've made tremendous progress,"" he said, saying that ""everyone just needs to be patient"" and that ""perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day."" Key negotiators also maintained an upbeat posture and financial markets, which Washington is watching very closely considering their volatility over the political impasse, also ended the day higher with Wall Street heartened by news of a possible deal, especially on the debt limit. At the same time, both sides noted that nothing had been finalized and the postponement of the meeting between congressional leaders and Obama and Vice President Joe Biden raised a new question mark in the process. Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown . During a visit Monday to a local food pantry, Obama cited progress in the Senate negotiations but also warned of what he called continued partisan brinkmanship by House Republicans who ""continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shut down or by threatening default."" ""My hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours,"" Obama said. Shutdown drags on . The failure of Congress to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on October 1. Another deadline looms on Thursday, when the Treasury says it will need Congress to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government's bills. During his visit to Martha's Table in Washington, Obama said the congressional leaders could ""solve this problem today."" The crisis with an on/off switch . He warned that a default, in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as Social Security checks, ""could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy."" ""We've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown,"" he said. ""That damage would be greatly magnified if we don't make sure that government's paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week."" The Treasury Department said it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. As reported by CNN's Dana Bash and CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, the main sticking point involves how long an agreement would fund the government to end the shutdown and increase the debt limit. Democrats want the debt ceiling increase to extend as long as possible to avoid similar showdowns in coming months. Conservatives defiant in the face of GOP troubles . At the same time, they seek a temporary spending plan to reopen the government while formal budget negotiations work out a longer-term agreement that can negate the impacts of the forced sequestration cuts. Republicans, however, want a longer spending proposal that would lock in the planned sequestration cuts in coming months, with a shorter debt ceiling extension in order to negotiate further deficit-reduction measures. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have spearheaded the bipartisan talks. Separately, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee also cited progress. ""We'll get this done. We're gonna get this done. I feel real confident,"" Manchin said. Manchin said the goal was to get at least 65 Senate votes -- which would mean 10 or more from Republicans -- to help Speaker John Boehner generate GOP backing in the House despite certain opposition from the tea party conservative wing. Manchin said Reid and McConnell must work out specifics.

Democratic sources told Bash and CNN's Deirdre Walsh that the proposal under consideration by Reid and McConnell would fund the government through January 15, allowing it to reopen for at least three months or so. At the same time, negotiations on a budget for the full fiscal year would have a deadline of some time in December, the sources said. Meanwhile, the debt ceiling would be increased through February 7 to put off the threat of default for almost four months, according to sources in both parties. The budget negotiations were expected to address deficit reduction measures and therefore could impact when the debt limit would need to be increased again. Paul Ryan steps into budget fight . In addition, provisions involving Obama's signature health care reforms could be included, such as strengthening verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the sources said.

"Brighton, England (CNN) -- No two Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds concerts are ever alike, which is one of the reasons why the Australian singer remains such a mesmerizing performer well into his sixth decade. At the intimate Dome theatre in Brighton, southern England, he and The Seeds are on relaxed form as they give spellbinding renditions of much-loved older material like ""Nobody's Baby Now,"" ""The Mercy Seat,"" and ""Red Right Hand,"" and songs from this year's new album, ""Push The Sky Away."" This album is the first to be released without long-serving guitarist Mick Harvey and marks a more mellow and starker sound than on recent albums. ""The things that we don't understand. They're the best,"" he says as he launches into ""Higgs Boson Blues, a song written before the recent discovery of the so-called ""God Particle."" The new album also finds him observing the boys on Brighton's beach flirting with the ""silly"" girls -- it's a real return to form for Cave after some albums of mixed quality, and his best since 2004's ""Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus."" Perhaps his garage-rock side-project Grinderman has allowed for a return to more reflective material, but as ever the Bad Seeds are peerless in switching from quiet to crashingly loud on songs like ""Stagger Lee,"" always a highlight of a Bad Seeds gig. The sound and quality of musicianship are both superb and his voice remains both tender and strong, despite his 56 years. There is no doubting his commitment on this night, the first of 18 concerts of a European tour. Self-assured, almost like a preacher-man David Bowie, he has a magnetic and unique presence on stage. Stick-thin and resplendent in shiny black suit, Cave is constantly on the move, prowling, kicking his long legs high in the air and holding the hands of members of the audience as he alternately croons and screams. He is in easy-going, crowd-pleasing form, taking requests and seemingly enjoying being back on the road. One recent reviewer memorably described Cave as making ""hell on Earth sound as exhilarating as an acid trip at the funfair."" Don't miss the fun.","Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds kick off 25-date European tour in his hometown, Brighton .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid doesn't do austerity. While recession-hit Spain continues to wrestle with the financial crisis, Real has spent big again by making Gareth Bale one of the most expensive football players -- if not the most expensive -- in history. The clubs didn't reveal the official fee Sunday when his switch was confirmed. Europe's most illustrious club has previous experience in this regard and since the turn of the century, Real has broken the world transfer record on at least four occasions, with two-time president Florentino Perez eager to recruit what he refers to as ""Galactico"" star names. But even Perez, the man for whom money is no object, momentarily winced at the fee commanded by Tottenham Hotspur for Bale earlier in August. ""â‚¬100 million seems a lot to me,"" Perez told ESPN Deportes. Eventually, he refused to blink and in a country where unemployment is at 26.3%, the nine-time European champion has once again raised the bar in the transfer market. ""Bale's a very good player,"" Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino told reporters a week ago when asked about Real's pursuit of the Welsh winger. ""But the numbers are a lack of respect to the world in general."" At a time when most of Spain doesn't have two euros to rub together, you'd have thought Real's level of spending might also rile Madridistas -- but not a bit of it. The view among many Real fans is that the club is a private enterprise and can do what it likes with the money that it has. Their disdain is for Spain's political and financial establishment, rather than Perez and Real. ""What is truly immoral is how our leaders and banks steal from us, although if I think about it I'm not sure why I am surprised. They are just a reflection of the society in this country,"" 34-year-old warehouseman Enrique Gil told CNN. ""I consider it entertainment, something far removed from my day to day. I've never been interested in the financial aspects of football and it hasn't impacted on my support for Madrid,"" added Ignacio Servan, a psychologist and long-term season ticket holder at Real's Bernabeu stadium. ""Nothing must change your hobbies,"" added 36-year-old journalist Pablo Garcia Reales, who is back working having been unemployed for four months. Servan and Reales are not alone in their views. Fellow Real fan Antonio Velasco, who regularly attends the team's home matches, detaches the frivolity of football from the financial hardships faced by most Spaniards. ""It's important to contextualize and not mix both,"" explains 32-year-old marketing manager Velasco. ""As high as the fee may seem, I'm sure that the decision makers in Real Madrid would not spend this sum of money without being sure of a return on the investment."" However, Velasco was keen to explain how the Spanish people have had to adjust to living in unsettling times. ""It's hard to not be affected by things; one cannot help but be moved by families being removed from their homes by force, family and friends being laid-off, social cutbacks and an uncertain economic future,"" he added. ""The doubt is not good for the general state of mind but we've learned and are learning to cope with uncertainty."" Not every fan finds it so easy to turn a blind eye to football's excesses. Spanish professional football has combined debts of $5.4 billion, while according to Spanish economist Jose Maria Gay de Liebana, Real's debts are approaching $800 million. ""As a Spanish citizen I think it is absolutely immoral,"" said marketing manager Javier Santos Martinez. ""I don't believe a football club can stop paying millions but a small family company must pay or they will have to close the business. If you take a look you'll be able to find every Spanish team owes a huge quantity."" Another Real supporter, Miguel Angel Lopez, who is currently unemployed, goes to Madrid's matches when he can. Although unsettled by the huge sums of money involved in the transfer, Lopez understands that, ultimately, Real is free to operate as it pleases. ""It's a hell of a lot of money and it makes me uncomfortable that a sports person can generate this type of transfer fee,"" said Lopez. ""But with the club being a private company they can offer what they want, with a view to recouping the fee over time and turning a profit with the money generated by Bale."" Telecommunications worker Patrica Manzanares Lopez, 31, who has been forced to rent two hours from Madrid due to the economic crisis, added: ""Florentino is a businessman and knows he will win twice with advertising, because Bale is a good player."" Jose Coria Fernandez is a worker on the Madrid underground who has not had a pay rise in six years. He thinks the money spent on the Bale deal is symptomatic of widespread financial irresponsibility in Spanish football. ""There are degrees of immorality about this fee and the money being generated by the bigger teams in the modern game,"" said Fernandez. ""Most clubs in Spain live financially beyond their means and as long as the football governing bodies turn a blind eye, and they get special treatment from the Spanish revenue system, this won't change. ""The banks seem to be happy to lend the major clubs these sums of money and they are treated in a way other companies aren't."" Bale's arrival is the latest example of Real and archrival Barcelona importing expensive, top-level players, while other less wealthy La Liga clubs try and keep pace. Many of these smaller clubs are seeing the best Spanish players depart for foreign leagues. The situation within Spanish football has become so dire that Juan Ramon Canadas, an armchair Real fan who attends games sporadically, finds himself drawn to city rival Atletico Madrid. ""I watch less and less Spanish football as the league is a competition between just two teams,"" reasoned Canadas. ""I tend to watch more Champions League football. I've started to become fond of teams such as Atletico Madrid who do well with inferior financial resources."" He considers the enormous Bale fee to be ""an embarrassment and a shame."" ""It does nothing to promote true sporting values and does nothing to add to community spirit, it's pure business,"" he argued. ""If they pay this fee it's because they know that it will be profitable via TV rights, image rights, etc. ""It turns me off Real Madrid."" Real hope the signing of Bale will help the team win a record 10th European Cup, the fabled, sought-after ""Decima."" If the Welshman scores the winning goal in the final of this season's Champions League, would Canadas be able to put aside his price tag and celebrate? ""Inevitably I'll celebrate it,"" he conceded. ""Once the money has been paid, one has to take advantage of the situation.""","Gareth Bale joins Spanish club Real Madrid from Spurs .

"(CNN) -- A middle-of-the-night fight, a surprise pullout from the Grammy Awards, leaked photos, a police investigation -- new pieces of the puzzle of the alleged assault of pop singer Rihanna by her boyfriend Chris Brown have been emerging since early February. Singers Rihanna and Chris Brown, shown performing in December, are rumored to be back together. Then, nearly three weeks after the alleged battery, the couple was reportedly together again. The reconciliation was reported just days before Brown's arraignment, which is expected Thursday in Los Angeles, California. Update: Chris Brown charged with two felonies . Brown, 19, has issued an apology for ""what transpired"" but neither he nor Rihanna, who just turned 21, has directly addressed the allegations. Many would ask why anyone would return to an abusive partner after leaving, but therapists who treat both abusers and victims say it's common. The effect is like a ""pendulum of pain,"" said Steven Stosny, counselor and founder of the anger and violence management program CompassionPower, which treats people convicted of abuse in the home. Abuse victims will ""leave out of either fear, anger or resentment,"" he said. ""But then, after the fear, anger or resentment begins to subside, they feel guilt, shame, anxiety, and that takes them back."" After a violent incident, there is often a ""honeymoon period"" during which the abuser may apologize profusely, give the victim gifts and persuade the victim to stay, experts say. But when that period is over, the abuser may once again become violent. Blog: The tangles of domestic abuse . The reasons for returning to an abusive partner may relate to the days of early humans, who had to fend for themselves in the wild. The powerful psychological mechanisms that lead people to stay in abusive relationships may have developed for survival reasons, Stosny said. ""To leave an attachment relationship -- a relationship where there's an emotional bond -- meant certain death by starvation or saber-tooth tiger,""  he said. Abuse happens in both low-income and high-income couples, said Joanna Snawder, who counsels students and community members at the Metropolitan State College of Denver in Colorado. A wealthy woman who has never worked may not want to change her lifestyle, while a poor woman may be financially dependent on her boyfriend or husband. Regardless, women may not want to break off an abusive relationship because they are afraid to be independent, don't know how to take care of themselves or don't want to face shame from friends and family, she said. Sometimes the abuser can get his partner to stay with him through manipulation, for instance, telling a woman that he will kill himself if she leaves him, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Crawford has seen many women stay in relationships because they couldn't bear the guilt of an outcome such as this. ""There are some women who need to be needed so badly they'll put up with anything,"" Crawford said. ""Even if the guy beats the crap out of them, they just feel that responsible for the other person."" The term ""the cycle of abuse"" is often used to describe how coming from an abusive family is believed to make an individual more likely to be an abuser or to stay in an abusive relationship. ""Unless we do a lot of psychological work, we often repeat family structures and dynamics that seem normal to us,"" Snawder said. On the other hand, some people who grow up in abusive households do not repeat the behavior they saw at home, she said. One student Snawder advises voluntarily went back to her abusive boyfriend after having a restraining order placed against him. They are together, but the man is assaulting the young woman again. ""It's really important that a woman reach out and get support from friends, family or a counselor who can help her see that she doesn't have to go back to that relationship,"" she said. Men aren't always the abusers. There are relationships in which the woman is the abuser and the man is the victim, and all of the behavioral patterns happen in reverse. For instance, the woman makes the man feel like it's his fault for being beaten, Crawford said. ""Those men just don't have the sense of self to say 'This is not acceptable,'"" he said. Stosny's celebrity clients who have been abusive to their romantic partners may have been negatively affected by their rise to fame early in life, he said. They see themselves as above others, and feel they are entitled to punch someone whenever they feel like it. ""I had one professional basketball player who sexually assaulted a girl. He really in his heart didn't believe that she didn't want to have sex with him,"" Stosny said. Can there ever be a happy ending for an abusive relationship? Experts agree that it's unusual, but a relationship in which a partner has been violent can become healthy again if, and only if, the abusive person seeks counseling to change his or her mindset. ""If you don't believe that you have a problem, and you believe the person drove you to it, you're going to have a really hard time seeing that you have a problem,"" Snawder said. In practice, however, the victim usually just needs to move on to someone else, she said.","Chris Brown and Rihanna are reportedly back together despite rumors he beat her .

"Washington (CNN) -- Trey Radel loves hip-hop. He is an avid user of Twitter. His real name is Henry Jude Radel III. He represents parts of the southwest Florida coast in Congress. He said he came to Congress to do ""the right thing."" He also just pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession and is taking a leave of absence to seek substance abuse treatment. ""I have no excuse for what I have done. I have let down our country,"" he said at a news conference Wednesday night back home in his district in Cape Coral, Florida. Rep. Trey Radel gets probation for cocaine bust, to seek treatment . The former local news anchor-turned conservative talk show host said he came to Washington to represent conservative ideals but also reach across the aisle. ""I spent my first two weeks here in Congress reaching out to every Florida Democrat to go shake their hand and say: 'I'm not here to yell out you. I'm not here to name call. I'm here to work with you,'"" he said in an interview with National Journal in August. In that same interview, he said he had Valentine's Day dinner with Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a fellow Floridian but also head of the Democratic National Convention. Easily winning his district -- which has the lowest percentage of Democrats in all Florida and consists of Fort Myers and Naples -- with 61% of the vote, the Republican congressman has been in office for less than a year. The 37-year-old husband and father of one toddler appeared to be having a great time in Washington. On Twitter, he posted pictures and Vines of himself around the U.S. Capitol with the hashtag #treydome. His Twitter followers loved him. During one of his frequent flights, he reviewed the SkyMall magazine on Twitter. Pictures of the products included his commentary. For one product to treat animal anxiety, Radel tweeted, ""For dogs n cats w serious anxiety. Every member of congress should have one. #treyonplane."" He would hold impromptu ""Twitter Townhalls"" where people tweeted him questions about anything but politics. In one, he referred to two classic rap albums by Public Enemy. When asked who he'd rather have dinner with, fellow Florida Rep. Corinne Brown, who is a Democrat, or Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Radel said dinner with Brown because he ""works with her"" but ""DRINKS w Nancy."" Radel would often talk about drinks. He was often asked about his favorites in interviews. In an interview with Roll Call, Radel said, ""I have yet to have a bad martini in D.C.,"" he commented. ""My favorite is Kettle [sic] One, up with blue cheese stuffed olives shaken by Mary at The Palm."" In a statement addressing his cocaine charge, Radel said he ""struggles with the disease of alcoholism"" and he's now in treatment. He has also experienced tragedy. He told National Journal that his mom died at his wedding reception. ""My mom literally died on my wedding reception floor, right after my wife and I were married. It was a freak accident; she choked. There was a paramedic in the room who couldn't save her,"" he said. After October 29, the night he was charged with cocaine possession, his Twitter feed became much more serious. There were no more Twitter Town halls or talk about his favorite drinks. Instead, it was filled with thoughts about policy, especially his opposition to Obamacare. He also showed a Vine of him and his son playing with ""Toy Story"" characters and a picture of him, his wife and son dressed up for Halloween. On the night he was elected, he told a local news reporter from WINK, the station where he once worked, that ""Florida has placed a tremendous amount of trust in me"" and that he hopes to be a ""spectacular servant"" for southwest Florida. On Wednesday night, at what seemed like a hastily called news conference, Radel said he was taking a leave of absence. He said he was going to seek treatment, that he needed help. ""I believe in faith, forgiveness and redemption,"" Radel told reporters. ""I ask for your prayers and I don't ask for me.... I ask for my family.""","Florida congressman is in the spotlight because of a cocaine possession charge .

"(CNN) -- Human activity and climate change have left about 75% of the world's coral reefs threatened, putting the livelihoods of many countries that depend on the ocean ecosystems at risk, according to a report released this week. Local threats such as overfishing, coastal development, and watershed- and marine-based pollution are responsible for the immediate and direct threat to more than 60% of the world's reefs. Add to that thermal stress from rising ocean temperatures and the number of threatened reefs jumps to 75%, the World Resources Institute found in the report, titled ""Reefs at Risk,"" released Wednesday. ""This report serves as a wake-up call for policy-makers, business leaders, ocean managers, and others about the urgent need for greater protection for coral reefs,"" said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""As the report makes clear, local and global threats, including climate change, are already having significant impacts on coral reefs, putting the future of these beautiful and valuable ecosystems at risk."" The threat is the highest in Southeast Asia where nearly 95% of the region's reefs are threatened, mainly due to overfishing and destructive fishing, according to the report. Australia, home to the world's largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef, had the lowest threat level at 14%. The numbers represent an alarming trend: a dramatic increase in the percentage of reefs rated as threatened. According to the report, the level has increased by 30% in 10 years, mainly due to a rise in overfishing and destructive fishing. The report attributes the rise to the growth in coastal populations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Similarly, climate change is playing an increasing role in the growing threat levels as the warming atmosphere causes ocean temperatures to rise. As a result, ""mass coral bleaching, a stress response to warming waters, has occurred in every region and is becoming more frequent as higher temperatures recur,"" the report says, noting that ""extreme bleaching kills corals outright."" ""Our projections suggest that during the 2030s, roughly half of reefs globally will experience stress sufficient to induce severe bleaching in most years,"" the study says. ""During the 2050s, this percentage is expected to grow to more than 95%."" Many countries, especially small island nations in the Pacific and Caribbean, rely on coral reefs for fishing, tourism and coastal protection, and the report says that ""degradation and loss of reefs will result in significant social and economic impacts."" However, the report also notes that reefs have shown an ability to rebound from ""extreme damage."" In order to help that recovery, ""local threats must be tackled head-on with direct management interventions, while efforts to quickly and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions are of paramount concern not only for reefs but for nature and humanity as a whole,"" the report says. Former Vice President Al Gore cautions in the report's introduction that if efforts ""fail to address the multiple threats they (reefs) face, we will likely see these precious ecosystems unravel, and with them the numerous benefits that people around the globe derive from these ecological wonders.""","Causes are attributed to human activity and climate change .

"(CNN) -- A sequel to Frank Capra's classic 1946 film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is in the works, but it might take a Christmas miracle to turn this reboot into a classic. According to a news release from film financier Allen J. Schwalb and his company Star Partners, ""It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story"" will tell what happened to the Baileys of Bedford Falls after the first movie ended. To help bridge the two films, producers announced that Karolyn Grimes, who at 6-years-old played Zuzu Bailey alongside Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed, will reprise her role. Grimes might have been charming as little Zuzu in the original, but her film resume ended roughly when her teens started in 1952. There are also talks with other living original cast members to see if they would sign on to the movie, which may sound like a holiday treat to some and like a lump of coal to many. ""It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story"" will be written by Bob Farnsworth, known primarily as a music producer, and Martha Bolton, whose resume largely consists of her work done on Bob Hope specials in the 1980s and '90s. Schwalb has financed a long list of films -- including ""Rain Man,"" ""The Color Purple"" and ""Thelma and Louise"" -- but most of them were hits in the last century, and his credits as a producer appear to be minimal. Despite a reported $25 million to $32 million budget and an projected release next holiday season, the movie resembles an independent film rather than a high-profile sequel. And that's if it can even get off the ground; the copyright to the original is its own complicated story. NBC controls the rights to ""It's a Wonderful Life."" At one point, it was believed to have been part of the public domain and these new filmmakers seem to be operating as if it is. Requests for comment from NBC have not been returned, but it's worth noting the network has been protective enough of the classic's legacy that it airs the film sparingly even during the holidays. For his part, Schwalb says this new movie would continue the classic story for ""an entirely new generation of moviegoers"" and he is proud ""to be involved in moving this story forward.""","A sequel to the classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is being planned .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid will head into a big week knowing the club's Spanish title bid is back on track and that one of its records will stand for at least another season. Carlo Ancelotti's team will be just three points behind Barcelona ahead of next weekend's ""Clasico"" at Camp Nou after the La Liga champion dropped its first points this campaign in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Osasuna. It was the first time in 64 league matches Barca had failed to score, despite the introduction of Lionel Messi midway through the second half. Second-placed Atletico Madrid then surrendered the division's only other 100% record, losing 1-0 at Espanyol to also fall one win short of the 1968-69 Real side's benchmark beginning. Ancelotti, meanwhile, was lifted by a 2-0 win at home to Malaga earlier in the day which lifted some of the building pressure on the Italian. ""Today I am happy, we have to keep going and keep improving, but the team has done well today, the week has started well,"" the former Milan and Chelsea coach said. Angel Di Maria put Real ahead a minute into the second half with a speculative cross that bamboozled the keeper, and Cristiano Ronaldo sealed victory in time added on with a penalty after substitute Gareth Bale was brought down in the box. Marquee signing Bale is now in contention to face Juventus in the European Champions League on Wednesday, having impressed on his return from injury. ""Bale has no problems and is another option. We will see now that we have three days of training before the next match,"" Ancelotti said. He backed Ronaldo after the Portugal forward -- who hit the bar in the first half -- apologized to fans for not scoring earlier in the match. ""He was not happy because he wanted to score -- he had chances and I said that the today it was just not his day, but he showed a cool mind in scoring the penalty because when it is not your day, it is not difficult to miss a penalty,"" the 54-year-old added. Barca coach Gerardo Martino shrugged off his side's frustrating day ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Milan. ""We should have won given the chances we created. I'm pleased with the team's performance,"" the Argentine said. ""We weren't accurate in front of goal. In the first half we were missing that final pass. We were off by centimeters. ""I would be concerned if there had been a decline in our performance. We tied because that's how it had to be -- I don't think our level has dropped."" Atletico's perfect run came to an end in the Catalan capital as Espanyol triumphed thanks to a bizarre own-goal from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who could only divert Juan Fuentes' 55th-minute cross into his own net via his outstretched foot. Atletico did breach the opposition's goal, but Mario Suarez was offside when he headed in Koke's free-kick. In Saturday's other La Liga game, Valencia missed a chance to stay in touch with the top four after losing 2-1 at home to Real Sociedad. Germany . Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga after coming from behind to beat Mainz 4-1, with substitute Mario Gotze inspiring a second-half fightback. The 21-year-old set up Arjen Robben's equalizer and was also involved as Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic made it 3-1. Muller sealed the scoring with a penalty after Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled. It extended the German and European champion's unbeaten run to 34 matches, two short of Hamburg's longstanding league record. Borussia Dortmund reclaimed second place with a 1-0 win at home to Hanover, thanks to Marco Reus' first-half penalty. It gave last season's runner-up a goal-difference advantage over third-placed Bayer Leverkusen -- whose controversial Friday win against Hoffenheim, courtesy of a goal that went through the sidenetting, will be reviewed on Monday. Fourth-placed Hertha Berlin, another seven points back, beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-0, while Schalke took fifth as Roman Neustaedter's injury-time goal earned a 3-2 win at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig. Second-bottom Freiburg drew 0-0 at Werder Bremen, while it was 1-1 between Eintracht Frankfurt and Nuremberg. Italy . AC Milan notched a morale-boosting 1-0 win at home to Udinese, moving into the top half of the Serie A table thanks to Valter Birsa's first-half goal. Brazil midfielder Kaka came on as a second-half replacement after a month on the sidelines with injury, as severely-depleted Milan bid to put together a match-fit squad for Tuesday's home clash with Barca. Cagliari won 2-1 against 10-man Catania in the club's first match in 18 months at its renovated home stadium, joining ninth-placed Udinese on 10 points from eight rounds. Second-placed Juve will seek to cut the gap on leader Roma to two points by winning at Fiorentina on Sunday. France . Ligue 1 champion Paris Saint-Germain went three points clear with a 4-0 drubbing of Bastia, as star strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani scored twice each. Monaco can regain the lead on goal difference by winning at bottom club Sochaux on Sunday. Lille moved up to third with a 1-0 win at Montpellier, while Nantes beat Ajaccio by the same score to also go above Marseille -- defeated at sixth-placed Nice on Friday.","Barcelona and Atletico Madrid fail to equal Real Madrid's record start to season .

"Belgrade, Serbia (CNN) -- A gunman went on a shooting spree in the Serbian town of Velika Ivanca on Tuesday, killing at least 13 people, including a small child, according to Police Chief Milorad Veljovic. The town lies roughly 25 miles south of the capital, Belgrade. Are you there? Share your story with CNN iReport. The man, in his 60s, entered five houses and shot six men, six women and one child dead. Twelve of the victims died immediately, another died at a Belgrade hospital, Serbian news agency Tanjug reported. Two people remained hospitalized, one of them likely the suspected shooter, Tanjug reported, citing Veljovic. Veljovic said the gunman attempted to kill his wife and take his own life, according to Tanjug. It was not immediately clear whether the man's wife survived. Investigators don't know what sparked the killings, Veljovic said. Serbian broadcaster B92 described the man as a veteran of the Serbian-Croatian war in the 1990s who had lost his job a year ago. Neighbors said the man had never seemed violent, B92 reported. Serbia has a low murder rate, nearly on par with that of Sweden, according to the World Health Organization. With 1.2 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, Serbia's murder rate was one-quarter of that of the United States.","NEW: The shooting suspect is a war veteran who never seemed violent, a broadcaster reports .

"(BudgetTravel.com) -- When Americans think of ""five star"" hotels, they conjure up images of on-site spas, white-gloved service, and pillow menus. That's no surprise, given that the dominant rating systems in the U.S. are two of the most trust-worthy on the planet -- Forbes and AAA. In order to snag Forbes's highest ratings, for example, a hotel's staff must meet criteria such as greeting arriving guests curbside within 60 seconds and offering tasting samples to drinkers ordering wine by the glass. In Italy, on the other hand, where the rating system is government owned and operated, all it takes to score five stars is a 24-hour reception desk, receptionists that speak three foreign languages, and double rooms starting at 172 square feet. Budget Travel: 10 gorgeous pools you won't believe are public . There are more scoring systems than most folks realize, and they vary from country to country (and, in some cases, from city to city). That said, most ratings fall into one of four main categories: those operated by private companies such as AAA, those run by hotel booking sites such as hotels.com, user-generated systems, and government-run agencies. Bottom line: Consistency is an issue. In the past two years, several governments including Switzerland's and Germany's have overhauled their systems to be more uniform, and Brazil is following suit this year. Plus, in 2009, Europe's Hotelstars Union launched with the goal of establishing common classification criteria across the EU. Despite the improvements, figuring out which hotel will provide the best value can still feel like cracking the Da Vinci Code. To help you make the most informed decision possible, we scrutinized criteria across the globe to suss out the meaning behind the stars. No matter where you're going, here is what you need to know before you book. No. 1: Private-company rating systems . Verdict: Independent ownership, consistent criteria, and anonymous inspectors make companies like AAA and Forbes (formerly Mobil) Travel Guide reliable and unbiased. Both AAA and Forbes have been rating hotels for more than half a century and provide regular, in-depth reports on what consumers can expect, from how many soaps in the bathroom to bedsheet thread counts. Every 12 to 18 months, for example, Forbes inspectors make incognito visits to up to 5,000 properties and complete a checklist of 525 questions: Are guests arriving in a taxi greeted curbside within 60 seconds? Does wine-by-the-glass service include a tasting sample? Findings are relayed in a 110-page report. Five-star spots feature virtually flawless service -- if you only eat the cantaloupe off the breakfast-buffet fruit tray, for example, expect extra melon delivered to your table. Diamonds are the currency in the AAA system, where inspectors pay unannounced visits to 32,000 North American properties annually and rank them on a scale from one diamond (lowest) to five. But even single-diamond hotels have standards: In order to be AAA-rated, properties must adhere to a basic set of benchmarks relating to cleanliness and management (bathrooms must have mini soaps, for example), but don't expect a business center or even an elevator. On the other hand, in five-diamond hotels you can bank on a full on-site spa, 24/7 room service, choice of pillow filling (pick from goose down, silk, cashmere), even a personal butler. Outside of the U.S., Australia is one of the few other countries in the world with a private rating system, which also happens to be called AAA. The system is operated by the Australian Automobile Association, an organization similar to (but not affiliated with) North America's AAA. No. 2: Hotel booking sites . Verdict: Online booking engines such as hotels.com use a combination of hired scouts and user ratings to review hotels, but generally reviewers aren't anonymous and the standards vary by country and company. These ratings are best used in conjunction with other review sites. Orbitz and Priceline each has its own rating system, though neither publishes their ratings criteria on their website. The standards vary by company and country -- which means a hotel in London won't necessarily be rated by the same criteria as one in New York City. (One major reason is the difference in room size between Europe and America; rooms tend to be smaller overseas, even in hotels that would otherwise score high marks.) Hotels.com, for example, stations employees on every continent but Antarctica to suss out properties. While these scouts aren't anonymous -- they actually work with hoteliers to improve hotels' star ratings -- 2 million unvetted consumer reviews provide another layer of feedback. Ratings are based on location, amenities, type of accommodation, and service. Budget Travel: Secret hotels of Paris . No. 3: User-generated rating systems . Verdict: User ratings are more valuable en masse. The key is to focus on what the majority of reports seem to indicate about a property and to ignore extremely positive or negative reviews, which may be biased. Use these sites as a reference but not your sole reference. User-generated sites are built on feedback from the masses: TripAdvisor, for example, features more than 50 million traveler reviews sounding off on nearly 495,000 hotels worldwide. While the company, which launched in 2000, bills itself as having ""World's most trusted travel advice,"" the sheer volume of sources -- and TripAdvisor's inability to vet them all for accuracy -- make these reviews something to take with a grain of salt. (A general rule is to ignore the ecstatically positive and totally negative reviews in favor of those in the middle.) While the site has stringent guidelines (""reviews should contain only original content and no quoted material from other sources...we do not allow quoted material from personal email correspondence with a property manager"") and even has moderators to flag posts that seem fishy (like a hotelier giving his property rave reviews, for example), there's no way to catch every questionable review. Even with the caveat, peer reviews can be helpful, as they're often more detailed (""the room smelled of moldy hotel carpeting"") and straightforward (""the check-in staff was great, but the hotel was on a yucky street"") than those from third-party organizations or tourism boards. No. 4: Government-run ratings systems . Verdict: Government-run ratings systems may be self-interested -- the better a destination's hotels, the more tourists it'll draw -- and unregulated by a third party. Proceed with caution, and always refer to at least one or two other sources. Most European countries have their own government-produced ratings, as well as countries in Asia, South America, and Africa. (There's no standardized system across Europe, but in 2009, an organization called the Hotelstars Union launched a drive to establish a common system across the EU. So far, 11 countries, including Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, are participating.) In Europe, reliability varies by country -- the U.K.'s system is uniform across Great Britain and fairly trustworthy, though tourist authorities have toyed with the idea of including user reviews. In France, on the other hand, ratings aren't based on quality but on the presence of certain features (air-conditioning and bathroom facilities, for example). In Italy, a hotel can earn a single star just for changing the sheets on the beds once a week (don't let the bedbugs bite!). Also low on the reliability scale: Asia, South America, and Africa, where national tourism boards have no standardized criteria or oversight. Budget Travel: 15 places every kid should see before 15 .

"(CNN) -- French police have released a second photo of the man suspected of shooting a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation Monday, as their manhunt continues. A gunman shot the 23-year-old assistant photographer twice near the heart with a shotgun in the lobby of the newspaper's offices in Paris. Liberation Publisher Nicolas Demorand told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Monday that the victim was ""a little better"" Tuesday but still in critical condition. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins earlier said he was in intensive care. The gunman fled after the attack, and authorities released photos showing a 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 man with a ""European appearance"" and graying hair. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old. Police said he was carrying one or two bags and was wearing a khaki parka or a green pullover, a dark sleeveless vest, green-and-white basketball shoes and a dark cap. On Tuesday, police released another image of the suspect that showed him wearing what appeared to be a red parka, blue T-shirt and pale brown knitted hat. Paris police had no information about the man's motive, and prosecutors issued a plea for witnesses who may have seen a man ""making death threats while carrying a gun,"" according to a statement. The suspect apparently also opened fire in front of Societe Generale towers in Paris, the international bank said on Twitter. There were no injuries in that shooting, and police are investigating, the bank said. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense. The bank's towers are in the same neighborhood. The man said he dropped the assailant off near the Champs-Elysee, the city's main street, according to police. On Friday, a gunman broke into BFMTV, threatening journalists before fleeing. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. But it has not been established that it was the same man.","A gunman shot a photographer at the Paris offices of Liberation newspaper Monday .

"New York (CNN) -- A motorcyclist has been charged with pulling a driver from his SUV and beating him in a clash with bikers on a Manhattan roadway that was captured on video, New York authorities said Saturday. Kaliq Douglas, 27, of Brooklyn, did not enter a plea during his arraignment on allegations of gang assault and assault with intent to cause bodily injury, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The case brings to eight the number of people charged in the case, NYPD spokeswoman Annette Markowski said. Authorities say Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally on September 29. When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. Lien has not been charged. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed. He was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. A judge set bond for Douglas at $25,000, according to the district attorney's office. The NYPD, which has appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, hasn't ruled out more arrests or charges. The beating went viral after a video of the incident was posted online. Of those arrested, at least three have been indicted by a grand jury. Three NYPD officers are under investigation for allegedly waiting several days to tell their superiors they were at a rally where the SUV driver was beaten and kicked. Outlaws or stunt artists?

"Washington (CNN) -- OK, so Congress passed a bill, the President signed it into law and the government's finally back in business. But with all the last-minute press conferencing, speechifying, and endless partisan tweeting, the one thing that wasn't extensively discussed was the actual details of the bill. Since it evolved constantly and was pushed through at the 11th hour, things got a tad confusing. Here's are the key points you need to know about the bill that saved the government: . America can keep spending . . . through January 15 . This goes down as a 'win' for President Barack Obama and the Democrats. Republicans tried to use the shutdown and the looming debt ceiling deadline to force spending cuts or even dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. They got neither. 9 things we missed during the shutdown . ""We fought the good fight, we just didn't win,"" House Speaker John Boehner said on a local radio station. Now, there's a little more time for both sides to hash out the bigger issues, like entitlement programs and tax reform. But Republicans have been badly bruised and aren't going to want to walk away empty-handed again. So, it's safe to expect them to regroup, get on the same page, and take a hard line the next time around. There's a little pork in the bill . We run out of cash again . . . on February 7 . Mark your calendars, because we get to have this fight all over again in a few months. February 7 is the new date the Treasury Department will run out of ways to pay America's bills. This legislation raised the debt ceiling just enough to fund the government for the next few months. The two chambers of Congress will now have to create a spending plan for the 2014 fiscal year. If negotiations break down, we may be in for another round of last-minute debt ceiling shenanigans. But what are the odds of that happening, right? Show them the money . . . for healthcare subsidies . This was a win for Republicans, but they aren't exactly doing a group high five. Conservatives had been pushing for insurance marketplaces to confirm the income of those requesting health care subsidies since the Obama Administration scaled back the requirement months ago. It's a pretty small bone to be thrown when you consider their starting point was an effort to totally defund Obamacare. But hey, a (small) win's a (small) win. Furloughed workers WILL be getting back pay . In an expected move, Congress agreed to pay back federal workers whose wages were withheld while the government was shut down. Remember the Capitol police officers, some of whom showed up to work out of a sense of duty and put their lives on the line when an erratic driver tore through the streets of DC? They'll finally get paid. Sylvia Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said furloughed workers should expect to return to work Thursday. Of course, in the midst of battling to keep the U.S. from defaulting, Congress took the time to load the 35-page deal with some choice pork spending. But that's another story. 3 reasons not to celebrate the shutdown deal . CNN's Tom Cohen, Greg Botelho and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Current spending levels are authorized through January 15 .
We run out of money again on February 7 .
Income verification will be needed for Affordable Care Act subsidies .
Furloughed works will get back pay ."
"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- An American held by Colombian rebels for more than three months will be released ""imminently,"" U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Saturday after meeting in Cuba with rebel leaders. FARC guerrillas captured U.S Army veteran Kevin Scott Sutay on June 20 while he was traveling in Colombia. Jackson said FARC invited him to Havana, where the group has been holding peace talks with the Colombian government since last October. ""It's a humanitarian gesture of their own volition, demanding nothing in return,"" Jackson said at a news conference in the Cuban capital. ""I consider it as a gesture to reinforce the peace negotiation."" FARC guerrillas said in a statement Saturday they had previously offered to free Sutay but that ""the Colombian government did not provide the minimum necessary conditions we need for this procedure."" There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. Colombian officials previously said they feared FARC would use Sutay's release to garner media coverage. Jackson said he hopes the Red Cross in Colombia will provide a helicopter to remove Sutay from the remote area of the country where he is being held and that the Colombian government will designate the area a cease-fire zone during his release. Despite the 10-month old peace talks, the Colombian government has resisted calls for a cease-fire with guerrillas, saying the rebels have used previous cease-fires to strengthen their forces. Sutay served in the U.S. Army from November 2009 to March 2013. He served in Afghanistan for a year starting in November 2010, according to the U.S. Defense Department. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. The Pentagon lists his rank as private. Despite Sutay's military background, Jackson said the Army veteran had peaceful motives for visiting Colombia. ""The fact is, he is a tourist,"" Jackson said. FARC, whose name in Spanish is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, began fighting the government in the 1960s, making it Latin America's oldest guerrilla force. There have been sporadic peace talks between the rebels and the government since the 1980s. The last attempt failed in 2002. CNN's Jessica King and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: Jackson says the release would be a 'humanitarian gesture of their own volition""

"(CNN) -- If we allow this awful measure to stand, predicted the conservative spokesman, ""behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day...we will wake to find that we have socialism [and] we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free."" This could be a tea party representative warning about the perils of Obamacare and willing to keep the government closed until it is delayed or repealed. But it was Ronald Reagan speaking back in 1961. And the program he viewed as the driving wedge of socialism was Medicare. One can draw three important lessons from that statement and from the later presidential career of the man who made it. First, the fear that a federal program designed to help millions of people flagrantly violates the Constitution and speeds the nation toward tyranny has deep roots in modern U.S. history. In the mid-1930s, the American Liberty League hurled that charge at Franklin D. Roosevelt for creating Social Security as well as for endorsing the right of unions to organize. In 1964, Barry Goldwater made a similar argument against the Civil Rights Act. ""The problem of race relations,"" the Republican presidential nominee contended, should be left to the people of the South to decide. It ""should not be effected by engines of national power."" In 1994, Newt Gingrich and his fellow House Republicans described President Bill Clinton's national health care plan, which included an employer mandate, as a radical attempt to coerce American business. The Liberty League collapsed after FDR won re-election in a landslide in 1936. But the careers of Reagan, Goldwater and Gingrich were propelled by a large movement of white, middle-class Americans who shared the same dread of federal power tea party members now express. Like the Koch brothers today, wealthy individuals on the right were always eager to finance that movement. The second lesson is that, over time, the dire predictions of conservatives have not come to pass. Social Security and Medicare did not destroy individual liberty in America; they enabled millions of people to avoid poverty and an early death. Of course, these programs eat up the lion's share of the federal budget. But few citizens -- including the most zealous tea party activists -- would wish to cut the benefits they receive, much less abolish them. And if black people had waited for the majority white Southerners to grant them equal rights, they might be waiting still. The final lesson is that when conservatives do take power in Washington, they depart quite markedly from the rhetoric of their campaigns. As president, Reagan made no attempt to reduce Social Security payments and expanded Medicare to cover ""catastrophic"" costs. When he made it to the White House, George W. Bush, who had been the favorite candidate of most conservatives in the 2000 primaries, initiated a major new entitlement program, Medicare Part D. When they campaign for votes and donations, conservative candidates for national office are fond of such slogans as ""the bigger the government, the smaller the citizen."" But those who gain victory quickly realize that Americans like and often rely on the government programs, which benefit them and their families, and will punish any politician who tries to take them away. As two astute political scientists put it in the 1960s, most Americans may be ""ideological conservatives,"" but they are also ""operational liberals."" Ironically, however, the conservative activists who despise ""big government"" endure because the politicians they endorse never fulfill their desires. By losing nearly every big battle to curb federal power from the New Deal onward, they maintain the fervor of a movement of outsiders. The struggle to preserve the constitutional order against the onslaughts of its enemies never ends. If a future President Rand Paul or Ted Cruz did make a serious attempt to dismantle the welfare state, their disciples would lose their image as heroic losers. But this fall, the tea party, the latest version of the grassroots right, has already achieved a victory of sorts. With the acquiescence of Republican leaders, its stalwarts in Congress have done much to bring the nation to the brink of a financial catastrophe. If that debacle were to occur, we could, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, someday be telling our children and grandchildren what it was once like in America when we had a government that could truly function. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Kazin.","Michael Kazin: In 1961 Reagan warned of spread of socialism -- he was talking about Medicare .
Kazin: In opposing Obamacare, tea party echoes movements against Social Security .
He says they're usually backed by wealthy and predict catastrophe that never comes .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago commuter train that was parked in a service yard somehow moved onto a rail line and smashed into an oncoming train early Monday, injuring dozens of people. How it happened is a mystery. ""I don't know the last time, if ever, that this has happened"" on the Chicago Transit Authority system, spokesman Brian Steele said. There are ""more questions than answers"" about the incident in Forest Park, Illinois, he said. At least 48 people were injured; 33 of them were transported to hospitals, Forest Park Mayor Anthony Calderone told CNN affiliate WLS. They are believed to have minor injuries. It was not immediately clear how many passengers were aboard the train. Investigators are not characterizing the incident as a runaway train at this point, Steele said. A central question: whether anyone had climbed on board the empty train and set it in motion. ""In order for a train to move, it has to be energized,"" said Ronald Ester, vice president of CTA Rail Operations. ""We call it unlocking the master controller,"" he said. The train would have needed to be placed in power position manually. Authorities are looking at video feeds from the platforms and from some rail cars. They're also interviewing workers who were nearby. It's unknown whether there were criminal activities, Steele said. Authorities did not immediately find windows broken, doors pried open or graffiti on the train. The train that caused the accident had four cars; the one with passengers aboard had eight. The incident took place about 8 a.m. Train service continued but did not stop at Harlem, near the site of the crash. Shuttle buses were made available. Steele emphasized that the CTA has ""a very strong safety record."" More on the accident from CNN affiliate WGN .","NEW: The train that caused the accident had been parked in a service yard .

"(CNN) -- Tear gas shrouded the streets outside the Sunni Muslim world's most prestigious university after Egyptian police battled thousands of pro-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrators Sunday in Cairo, authorities reported. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the protest, the latest in a wave of sometimes-deadly demonstrations since the summer coup that deposed Egypt's first democratically elected president. About 3,000 students from Cairo's al-Azhar University, considered a top center of Islamic scholarship, blocked a road outside the institution, according to Egypt's Interior Ministry. After about half an hour of attempts to persuade them to reopen the roadway, the protesters refused and began chanting anti-military slogans and throwing rocks, the ministry said on its Facebook page. Police responded with tear gas, driving some protesters back onto the university grounds and arresting others. Egypt's military stepped in to remove President Mohamed Morsy in July amid protests that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets to demand his resignation. Morsy, who had won office barely a year earlier, and other Brotherhood leaders have been arrested, and a court banned the movement in September. But the demonstrations have continued, with Morsy's supporters demanding that the generals reinstate his government. Battles between police and protesters left more than 50 dead in early October, spurring the Obama administration to cut off significant military aid to a leading Arab ally. Egypt's military-backed interim president is reviewing a proposed law that would place strict limits on protests, state-run news outlets reported last week. The legislation has drawn the ire of human rights groups and both pro- and anti-Morsy political movements. The April 6 Youth Movement, an influential political force deeply involved in Egypt's 2011 revolution, called it ""one of the worst repressive laws constraining freedoms in Third World countries and military dictatorships.""","Police break up protest at al-Azhar University with tear gas .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed ratification documents for America's new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia on Wednesday, clearing the way for the two powers to put the landmark accord into effect. The agreement, known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) replaces START 1, which expired in December 2009. The U.S. Senate approved the new START pact last December, while the Russian parliament ratified it in January. The treaty is designed to slash the stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons in both countries to 1,550 warheads -- down from a current cap of 2,200 -- and 700 launchers. It also calls for a resumption of inspections of nuclear arsenals that ended when START 1 expired and helps move forward with White House efforts to ""reset"" U.S.-Russian relations. Obama has called the treaty ""the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades."" The Senate's approval in December gave the president a key victory on what has been considered one of his top foreign policy priorities.","Obama signs the new START treaty .

"(CNN) -- The slaughter of hundreds in Egypt this week was horrifying. The response of the United States to that slaughter seemed puny and impotent. The president and the secretary of state offered strongly worded condemnations, and the United States canceled its participation in a military exercise that probably wouldn't have happened anyway, given the unrest. Around the world critics suggested the United States was either effectively condoning the violence or sending a strong message that it wouldn't penalize the Egyptian military for this or future harshness. It didn't help that after his statement the president slipped off for a round of golf. The unnecessarily callous optics of the golf game aside, the unsettling reality is that America's options were puny and likely to have very little effect. Indeed, the White House wisely avoided falling into the trap of ""feel good measures:"" bold gestures that may resonate but ultimately won't work. Some argue the United States should suspend the delivery of some or all the $1.3 billion in annual aid it sends to the Egyptian government. But this would only further reduce the limited influence we have over the Egyptian military. Mosque at center of Egyptian clashes . It is important to remember that after Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy's overthrow, governments from the Persian Gulf in a matter of days offered the new Egyptian government 10 times the amount the United States gives each year. Not only did this shift the balance of influence away from the United States, but it also raises the possibility that they might well have replaced any funds we withdrew, blunting the impact of our actions. It is also important to remember that the situation in Egypt is not black and white. While there is no excuse for the kind of massacres that took place this week, the Muslim Brotherhood also has a share of responsibility for the situation on the ground. The Morsy government regularly abused its authority, trampled on basic human rights and was so widely reviled in Egypt that its overthrow was welcomed by tens of millions of citizens. Indeed, if you are looking for a place to fault the U.S. response, look to our relative tolerance of Morsy's abuses and our failure to strongly and effectively call him out as his government crushed personal freedoms, suppressed the press, threw opponents in jail and stood by as the Muslim Brotherhood actively sought to sow discord throughout the Middle East. Had the United States been tougher back then and had it worked more with the international community to tie total aid flows to better behavior, it could have helped forestall the current situation. The United States consistently did and said too little too late. It also fell into the trap of overstating the legitimacy that being elected conferred on Morsy, even as he undercut that legitimacy by acting in a perniciously undemocratic way. Is it still safe to travel to Egypt? This last overall point contains the secret to effective U.S. leverage over Egypt and many countries these days. The United States cannot have much impact acting alone. Unless--in an instance like this-- it can speak for a broad cross section of aid-giving countries and institutions, the impact of any conditions it sets is likely to be limited. Impact requires purposeful, active political and economic diplomacy at the highest levelâ€”including the willingness to pressure friends. It also requires having a clear plan. Finally, those with whom the United States is interacting, be they friends or adversaries, have to believe that it has the resolve to follow through -- and the willingness to take materially positive action if things go the way America wants. But a United States that is post-Iraq and post-Afghanistan is correctly seen in the Middle East and elsewhere as ""leaning back."" A trifecta of forces has contributed to this: . The huge costs and damage of our misadventures in the region have left us disinclined to further commit major resources or incur further risks. Our domestic economic problems have led us to turn inward and question how we allocate our resources. And the polarization in U.S. politics has both produced divisions that make action hard and empowered the extreme wings of both parties, groups that for all their divisions happen to share a taste for isolationism. American inaction in Syria, the growing violence in Iraq, our apparent inclination to get out of Afghanistan at any cost, and our relative silence on the decaying situation elsewhere in North Africa all contribute to the unhelpful perception that we are not going to put our shoulder into much in the region (or elsewhere for that matter). It's not that we'll be absent. Not that we won't issue statements. Not that we won't take some modest actions. It's just that we will do less where we can do less. We will hesitate more. And with each illustration of thisâ€”whether our restraint is soundly based or notâ€”we lose credibility and thus leverage. This is the hard choice for America: Embrace the risks and costs of real engagement or accept those associated with a much more passive role. This doesn't mean we have to be foolish. We don't need more Iraqs. Egypt's identity torn in two . But the lesson of Iraq was not to never intervene again. It was to never do so rashly, recklessly or for the wrong reasons. It was to resist the temptation to act alone, to step up to the hard work of real diplomacy, to keep our eye on our nation's need to be a more effective leader in the international community, rather than simply the bullying hyperpower. It was to understand that the trick of leadership is actually getting others to follow, building coalitions, leveraging our power with that of others. Because as we are now discovering, sometimes the greatest costs of mistakes like the ones we made in Iraq and Afghanistan are the way they limit our ability or inclination to take action in the future when it is truly necessary.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats on Wednesday blocked a Republican effort to repeal the health care law passed last year. The party-line vote, with all 47 Republicans in favor and 51 Democrats opposed, meant the procedural motion failed to get the necessary 60 votes to pass. Two Democrats didn't vote. While the Republican-controlled House of Representatives previously succeeded in passing a bill to repeal the health care overhaul on Jan. 19, the Senate defeat Wednesday means a total repeal of the measure by Congress is dead for now. The Senate vote involved a Democratic challenge to a Republican amendment that would repeal the health care law. Because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the health care reform law will lower the deficit, Democrats argued that repealing it would increase the deficit. The Democrats therefore invoked a point of order against the Republican amendment under budget rules that limit the ability of Congress to increase the deficit. That forced Republicans to try to waive the budget rules in this case, with the motion requiring 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to pass. The threshold proved out of reach for the Republicans, who hold 47 seats. Using the budget argument was a way for Democrats to say they voted for fiscal responsibility. Senator Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said before the vote that supporting the Republican amendment would be ""irresponsible"" and ""reckless."" ""The amendment will significantly worsen the deficit,"" Conrad said, noting that senators from both parties are calling for getting deficits and debt under control. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, the amendment's sponsor, responded that the public will understand that the vote was really against the repeal of health care reform. ""Only in Washington could you argue with a straight face that starting a new trillion-dollar entitlement program"" was a way to save money, McConnell said. While a repeal of the entire health care law won't move forward, Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting for the elimination of a rule, scheduled to take effect in 2012, that would require businesses to issue Form 1099s to any individual or corporation from which they buy more than $600 in goods or services in a year. Most liberals and conservatives view the rule as an unnecessary burden on private-sector employers. Wednesday's vote amounted to a push by Republicans to get Democratic opposition to a full repeal on the record in the form of votes against the amendment. Democrats concede the health care overhaul can be improved, but they oppose rolling back benefits for consumers. ""We're not going to go back and fight the battles of the last two years,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. ""We're not going to go backward. We're going to move forward."" Overall, the Republicans oppose the increased government role in regulating health care, claiming it will impinge on individuals' right to choose care options. Democrats say the law will better control skyrocketing health care costs and expand coverage to millions of people currently lacking health insurance. The push for an outright repeal is one of several strategies currently being pursued by the GOP leadership in order to undermine support for the law. Senate Republicans also introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow states to opt out of key provisions of the new health care law. Specifically, the bill would allow state governments to opt out of the so-called ""individual mandate"" requiring everyone to obtain health care coverage by 2014 or face penalties. It would also allow states to ignore new mandates regarding employer-based coverage, insurance benefits and an expansion of Medicaid. The motion was introduced one day after a federal judge in Florida issued a sweeping ruling against the law, siding with 26 states that had challenged the measure and setting up a likely Supreme Court challenge in the months ahead. A federal judge in eastern Virginia has also found the health care law unconstitutional, while two other federal judges, one in western Virginia and one in Michigan, have ruled the opposite. Twelve other federal judges have dismissed challenges to the law, according to the White House. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Ted Barrett, Dana Bash and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .","NEW: All 47 Republicans vote for repeal, while Democrats unite to defeat them .

"(CNN) -- A Greyhound bus accident along Interstate 80 in central Pennsylvania early Wednesday killed one person and injured more than 40, officials said. The incident happened in Union County south of Williamsport around 1:30 a.m., state police Trooper Matthew Burrows said. Five hospitals reported receiving a total of more than 40 patients from the accident. At least four of them were listed in critical condition Wednesday morning. The bus was traveling non-stop from New York to Ohio, carrying 49 passengers, a Greyhound spokesman said. The nature and cause of the incident weren't immediately clear; state police and a Greyhound spokesman told CNN only that it was under investigation. Westbound I-80 near the Williamsport exit was expected to remain closed until noon, Burrows said.","A Greyhound bus is involved in an accident on Interstate 80 in central Pennsylvania .

"(CNN) -- Only a few hours had passed after the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds, when this little nugget of inspiration showed up in my Twitter feed: . ""Back home. You know what? I'm going for a run. Definitely."" That tweet is from Peter Vigneron, a writer who was at the marathon when the bombs went off. Luckily, as he writes on his blog, he was far enough from the blasts to be safe. As the hours went by I started to see more online posts like that -- runners in Boston and elsewhere making pledges to lace up their sneakers and hit the road. It felt like a groundswell of grass-roots action, a collective statement that this tragedy, no matter who perpetrated it or why, wasn't going to stop people from doing what they love. iReport: Run for Boston 2014 . By Tuesday, people from Hong Kong, India, Canada, England, Croatia, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and the Netherlands were using the hashtag #runforboston and a Google doc created by CNN iReporter Becca Obergefell to log their journeys. The momentum has been building. As of early Tuesday afternoon, 360 people had logged more than 1,200 running miles on Obergefell's page. People also have been sharing their stories with her. ""I ran to clear my head, but it didn't work. So I ran because I could. Because the freedom of running wasn't taken away from me. Because the running community stretches to all cities and all places, and I'm glad to be a part of it,"" one person wrote to Obergefell, a 26-year-old in Columbus, Ohio. I heard these stories and got inspired. That's why I'm pledging to run a marathon in honor of Boston -- and, since I'm kind of a couch potato, I'm going to pledge to do it by April 15, 2014, the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy. I'd like to invite you to do the same. Sign up by going to the ""Run for Boston 2014"" page on CNN iReport and uploading a photo of you and your running shoes. Alternatively, post the photo to Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #runforboston and #cnnireport. If you're so inclined, tell us why you're running. You don't have to pledge to run a marathon. Run a mile or a 5K -- or do a walk. The important thing is to get out there and get moving. Do it for Boston. Do it for your health. Or, if you use the simple app called Charity Miles, you can do it to raise money for one of the several worthy charities it features. I'm doing it because I feel like I've got to do something. It's been 12 years since 9/11 and 18 years since the Oklahoma City bombing. I was safely miles away, in a middle school classroom, when a bomb exploded in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168. But that morning is stuck in my memory forever. I'm running because I don't want any of these tragedies to change me or to change us as a people -- to make us afraid, to keep us indoors. I am by no means a regular runner -- or even a runner at all. One of my friends saw a post about this idea on Facebook and thought I was joking. So please don't feel shy about signing up to do something new. I have no idea what I'm getting myself into -- and I think that's probably a good thing, at least for now. CNN also hopes to make a video about the collective journey -- and I'm running to see what it will be like to (hopefully) complete this challenge as a group. I could go on, but instead I'm going to go take a photo with my sneakers. And then hit the sidewalk. I hope you'll do the same. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D.

"(CNN) -- Nobody wants to underwhelm when it comes to their final words on this planet. ""Diane, toast me a bagel."" So if you knew the exact moment when you were going to die, you might put some serious thought into the matter and really nail it. Of course, you'd probably want to go out with something inspired and meaningful. Or perhaps a dark, secret confession. Maybe explain to your wife that, yes, you traded her stupid cat on Craigslist for a football phone. And, no, she can't have it when you're gone. The football phone goes in the casket. So does the dog. And whatever beer's in the fridge. It's all a little weird to consider, but if having this mortal information appeals to you, there's a popular new Kickstarter campaign that delivers this gift of death. More specifically, a wristwatch that counts down to your very last moment. It also keeps regular time. Which is good. Because if you miss your appointment for erotic massage, there's no refund. So I've heard. But its main job is still to remind you when you'll die. The watch, appropriately called Tikker, ""counts down your life, in order to make the world a better place."" And it's a heartwarming sentiment if you're into that kind of thing. Helping others and whatnot. I'm just not sure that if I suddenly knew I had 40 minutes to go, I'd quickly drop everything, grab a shovel and plant a tree. Truth be told, I'd probably sit around the house, watch some Netflix and wallow in self-doubt. You know. The usual. But the idea is that you might go out and be a better person if you had a bit more advance warning. Which is why Tikker hopes to inspire people by reminding them that ""death is non-negotiable"" and, as the days slip away, it's important to ""make the right decisions."" ""Today I am not wearing pants!"" Just be careful to make the ""right decision"" at home and not, say, Jamba Juice. Tikker comes from the mind of Fredrik Colting who, after his grandfather passed away several years ago, was inspired to create the ""death watch"" in his honor. Colting said: ""It made me think about death and the transience of life, and I realized that nothing matters when you are dead. Instead what matters is what we do when we are alive."" I nap a lot. Carpe diem. However, if you're even slightly more motivated than I am, and if knowing your expiration date is something you're into, setting up the Tikker death watch will be fairly straightforward. You simply fill out a questionnaire with inquiries about smoking, exercise and general health. That creates a special number from which you then subtract your age. And there you have it: the exact number of years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds until you take a big dirt nap. With apologies to the word ""exact."" Tikker is, perhaps, a bit odd, but it'll definitely be a good conversation starter at the company holiday party. And that's what Colting wants. ""The occurrence of death is no surprise to anyone, but in our modern society we rarely talk about it,"" he said. ""I think that if we were more aware of our own expiration, I'm sure we'd make better choices while we are alive."" At the time of this writing, with two weeks to go, pledges for the Tikker death watch are at just more than $70,000. Their goal was $25,000. So, clearly, people are pretty excited about confronting their demise. Though hopefully not enough to test it out with a moving train. ""I still have 30 years. Bring it, Amtrak!"" SMACK!

"The statistics are sobering: Heart disease is the number-one killer of women in the United States. And an estimated 8 million women have it. What's more, a new study shows that in recent years the overall heart disease risk for Americans -- especially women -- hasn't continued the healthy downward trend it showed in previous decades. There are steps you can take, at any age, to prevent heart disease, the #1 killer of US women. Ready for some good news? You can do more to prevent heart disease than almost any other serious condition. Start with these age-specific steps. The 30s . Declare a trans fat-free zone. Commonly used to extend the shelf life of packaged foods like cookies and crackers, and also found in margarine, trans fats pack a double whammy: they raise bad cholesterol (LDL), while lowering good, protective HDL (your LDL should be below 100; your HDL, above 60). In a Harvard University study, women with the highest level of trans fats in their blood had triple the risk of heart disease. Take a cue from major U.S. cities like New York and Philadelphia (which have banned trans fats from restaurants), and pitch them out of your pantry. On ingredient lists, they show up as ""hydrogenated"" and ""partially hydrogenated"" oils. But scrutinize any product touted as ""trans fat-free"" at the supermarket, too: some manufacturers have replaced hydrogenated oils with tropical oils that are high in saturated fat, which also raises LDL cholesterol. Eating out in a city where trans fats aren't banned? Skip the fried stuff -- many restaurants still use the oils for frying. Health.com: 10 best foods for your heart . Use your OB-GYN as a partner. During your prime reproductive years, you may visit your OB-GYN more than you go to your regular doctor. Make sure you talk to her about your heart as well as gynecological health, particularly because blood pressure (BP) can rise if you're taking birth control pills or when you're pregnant. Women who develop preeclampsia (pregnancy-related hypertension) are prone to heart disease later in life. And, in general, ""how your heart handles pregnancy offers a snapshot of how it will look in middle age,"" says Sharonne Hayes, M.D., director of the Women's Heart Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. To keep BP from creeping up (the safe zone is lower than 120 over 80), substitute herbs and spices for salt -- try cumin for a healthy twist on popcorn, for instance. Simmer down. If you boil over when the shopper in front of you has 16 grocery items in the 15-or-fewer lane, beware: Losing your temper can damage your arteries, according to research by C. Noel Bairey Merz, M.D., director of the Women's Heart Center and endowed chair in Women's Health at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, California. ""Raging causes your blood pressure to surge and stay up there,"" Merz says. That's why it's crucial to get a grip on anger at an early age, before it takes a toll. Learn now that, instead of venting when a situation makes you furious, you can take a few deep breaths and describe to yourself what's making you angry. That should help you calm down. The 40s . Don't skimp on sleep. When your hormones are fluctuating madly, it can be tough to nod off. It's no wonder, then, that more than half if women in their 40s suffer from insomnia at least a few nights a week. That's nothing to yawn about, either. When your body is deprived of restorative sleep, your heart has to work harder. And piles of studies show that too little shut-eye can lead to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and diabetes. How little is too little? A recent study in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggests that less than seven-and-a-half hours per night puts you at risk for heart disease. And recent research from Duke University found that women who take more than a half-hour to fall asleep or those who awaken frequently during the night have inflammation in their arteries and higher levels of insulin, two major risk factors for heart disease. The soporific Rx: Do your best to unwind with a relaxing bedtime routine, like listening to soothing music or soaking in a tub with bath salts. And, despite how difficult it might sound, obey this rule: no technology or work in the bedroom; your bed should be for sleep and sex only. Monitor your mood. Between the demands of work and family, it's easy to worry that something will fall through the cracks -- but don't let that something be your own peace of mind. Perimenopausal women have nearly double the risk for depression, and that spells trouble for their hearts, says Jennifer Mieres, M.D., a cardiologist and associate professor at New York University's School of Medicine. Uncontrolled stress can raise blood pressure and flood blood vessels with inflammatory chemicals, which in high doses can be toxic to the heart, while depression has been linked to hardening of the arteries. Then there are the unhealthy habits that come with stress and the blues: smoking, excessive drinking, and overeating. Smart medicine for your mood and your heart? Exercise. Thirty minutes of aerobic activity (walking, biking, swimming) most days of the week has been shown to reduce the symptoms of depression by about half, an effect comparable to antidepressant use, while lowering blood pressure and strengthening your cardiovascular system. But if you're feeling low more often than not, talk to your doctor about therapy, antidepressants, or St. John's wort. (New research suggests that this herb works as well as antidepressants and has few side effects.) Health.com: How safe, moderate exercise can keep your heart healthy . Get more fish, flaxseed, and fiber. In your 40s, as estrogen dips, your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat stored in the blood) start creeping up, making a heart-healthy menu more important than ever. Aim for two servings of fish, like salmon or tuna, each week for omega-3 fats; or pick omega-3-fortified foods like orange juice, margarine, and eggs. Also, sprinkle ground flaxseed on yogurt or cottage cheese to lower cholesterol. And experiment with dishes that contain high-fiber foods like apples, broccoli, beans, and bran cereal. Health fads come and go, but a high-fiber diet has consistently proven to be good for the heart, says Leslie Cho, M.D., director of the Women's Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Health.com: Recipes to help you 'fill up on fiber' The 50s plus . Whittle your waist. If a few extra pounds have settled around your middle since menopause, you're not alone. ""Basically, we start putting on weight more like men,"" says Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director of New York University's Women's Heart Program and author of Complete Guide to Women's Health. The ""meno potbelly"" is especially hard on the heart because it builds up around internal organs, triggers inflammation, and leads to insulin resistance. Research from the famous Nurses' Health Study found that women with a waist circumference of more than 35 inches were twice as likely to die of heart disease than women with a 28-inch waist, regardless of weight. Low-intensity workout routines can help slow down the belly buildup, but to shrink it you'll need to work up a sweat with 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least three times a week. Try jogging, walking on the treadmill on a challenging incline, or swimming laps. Enjoy some ""friend benefits."" Whatever causes you stress, leaning on friends for support and commiseration can help keep blood pressure in check. ""There are clearly good things that happen to your heart when you care about people and people care about you,"" Cedars-Sinai's Merz says. Talk out the stress with friends over a walk or at the gym, and you'll double your heart benefit. Stay strong. Since hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is no longer thought to protect your heart, and may even harm it (talk to your doctor about the risks if you decide to try it), you need to safeguard your heart with strong muscles. Add strength training -- like a weight-lifting class, yoga, or Pilates -- to your exercise routine at least twice a week, Goldberg recommends. You'll keep blood pressure in check, boost metabolism, zap more calories, control cholesterol, and improve endurance. Health.com: Strength exercises for any age . Sum total?

"(CNN) -- Left to babysit her 6-month-old granddaughter, a suburban Chicago woman instead turned on the infant, bludgeoning her and cutting her throat, prosecutors said Monday. Alfreda Giedrojc is being held without bail after a court appearance Monday afternoon, said Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for the Cook County State's Attorney's office. She was charged with first-degree murder in the death of her granddaughter, Simonton said. The girl's father brought her to Giedrojc's home in the southwestern suburb of Oak Lawn on Sunday while he helped with repairs on a nearby home, Simonton told CNN. ""Her father and grandfather had stepped out of the grandparents' house for a short time when this horrific event took place,"" Oak Lawn police said in a written statement on the death. While her husband was away, Giedrojc laid the child on the floor, pulled a sledgehammer from a nearby closet and swung it down on her head and body several times. She then picked the baby up and used a carving knife to slit her throat when she was still alive, Simonton said. Oak Lawn Det. Mike Kaufmann said the 61-year-old Giedrojc expressed remorse for the child's death when questioned, and investigators have found no record of previous arrests or mental illness.

"Washington (CNN) -- Newtown. Aurora. Columbine. Tucson. Virginia Tech. The tragic shootings in each of these and other towns have ignited public sentiment for some kind of gun reforms and fired up gun advocates to protect what they see as their constitutional right of easy access to firearms. According to recent polls, more than 90% of Americans favor some form of background checks for firearm purchases, particularly at gun shows, but the efficacy of the measure remains dubious by both law enforcement and gun control advocates. But, as Congress wrestles with what new measures -- if any -- should be passed to control gun purchases, one question looms: . In those and other mass shootings, would background checks have made any difference? How background checks work . Looking back, background checks did not stop three mass shootings that claimed more than 40 lives since 2011. In the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 26 people, mostly children, were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Adam Lanza used two semi-automatic handguns and a semi-automatic rifle. He didn't get a background check for those weapons. They were legally purchased and registered to his mother, Nancy Lanza, who was his first victim. Last July, James Holmes walked into a crowded theater in Aurora, Colorado, and began shooting. His AR-15, two 9 mm Glocks, .40 caliber pistol and 12-guage shotgun were all purchased legally, after his name was submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Twelve people were killed. The same is true with Jared Loughner, who shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 19 other people, killing six, in Tucson in January 2011. His application was never flagged when run through NICS -- the database from which potential firearms buyers are determined legally eligible to purchase a gun. NRA 'plucks the bird' to weaken gun proposals . ""The one shooter that might have been prevented by background checks and was not was the Virginia Tech shooter because he had, in fact, been adjudicated to be potentially violent,"" said National Rifle Association President David Keene. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people in 2007 on the picturesque Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, had been deemed mentally ill by a judge, which is one of the criteria used to disqualify certain people trying to buy a gun. Others who could be potentially disqualified include convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts and domestic abusers. Cho's case apparently slipped through the cracks and the state of Virginia has since instituted a series of reforms in its reporting procedures to NICS as a result. Cho might have been stopped if universal checks were the law, Vice President Joe Biden said. ""One of the problems that was pointed out here was that there was an adjudication of the young man that committed the crime at Virginia Tech, and yet he was able to go out and purchase two weapons,"" Biden said in January. The current Senate proposed bill called the ""Fix Gun Checks Act"" seeks to remedy the database deficiencies by forcing the states to become more involved in submitting names into the existing system. The sticking point with the proposal for many anti-gun control proponents is the requirement that background checks cover every firearm sold, whether at gun shows, the Internet or private sales. Sens. Joe Manchin III, D-West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, announced Wednesday a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun shows and Internet sales, but a similar agreement in the House is still unlikely. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who wrote the latest Senate bill, said his was an expansion of the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that banned military-style assault weapons for a decade before it expired. ""Every major expert believes that universal background checks will save lots of lives,"" Schumer told CNN. He added that 1.7 million people ""have gone to firearms dealers and been denied guns because they were felons or adjudicated mentally ill because of the Brady law."" But the NRA's Keene disagreed. ""The tipping point for all this gun control talk about background checks is actually an example of how background checks don't matter... [the] killer will find a way to get a gun even if he kills the owner.""","Mass shootings have ignited public sentiment for some kind of new gun control .
Examples of gunmen in recent mass shootings suggest background checks not a panacea.

Not always, mind you -- social media will, and should, continue to play an important role in our political discourse. But the trend has grown so quickly; I don't know that anyone has really stopped to consider the implications of moment-by-moment, real-time transparency. I would argue that what we've gotten is a trade-off, and the jury is still out on whether what we've lost is worth more than what we've gained in the process. So before I go about the process of destroying my company's business model, let's talk about what we've gained with social media. The Web and social media have created a level of transparency that never before existed in our country. People sitting at home can research complicated issues with a few clicks of a mouse. Online campaign disclosure databases make pay-for-play politics far more difficult to obfuscate. Instantaneous tweeting of shady government practices -- and the resulting uproar -- means that public bodies are more responsive than ever. But there's an unintended consequence, too, of over-democratization. Wait, you ask, how can we have too much democracy? Well for starters, we don't live in a democracy. We never have, nor should we. We live in a republic, where we elect people to take the tough votes and make the tough decisions for us. And quite honestly, politicians should have some level of flexibility to cast votes that -- gasp -- we might not like, without their every action becoming a referendum via Twitter and Facebook. A quote sometimes attributed incorrectly to Alexis de Toqueville goes, ""The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money."" Today the same sentiment could be said about the danger of shutting naysayers up on Twitter and Facebook. Too many politicians aren't voting their conscience, they're voting to placate blog commenters, and that's no way to run government. Secondly, it's one thing to see the sausage get made. It's another thing entirely to watch the pig get slaughtered. There's a domino effect when it comes to transparency. In policy making, lots of ideas are thrown out in order to set the good apart from the bad, and in order to stake out a position for compromise. Cynics would refer to it as ""backroom deal-making in a smoke-filled room."" But here's the harsh reality -- that's how bills get passed. And it's how every important collaborative effort since the dawn of the written word has been achieved. After all, do you think the Constitution would have ever been written if Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton had Twitter accounts? Third, government by social media leads to an environment where in every setting a politician has to be ""on."" When politicians are hashing out ideas, those ideas can range somewhere between politically untenable and electorally suicidal. Once they're tweeted -- be it by a journalist or a rival politician -- they become TV ad, direct mail, and attack e-mail fodder. During the discussion, an idea is thrown out about ""What would be the implication of zeroing out funding for popular program X?"" Suddenly, that politician is facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative ads back home, telling his constituents that he ""considered"" or ""proposed"" eliminating X. Two weeks ago, Mitt Romney made a passing reference to eliminating HUD. It won't be long before President Obama's team is cutting ads about Romney ""proposing"" that we leave millions of Americans homeless. Factually accurate? Sure, but misleading as hell. The result is a political discourse that is becoming devoid of real ideas, and instead pared down to the safest of talking points. And because most politicians draw their own districts to shield against a viable challenge from the opposite party, they are far more susceptible to electoral defeat in the summer than they are in the fall. Their audience in everything they do is the primary voter, not the swing voter. So the rhetoric throughout the year from both parties is increasingly divisive, increasingly partisan, and increasingly destructive to any kind of progress. Is any of this a product of social media? No, absolutely not. American politics have been trending this way for decades. But technology has expedited our descent toward a political system devoid of real ideas and bold, controversial thought. As the use of social media accelerates, it's incumbent upon everyone involved in the political process to make sure its power is used to harness everything good about the American political system, rather than to hasten political trends that are hurting our republic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wesley Donehue.","Wesley Donehue: Social media gives people unprecedented ability to see political process .

"(CNN) -- All nine teenagers who were sought in an Amber Alert are with their parents, according to the lawyer for a New Mexico youth ranch. On Saturday, police said they had confirmed that four of the nine were in their parents' custody. The other five were accounted for Sunday, state police said. The nine teens were attending a facility for troubled youths called the Tierra Blanca Ranch, and authorities began searching for them after receiving allegations of abuse, police say. Pete Domenici, the attorney for the ranch, told CNN early Sunday morning that the teens were all with their parents and have been for ""many, many hours."" ""The five remaining kids on the state police Amber Alert have all been with their parents for over 24 hours. One boy who is still listed as part of the active Amber Alert, has been with his parents since Wednesday."" CNN has reached out to police for comment regarding Domenici's claims. Earlier, authorities had said they would keep the alert active until they could confirm the teens' whereabouts. The incident started Friday, when state police investigators went to the ranch to execute a search warrant and investigate claims of abuse, authorities said. The youths were not at the ranch and neither was Scott Chandler, the ranch director, the New Mexico State Police said. Domenici said the teens had just gone on a trip and nothing was wrong. ""The boys from the Tierra Blanca Ranch have been on a previously scheduled activity away from the ranch for several days,"" Domenici said. ""They do this regularly, have for years,"" he said. ""Three teachers were part of the trip."" Despite the attorney's statement, the Amber Alert was not rescinded. State police on Saturday urged Chandler and the parents of the missing boys to contact them. ""This is still an active investigation,"" said state police Sgt. Emmanuel Gutierrez. ""We have not visually seen these kids to confirm their whereabouts, which is why the Amber Alert remains active."" The confusion seems to stem from allegations of abuse of the teens at the ranch, CNN affiliate KRQE reported. ""We have allegations of abuse,"" New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said, according to KRQE. ""We're required by law to investigate, and when you suddenly show up to the place and everybody's gone, it's of huge concern to us."" State officials were investigating claims that youths at the camp had been threatened, shackled and beaten, the affiliate said. Chandler has denied these claims, his attorney said, and he has filed suit against the state for the handling of the case, KRQE reported. The ranch director tried to resolve the situation in court, but a hearing had been delayed, the lawyer said. The Tierra Blanca Ranch in unincorporated Hillsboro, New Mexico, is a 30,000-acre facility that bills itself as a ""new beginning for troubled at-risk youth,"" according to its website. ""For almost 20 years, this beautiful and historic ranch has been the setting of Chandler family efforts to work with troubled and at-risk youths.""

"(CNN) -- In his first post-Election Day interview, President Bush spoke to CNN's Heidi Collins on Tuesday aboard the Intrepid, a former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier where he was commemorating Veterans Day. He reflected on his presidency and the transition in the works with President-elect Barack Obama. President Bush says he has always been proud of America's volunteer military force. Here is a transcript of the interview. The president began by talking about his feelings for the troops. President Bush: Being the commander in chief is as high an honor as you can possibly imagine and I have given it my all to support our military and to support our veterans. What does that mean? It means going to Congress and saying let's make sure our military families have good housing, health care, educational benefits. It means helping to work with the Congress to get money for our veterans, but it really means saying to our troops, ""I will make decisions based on what is best for our country, not what is best for me politically."" I don't want your troops thinking that the decisions I have made were about politics or about my standing. The decisions were made how to secure this country, how to protect ourselves from the long run. And that was important for those troops to know that their commander in chief not only supported them but stood with them in their mission . CNN: As you stand with them in their mission there are two months left of your presidency. How will that feel to leave office in the middle of two wars?  Watch Bush discuss his regrets » . Bush: I'm trying to figure it out because there's a lot going on. We've got an economic situation, the campaign just ended, we still have troops in harm's way. I'll be meeting with families of the fallen today. This job will end on January 20 and so this is a better question answered on the 21st. I'm not sure what to tell you because I know I'm going to go from 100 mph to near zero overnight. I'm not sure what to expect. I know I'll miss certain things about the presidency. I also know I'm looking forward to getting home, so I've got mixed emotions. CNN: What will you tell -- and maybe you talked about this yesterday with President-elect Obama -- about taking care of America's veterans and active servicemen and women? Bush: To the extent that he asked my advice -- and he may want to ask it again -- and the best way to make sure he feels comfortable asking it again is for me not to tell you in the first place on what I advised him. We had a very private conversation. It was relaxed. It was interesting to watch someone that is getting ready to assume the office of the president. It will be a fantastic experience for he and his family. He didn't need my advice about supporting the military. He knows he must do that. We had a good conversation. I was very pleased. Remember the conversation I had with my predecessor Bill Clinton, as a matter of fact called him yesterday and said, Bill, I'm getting ready to meet with the new president and I remember how gracious you were to me. I hope I can be as gracious to President-elect Obama as you were to me. It was interesting yesterday. One of the things President-elect Obama was interested in, after we had our policy discussions, was his little girls, how would they like the White House. It was interesting to watch him go upstairs. He wanted to see where his little girls were going to sleep. Clearly this guy is going to bring a sense of family to the White House and I hope Laura and I did the same thing, but I believe he will and I know his girls are on his mind and he wants to make sure that first and foremost he is a good dad. And I think that's going to be an important part of his presidency . CNN: This is your first interview since the election. I want to ask you, how did you think that turned out? What was your impression? Bush: My choice didn't win. I was for John McCain. I thought he battled hard, but I meant what I said after the election, that the election of Barack Obama is an historic moment for our country. There are a lot of people in America who did not believe they would ever see this day. It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity. I really do wish him all the best. I am just as American as he is American and it is good for our country that the president succeeds. The transition that we are working on is a genuine effort to help him be able to deal with the pressures and the complicated issues of the presidency. CNN: Where do you see this country in four years? Bush: You know, it's hard to tell. I am pretty confident that we will recover from the economic times. That Iraq will be a symbol of freedom, that Afghanistan will improve. There's a -- the country will be secure. It's gonna be very important for the president and the Congress to work together to make the decisions so that we can succeed in keeping us secure and helping us regain our prosperity. CNN: I have heard you say many times in the past: ""I don't look at polls. I like to do what I want to do."" The polling -- are up and down, all over the map. Do you ever get disappointed? Does it make you feel a certain way? Bush: I think a president who tries to be popular is a president who could fail the country. And I remind people popularity is fleeting. Principles are forever. And there've been times when I've been popular and times when I haven't been popular. But the job of the president is to make good, tough decisions based upon solid principles that are etched in his soul. I know there's this kind of preoccupation by some by popularity polls, but for me they're just moments, they come and go. But what doesn't change [is] what you believe and can you defend those beliefs. And I assure you, as president of the United States you better have a core set of beliefs, because a lot of people are watching you and they are trying to determine where America will stand. A lot of people inside the White House, they are trying to determine whether this person is going to be making decisions based upon core principles or whether the person is going to be all over the map trying to chase popularity. CNN: If those are principles that you have considered your whole life and coming into this office and they are near and dear to you, I imagine you probably have a moment in your presidency that you are most proud of, and a moment I'm sure you most regret. Bush: I regret saying some things I shouldn't have said. CNN: Like? Bush: Like ""dead or alive,"" or ""bring 'em on."" And, by the way, my wife reminded me as president of the United States, you better be careful what you say. I was trying to convey a message. I could have conveyed it more artfully. Being on this ship reminds me of when I went to the USS Abraham Lincoln and they had a sign that said ""Mission Accomplished."" I regret that sign was there. It was a sign aimed at the sailors on the ship, but it conveyed a broader knowledge. To some it said, well, Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over, when I didn't think that. But nonetheless, it conveyed the wrong message. So, there are things I've regretted. I've had a lot of reasons to be proud, I guess is the right word. I'm proud every time I stand in front of the United States military. I am proud to be the commander in chief of people who are so selfless and so courageous that they would volunteer to serve our country in a time of war. I'm proud when I see people feed the hungry. I'm proud when I'm in Africa and see volunteers helping those citizens dying of HIV/AIDS. I'm proud to know that there are young kids raising money to buy mosquito nets to help fight malaria on the continent of Africa. I cannot tell you what an inspiring experience it has been to be the president of this country, because we are a nation full of generous, courageous, decent people . CNN: So, after all of this, what is next for you? Bush: I'll probably get back and take a deep breath and I haven't had much time to really settle down and figure out what life's going be like after this. I know I'm going be in Texas. No doubt I'm heading straight home. I miss Texas. I love Texas. I've got lots of friends in Texas. I will probably write a book. I know I'm going to build a policy institute and a library at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. And other than that, I'm not quite sure yet. CNN: Do you have an outline for that book yet? What's it going to look like? Bush: I'm beginning to think about it, you know. I'm beginning to think about it. I want people to know what it's like to make some of the decisions I had to make. What was the moment like. I've had one of these presidencies where I had to make some tough calls. I want people to know the truth about what it was like sitting in the Oval Office, but it's going take a lot of thought and a lot of work to get it out and it will be an interesting project.","In CNN interview, president reflects on his term .

"(CNN) -- Vladimir Putin may not be the best defender of a free press, but the well-traveled former recruit of the KGB knows how things work abroad. In America, he has learnt, drawing attention to your point of view does not necessarily imply jailing or inflicting bodily harm to your dissenters but may be as simple as submitting an op-ed to the New York Times. That is exactly what happened on September 11, when the renowned peacemaker of Chechnya advised Barack Obama to ""stop the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement"" on the matter of Syria. READ MORE: Putin 1, Obama 0? This was a sweet topic of conversation and an interesting response to Obama's address to the nation the night before, but the Russian president also criticized his counterpart for having mentioned ""American Exceptionalism"" as a justification for using force or imposing its views on other sovereign countries. There, Putin may have a point. The American exception may be obvious to Americans, but it has always been a subject of conjecture for everyone else. Simple sense of superiority? Candid idealism? Cynical expression of self-interest? In the eyes of foreigners, the concept varied according to who in America mentioned it, when it was used, and what country, rich or poor, had to deal with it. Adding to the complication, the Americans may disagree on its meaning. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio celebrity, immediately said that Obama had no idea what the American Exceptionalism is. Nevertheless, the president, on September 10, used its most classical Wilsonian definition, after describing the fate of gassed Syrian children. He meant that America has a heart of gold, and more than any other nation, the cruise missiles to prove it. Moral ambitions or pretentions, coupled with overwhelming force. A recipe for success, or, to say the least, disappointments. As a European child, I was raised in the epic of the GIs of D-Day crushing Nazis, but soon, in 1973, I noticed new kids had arrived in my school in a working class suburb of Paris. They came from Chile, sometimes with only one parent because the other one had been shot dead or was being tortured in Santiago. Their former president, I understood, was not to the liking of the American government of the times. As an adult, and a journalist, I could see the same post-Vietnam superpower set sail to Somalia at the request of public opinion and pack its bag at the first casualties, abandon the Rwandan Tutsis ( much like every western power) before making good on its promises against the Serbs. All this to say that American Exceptionalism was only rarely exceptional. The myth even took a fatal beating in Iraq under George W. Bush, and worse, was shamed by the nonsense of Guantanamo and the sordid exactions of the Baghram prison in Afghanistan. Barack Obama on September 10 had at least the courage to try to invoke the mythology. But the damage is done. An example: Human rights organizations, mostly born in the United States in the 1970s, focused back then their action on prodding the American government to use its power and influence to reform rogue regimes abroad. This is simply impossible today because of the terrible deficit of credibility of Washington in this matter. Now, these organizations have to build up their power by themselves, and multiply foreign bureaus at great cost to obtain results and try to save lives. The reactions to Putin's op-ed proves that he hit a nerve in the United States. The American Exceptionalism, understood as a sense of entitlement, superiority, uniqueness and sometimes immunity to any positive foreign influence is also shaken in the homeland. For long, I had been unable to discuss the tax system, the lack of universal health care, the humongous price of cable or the technology of washing machines without receiving a dreadful glare from American friends, followed by a fatalist and severe ""that's the way we do things here."" It is easier now. Good news, the American way seems to follow some of the ways of the world, much as the sacred and mythical ""French model"" meets reality. America, the new free society deemed exceptional by Tocqueville, was a pioneer in countless domains, like technology, education and justice, before suffocating and declining in its superb and often trivial isolation. Its values? The country that sent humans to the moon seems now, for the first time in decades, willing to temper ideologies to repair its bridges and roads. The Mecca of medical innovation tries to tackle its dismal public health problems. The birthplace of juvenile justice ended up locking its kids for life without parole. But the Supreme Court is slowly amending mandatory sentences to simply adapt to the mores of most developed societies, as the attorney general, for the first time, dares to take a look at the 2.4 million American detainees. A world record and a terrible American exception. Another sign of change? In the ""Newsroom,"" the HBO series from 2012 by Aaron Sorkin, the main character, Will McAvoy, a disillusioned star anchorman, is asked ""why is America the greatest country in the world?"" His totally nostalgic and enraged answer paints the failed, or imaginary, good old times of American Exceptionalism: ""We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore."" But the rant was on TV. It made news, which is, whatever says Mr. Putin, a very good omen for America. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Philippe Coste.","Vladimir Putin's op-ed in the New York Times disputed the idea of American 'exceptionalism'

"(CNN) -- You know about the obvious impacts of the government shutdown: federal workers idled, offices closed, funding disrupted for all sorts of activities. But some of the impacts are less obvious, more outrageous, or a little bit of both. Here's a sampling of some of the spinoff effects of the shutdown showdown in Washington: . State Department defends $5 million for high-end glassware . Shuttered Websites . In the digital equivalent of throwing a sheet over unused furniture, many federal agencies have replaced their websites and all the information on them with static pages announcing the government shutdown. Whether a website will be up or not, however, is something of a guessing game. The National Parks Service site is down. It sends visitors to the Department of Interior's website, which is up but not being updated. The Department of Justice website is up, but the website for its subordinate agency, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, greets visitors with a stark white page reading, ""Due to the lapse in federal funding, this Office of Justice Programs (OJP) website is unavailable."" That you can still reach the websites mean the computers that serve the data are still up and running, and the government is either paying a private company to operate them or they're using taxpayer-funded power to continue running. But it doesn't matter if running the sites with big ""closed"" sign draped across the front costs the same or even more than letting them run, the White House said in a September 17 memo to federal employees. ""The determination of which services continue during an appropriations lapse is not affected by whether the costs of shutdown exceed the costs of maintaining services,"" according to the memo. Icing Antarctic research . While NASA has the okay to keep supporting U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station, the same apparently isn't true of scientists at what may be the United States' next most desolate outpost: Antarctica. The National Science Foundation said Wednesday that it would run out of money to keep the U.S. Antarctic Program going by October 14. So it's putting the program into ""caretaker status,"" leaving research stations and other facilities staffed with only the bare number of people necessary to ""ensure human safety and preserve government property,"" the agency said. That means many of the scientists who would be heading to the program's Antarctic research stations to work over the Southern Hemisphere's summer, which begins in December and runs February, are in limbo. The agency says it will try to restart the research program once funding resumes, but says that it could be tough once seasonal workers are let go and the seasonal window to do some of the work has passed. Emptiest catch . The shutdown also could make its way to your seafood dinner plate. Without federal employees to set rules and quotas for the fishing season, crab fleets in Alaska are in limbo -- unsure whether they'll be able to head out in pursuit of lucrative crab that bring in millions of dollars each season. A delay of even a few days could be costly, Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington, said in a House speech last week. Her district includes the home port for some of the fleets that fish for Bering Sea crab. What you need to know today . ""A delay could mean they'll miss out exporting to the all-important Asian holiday market when demand is at its highest and most lucrative,"" she said. That could cost the industry millions, dealing it what she called a ""crippling blow."" One fishing captain told CNN affiliate KIRO that the delay threatens what they call the ""Super Bowl of crab fishing."" ""We think of a lot of other things besides the government affecting our fishing -- weather, boats, crew,"" said Capt. Moore Dye of the fishing vessel Western Mariner. ""This has really caught us off guard."" No shutdown for House gym rats . Move along, nothing to see . No, the Obama administration has not deployed helicopters to hover in front of Mount Rushmore National Monument with a giant, view-obscuring sheet, as the rumor-busting site snopes.com debunked last week. But federal officials did -- for a time at least -- put traffic cones up at a pull-off where people stop to view the carving from a distance. Depending on whom you ask, the cones were either to block motorists from pulling off or to guide them into viewing areas. ""They won't even let you pull off on the side of the road,"" the Argus Leader newspaper in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, quoted state Tourism Department Secretary Jim Hagen as saying. ""I just don't know what they're trying to accomplish."" The newspaper said park officials told the state the cones were meant only to channel motorists into viewing sites. They went up October 1, the day the shutdown began. Federal officials removed the cones for at least a while after a snowstorm hit and crews needed to plow the roads, the newspaper reported. ""Once the snow's off the ground, we're going to be keeping an eye on how the cones go up,"" the newspaper quoted the governor's chief of staff, Dusty Johnson, as saying. On shutdown's 9th day, survivors of fallen troops take center stage . Don't go in there . The area around the Grand Canyon is a ghost town. It's no different inside, and park rangers are working to keep it that way, according to The Republic newspaper in Arizona. Park officials have written about two dozen citations for people trying to sneak into the park. Some have been caught at the canyon's South Rim, others on trails or attempting hikes, the newspaper reported. Shutdown leaves ranchers in the cold, blizzard kills their cattle . Don't 'recreate' According to the Eagle-Tribune newspaper of North Andover, Massachusetts, tourist Pat Vaillancourt said National Park Service Guards held her tour group under armed guard in a Yellowstone National Park hotel and brusquely told tourists who had filed off their bus to take pictures of bison that they weren't to ""recreate."" The tour guide argued to rangers that the tourists -- some of them from overseas -- weren't ""recreating,"" just taking pictures. ""She responded and said, 'Sir, you are recreating,' and her tone became very aggressive,"" the newspaper quoted Vaillancourt as saying. Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash, who despite being furloughed was asked by park officials to respond to some media inquiries when available, said hotel guests were never held under armed guard. He acknowledged that tourists were frustrated by limitations imposed by the shutdown -- he said parks officials were, as well. Ted Cruz: Democrats' new bogeyman . And stay out! A Nevada couple said they were kicked out of their home in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, CNN affiliate KTNV reports. Retirees Joyce and Ralph Spencer own a cabin on federal land, and were told last week they had 24 hours to clear out and stay out until the government reopens. Park officials gave KTNV a statement saying overnight stays are not allowed in the park until funding is restored, but said owners can visit their properties to retrieve belongings. While the decision has angered some commenters on KTNV's story -- some of whom suggested the decision to kick out property owners was made out of spite and encouraged the couple to sue -- Joyce Spencer said they're taking the situation in stride. While they'd like to be allowed back in their home, the worst impact has been that she had to buy her husband new clothes they forgot while packing up to leave their cabin. ""We're not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants,"" she told KTNV.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a congressional version of hot potato, the Senate on Friday passed a short-term spending plan that would prevent a looming government shutdown and sent it to the House for a weekend showdown between Republican tea party conservatives and their more moderate party leaders. The 54-44 vote on strict party lines came after Senate Democrats pushed through an amendment to restore funding for Obamacare that House Republicans had eliminated in their version of the spending measure, which would prevent the start of a government shutdown on Tuesday. Now House Speaker John Boehner must decide whether to urge his divided Republican caucus to vote with Democrats to pass the Senate plan, or yield again to a hardline conservative wing that demands making continued government funding contingent on undermining Obamacare. Cruz loses filibuster bid . The Senate began its votes Friday by easily overcoming a filibuster led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas against the spending plan. Cruz waged a 21-hour floor speech this week against Obamacare, but 25 more moderate Republicans rejected his tactics in voting with Democrats on Friday to move ahead on the measure. All but two of the other Senate Republicans then joined Cruz in opposing the Democratic amendment to restore Obamacare funding, as well as in the vote for final approval. The other two Republicans -- Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of Utah -- were out of town. Boehner indicated Thursday the House could revise the Senate's version and send that back, a move that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned would result in at least the start of a government shutdown because of the time it would take to reconsider the proposal. Cruz said Friday he expected his GOP colleagues in the House to continue the fight by revising the spending plan, which would mean ""this issue is coming back to the Senate."" In Friday's votes, Democrats facing re-election next year in conservative-leaning states such as Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina all resisted Republican pressure to buck their party over the Obamacare funding. After the Senate vote on the spending plan, President Barack Obama criticized Republicans for using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage in trying to defund Obamacare. ""The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they have threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act,"" Obama said, adding: ""That's not going to happen."" He noted new exchanges for private health insurance under the law will open next week as scheduled even if there is a government shutdown, calling it ""a done deal."" Exclusive: Romney disagrees with GOP tactics . The revised spending measure approved by the Senate -- called a continuing resolution -- would fund the government through mid-November, more than six weeks into the new fiscal year that begins Tuesday. Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski said the goal now was to work out a broader spending plan for the rest of fiscal 2014 that would ease the impact of forced cuts to the military and other government programs. House GOP split . Republican leaders in both chambers don't want a shutdown now over the spending issue, for political and negotiating reasons. They fear the optics of Republicans being blamed for a shutdown, and also want to exert as much leverage as possible for the GOP's agenda at the upcoming deadline to raise the federal debt limit. However, Boehner needs backing from the 40 or so tea party conservatives in the House in order to have a spending plan pass with full support from his Republican caucus. Their opposition to the Senate version that had included funding for Obamacare would mean the measure could only pass the House with support from all Democrats and some Republicans, which would further weaken Boehner's already shaky leadership of his caucus. The brinksmanship highlights the division within the Republican Party over how best to attack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, which was pushed through Congress by majority Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Tea party conservatives want to halt Obamacare now, just as full implementation of its individual health care exchanges begins in the new fiscal year starting Tuesday. In the Senate, veteran Republican conservatives such as John Cornyn of Texas oppose the tea party strategy of linking the Obamacare funding to a possible government shutdown. ""There are some people across America that are so upset with Obamacare -- and I understand their frustration -- that they say we ought to shut down the federal government,"" Cornyn said, adding that the Congressional Research Service had determined the health care reforms would be funded even if there was government shutdown ""because there are alternate sources of revenue that could be used to keep it going. ""So I say to my friends who say we ought to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare that it won't work,"" he said. Democrats slam GOP tactics . Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa called on House Republicans to ""be responsible and forget about kid's games like picking up their marbles and going home or throwing a temper tantrum or shutting down the government because you can't get your way."" On Thursday, Boehner had to delay their plan to introduce a bill to raise the nation's debt limit after conservatives complained the proposed package failed to include enough budget cuts and significant changes to entitlement programs. The Obama administration says the debt ceiling must be increased by October 17 to ensure the government can pay all its bills. Boehner signals GOP focus now on debt ceiling . Boehner and his top lieutenants initially hoped to move ahead with their proposal to permit Washington to borrow more money to pay its bills as soon as Friday. The initial proposal by House GOP leaders, which would raise the debt ceiling for a year, included a lengthy list of GOP priorities including a one year delay of Obamacare, provisions to roll back regulations on businesses, tax reforms, and approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. However, conservatives wanted more. ""It definitely has a lot of goodies in it, things that arguably would grow the economy and would arguably would generate more revenue,"" GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told reporters, adding he was undecided on whether to support it. ""Washington has a spending problem and this debt ceiling bill does not address the problem."" Another Republican, Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, told CNN that she was also undecided but wanted to see deeper budget cuts on the measure. ""I came here to cut spending and to reduce the size of the federal government, so when those opportunities arise I want to take advantage of them,"" Lummis said. When asked Thursday about the scope of cuts, Boehner told reporters that ""in this bill, we have spending cuts and we have issues that will help spur more economic growth. We think the balance is correct."" Obama said Friday that the GOP strategy amounts to threatening to ""burn the house down simply because you haven't gotten 100% of your way."" ""That's not how our democracy is supposed to work,"" he said, repeating his past insistence that he will not negotiate under threat of a U.S. default because Congress failed to increase the debt ceiling. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday a one-year delay in implementing Obamacare's individual mandate for people to obtain health insurance would undermine a key provision of the program that prohibits the denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions. ""The fact is you have to make the system work,"" Carney said, adding people with pre-existing conditions won't be denied insurance under Obamacare ""because of the expansion of the number of people who will be covered and participate in these marketplaces provided by the Affordable Care Act through the individual mandate."" Some House Republicans questioned the strategy of proceeding to the debt ceiling fight before Congress resolved the question on spending and the possible shutdown. They argued the GOP still had some leverage to force a change to Obamacare on that measure. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said Thursday that focusing on the debt ceiling was where House Republicans ""wanted to wage this fight all along."" ""They didn't want to get bogged down in the government shutdown fight, but a conservative revolt within the House Republican ranks forced them to get there,"" King said. Analysts warn of severe economic impact from any doubt cast over whether the United States would fail to meet its debt obligations. A similar bout of congressional brinksmanship over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.

"(CNN) -- When James Cameron's box office smasher ""Avatar"" first hit theaters in 2009, fans couldn't stop raving about the special effects used to bring Pandora, the beautiful home of the blue-skinned Na'vi, to the big screen. Disney, which has stepped up to give visitors a real-life version of Pandora, just announced that Avatar land -- yet to receive an official name -- will open in 2017 at Walt Disney World Resort's Animal Kingdom. Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Tom Staggs unveiled the first images of the park during the D23 Expo at Tokyo Disney Resort over the weekend. ""As these concept renderings show in epic scale, in the world of Avatar guests will encounter awe-inspiring floating mountains and wander through a nighttime jungle of bioluminescent plants that are alive with light and sound,"" said Staggs in a blog post. ""Guests will also discover what it feels like to soar into the sky riding a banshee."" The Avatar-themed land is being developed by Walt Disney Imagineering alongside filmmaker Cameron and Lightstorm Entertainment. Disney first announced plans for the attraction back in September 2011. ""As I walked through the park, I kept imagining Pandora coming to life all around me and found my mind racing with all the possibilities of what we will be able to create in the years ahead,"" said Cameron during his site visit in October that year. ""Disney's Animal Kingdom is truly a remarkable place and I can't think of a better home for our first Avatar experience."" As part of the largest expansion in the history of the Animal Kingdom park, which opened at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida in 1998, Disney will also be adding new entertainment experiences including a night show with music, floating lanterns, water screens and swirling animal imagery, said Staggs. More Avatar movies to come . ""Avatar"" is the world's highest grossing movie of all time, bringing in more than $2.7 billion worldwide. In July, Fox announced the studio will release three sequels. Production will begin in 2014, with the movies due for release in 2016, 2017 and 2018. When the first ""Avatar"" was released, many fans reportedly experienced depression because they longed to enjoy the beauty of Pandora themselves. Should a similar phenomenon occur following the next three releases, they'll have a place to go to sate their cravings.","Avatar-themed attraction set to open at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom in 2017 .

"(CNN) -- Life after ""The O.C."" has been rocky, to say the least, for Mischa Barton. The 27-year-old actress was one of the hottest TV stars out about a decade ago, but since her reign as ""The O.C.'s"" Marissa Cooper, Barton has had a ""full-on breakdown,"" she tells People magazine in its new issue. The actress recounted how, in July 2009, her parents and agents confronted her with their concern that she was working too hard and partying even harder. During the intervention, Barton blacked out and was sent to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Along the way, she threatened to kill herself, which prompted her being sent to a psychiatric ward for four days. ""It was a full-on breakdown,"" Barton said. ""It was terrifying. Straight out of 'Girl, Interrupted.' Story of my life."" The actress said she was never actually suicidal, just ""overworked and depressed. But one slip of the tongue in a heightened moment, and you find yourself in that situation."" Yet that situation also allowed her to gain some clarity about her life, she told the magazine. ""I was deeply hurt at first,"" Barton recalled, ""and then I accepted this was time I needed to be away from work, my family and all the pressure. I had been through the wringer."" The star also opened up about coping with the public's scrutiny of her weight: ""It was always, 'She's too skinny, she must be sick.' Then it was, 'She's too big.' I was never the right weight."" Born in London, Barton landed the role of Cooper on the Fox prime-time soap when she was 16. It seemed that overnight, she and her parents, who also hail from the United Kingdom, were thrown into ""this situation that was completely foreign,"" she said. ""Nothing could prepare (my parents) to have their children jump into the overtly sexualized and crazy world of L.A. ... It was a train I could not get off of. When you're young, you can do it, but after a while, it's going to come crashing down on you."" But Barton did eventually exit that fast life, and she headed to Paris to recuperate. ""I needed to be on my own and get healthy,"" Barton said. ""I just try to be balanced. ... I needed to take this time for me. ... I've learned a lot. I'm stronger now, and I'm excited for what's ahead.""","Mischa Barton says she had a ""full-on breakdown"" after ""The O.C.""

"(CNN) -- As a historian and a former speaker of the House who negotiated successfully through two government shutdowns, a successful welfare reform bill, the first tax cut in 16 years and four balanced budgets, I am offended and a little frightened by President Barack Obama's deliberate dishonesty about the debt ceiling. On Wednesday, speaking to the Business Roundtable, Obama said: . ""You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt being used to extort a president or a governing party and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and nothing to do with the debt."" This is just plain false, and he knows it. That he would say something so factually false in a prepared text is very worrisome. First of all, issues such as Obamacare don't have ""nothing to do with the budget"" and the idea that it is unusual for Congress to bring them into the debt ceiling debate is absurd. Far from having ""nothing to do with the budget and nothing to do with the debt,"" Obamacare is a major part of the budget, and it is now projected to cost twice what the president promised. The president's historical claim is completely wrong, as well. Let's set the record straight. Debt ceilings have been used since President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s to enable conservatives to put limits on government spending. The concept of using the debt ceiling as a vehicle to force negotiations really took off under President Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Under President Ronald Reagan, one of the most important changes in spending, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, was attached to a debt ceiling provision. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton also signed debt limit increases tied to spending agreements. When we reached a deal to balance the budget 1997, it included a debt limit increase. As Speaker John Boehner pointed out, ""In fact, every major effort to deal with the deficit over the past 30 years has been tied to the debt limit."" Of course, Obama himself has signed a debt ceiling increase with amendments attached to it. This is not a dictatorship. The president cannot dictate. The structure of our Constitution requires negotiations between the president and the Congress to get anything done. It is very troubling that the president would adopt a ""no-negotiation"" strategy and then deceive the American people about the history of negotiations on the debt ceiling. It is especially bizarre that Obama eagerly negotiates with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad but considers the elected leaders of the American Congress unworthy negotiators. As Reagan said in his 1964 speech ""A Time for Choosing"": ""The trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so."" Anyone who tells you tying the debt ceiling increase to spending agreements is unprecedented knows something that just isn't so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich says Obama wrongly claims debt limit hasn't been subject to negotiations .
He says president is wrong in saying Obamacare isn't relevant to the budget .
Gingrich says there's long history of presidents negotiating with Congress on debt limit .
Gingrich: If Obama can negotiate with Putin and al-Assad, he should negotiate with Congress ."
"(CNN) -- There is a story that the first time a Persian 'Qajar dynasty' king attended a concert during a European tour, he was asked what he liked most about it. ""The beginning,"" he answered, having assumed that the sound check was part of the performance. A similar incident happened during the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week. It was a good opportunity to bring together the Obama and Rouhani administrations in order to tune their instruments. While vague expressions such as ""cautious optimism"" were tossed around in the media, in reality some American and Iranian journalists -- and political analysts -- were waiting to hear a symphony orchestra performance. This unrealistic enthusiasm was evident in the focus and media speculation given to the story of Presidents Hassan Rouhani and Barack Obama accidentally -- but apparently on purpose -- bumping into each other. At midnight Tehran time (the early hours of Tuesday morning in New York, the same day that world leaders were about to attend the U.N. luncheon) Shargh, an Iranian reformist newspaper, hurriedly decided to publish a second version of its front-page story reporting a meeting between the two presidents. On Wednesday, the disappointed journalists published a wishful and envious headline that read ""Perhaps Another Time!"" Investing in the probability of a handshake, which would have been symbolically significant despite having little value in terms of political reality, raises a more serious concern. Did Obama and Hugo Chavez shaking hands change U.S.-Venezuela relations? Having such expectations of diplomacy is like a Persian proverb -- blowing the horn from the bell instead of the mouthpiece. At a time when our traditional slow and gradual courtship process has been replaced by online dating followed by an instant hook-up, it is not surprising to expect overnight miracles in diplomacy. Read more: Iranians warm to possible thaw . Let's take a look at another example. From the day President Nixon took office in 1969, he wanted to end 23 years of U.S.-China hostility. But he did not shake hands with Mao until after planning, and two trips to China, including one secret visit by his National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger. Winston Lord, a member of the National Security Council's planning staff who was with Nixon on that trip says the Chinese reception was ""sort of anticlimactic."" He adds: ""There wasn't the color and excitement that one expected."" President Obama and Rouhani did tune their instruments during their speeches at U.N. General Assembly; Obama said that his administration does not seek regime change in Iran, and Rouhani responded that managing differences is possible. However, with these first indications of a change in Iran-U.S. relations, one should not expect to see an immediate end to chants of ""Down with USA"" at Friday prayers in Tehran or across Iranian cities. After Nixon's trip to China, anti-American sentiments did not completely disappear among the Chinese, but decreased gradually, over time. That shows why, in an editorial piece in Iran's Revolutionary Guards' weekly paper on September 21, a few days before the U.N. General Assembly, Reza Garmabdary, who is the head of the IRGC political research center, wrote: ""the domestic reverberation of interaction [between the U.S. and Iran] must be in a way that preserves the people's rage towards and hatred of the global arrogance."" One might find this suggestion something of a blow to the potential Iran-U.S. rapprochement. But a closer look at the editorial shows that in fact the author gives a green light to an agreement between the Rouhani administration and that of Obama. Contrary to what has been said in the international media over the past few days, IRGC commanders are not opposed to Rouhani and Obama dancing together -- what they don't want Rouhani to do is actually enjoy the dance. They are warning Rouhani of the cunning tactics of his ""expert and skilled"" partner. Read more: Amanpour on why Rouhani may be different . The IRGC weekly stresses that Rouhani's team ""must not express complete satisfaction with possible agreements"" and continues to demand that ""strong guarantees must be obtained for every possible agreement and a major part of the guarantees must be unilaterally offered to Iran."" According to the piece, the back door should always remain open and no bridges should be burnt. Such advice could enrage those who are against negotiations with Iran. But the truth is that the IRGC is looking at the situation as cautiously and realistically as some of its die-hard enemies in the U.S. Some analysts apologetically argue that the first part of Rouhani's speech at the U.N. General Assembly was merely targeted to his domestic audience, including the Revolutionary Guards. Undoubtedly, the prologue to the speech was filled with jargon and a combination of different theories on humanities and social science. In other words, he was criticizing the current world order and accusing the West of considering itself as ""superior"" and the rest of the world (ie. Iran) as ""inferior."" It is possible that he intended to convey this message using complicated language not to draw too much criticism, but the fact that Rouhani and his accompanying team could truly believe in such sentiment and not only planned to appease the Iranian hardliners cannot be ruled out. The ruling elites of Iran are not happy with the current state of world affairs; the difference, however, is that some leaders such as Rouhani want to change the situation and obtain a better position in the world via interaction, while others seek confrontation. Let's not forget that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, has tested both interaction and confrontation during his 24 years in charge. Previously, as soon as he allowed one group to try an approach, he had to face the criticism of a rival group. Today, however, all of Iran's power players are in agreement, letting Rouhani test the negotiation approach. For example, Judiciary Chief Sadeq Larijani described Rouhani's U.N. speech as reasonable and said: ""Provided that the conditions are fair, honorable and [there is] mutual respect, Iran has nothing against negotiations [with the U.S.]."" This is the first time that Iran's political elites have spoken in a unified voice. Read more: One day, U.S. and Iranian president might shake hands .

"(CNN) -- While the rest of us were watching two boats battling it out in one of the most thrilling sailing competitions of all time, there was another man soaring 400 meters above the waves watching our every move. Hanging out of an open-door helicopter flying high above San Francisco Bay, is all part of a day's work for sports photographer Ezra Shaw, who took these remarkable images of the America's Cup. It's not always easy finding an interesting angle when photographing endless blue sea and sky, but Shaw managed to capture the grace -- and adrenalin -- of sailing, using high-tech equipment on land, sea, and air. ""I don't like flying that much,"" admitted 39-year-old Shaw, a photographer with one of the biggest news agencies in the world, Getty Images, for over 15 years. ""But having a camera makes being in a helicopter a little easier because I'm concentrating on my job and trying to get these pictures -- rather than actually thinking 'I'm flying above the water with no door.'"" Golden backdrop . This was one of the first times the prestigious race had been held in a city, rather than out at sea, giving Shaw a rare opportunity to capture the dramatic skyline of his hometown. As U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison's yacht Oracle made a dramatic comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand, in one of the most nail-biting finishes in the competition's 162-year history, it was up to Shaw to capture the drama, with his images used in newspapers across the world. ""Golden Gate Bridge is pretty spectacular and the skyline is beautiful. So to be able to work those two elements into the picture gave me a chance to get a variety of different images that wouldn't have been possible in other America's Cups,"" said Shaw. ""San Francisco also has lots of different micro climates -- the fog might roll in one day and they'd be blue sky the next, which made for interesting images."" Speed machines . But it wasn't just helicopters helping Shaw get a fresh perspective of the historic race. The photographer -- who covered last year's London Olympics -- also jumped aboard a powerboat to get close to the action. It was hard work keeping up with the futuristic yachts -- which glide along the waves at 80 kilometers per hour -- not to mention taking photographs on a violently bouncing speedboat. ""These sailboats go so fast that the motorboats we were on really couldn't keep up with them. So you have to pick a few key spots on the course,"" explained Shaw. ""I was carrying heavy equipment going out on a boat day after day -- I went to the gym a lot more,"" he joked. Brave new world . It's an indication of how far sports photography has developed in recent years, with international agencies using everything from helicopters to high-tech underwater camera equipment to get a shot no one else has. ""One of the guys on the motorboat had been photographing sailing for 30 years and was talking about America's Cup in Newport in the 80s,"" explained Shaw. ""He would have somebody bring him more film on the boat because he'd run out. ""It's great shooting on digital, because you're rocking up and down on a boat so much with these long lenses. I'd be taking thousands of images a day to get it down to 30 or 40 pictures that I would transmit to the Getty website."" Capturing the moment . But for Shaw, the secret to taking a good photograph isn't necessarily gadgets or extreme helicopter rides -- it's having a good eye. ""The moment is very important -- one of my photos of the two boats passing behind Golden Gate Bridge captures them just as they're between the lines,"" he said. ""Great moments in sports photography are very important, where you're capturing the millisecond of something happening.""","Veteran sports photographer Ezra Shaw reveals the secret to 'perfect shot'

Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have dominated practice and qualifying in recent races, but were off the pace this time in sixth and seventh place respectively in the afternoon runs. The team had been excluded from last week's tire testing at Silverstone and have catching up to do admitted Rosberg.

"(CNN) -- After years of setbacks and controversies, the Kenyan deputy president went on trial Tuesday at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity. William Ruto denied charges that include murder and persecution for allegedly orchestrating attacks that left more than 1,000 people dead after the disputed presidential election nearly six years ago. Can mobiles help stop Kenya election violence? His boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, has been indicted on similar charges and is set to appear before the court in The Hague in November. A third suspect, radio personality Joshua arap Sang, is being tried alongside Ruto on the same charges. He also denies the accusations against him. In addition to the deaths, hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates in the December 2007 election torched homes and hacked rivals to death. Kenyatta and Ruto have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed 2007 election. In one of a number of setbacks in the run-up to the trial, the Kenyan parliament voted last week to withdraw from the ICC's jurisdiction, a move that would take a while to implement because it involves various steps, including a formal notification to the United Nations. The International Criminal Court said the trials would proceed despite the withdrawal. In her opening statement, the ICC's top prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the prosecution would demonstrate that Ruto and his powerful allies sought to exploit the country's tensions for their own political and personal ends. The evidence would show that the outbreaks of violence ""were not just random and spontaneous acts of brutality -- on the contrary, this was a carefully planned, coordinated and executed campaign of violence"" that targeted perceived supporters of the ruling PNU party, she said. ""Mr. Ruto's ultimate goal was to seize power for himself and his party through violent means,"" if they failed to do so through the ballot box, she said. To do so, Ruto built up a network of influential allies from the Kalenjin ethnic group and recruited Kalenjin youths to take part in attacks, the prosecution said. He and Sang, a popular radio presenter, then both used public platforms to stir up sentiment against the Kikuyu ethnic group in the Rift Valley. Sang used his prime-time radio show to help Ruto and his allies to ""broadcast anti-Kikuyu rhetoric and even helped to coordinate attacks through coded messages,"" and in this way contributed to the violence, Bensouda said. Defense: Ruto is an innocent man . Opening for the defense, lawyer Karim Khan said that the case against Ruto was based on an ""exceptionally deficient"" investigation and that the deputy president should never have been accused. Khan said an inquiry would be needed at the end of a trial, to ask ""how was it that someone innocent has come before this court to answer charges that will be shown to be patently false?"" He said there was a ""rotten underbelly"" to the prosecution's investigation, chiefly conducted under former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, which Khan said had failed to recognize the ""lying witnesses"" directing untrue accusations against his client. The ICC investigation was set up to target Ruto he said, and sought to squeeze evidence into that box, ""however uncomfortable, however ill-fitting, however bizarre."" Khan said his client deserved praise for being the first serving deputy head of state to come willingly before the ICC to face charges. Ruto's electoral record demonstrated that he appealed to voters across ethnic groups and had no antipathy toward the Kikuyu ethnic group, the lawyer said. His whole reason for being in politics was to serve the whole of Kenya, Khan added. A lawyer for Sang will give his opening statement Wednesday, the court said. 'Atrocities ... pain and suffering' A representative of the victims of the violence in late 2007 and early 2008 told the court that those affected included many women, children and elderly people. The unrest left more than 400,000 forcibly displaced from their homes, besides the hundreds who lost their lives, Wilfred Nderitu told the court. He represents more than 300 victims of the violence in the case. One victim was quoted as saying: ""If there were no victims, there would be no case. If there was no suffering, would there be any reason to accuse the accused? We are the ones who experienced the atrocities the court cites, because there were atrocities, and there was pain and suffering by the victims."" The trial is being held before presiding Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, from Nigeria, with Judges Olga Herrera Carbuccia and Robert Fremr, from the Dominican Republic and Czech Republic, respectively. It is expected to last for several months. Avoiding a power vacuum . After the disastrous 2007 election, Kenyatta and Ruto teamed up and formed a coalition, which won the most recent poll held this year. Jittery Western nations watched as the two took office in April, raising the prospect of complicated diplomatic ties. Kenyatta maintains that they will cooperate with the court to clear their names and has asked that their proceedings be held on different days to avoid a power vacuum. ""We will work with ICC, but it must understand that Kenya has a constitution. Ruto and myself cannot therefore be away at the same time,"" he said. The court has encountered a number of obstacles leading up to the trial. Charges against three other suspects were dropped for lack of evidence after witnesses dropped out or recanted their testimonies. Bensouda has previously said that some of the witnesses, including a few who were set to testify against both leaders, pulled out because of intimidation. Lawyers for Kenyatta and Ruto have denied any witness intimidation. Stepping in . The ICC was set up in 2002 to try claims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Kenya's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the post-election violence, forcing the international court to step in. ""The ICC is not, under any circumstances, a substitute for domestic criminal justice systems; it only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to ensure that justice is done,"" the court said in a statement. That message was repeated by the prosecutor in her opening statement. The ICC intervened ""only after the Kenyan efforts to establish a domestic mechanism to investigate the violence failed,"" Bensouda said. Ahead of the trial, rights group Amnesty International urged Kenyan authorities to cooperate fully with the ICC to ensure a fair and effective process for those directly involved in the case, and for the Kenyan people. ""Six years after post-election violence rocked the country, it is high time to prioritize the pursuit of justice for the hundreds and thousands of people who lost their lives or homes,"" said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International's Africa program director. ""The government's recent efforts to politicize the ICC trials are deplorable, and must not be allowed to affect the commencement and future proceedings of this landmark trial. ""The authorities should focus their energy on ensuring justice, truth and reparation for the victims of many other crimes that the ICC is not able to deal with."" Eyes on Kenya . Kenya is the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president facing charges at the International Criminal Court. It is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent, so neighboring nations are watching the trial keenly. Kenya provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Most importantly -- at least to the West -- Kenya is a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations.

"(CNN) -- They came from all across America -- from Connecticut to Florida to Illinois and many points in between. One had been in the Marines for nearly four and a half years, another for just a few months. Many served in Afghanistan, earning numerous honors before making it safely back home to the United States. On Wednesday, the military released the names of the seven Marines killed Monday night during a training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada. 7 killed in explosion at Nevada Marine training exercise . ""Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of our fallen angels,"" said Lt. Col. Andrew J. McNulty, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. Those killed are: . • Lance Cpl. David P. Fenn II: The Polk City, Florida, resident joined the Marines in June 2010 and was promoted nine months later. In that time, he'd deployed to Afghanistan where -- among other honors -- he earned a NATO Medal-ISAF Afghanistan and Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The mortarman was 20. • Pfc. Joshua M. Martino: The 19-year-old from Clearfield, Pennsylvania, was a mortarman in the regiment. He joined the Marines in July, but already had earned the National Defense Service Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. • Lance Cpl. Roger W. Muchnick, Jr.: Muchnik, 23, hailed from the southwestern Connecticut town of Fairfield, and ended up in Afghanistan as a mortarman with the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. Like his fallen colleagues, he amassed a host of honors in his military career, such as the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. • Cpl. Aaron J. Ripperda: At 26, Ripperda was the most senior of those killed Tuesday, both in his age and rank. The Madison, Illinois, resident joined the Marine Corps in September 2008, with his latest promotion to corporal coming in April 2011. Among his numerous honors were a Navy Unit Commendation and a Humanitarian Service Medal. • Lance Cpl. Joshua C. Taylor: The Marietta, Ohio, resident, 21, was a teenager when he joined the Marines in June 2010. In 2011, the decorated mortarman was promoted to lance corporal -- the same year he deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. • Lance Cpl. Mason J. Vanderwork: Another mortarman with a host of medals to his name, the 21-year-old Vanderwork was from Hickory, North Carolina. He, too, served in Afghanistan and accumulated a number of medals along the way. • Lance Cpl. William T. Wild IV: In October 2010, the Anne Arundel, Maryland, resident joined the Marines. By December 2011, the mortarman had earned his new rank -- and he also earned a number of recognitions, such as the Combat Action Ribbon and Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. He was 21. Authorities still don't know how the men died. McNulty said Wednesday they know only that the ""60 mm mortar system failed to function as designed,"" and are trying to find out why. Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high-desert training facilities for military units. The night after the incident, the Marines issued a statement saying that 60 mm mortar rounds and tubes used to fire them are being pulled pending the investigation. In addition to the dead, eight servicemembers were injured in the explosion. The Wednesday night update from the Marines indicates that a Navy Corpsman remains ""very seriously injured,"" while five others are ""seriously injured"" and two Marines have been treated for minor injuries and released. CNN's Barbara Starr, Mike Mount and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","Those killed hail from seven states .

"(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office officially determined that the cause of death of an alleged Whitey Bulger extortion victim was homicide by cyanide poisoning, according to MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. The office plans to seek additional charges against William Camuti -- who has already been charged with attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains --- as a result of the official autopsy report. Camuti, 69, confessed to putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Stephen Rakes, 59, according to a testimony by a Massachusetts state trooper at hearing in Concord District Court on September 10. ""He indicated that he had purchased two iced coffees. He did in fact purchase potassium cyanide, which had been delivered and stored,"" said Trooper Michael Banks. Rakes took only one sip before deciding the coffee tasted too bitter. Camuti then drove him around the cities of Waltham, Woburn, Burlington and Lincoln for several hours until he ""succumbed to ... ingesting"" the cyanide, Banks testified. Camuti is being held without bail for 90 days after a judge deemed that his release would not ""reasonably assure the safety of any other person or community,"" said Long. Camuti and Rakes were longtime business associates, and Camuti allegedly poisoned Rakes at a time when Camuti owed Rakes money. In a phone call on July 16, Camuti asked Rakes to meet him about a potential investment property in Wilmington. The investment deal was a ruse to lure Rakes into meeting him, authorities said. The same day, surveillance video showed Rakes leaving the federal courthouse where he regularly attended Bulger's murder trial. Rakes appeared to be wearing the same clothing in which his body was found, according to authorities. The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, where Camuti allegedly bought two iced coffees, laced one with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave it to Rakes, authorities said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says potassium cyanide interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen, and exposure to it can be rapidly fatal. Investigators alleged Camuti dumped Rakes' body in the wooded area, where it was found the next day. CNN's requests for comment from Camuti's attorney were not immediately returned. Camuti pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment in August. Rakes had been a reported extortion victim of Bulger's and had learned shortly before his death that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to testify, a friend said. Bulger, an Irish mob boss in Boston, was found guilty in August on 31 of 32 counts, including extortion, money laundering, drug dealing and weapons possession. A federal jury held Bulger responsible for the murders of 11 people. James 'Whitey' Bulger: The 25-million-dollar man? Their lives had one thing in common: 'Whitey' Bulger .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Alan Mulally has vaulted to the top of the list of potential contenders to replace outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but the Ford CEO demurred when asked about the speculation Monday. ""I'm very, very happy serving at Ford. We have no plans that are different than that. And also we don't comment on speculation,"" said Mulally, who was in the city to launch Ford's new LPG-powered Transit Connect to compete in the Hong Kong taxi market. Since Ballmer announced in August his plans to retire, Mulally's name has risen to the top of a list that also includes former Nokia chief Stephen Elop. Microsoft announced a deal last month to purchase Nokia's mobile phone business. Mulally was poached from Boeing Inc. in Seattle in 2006 to lead America's second largest car company.

"(CNN) -- With four different drivers winning each of the four races so far, 2012 is shaping up as one of the most open seasons in Formula One history. And with no clear favorite yet to emerge, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg says his team is in a strong position to finally end a long title wait. The German marque has won only one race since returning to the elite division of motorsport in 2010 after an absence of half a century away, but Rosberg has hopes of emulating the 1954-55 world championship successes of legendary racer Juan Manuel Fangio. The 26-year-old's win at the China Grand Prix last month was Mercedes' first since Fangio's victory in Italy in 1955, and his first in 111 career starts. ""Before China we were really struggling in races and we worked hard and improved the car, modified the set up quite a lot with the car,"" Rosberg told CNN ahead of this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. ""We're not the best yet, which is what we want to be soon, but we're getting there and we were the best in China. ""It's a difficult season also, everybody is a little bit up and down this year. In the championship I'm in a really good position. We really need to focus and improve the car step by step and try and get the most out of it and try and get ahead of the others."" The most open F1 season came in 1982 when at least 11 different drivers stood on top of the podium. But even then, Alain Prost of Renault won the first two races. Rosberg believes Mercedes is in a strong position to overcome the disappointments of the past two seasons. ""The team is just doing a much better job, they're working together better. There's even more competence now in the team. New people have joined and we're getting there and we're really growing quickly,"" he said. ""It's taken longer for us and been more difficult than expected. But now we're really on a roll and going in the right direction, and for everybody China was a very emotional moment."" Rosberg's veteran teammate Michael Schumacher has blamed F1's sole tire supplier Pirelli for the unpredictable results in 2012, but the younger German is keen to see the positives in an open season and said the difficult conditions at last month's Bahrain Grand Prix were a great learning experience. The hot Middle Eastern country took its toll on tires, with McLaren's former world champion Jenson Button suffering a puncture and retiring on the penultimate lap. His teammate Lewis Hamilton finished eighth, losing his championship lead to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel. Rosberg finished fifth after failing to repeat his China pace, and 43-year-old Schumacher was 10th after fighting his way up from the bottom of the grid. ""Bahrain was probably the toughest conditions tire-wise we've had until now and there we were beating teams like McLaren, who until then had been dominating the season,"" Rosberg said. Mercedes, meanwhile, has downplayed reports it could be set to quit F1. British newspaper The Times claimed the UK-based team could be forced out over a power dispute arising from F1's proposed stock exchange flotation. It said Mercedes would miss out on a boardroom place despite its large investment as an engine manufacturer in the past two decades, while rival teams Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren would all be given representation by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. However a Mercedes spokesman told CNN: ""We are in discussions with the commercial rights holder and we would like to ask for your understanding that we are not currently commenting on these discussions.""","This year is shaping up to be the most open in F1 history with four different race winners .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's abrupt change of course and decision to ask Congress to authorize a strike on Syria won praise from some who have bitterly opposed his foreign policy. But in his surprise decision, did Obama cede presidential power? Over the last 50 years, presidents have successfully consolidated power when it comes to foreign affairs, especially when use of the U.S. military is concerned. Some say the concession to Congress sets a new precedent that bodes well for future Congresses and not so well for future presidents. ""This is a big deal and will tie the hands of future presidents,"" said Peter Spiro, law professor at Temple University. Spiro said this is the first time a president has sought authorization from Congress for a limited military mission. He said it will limit the flexibility of future presidents to make quick decisions, potentially putting U.S. national security at risk. Draft resolution on Syria would limit strike to 60 days . ""That kind of decision-making doesn't work when you have 535 Monday morning quarterbacks,"" Spiro said, referring to the number of lawmakers who will have a vote on Syria intervention as early as next week. Obama maintains, however, that he is not ceding his authority, but made the decision because ""the country will be stronger"" if Congress is on board. Obama insists he still has the authority to act unilaterally. ""[I] believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization,"" he said Saturday when he announced he would seek Congress' support. Obama and unilateralism . Other legal analysts disagree, however, with Spiro's assessment that the president is diluting the power of the office. On the legal blog Lawfare, Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith wrote: ""What would have been unprecedented, and a huge development for separation of powers, is a unilateral strike in Syria."" Oona Hathaway, a Yale Law School professor, agreed. She argued that the president had to seek Congress' approval because he didn't have support from the United Nations Security Council. Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike . ""Going to war under these circumstances (without congressional or Security Council support) would have put him out on a limb politically and legally,"" Hathaway said. Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary for President George W. Bush, sided with Obama. He said on CNN's ""New Day"" that this is ""a voluntary exercise where the executive has said to the legislature, 'I want you to act.' "" A return to precedent? Presidential historian Robert Dallek said the president ""returned to a central part of the country's history"" of power-sharing that has ""a complicated history."" He said Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt would never have considered sidestepping Congress in the lead-up to World War I or World War II respectively. Presidents moved away from asking Congress' permission in the 1950s, starting with the Korean War, when President Harry Truman declined to seek congressional authorization. Library of Congress historian Louis Fisher called the move ""the single most important precedent for the executive use of military force without Congressional authority."" Instead, Truman gained support from the U.N. Security Council and Congress did not object. President John F. Kennedy further consolidated power by authorizing the CIA to carry out the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and by his actions in the 1962 standoff with the Soviet Union over the U.S. blockade of Cuba. President Lyndon B. Johnson boxed out Congress with the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave Johnson broad authority without forcing him to declare war. He used the law to unilaterally decide to commit 100,000 troops in the first stage of the war against North Vietnam. As a result, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to rein in presidents' war declarations. The law says the president must ""consult"" with Congress before U.S. forces are committed in an overseas conflict or within 60 days of U.S. involvement. Congress' use of the War Powers Act is mixed, however. While President George W. Bush sought congressional approval for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, presidents have often failed to ask Congress for support for smaller incursions. President Ronald Reagan didn't seek authorization for Grenada and Panama, President Bill Clinton avoided Congress over military action in Haiti and Kosovo, and Obama sidestepped the legislative branch for an expanded war in Afghanistan and intervention in Libya. Opinion: Obama, ignore the polls on Syria . What if Congress turns down the president? The most immediate risk for the president is that the Congress says no, as Great Britain's Parliament did to Prime Minister David Cameron last week. Fleischer warned that Obama ""has to prevail on the vote."" Dallek said it would be ""rare"" that Congress would not defer to the president on an issue of war. He pointed to one instance in 1939, in the lead-up to World War II, when the president failed to gain Congress' support to aid the British and French against Nazi Germany. Shortly after, Congress reversed course and gave Roosevelt the resources he wanted. Syria war resolution faces tough challenge in Congress . While Obama's decision will be debated for years, Congress' response could be the real precedent-setter. During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said congressional rejection would harm U.S. standing among its allies while emboldening its enemies. As of now, Congress isn't completely sold on intervention in Syria. If a failed vote falls along party lines, Hathaway said ""partisan squabbling would make future presidents nervous"" about seeking congressional authority. Dallek quoted Dutch historian Pieter Geyl, who said, ""History is an argument without end."" In other words, future Congresses and presidents (and observers) are likely to use Obama's action and Congress' response as evidence bolstering a position. Opinion: On Syria, Obama must show strong grip . CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Past presidents have successfully taken military action without Congress' approval .
One expert says decision will result in ""535 Monday morning quarterbacks"" in Congress .
Other legal scholars say Obama going it alone would put him on limb legally and politically ."
"(CNN) -- Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has warned of the dangers of working in a Formula One pit lane after a wheel from one of the team's cars came loose and struck a cameraman. Paul Allen, who was working for Formula One Management at Sunday's German Grand Prix, was hospitalized with a broken collarbone and cracked ribs. The incident occurred when Red Bull's Australian driver Mark Webber came in for a pit stop on lap nine of the race at the Nurburgring Circuit. The right rear tire of Webber's car was not fitted properly and came off as he pulled away from the garage, with the wheel hitting Allen, who was facing in the opposite direction. ""The most important thing today is that the cameraman who got struck by the tire does not appear to have suffered any life-threatening injuries,"" Horner told the sport's official website. ""It's a timely reminder that working in the pit lane is dangerous. Everyone reacted incredibly quickly and the most important thing is to hear that he seems to be fundamentally OK. ""We need to understand what went wrong in that first pit stop for Mark, but as I said, our main concern today is knowing that the cameraman is OK."" CNN's F1 interactive Nurburgring Circuit . Force India were also fined â‚¬5,000 ($6,400) after driver Paul Di Resta pulled out into the path of Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne when exiting the pit lane.

"(CNN) -- The Greek government said Friday that in a phone conversation with the country's president, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that the issue of whether his country remains in the eurozone be put to a referendum, a claim Germany flatly denied. Merkel made the call to President Karolos Papoulias, whose country is facing uncertainty over its government, ahead of her visit to the United States for the G8 summit of international leaders. According to the Greek prime minister's office, Merkel ""conveyed ... thoughts about holding a referendum in parallel with the elections with the question how much do Greek citizens want to remain in the eurozone."" When asked about the statement, a spokeswoman for the German government said, ""This is not true."" The spokeswoman declined to elaborate further. The Greek government stood by its statement about the phone call and declined to comment further. Papoulias' office also declined to comment except to confirm that the phone call took place. A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from its inability to pay its debts. Greece is heading toward new elections next month, with polls suggesting a narrow victory for a radical leftist party that wants to tear up an international loan agreement that forced the government to make deep budget cuts. That possibility has sent ripples of fear through markets in Europe, Asia and the United States as analysts worry that it could ultimately lead to the collapse of the euro currency used by 17 European nations. Ratings agency Fitch cut Greece's long-term credit rating from B- to CCC on Thursday, reflecting worries about its ability to remain in the eurozone. ""The downgrade of Greece's sovereign ratings reflects the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership of Economic and Monetary Union,"" Fitch said. ""In the event that the new general elections scheduled for 17 June fail to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-IMF programme of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit of Greece from EMU would be probable."" Antonis Samaras, the leader of Greece's New Democracy party, slammed the possibility of a referendum. ""The Greek people do not need a referendum to prove their choice of the euro, a choice that it defends with bloody sacrifices,"" Samaras said. ""Merkel's proposal tonight about a referendum -- and at a pre-election time -- is, at the very least, unfortunate and cannot be accepted."" Samaras' party narrowly came in first in this month's elections, but opinion polls since then have suggested that Syriza would finish in first place in a new election. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the Syriza party who leads in polls ahead of the June 17 election, said Friday that with the vote, ""The Greek people will hold a final answer. ... This will put an end to the austerity bailouts, submission and lack of dignity and will pave the way to progressive developments for the entire of Europe."" Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls May 6 for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country's international lenders, the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The election left no party able to form a government, creating deep uncertainty about Greece's ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations. In her call with Papoulias on Friday, ""(Merkel) reiterated the German position that Europe is waiting for the elections and that it is the wish of all European partners and also of Germany that a government is formed as quickly as possible after the elections,"" a German government spokeswoman said. Merkel said Wednesday that she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone. ""Europe needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,"" she said. Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of tough budget cuts. ""It's very bitter, obviously,"" she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, ""Sacrifices had to be made. ... I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken.""

"(CNN) -- He refers to himself as the industry's last remaining dinosaur, but Adrian Newey is the pioneering Formula One engineer who can consistently claim to be ahead of the curve. The 53-year-old's designs have delivered a total of 10 world titles, spread across three different constructors, putting the Briton in a class of his own. After successful spells with Williams and McLaren, Newey is now chief technical officer at Red Bull, where he produced the cars that swept Sebastian Vettel to back-to-back championships in 2011 and 2012 alongside double manufacturers' crowns. He can also count legends of the sport such as Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve and Mika Hakkinen as those who have triumphed under his hand since he started working in motor racing in 1980. CNN World Sport sat down with Newey at Red Bull's UK base to quiz him on his designs, his method of working and why he still prefers drawing by hand. How do you stay ahead of the curve every season? The design job is part iteration and part blue sky/light bulb-type thing. So if regulations are stable, quite often it's evolution in the Darwinian sense of the word, but occasionally we'll come up with a new idea which is not a derivation of what we've been doing, it's coming from left field. So it's really about trying to get that blend of evolution and revolution. Where do you get your ""light bulb"" moments? They can come from anywhere. I quite often find that if I think about a problem for a while, store it, walk away and do something else ... the brain is an amazing thing. It seems to tick away on a problem. Sometimes the solution will pop up in the shower the next day, the next week. I'm sure we all have different ways of working and I'm obviously not the only person coming up with ideas. It's a big engineering company now. The rules change every season. Do you relish it as a challenge or is it a headache? I enjoy regulation changes if they give new opportunities. The big changes we had at the start of 2009 gave all sorts of new opportunities; different ways to approach things, don't simply do things the way we've always done and really try to think what are we trying to achieve here, what is the best solution or set of solutions to suit new regulations. What I don't enjoy so much is when the regulations simply become more restrictive, when things that we're doing become banned. I think the danger there is that if the regulations become excessively restrictive, then all the cars will be the same and it will effectively be a runway chassis format. You are well known for your low-tech approach to what is ultimately a very high-tech product -- you draw a lot of your designs. How do you reconcile that? In terms of communicating my ideas and developing my ideas, I work on a drawing board -- as opposed to all my colleagues now, who are obviously on computer-aided design (CAD) systems. I guess I'm the last dinosaur in the industry. I view it simply as a language. It's the way of taking an idea in the head -- typically I'll take an idea, sketch it on a bit of paper and then develop it on the drawing board. Now, of course, as everything has to go onto the CAD system, I'm lucky enough to have a team of two or three people who take my drawings and convert them into electronic images. But whether you use a drawing board or go straight to the CAD I think it's really a personal preference. That's the way I grew up and I'm afraid I'm getting a bit too much of a creature of habit to change. Have you ever been forced to try the newer design technology? When CAD first came in during the early 1990s, then various people -- particularly when I was at Williams -- said I ought to really be changing. Perhaps at that time when I was still in my 30s, I should have done. But I like the freedom of drawing, the fact that you can sketch very easily, you can rub out, you can change, you can freehand. When I watch people on the CAD system now, that's still a weakness to me of the CAD system -- the freehand ability and the ability to change things very quickly and easily with a rubber is not there. What are the things that you are most proud of? Certainly the first Formula One cars -- I was involved in the Leyton House/March team from 1988. We were a very small team. It was only two aerodynamicists I think, including myself, on the car. The total engineering team was five or six people. We were stuck with an abnormally aspirated engine which had far less power than the turbocharged engines of the era. So we set out to build an as aerodynamically-efficient car as we could. That car I think genuinely changed the direction of F1 at the time. The cars had become quite big and clumsy and our little March was, despite being well done on power, was able to get ahead of McLaren and Ferrari and Williams, just by being aerodynamically efficient. Of course other people recognized that and over the coming years increasingly cars became a clone of the 1988 car. Which of your innovations do you think have stood the test of time? Certainly my route has always been to try to put aerodynamics first and foremost in the design of the car because that's the biggest performance differentiator. And that really is something now that is generally accepted -- everybody does that. But in the 1980s when I first started that wasn't the norm. People tended to design the car mechanically first and foremost, and then the aerodynamicist was given the job of trying to fit the bodywork to it. I think that philosophy is still in good stead. It's trying to recognize where do you get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of performance and then design accordingly. Can you talk through the process from design to the road? You have a set of regulations, you then do the layout of the car, which obviously satisfies the regulations initially perhaps first and foremost, and then try to look for opportunities and try to develop ideas around that. Once you have an aerodynamic concept together, that has to be transferred to a mechanical package that will physically transmit the aerodynamics to the road, the suspension, to hold all the vital things to drive with; the fuel, the engine. So typically we have to work to league time schedules and the longest league time is the chassis itself -- what we call the monocoque, which holds the front suspension, contains the driver and contains the fuel tank. To the back of that is bolted the engine, which we are supplied by Renault. So we are not involved in the engine, other than how we install it in the car. Then the other long league up item is the gearbox, which we do ourselves. It's a carbon composite case. So the monocoque and the carbon gear box case are the things we have to first get out as a piece of design. Their shapes need to at least be designed by late August, early September to meet the league times necessary for the following year. Then once you have those big two items out, you go through and tick off the list of remaining items: suspension upright, suspension so on and so forth. Do the legacy of your designs and innovation go beyond F1? When I first started teams typically had five engineers or less, so there was very little research capability. It was purely a design job to design the car almost with the least amount of effort you could, as you just didn't have the resource. Today the top Formula One teams will have over 100 engineers, maybe as much as 130. So we have a tremendous research capability. That has meant that instead of it almost being something that general engineering took no notice of, we are now able to contribute to engineering developments in the same way as aerospace and automotives. We will typically go from a blank sheet of paper to a complete in a space of around six months, and that's something which the aeronautical sector in particular is fascinated by because they have league times which are more like 10 years. So we borrow off them and in some areas they borrow off us now. When you get up in the morning, what's main thing driving you? I just enjoy the job. I enjoy the blend of design engineering, working with my fellow engineers, my colleagues here at Red Bull, working with the drivers, working with the mechanics and that blend of design and competition that we're out there every couple of weeks being measured on how we're doing -- which if it's going well it's great, and if it's going poorly it's a lot of pressure. What is so fascinating about motor racing is that blend of design and competition, and it really doesn't exist anywhere else. Yes of course there is technology in bicycles, tennis rackets and whatever but the budgets and the research are much smaller. We get to play with quite a grownup budget and we can get involved in lots of areas as a result of that. What's more important -- the driver or the car? The answer is you have to have the combination. There are three principle things: the driver; the chassis, or the car less the engine; and the engine itself. The main performance differentiator on the chassis is the aerodynamics. So to win races you've got to have a good driver, good aerodynamics and a good engine. If you don't have that combination you might win the odd race but you certainly won't win championships.","Designer Adrian Newey has delivered 10 Formula One world championship titles .

"Washington (CNN) -- The morning that the federal government reopened after 16 days of political stalemate, President Barack Obama stood at the podium in the State Dining Room of The White House. He didn't smile. ""Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job as best we can. We come from different parties, but we are Americans first,"" he said. He then chastised Republican lawmakers, blaming them for the shutdown and drama over the debt ceiling that he called ""completely unnecessary"" and said damaged ""our economy."" Fresh from what most are calling an undisputed political victory over the conservatives, the President didn't seem in a conciliatory mood. His body language said it all: Enough already. A long history, a strained relationship . Obama has more than three years left in his presidency and the next battle is just months away because the deal approved by Congress that he signed only funds the government through early January and only extends U.S. borrowing authority until early February. From his bully pulpit on Thursday, Obama invoked his professorial tone and implored Congress that their working relationship ""has to change."" ""Because we've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people and that includes the hard work of regaining their trust,"" Obama said. This episode was only the latest in a series of confrontations between the President and Congress. To say that his relationship with the legislative branch has been strained might be the political understatement of the decade. A deal for now, but this year's been a legislative dud for Obama . The biggest battle was over Obamacare, which passed the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2010. But the past year alone has seen fierce wrangling over the administration's response to the deadly terror attack in September 2012 on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. And there was the major fiscal cliff impasse over budget cuts and tax increases last March and in the first excruciating battle over spending and the debt limit in the summer of 2011. There has also been tension over Syria and Iran. 'Bottom of the barrel' While he said ""there are no winners,"" Obama used the moment to press his agenda. He urged Congress to determine the government's spending and priorities for 2014 and beyond. He also urged lawmakers to pass an overdue farm bill that sets the country's farming priorities and pays for food assistance. He wants the House to take up the immigration reform bill, which the Senate passed earlier this year, and has called for a return to ""regular order,"" where Congress approves budgets, reconciles differences and gets things done. Playing nice: Budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone . ""The American people are completely fed up with Washington,"" he said, reflecting polls that show support for Congress at historic lows. It's an ambitious agenda, especially for a government fresh off a debilitating few weeks and tensions between the two branches are high and trust is low. One former Democratic member of Congress, Dan Glickman, who represented Kansas for 18 years and currently sits on the political reform commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that the shutdown showdown brought about one bright spot. ""I think we may have reached the bottom of the barrel,"" meaning things in Washington ""can't get any lower than this,"" he said. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day . But former House Speaker Newt Gingrich disagreed. He said the most conservative members who wanted to gut Obamacare in exchange for government funding got little out of the budget deal are even more incensed. ""They will be more embittered, more angry. They will find more ways to go after Obama because they can't find any way to get him to negotiate,"" he said. Gingrich's statement rings true if Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, accurately represents his like-minded colleagues. He told the Huffington Post that he thinks immigration reform is dead. ""For us to go to a negotiation, to the negotiating table with President Obama after what he has done over the last two and a half weeks, I think would be probably a very big mistake,"" Labrador said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi didn't mince words Thursday morning. She said the Republicans' ""temper tantrum"" cost the economy $24 billion. 'That's democracy' From his lectern, Obama tried to sound like the adult in the room. ""Democrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues and I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided,"" he said. ""That's putting it mildly. That's okay. That's democracy. That's how it work."" While he offered out his hand for future negotiations, Obama didn't stay completely above the fray. In the same sentence he blamed one faction of the Republican Party for the latest dysfunction, insisting that their goal is to cause chaos. ""Let's work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse,"" Obama said. Why is Ted Cruz smiling? Understanding that he needs the Republican Party to get anything done in Washington, he separated the party into two factions and implored the more rebellious to stay in line. ""You don't like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election. Push to change it but don't break it. Don't break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That's not being faithful to what this country is about,"" he said. McConnell: Further shutdowns 'off the table' Republican congressman: It was worth the fight . While Obama tried to highlight the rifts in the Republican Party, perhaps hoping to exploit the divisions and then conquer, Republicans appeared united, at least for a few hours Wednesday night. Moments before the House was set to vote on a deal to reopen the government, House Speaker John Boehner received a standing ovation, even from his most vocal Republican critics. And one of those critics, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, said Boehner's leadership through the latest battle has been ""fantastic."" Then Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, put a damper on that party. ""This was a terrible idea. I told you at the beginning how it was going to end. We know if they try it again how it's going to end. So hopefully, they won't try to do this again, at least not in my lifetime,"" McCain said.","President Obama emerged with an ambitious agenda moving forward .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to the age-old art of bartering, a California teenager became the envy of all his friends when he pulled into school in a Porsche convertible. Steven Ortiz, 17, dreamed of one day owning a luxury sports car -- a dream that became reality after he posted a used cell phone on Craigslist. ""My friend gave me a free phone and said, 'Do what you want with it,'"" Ortiz told CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""So I put it on Craigslist on the barter section."" After some serious patience, research and a lot of talking, his cell phone trade landed him an iPod touch, which he managed to barter up for a dirt bike and then to a Macbook Pro laptop computer. Before long, he was the proud owner of an 1987 Toyota 4Runner. Eventually, he landed a classic Ford Bronco SUV -- the golden ticket that would soon get him into the driver seat of a luxury sports car. ""I just went for it,"" he said. ""I knew the Bronco was worth more at the end."" So what's his secret? ""It's trying to catch people who want what you have,"" Ortiz said. ""The man that needed the laptop had an extra car,"" so both parties got what they wanted, he added. He advises anyone looking to get into the barter game to be cautious before committing to a trade. ""Always inspect everything,"" Ortiz said. Although he accomplished his goal of owning a Porsche, Ortiz says it's time to move on and he plans on going back to what he does best -- bartering for something else. ""I don't have a job right now and I really don't like asking my parents if I can get an oil change, so I want to trade [the Porsche] for a mid-sized truck,"" Ortiz said. ""We'll see what comes along.""","Steve Ortiz posted a used cell phone on Craigslist under the barter section .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The co-author of a study on propofol addiction funded by AEG Live and used in their defense in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial lost his medical license for writing illegal drug prescriptions, according to testimony. Dr. Torin Finver was hired to help with the AEG Live study after he lost his job at a pizza parlor and took a job driving a Goodwill truck, said Dr. Paul Earley, who testified Wednesday as an expert witness for the concert promoter. Finver was ""destitute, dead broke, and I wanted to help him,"" Earley, himself a recovering heroin addict, testified. The revelation was a bizarre twist in the trial of the billion-dollar lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and three children, which is being heard by a Los Angeles jury. The four-month-long trial is nearing a conclusion. AEG Live lawyers will announce if they have any more witnesses to call before playing the video depositions of three more doctors on Friday. Jackson lawyers would then take several days to call rebuttal witnesses before closing arguments are heard, which is likely to happened around September 23. Earley testified that he never disclosed to AEG Live lawyers that his co-author had lost his medical license. Ironically, the company is being accused of the negligent hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray, convicted in Jackson's death because it allegedly failed to check Murray's background before hiring him. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle also grilled Earley over his nondisclosure that he was working as a paid consultant in AEG Live's defense when he submitted the study for publication in a medical journal. He said the concert promoter did not try to influence his findings, which were published in March in the Journal of Addiction Medicine. Nurse details Michael Jackson's fatal search for sleep . Jackson lawyers are hoping the controversy over Earley's work for AEG Live will distract jurors from his conclusion that Michael Jackson was a drug addict with a ""grave prognosis"" that would have shortened his life had he not died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009. Each dose of an anesthetic his doctor gave him to help him sleep was like playing ""Russian roulette,"" Earley said. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson infusions of propofol for 60 nights to treat his insomnia as the entertainer prepared for his comeback concerts. Lawyers for the concert promoter hired Earley in their effort to downplay damages the company might have to pay if found liable in the pop icon's death. How much longer Jackson might have lived -- and earned money touring -- will be important if the jury decides AEG Live is liable for damages in Jackson's death. Jackson lawyers contend he would have earned more than $1.5 billion touring the world over the next several years. Katherine Jackson and her three grandchildren sued Michael Jackson's last concert promoter, contending the company is liable in his death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live lawyers contend it was Jackson, not the promoter, who chose and controlled Murray, and say AEG executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. Jackson's mom remembers her 'sweet little boy' Earley: Jackson went 'doctor shopping' Despite writing a blog six weeks after Jackson's death titled ""Michael Jackson: Addiction in the Privileged,"" Earley testified Tuesday that there ""was insufficient evidence that he was addicted to propofol."" ""He was given propofol initially for appropriate medical procedures, but at some point, he began seeking out physicians who would administer propofol to him,"" Earley testified. The last two instances of ""doctor shopping"" for propofol were late March and April of 2009, when Jackson asked an anesthesiologist to go on tour with him and then asked a nurse to help him find an anesthesiologist, he said. Earley said there was no evidence Jackson's search for a doctor to give him propofol continued after AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware sent an e-mail to the singer's assistant on May 6, 2009, telling him Murray had agreed to take the job as his personal physician for the ""This Is It"" tour. ""Done at $150k a month,"" Gongaware wrote. ""Sounds like he got it,"" Earley testified. The Jackson family's lawyers contend that AEG Live executives ignored warning signs that Jackson's health began deteriorating after Murray began attending to him on a daily basis. Show workers sent e-mails describing a paranoid and frail Jackson who couldn't perform his standard dances or remember words to songs he had sung for decades. A Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testifying in June for the Jacksons, concluded that the 60 nights of propofol infusions apparently robbed Jackson of rapid eye movement sleep, which is vital to keep the brain and body alive. ""The symptoms that Mr. Jackson was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period,"" Dr. Charles Czeisler testified. AEG expert: Jackson was a drug addict . Expert's conflict? Soon after AEG Live's lawyers hired Earley as a consultant on propofol addiction in 2011, they agreed to fund his scientific research, which resulted in his paper titled ""Addiction to Propofol: A Study of 22 Treatment Cases."" The American Society of Addiction Medicine published the study in March. Earley insisted in his testimony that AEG Live's funding did not influence the conclusions of his study or his testimony in the trial. But the Jackson lawyer hammered the doctor about the lack of disclosure to the scientific journal and his collaborator that he was being paid to be an expert witness in the trial. He informed them that he was doing research for the company, but the trial aspect was ""irrelevant,"" Earley said. ""It's irrelevant to health care professionals,"" he said. ""It wouldn't affect their understanding of the paper.""","NEW: Co-author of AEG Live propofol study was hired after losing pizza parlor job .

"Washington (CNN) -- Immigration reform entered an uncertain new phase on Wednesday as House Republicans signaled some willingness to compromise with President Barack Obama and Democrats but rejected a Senate-passed bill and insisted they would take their time drafting their own version. Following more than two hours of talks on how to proceed, GOP legislators said the biggest question was whether to give the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States a path to eventual citizenship, as provided by the Senate measure. Participants in the Republican caucus meeting described a 50-50 split over the undocumented immigrant issue, with more consensus on the need to produce some kind of legislation to show the party's commitment to fixing a broken system and addressing concerns of Hispanic Americans -- the nation's largest minority demographic. Despite the divisions on the undocumented immigrant issue, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told the GOP members that children living illegally in the United States through no fault to their own should receive legal status. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he and fellow Virginia Republican Cantor were working together on a bill focused on children, which is a priority of Democrats pushing for immigration reform. At the same time, House GOP leaders made clear they intended to slow the process down by tackling individual components of the broad measure passed by the Democratic-led Senate last month with bipartisan support. Bush welcomes new citizens in soft push for immigration reform . Prospect of political attacks . That means taking up smaller bills on specific provisions, such as border security and employment verification measures, in coming months while also seeking a compromise within the caucus on providing legal status for undocumented immigrants. House Speaker John Boehner warned his caucus that Republicans would face political attacks if they failed to move legislation, according to several GOP sources in the room. ""We don't want the White House to hope that we fail to make it a campaign issue,"" said GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas. ""House Republicans want to do this on our terms, and not on the Senate's terms and not on the White House terms."" Another prominent House GOP leader, Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, told his colleagues that doing nothing was not an option. The unsuccessful Republican vice presidential nominee in last year's election, Ryan made the case also pushed by the White House that immigration reform would help boost the American economy, participants said. Meanwhile, a group of bipartisan House legislators trying to draft its own immigration measure met for several hours on Tuesday night and would continue its work, said Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra of California. The group is working on a comprehensive bill closer in form to the Senate measure and Becerra argued the incremental approach advocated by House Republicans wouldn't work. ""It's better to eat your Wheaties and do it right than do it poorly and 5-10 years from now have to come back at it again,"" Becerra said. How immigration reform would affect 3 families . Path to legal status . The 1,000-plus page Senate immigration bill passed last month takes a comprehensive approach that removes the threat of immediate deportation for most undocumented immigrants and provides a path to legal status and eventual citizenship. It also includes stronger enforcement provisions including the virtual militarization of the Mexican border with almost double the agents, new technology and a longer fence, as well as requiring employers to verify the immigration status of workers and improved monitoring of visa holders. While the Senate measure passed 68-32 with support from 14 Republicans, House GOP leaders insist they will not bring it up because most of their caucus opposes it. Boehner has repeatedly said any immigration bill brought up for a House vote must have support from a majority of Republicans, and he repeated that guarantee to his GOP caucus on Wednesday. Democrats called on Boehner to allow a House vote on the Senate version, believing it could pass with unified Democratic support along with several dozen Republicans. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Wednesday that Republicans were ""splintered and confused"" on immigration, describing what he called a ""deeply divided party"" that was ""much more into ideology than they are into solving problems."" Opinion: Should the U.S. be more like Mexico? Midterms loom in 2014 . The immigration issue will be significant in next year's congressional elections, with House Republicans under pressure from conservatives to oppose what the political right-wing calls amnesty in the form of a path to legal status and even citizenship for people who sneaked into the country illegally or overstayed their visas. ""Once you start down that line, you're destroying the rule of law,"" conservative GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa said after Wednesday's caucus meeting. He and fellow conservative Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota described the GOP caucus as evenly divided on the question. ""The real issue is amnesty. The whole game is about legalization, the status of legalization,"" Bachmann said. On the other side was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban immigrant from Miami, who told reporters that ""we have different points of view."" ""I hope we can also look at the 11 million people who want to legalize their status,"" she added. For Obama and Democrats, passage of immigration reform would mean following through on a promise to the nation's largest minority demographic -- Hispanic Americans -- to reduce uncertainty for millions of them living illegally in the United States. Searching for the American Dream in Mexico . Moderate Republicans, including most of the party's leaders in Congress, want a compromise that would represent a potential breakthrough for the GOP with Hispanics who voted overwhelmingly for Obama in last year's election. Earlier Wednesday, former President George W. Bush added his voice to calls for a solution, telling a ceremony for new citizens that the present system was broken. ""I do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate,"" Bush said in a rare public comment about politics since he left office. While he refrained from taking sides, he sounded moderate in saying he hoped that ""we keep a benevolent spirit in mind."" ""We understand the contributions immigrants make to our country,"" said Bush, a Republican. ""We must remember that the vast majority of immigrants are decent people who work hard and support their families and practice their faith and lead responsible lives."" White House keeps up pressure . However, conservatives fear that legalizing undocumented immigrants means guaranteeing future electoral hardship for Republicans by adding millions of new voters who generally lean Democratic. The White House sought to keep up pressure on House Republicans, asserting Wednesday that the Senate immigration measure would boost the U.S. economy and help create jobs. A Congressional Budget Office report released in June indicated the Senate bill could reduce deficits by $175 billion over the first 10 years and by at least $700 billion in the second decade. The CBO, working with the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, estimated that eight million unauthorized residents would become legal in the first decade. In addition, the CBO report estimated the bill would boost the U.S. population by a net of 10.4 million people by 2023 and by 16 million by 2033. ""The benefits are clear. The fact that there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind this is clear,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""It cannot be acceptable, broadly and in the long term, that immigration reform would be blocked because some minority of House Republicans is concerned about a primary challenge from the far right. That's not a good argument. It's not a good argument politically. It's certainly not a good argument economically,"" he said. Senate immigration deal includes tougher border security . 'Fully comprehensive' On the House side, the bipartisan group working on an immigration package would require that border security measures be in place before any process toward residency for undocumented immigrants could begin. GOP legislators endorsed that strategy after Wednesday's caucus meeting. ""The American people want our border secured, our laws enforced, and the problems in our immigration system fixed to strengthen our economy,"" said a joint statement by House GOP leaders that expressed distrust in Obama and Democrats to fully enact tougher security laws before legalizing undocumented immigrants. GOP Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California told reporters the end result in the House would be ""fully comprehensive immigration reform"" that would address undocumented immigrants. He outlined legislation that would provide some with legal status, such as those who served in the military and children of undocumented immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents. While other immigrants also could be considered for legal status, those with criminal records should be kicked out, Issa said. Sticking points in the House debate include whether undocumented immigrants would be eligible for health care benefits during the years it would take to get legal status, and empowering state and local police to work with federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws.

"Seoul (CNN) -- Pictured giggling on a park bench, 89-year-old Lee Soon-sang and his wife, Kim Eun-hae, look as though they met just yesterday. In fact, they married more than 60 years ago. But for half a century, Kim believed her husband was dead, missing in action during the Korean War (1950-53). Then in August 2004, a telephone call came from China. ""I thought someone was trying to make money off me. I got many calls like that over the years from China, but I didn't pay attention,"" she said. This was no ordinary call. The voice on the other end of the line shook her to the core. It really was her husband. ""I asked, 'Are you really alive?' He answered, 'Yes, I am alive.' Then I asked if he knew so and so, and he did know them. That's how I knew it was real."" When they finally met, they barely recognized each other. ""He was so skinny, he was wobbling in,"" recalled Kim. ""I could only recognize his nose."" In contrast Lee couldn't believe how well fed his wife looked. ""She looked like one of those landlords from the old days,"" he said. ""And the propaganda, that all South Koreans are starving to death ... that Americans are taking all the rice and only giving back rotten flour ... I only heard this kind of propaganda, so I thought she was dead. ""We just held each other and cried."" Lee Soon-sang had been captured by the North Korean army in 1953, two days before the Armistice was signed. He spent three-and-a-half years in a prisoner of war camp and was then sent to work in the notorious coalmines at Aoji, North Korea -- also a production site for gunpowder. There he had remarried and had children -- though he said he never forgot about life before the war. ""Life in North Korea was hard', he said. ""So I always thought about my hometown. Even though I believed my wife was dead, I always thought I'd go back one day."" Decades later, in 2004, a ""broker"" got in touch -- they are middlemen who make their living smuggling people in and out of North Korea. ""He told me that Kim Eun-hae and my son were in China with lots of money, that I should take the money and go back to North Korea to live a better life."" Aged 77 by then, he had managed to save up 20,000 North Korean won (approximately US$150) selling cigarettes. ""In North Korea, that's a lot of money. You could buy a small house with that. I gave that to my wife and said, 'I'm going to pick acorns, I'll be back in two or three days.' That's how I left."" He said he meant to return. But he never did. He won't talk about the family he left behind. ""I'm happy now. You're my wife,"" he told Kim. But the bitterness of his choice is a reality for many whose lives and loyalties were split by a divided Korea. Why the Korean War still matters . Lee attends a lunch organized for prisoners of war like him -- a group of about a dozen men who meet three times a week, all of whom were held captive in the North long after the 1953 Armistice agreement when Pyongyang agreed to return all prisoners of war. Kim Sung Tae left his adopted daughter behind in North Korea when he fled in 2001. ""How can we see each other unless there's reunification?"" He's 81. He does not expect to see her again. He described the terrible hardships of his life in North Korea, especially the six months he spent in a prisoner of war camp. ""We were fed just a few hundred grams of grain a day,"" he recalled. ""I would wake up in the morning and grab handfuls of lice from my body. That was normal."" For more than a decade after, his life was spent in a succession of regular prisons, often in solitary confinement in a cell no larger than the size of a crouching man. ""When I came back to South Korea, I asked them to take me to a prison here so I could compare. It was like paradise. South Korean prisons treated their prisoners better than North Korea treated their citizens."" According to South Korea's Defense Ministry, 8,343 former servicemen have returned to the South since 1953. Eighty of those men escaped through a third country decades after the Armistice was signed. Based on their testimony, the Seoul government believes there are still some 500 POWs living in the North. Kim Sung Tae feels the government should do more to bring them home. Recently, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihi-jae repeated his call for North Korea to resolve the issue of former servicemen and other abductees kept by the North. Pyongyang claims they are there of their own free will. And in the absence of actual talks between the two countries, Seoul has little leverage to orchestrate their release. Men like Lee Soon-sang and Kim Sung Tae are living proof that Pyongyang is wrong. But many Korean war veterans are now well into their eighties -- no longer at an age where fleeing across treacherous borders is particularly feasible. Men whose fate was sealed when they were taken prisoner 60 years ago may never see freedom again.","Lee Soon-sang and his wife reunited after more than half a century .

"(CNN) -- America is heading toward an energy cliff in the next 20 years, and the impacts could be much worse than those of the recent recession. Simply put, we cannot keep out of economic downturn without a readily available supply of clean and abundant energy -- from sources that are affordable, scalable to meet long-term demand and that do not compound the problem of global climate change. CNN Films' documentary ""Pandora's Promise"" correctly suggests that nuclear power is the safest, most stable and most secure option for achieving that goal. The U.S. nuclear fleet is robust, but even with license extensions, plants soon will reach the end of their design life. And an aging fleet of coal-fired power plants has numerous challenges with environmental compliance. Combined, these two sources represent approximately 60% of this nation's electricity supply. The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts that somewhere between 35 to 60 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, or one-fifth of the U.S. energy supply, will be shut down by 2018 because of today's lower gas prices and rigorous enforcement of clean air standards. Electricity use at the same time is expected to grow by nearly 30% through the year 2040. Energy-efficient products have helped to reduce consumption, but they have been outpaced by new demand from other energy-consuming lifestyle choices. As ""Pandora's"" director Robert Stone rightly points out about the weakness of renewables, carbon sources of generation are needed to supply the intermittent electricity capacity when the sun isn't shining or when the wind isn't blowing. Nuclear power has been proven to be the safest form of energy since the first reactor went online in the U.S. more than 50 years ago. What's more, the new plants being built today by Westinghouse feature advanced technology and design that take safety to new levels and are being built around the world. For more than 35 years, the nuclear industry has provided over 20% of the electricity that powers the U.S. economy, creating jobs and fueling economic growth. Many thought the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island would mean the end of the nuclear industry. In fact, the industry, with the oversight of government regulators, learned a great deal from that event and over the next decade reinvented itself. In the years that followed, the U.S. nuclear fleet and its suppliers developed, embraced and set the highest standards of nuclear plant safety in the world. Improvements in technology, design, plant maintenance, and operations enabled the nuclear industry to do more than survive -- it actually grew. Existing nuclear plants improved safety and were uprated, adding the equivalent of many new reactors without actually building a new one. Today the U.S. nuclear industry consists of about 200,000 highly trained employees and is the world's leading exporter of advanced nuclear technology. While the building of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. was slowed, the world increased its nuclear fleet to more than 430 reactors. Even today more than 70 new reactors are in some phase of project development and construction globally. In 2010, two forward-thinking utilities in the southeastern U.S. made an investment in the future to protect stable pricing and hedge against pending environmental regulations that penalize carbon emissions. They committed to building four new Westinghouse advanced-generation nuclear power plants -- the first in the U.S. in 30 years. The utilities understood that a balanced fuel portfolio creates stability, predictable costs, and hedges price and supply volatility in the natural gas market. For most of the last three decades, nuclear generating costs have been lower than those for natural gas or coal. Today we are realizing the benefits of low-priced natural gas, but history tells us that over time and increased use, price volatility will return. It is important to remember that large-scale energy infrastructure investments typically have a life span of 60 years or more. Investors trade off between higher construction costs and the long-term price and supply security of nuclear versus a lower construction cost and high exposure to long-term supply and price volatility. In my lifetime, I have been assured at least twice of a new 100-year supply of natural gas, only to have those hopes dashed as increasing demand repeatedly burst the natural gas bubble. In the U.S., concern over high natural gas prices, global natural gas shortages and potential carbon taxes gave rise to the so-called ""nuclear renaissance"" of just a few short years ago. But the financial crisis and economic downturn that followed reduced the number of planned new nuclear plants from 25 to just five that actually started construction. Related story: ""Nuclear renaissance"" Others have extended planned starts due to economic conditions. In addition to the eight new units Westinghouse currently has under construction around the world, we have another 30 units that will begin construction within the next 10 years. Our new advanced nuclear power capacity will help fuel global industrialization without long-term environmental impacts. And these new plants are designed with features that can withstand the kind of natural disaster that happened in Japan. One thing is certain -- we need the power that these new nuclear plants can provide in order to meet the expected shortfall that will occur in the years ahead. The industry and government policymakers alike recognize that nuclear energy must be part of any national energy policy and is the most certain environmental solution to keep us from going off the energy cliff without taking away our clean air. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Roderick.","Coming ""energy cliff"" could be worse than recession, says Westinghouse's Danny Roderick .

"(CNN) -- Rebecca Sedwick should be 13 now. She should be enjoying the birthday cupcakes and ice cream her mom planned for her. But Rebecca will never know what it's like to be a teenager. She killed herself last month, jumping off a silo after she was tormented by bullying. Her mother, Tricia Norman, posted a birthday message to Rebecca on Facebook on what would have been her 13th birthday Saturday. ""I remember so clearly the moment you were born. I knew I was gifted with a precious life and every moment since, I did my very best to protect you and now I feel like I failed that very important job that God gave me because He took you from me way too soon,"" Norman wrote. ""I am doing my very best to make sure that other parents are made aware of how serious of a problem bullying is and I hope you are proud of me and satisfied with my progress. I am also working hard to make sure those that wronged you pay the price for what they did to you!!"" A day after a class on bullying, a suicide . Over a boy? Rebecca and one of her alleged bullies were once friends, but they both had feelings for the same boy, police said. It soured their relationship. In November 2012, the bullying began, Judd said, and it expanded beyond the initial tensions between the two girls. Police arrested a second suspect accused of intensely bullying Rebecca, and they also confiscated the laptops and cell phones of 15 girls at Crystal Lake Middle School, which Rebecca had attended. They found a barrage of horrible messages: . ""nobody cares about u"" ""i hate u"" ""you seriously deserve to die"" Rebecca apparently gave up on herself, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""Rebecca wasn't attacking back. She appeared to be beat down."" But Rebecca's suffering was no secret at her school. Teachers saw her in tears. In December, she was hospitalized after slitting her wrists. Her school started a campaign against bullying, giving talks before the student body to discourage it. The night before her deadly plunge, she sent a message to a boy she met on Facebook: ""I'm jumping. I can't take it anymore."" Should parents be criminally liable for kids' cyberbullying? A suspect's defense . Two girls have been charged with aggravated stalking in Rebecca's case: 14-year-old Guadalupe Shaw and 12-year-old Kaitlyn Roman. CNN does not typically identify minors who are charged as juveniles, but the network is doing so in this case because their identities have been publicized by law enforcement and have received extensive publicity in their local media. Weeks after Rebecca leaped to her death, a potentially incriminating message appeared on Guadalupe's Facebook page: . ""Yes IK I bullied REBECCA nd she killed her self but IDGAF,"" the message read. Judd said the online vernacular meant: ""I don't give a (expletive)."" The sheriff called in Guadalupe and her family about the post. Police arrested the daughter. Mother of girl accused of bullying Florida teen arrested on unrelated charges . But Guadalupe's father, Jose, told CNN's ""New Day"" last week that his daughter couldn't have been the one to post that message. The father had just finished watching the news on TV when he found her asleep and sent her to bed. It was about that time that the message landed on Facebook, he said. ""I grabbed the computer and took it to my room, and the only other thing she could have used to send this message was my cell phone, and my cell phone is always with me,"" he said. He said he suspects someone hacked her account. But the sheriff said he doubts that. Judd said investigators don't believe the teen's Facebook account was compromised, Judd said. Sheriff: Taunting post leads to arrests in bullying death . Mother of teen suspect arrested . Not long after Guadalupe's arrest, her mother was arrested on suspicion of child abuse and child neglect, authorities said Friday. Judd said 30-year-old Vivian Vosburg was arrested Friday afternoon. The sheriff emphasized that Vosburg's charges are not related to those of her daughter and the other young suspect in Rebecca's case. Vosburg's arrest came after authorities received tips from residents that she might have been involved in beating children, Judd said. A minute-long video clip Judd played at a Friday press conference showed a woman, whom he identified as Vosburg, punching two boys with her fist while shouting profanities. Join us October 29 for a Google Hangout on bullying . Judd said the mother first argued the beating was an accident but then said it ""got out of hand"" partly because she was having a bad day. The video had been posted to the Internet and has since been taken down. It wasn't immediately clear who took the video or when and where it was taken.

"(CNN) -- From playing bat and ball in quiet corners of refugee camps to cricket's most glamorous tournament; Afghanistan's national team, like the country, has come a long way. The team's rise to the biggest stage of them all, the 2015 World Cup, has been nothing short of remarkable -- and equally heartwarming. The scenes of jubilation on the pitch as Afghanistan recently brushed aside a disappointing Kenya team couldn't have been farther from the reality of life for many Afghans after decades of conflict and turmoil in their country. The first Afghans learned the game in Pakistani refugee camps, having fled the Soviet invasion of 1979. READ MORE: Afghan cricket's battle for acceptance . Sport was banned completely under the strict Islamic fundamentalist rule of the Taliban, between 1996 and 2001, with pitches and arenas more likely to host an execution than a training session or a match. But as the Taliban lost its grip, sport blossomed, with cricket among those leading the way. Cut strips appeared across the country and children would use roads as wickets, discarded pieces of wood as bats and wickets. And the rest, as they say, is history. Afghan cricket has gone from strength to strength. Just 12 years ago, the team didn't even officially exist. Then a few Afghan expats set up a team in Pakistan and applied for accreditation to global cricket's organizing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). In 2001, Afghanistan became an ICC associate member, which meant cricket was recognized as an established sport in the country. It was a start, but little more than that. In 2008, the team played its first matches in division five of the ICC's global league -- against Japan and the tiny island of Jersey, a self-governing British Crown dependency off the coast of northern France. That's as low as world cricket goes. But by winning the league, the players gave themselves a chance of qualifying for the 2011 World Cup. Ultimately that proved to be a step too far, too soon, as they came up short. But it wasn't all bad news. The team did enough in the qualifiers to be granted the status of an international one-day team. They went on to qualify for the world Twenty20 tournament, a shortened form of the game, in 2010 and again in 2012. Despite some respectable performances, they did little to surprise the bookies and fell during the initial knock-out stage. But now, what appeared to be nothing more than a dream just a few short years ago has finally become reality. Afghanistan triumphed over Kenya by seven wickets at the recent World Cricket League Championship in Sharjah, UAE to win the right to play at the 2015 World Cup. They will be part of a group that includes co-hosts Australia and New Zealand, as well as Bangladesh, England and Sri Lanka. ""I can't express my feelings. It is a very big day in my life. I'm sure there will be huge celebrations back home,"" the team's talismanic captain, Mohammad Nabi, told the ICC website. ""I didn't expect to play in a World Cup when I started playing cricket. But now I can cherish this moment and look forward to playing against the best sides in some of the best playing facilities."" The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is a far cry from the refugee camps many Afghans can relate to.","Afghanistan triumphed over Kenya to win the right to play at the 2015 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- The world-famous Hubble Space Telescope is owned by the U.S. government and operated cooperatively by NASA and an institute under contract to NASA. Now that the government has shut down, the institute can still use existing resources to continue Hubble operations for as long as possible. Its staff has tried to ensure that -- to the extent possible -- the shutdown will not affect telescope operations. But events can overtake plans. If Hubble encounters a problem or a glitch, as happens occasionally, science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations. Safe mode means orienting the delicate instruments away from the sun while keeping the solar panels illuminated, to make sure no instrument loses power and is ruined. But in safe mode, the instruments won't record any of the light coming to the telescope. The approximate cost of one hour of Hubble observing is somewhere between $8,000 and $25,000, depending on whether one adds the costs of operating and refurbishing the facility to its initial construction costs. That means a two-week government shutdown could waste $3 million, $5 million, even $8 million of taxpayer investment. Frankly, the loss to science is far greater. Each year thousands of astronomers from around the world compete to decide where Hubble will point -- toward particular stars or planets or galaxies or gravitational lenses. Special science panels spend weeks setting priorities for the most important proposed science investigations. For every 10 hours of observing time astronomers want to use, only 1 hour is eventually approved. U.S. shutdown threatens launch of NASA's next mission to Mars . That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations. The James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, is undergoing critical tests at the Goddard Space Flight Center. This has to be done at extremely cold temperatures, mimicking conditions in space, and the amount of time to cool the system down is one of the drivers of schedule and therefore cost. As long as the government remains shut down, the testing will have to wait. If the shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, the JWST instrument module will have to be warmed up, probably pushing the launch date forward by a few months and raising the cost commensurately (about $1 million per day). NASA operates dozens of scientific spacecraft. A few look out at the cosmos, like Hubble. Many monitor the sun and the particle environment around Earth. Such observations have provided early warning of major sunstorms (known by solar scientists as ""coronal mass ejections"") that can knock out communications satellites and other fragile electronics. To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: ""Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available. We sincerely regret the inconvenience."" This prompted further searching. The main NASA website defaults to the same error message. The education and outreach pages maintained by astronomers at the Goddard Space Flight Center -- and read by schoolchildren across the country -- are not accessible. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, because it is run under contract to NASA, still has a visible website. Their flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity Rover, is apparently still active, operated by team members who work for JPL or Caltech or other participating institutions other than the federal government. But as for Hubble, if there is any kind of glitch, federal civil servants will be essential to the recovery of rover operations. NASA grounded by government shutdown . The work doesn't disappear, either. Scientists at NASA and the National Science Foundation are some of the hardest working people I know. The government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work. They can't take their laptops home or phone into teleconferences from home, the way I might if a hurricane or snowstorm threatened Yale. So, you might think they are having a nice (though unpaid) vacation. But actually, the same work is sitting on their desk when they get back, and it all has to get done. So it means they'll work longer hours to catch up and for most civil servant scientists, there is no such thing as overtime pay. A NASA colleague at the Goddard Space Flight Center is designing a powerful new telescope. For the past few weeks, we've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do. Now, there is radio silence. His last e-mail said, ""This is going to be my last e-mail before the government shutdown ends. Any work during a shutdown is deemed a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. You are welcome to continue to e-mail me, but I might not be able to respond until the federal government opens for business."" We are all waiting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Government shutdown affects NASA, where employees are off the job .

"London (CNN) -- The five surviving Monty Python members on Thursday announced their comeback performance in London next year, and fans are eagerly anticipating which vintage sketches will be dusted off for another airing. But their combined age of 357 years has taken its toll, and it remains to be seen how the comedians' aging bodies stand up to the often slapstick nature of Python sketches. One that John Cleese is unlikely to perform is the swivel-limbed ""Ministry of Silly Walks,"" due to what he says are his ailing hips and knees. Cleese says the show at the O2 Arena on July 1 will have some new material, but many old bits -- some featured in perhaps new ways -- that fans will expect, along with ""comedy, pathos, music and a tiny bit of ancient sex."" ""I remember going to the Royal Albert Hall and seeing Neil Diamond where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers. People really do want to see the old hits, but we don't want to do them exactly in a predictable way, so it's going to be a mix-up, I think,"" Cleese adds. Asked what he believes the modern twist will be, Terry Gilliam replies: ""The fact that we can actually still walk and stand upright."" While the Python stars say they hope the new performance will appeal to a new generation of fans, they are brazen enough to admit that money was one of the main factors in their decision to reform for the first time since 1980. ""I hope it makes us a lot of money. I hope to be able to pay off my mortgage!"" Terry Jones said days before Thursday's high-octane news conference at which the five Pythons announced they will perform at the O2 -- the world's biggest-grossing concert venue. Michael Palin adds that ""money was part of it."" But as the five aging comedians lumber onto the stage at the Playhouse Theatre in central London, it is evident how much mutual regard they still have, despite often-fractious years working together and three decades apart. ""We may not like each other, but we make each other laugh,"" Cleese reflects. The show will be the first time Cleese, Jones, Gilliam, Palin and Eric Idle have performed together since the death of Graham Chapman from cancer in 1989. His presence will be sorely missed -- by both audience and stars. ""We've told him he'll be on with us,"" Idle says, not entirely in jest, ""and if there is a God, he'll turn up."" There'll be a nurse on hand just in case of emergencies, he adds quickly. Despite the show being billed as ""a final reunion"" and ""one down, five to go,"" the comedians say a world tour may follow ""depending on how long Eric and Mike live for,"" Cleese jokes. When the pair protest, saying they believe the deaths could occur in alphabetical order, he quips: ""In your dreams Gilliam."" The longevity of Python -- and excitement the reunion has stirred up among fans appears to have taken the five Pythons by surprise. ""No one expected this to be more than a Sunday night show at the BBC,"" Idle says, referring to the first TV broadcast in 1969. Forty-five episodes and five films later, the Pythons are comic legends, with their legions of fans around the world able to recite every line of their scripts word-perfect. ""I'm just shocked and amazed"" at the reaction to the reunion, he says, adding that he thought they'd waited ""until demand had died down."" The Python shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches, often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream of consciousness animations. The group dressed as old ladies, as transvestite lumberjacks, performed sketches about pompous middle-class men, used catchphrases such as ""And now for something completely different,"" and sang ditties such as ""Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam ..."" Some of the material has never been performed on stage before, and the group says fans could expect the crunching frog sketch, a version of the dead parrot sketch and the Spanish Inquisition. Other material ""they hope people will have forgotten, so it'll appear new,"" Idle adds. The sketches still make them laugh, despite the passing of time, Palin says. ""We had a read-through of all the material, which to me was far more anxiety-inducing than the press conference. But it's still funny. The show is going to be spectacular."" Python has appeal around the world, he believes, because ""it's seen as physical but not topical - it doesn't require knowledge of British politics or way of life. It's just quite jolly!"" CNN's Max Foster, David Wilkinson and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","Fans eagerly awaiting return of Monty Python stars for first time in three decades .

"(CNN) -- The latest in a string of suspicious fires early Thursday destroyed a home in Detroit's internationally known Heidelberg Project, an installation that transformed decaying homes into works of art. The blaze engulfed ""The Penny House,"" a small home adorned with images of pennies, around 3 a.m., fire officials said. The two-story structure was leveled by the time firefighters arrived. The nonprofit behind that artwork set out to bring new life to Detroit's crime-ridden East Side and draw attention to the community's plight. The project was recently featured by CNN's Anthony Bordain on ""Parts Unknown: Detroit."" In the last two months, Heidelberg Project properties were hit with five fires, which destroyed three of the vacant buildings -- ""Obstruction of Justice,"" ""House of Soul"" and ""The Penny House,"" according to the project. Only four properties remain in the installation, which draws about 300,000 visitors from around the world each year. Detroit Senior Fire Chief Larry Gassel voiced his suspicions about the fires to CNN, saying of the buildings, ""They're all vacant; it's not like it's wiring. So something is definitely going on there."" Detroit has long battled waves of arson. No arrests have been made in connection with the fires. Heidelberg Project staff said city's slow emergency response times were partly to blame for the destruction of the buildings. ""It's kind of our thinking that this individual keeps doing this knows [because] he can get away with it,"" Katie Hearn, marketing coordinator for Heidelberg Project told CNN. Artist Tyree Guyton created the Heidelberg Project in 1986, slowly bringing decaying homes back to life with decorations.

"(The Frisky) -- By T-minus 18 days until the Oscars and, of course, we are all starting to place bets on who we think will walk away with little golden men this year. Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold. But there's another trend we've been noticing lately: the winners for Best Actress and Best Actor tend to be the person who's taken on the based-on-a-true-story role. In fact, 10 of the 20 top honors given in the 2000s went to actors who portrayed real people. Let's take a look, shall we? Last year, Sandra Bullock won Best Actress -- just days after taking home a Razzie -- for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, the Southern mom who took in Michael Oher and helped coach him toward football greatness. The real Leigh Anne was in the theater to see Sandra accept her award. The Frisky: 12 Female Celebs Reveal Their True Size . In 2008, Sean Penn won the Academy Award for Best Actor -- again! -- for playing Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. I still remember the gorgeous mermaid-scale gown that Marion Cotillard won when she accepted the Oscar for Best Actress in 2007 for her role in ""La Vie En Rose."" In the movie, she played Edith Piaf, an extremely popular singer in France who was also known for her out-of-control social life. In many ways, Marion won for playing the Britney Spears of 1950s France. The Frisky: 12 Starlets Married And Divorced By 26 . In 2006's ""The Queen,"" Helen managed to out-Elizabeth Queen Elizabeth II herself in the movie about the aftermath of Princess Diana's death. Helen, of course, won Oscar gold for her efforts. Philip Seymour Hoffman was one of two actors to portray writer Truman Capote in a two-year span. His uncanny portrayal netted him a Best Actor win in 2005. The Frisky: 10 Celebs Who Fancy Themselves Doctors . That same year, Reese Witherspoon won Best Actress for playing another beloved real character -- June Carter Cash, the wife of Johnny Cash. In the movie, Reese didn't sound exactly like June as she warbled ""Jackson,"" but put her own spin on the classic tune. Blame it on the al-al-al-alcohol, but sometimes I forget that Jamie Foxx is an Oscar winner. He won Best Actor in 2004 for his portrayal of iconic ivory-tickler Ray Charles in ""Ray."" The Frisky: Scandalous 9 Celebrity Pairs Spotted Leaving A Party Together . Charlize Theron broke out of the former-model mold when she played Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who killed at least six men. By gaining 30 pounds, rocking a mullet, and perfecting an eyebrow-less, terrifying stare, Charlize won Best Actress in 2003. Adrien Brody may be in beer ads now, but in 2003 he was riding high after winning the Oscar for Best Actor in ""The Pianist."" In the movie, he played Jewish piano virtuoso Szpilman, who survived the Nazi invasion of Poland. In 2000, Julia Roberts took on the role of a brash single mother who, without a law degree, helped construct a lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The grooved, gray concrete wall rising from a few inches to a few feet seems to be solely for blocking the noise from the nearby highway, but like many parts of the new Pentagon memorial, there is more to the wall than meets the eye. Seven years after the September 11 attack on the Pentagon, the wall is designed to remind visitors of the youngest and oldest victims, wrapping the memorial in symbolic imagery. It stands 3 inches tall at its beginning, representing the youngest person killed there -- 3-year-old Dana Falkenberg -- and continues to a height of 71 inches, corresponding to the oldest victim, retired U.S. Navy Capt. John D. Yamnicky Sr. Both were aboard American Airlines Flight 77 when terrorists hijacked the plane and smashed it into the Pentagon that day. Falkenberg died with her mother and father, Charles Falkenberg and Leslie Whittington, and her 8-year-old sister, Zoe. President Bush attended a solemn ceremony on the grounds Thursday, along with dignitaries and family members of those killed in the attack.  See images of 9/11 » . A flag was raised at half staff and the national anthem was played. The words on a big screen seemed to capture the moment: ""We will never forget."" ""The Pentagon memorial will stand as an everlasting tribute to 184 innocent souls who perished on these grounds,"" Bush said. ""A memorial can never replace what those of you mourning a loved one have lost. We pray that you will find some comfort amid the peace of these grounds. We pray that you'll find strength in knowing that our nation will always grieve with you.""  Watch bagpipes play at the site » . Donald Rumsfeld, who was defense secretary when the Pentagon was attacked, said, ""We will never forget the way this huge building shook. We will not forget our colleagues and friends who were taken from us and their families. And we will not forget what that deadly attack has meant for our nation."" The symbolism inside begins for visitors as they first step into the memorial.  Watch as the Pentagon remembers 9/11 victims » . As they enter the cenotaph, they pass over etched stone that reads, ""September 11, 2001 -- 9:37 a.m.,"" the exact moment of the attack on the Pentagon. The stone in which that infamous date is carved was recovered from the smoldering ruins of the Pentagon, still stained with the burn marks from the explosion and fire from Flight 77 slamming into the building. Across the memorial grounds, 184 bench-like structures, each one dedicated to a victim, are clustered in what seems like an uneven and unsettling array throughout the main grounds of the memorial.  See the symbolism driving the memorial's design » . ""We've tried to keep everything subtle to the extent that people can discover,"" said Keith Kaseman, the memorial co-designer. Thomas Heidenberger stopped recently with his son, Tom, to pay tribute to his wife, Michelle, a senior flight attendant on Flight 77. They wept as they sat on the bench honoring her. iReport: How are you observing 9/11? ""These were the first to die in this so-called war on terror,"" Heidenberger said. ""Why shouldn't we not just remember the day, but remember their sacrifice, remember their lives?"" His son said the memorial was touching because it started with an artist's rendition, but now is a reality and a fitting tribute to those who died. ""It looks great,"" he said. ""I'm very impressed."" The benches are laid out in a pattern according to the year each victim was born, from 1998 to 1930. Some rows, called birth-year aisles, have just one seat, and some have three or more. All of the granite-covered benches, called memorial units, are oriented in the direction the plane hit the building, pointing east. Each unit rises smoothly from the ground in a gentle slope to form the bench. A small pool of water beneath each one gently gurgles, adding to the relaxing nature the designers intended. On the end of each unit, the name of the victim is inscribed in stainless steel. Family members who lost loved ones have already begun leaving flowers and notes at the benches. The names on the benches face east or west, depending on where the victims were when they died. If the victim was on the plane, visitors read the name as they look toward the western sky. If the person was inside the Pentagon, you read the name looking at the building, facing east. ""The idea that this place is just an invitation for your thoughts and your interpretations is what we see as persisting through time, and I think that's what sets it apart to some extent,"" Kaseman said. Just steps from the Pentagon complex, it is like many of the Washington memorials in that access is freely available 24 hours a day. But it stands in a different place from the more well-known monuments. Tucked away on a small patch of super-secure land between a busy highway and the nation's military headquarters, the symbolism of a post-9/11 security environment is present. An iron fence surrounds the memorial, providing visitors with unintended symbolism. Just outside the fence, a Pentagon police guard shack is on one side, and a giant earthen berm -- designed to deflect bomb blasts from the Pentagon -- is on another. On a third side is a checkpoint with explosives-sniffing dogs and a secure road that leads to a Pentagon delivery facility away from the building. It is hard to imagine that a few years ago, this land was once just flat grass and the original location of the building's helicopter port before the attack. It has taken seven years to build the memorial. But the time has not lessened the memories or the solemn nature of the location, feet from the impact site. A kind of peace is still present between the whirring traffic and the occasional low-flying military helicopter preparing to land at a helipad. Plantings and trees will eventually fill it in the young memorial, creating a more private and intimate setting; and for those who lost family, friends and colleagues, the symbolism outside the memorial will be drowned out by the intimate symbolism inside. Thomas Heidenberger said those who lost loved ones in the New York attack still don't have a memorial -- ""no place to go, have no closure."" He stressed the importance of such sites to families left behind. ""We have a place to go other than a burial plot or a vacant stone in a cemetery,"" he said. ""The children who were born to 9/11 moms who don't have a dad, they have a place to go. And the elderly now have a place to go visit their children, their loved ones.""","Pentagon unveils 9/11 memorial to honor the 184 victims killed there .

"(CNN) -- Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and American Kevin Streelman are tied for the lead after Thursday's opening round of the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne. Both men fired rounds of 66 to finish on five-under par at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club to take their respective nations to the top of the team standings. Historically, the tournament has been primarily a team event, but format changes this year have made it ""an individual event with a team component,"" say organizers. Gallery: World's greatest island greens . Individual players are competing in 72 holes of stroke play and vying for $7 million of the $8 million prize pot. The remaining $1 million will be shared between the leading teams. Bjorn's Danish teammate Thorbjorn Olesen and Streelman's partner Matt Kuchar (who won the team event with Gary Woodland in 2011) both shot level par rounds of 71. Portugal are currently lying second on two-under par thanks to rounds of 69 from Ricardo Santos and 71 from Jose-Filipe Lima. ""I played well today,"" BjÃ¶rn told reporters. ""I got off to a bit of a not so great start when I four-putted number four and then I thought, 'well, this could be a long day', but I kept my composure and made some good birdies. I did everything well today. I drove it pretty well."" Streelman was equally content despite dropping two shots in the closing three holes. ""I was very pleased with that start. It's just an incredible golf course, I love it ... I just had a lot of fun there to be honest,"" Streelman said. He and Bjorn are one shot ahead of South Korea's K.J. Choi, Welshman Stuart Manley and Scot Martin Laird. Home favorite Jason Day shot a highly respectable 68 to take sixth place on his own. The 26-year-old, who is mourning the loss of eight relatives in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan, finished three-under par after claiming five birdies and two bogeys.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner has a liability on his hands. Rep. Trey Radel, R-Florida, has taken a leave of absence after pleading guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession. Boehner has been praised by congressional watchdogs for having little tolerance for derelict members of Congress. But for now, Radel is retaining his seat. ""I believe that members of Congress should be held to the highest ethical standard,"" Boehner told reporters Thursday. ""The issue is between he and his family and his constituents."" Other members of Congress caught in compromising situations heard a similar refrain from the speaker. After Rep. Chris Lee, R-New York, was caught soliciting women with shirtless selfies on Craigslist in 2011, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), said that Boehner ""serves as a ruthless judge and jury within his party when it comes to the extracurricular activities of members of his conference."" While Boehner insisted that it was Lee's decision, the New Yorker immediately resigned his seat. Boehner said, ""members should be held to the highest ethical standard."" That's not the only time Boehner has given this canned response. When Republican Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana admitted to having an affair with a staffer in 2010, Boehner's spokesman at the time said ""he will hold our members to the highest ethical standards."" And when Republican Vito Fossella of New York was arrested for drunk driving in 2008 and then admitted to having a child in an extramarital affair, Boehner said his political future is a ""decision between he, his family and his constituents."" Lee and Souder resigned immediately. Fossella did not seek re-election, which was just a month out. While Boehner took no credit for the members' decision to step down, the situation behind the scenes is likely much different. Radel's office confirmed to CNN on Thursday that the congressman has checked into a drug treatment facility. His office released this statement: ""Today, I checked myself into a facility to seek treatment and counseling. It is my hope, through this process, I will come out a better man. I will work hard to gain back the trust and support of my constituents, friends and most importantly, my family."" While Radel retains his seat, Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said she doesn't ""see how he survives this."" Boehner and the Republican Party should have little tolerance for Radel, who is the first member of Congress since at least the 1980s to be caught with drugs, Sloan said. ""It's surprising that they haven't pushed Radel out yet,"" Sloan said. A senior House GOP aide said Boehner is coming down lightly on Radel because his is an issue of ""addiction and substance abuse."" Sloan immediately dismissed that justification. She said cocaine use is ""pretty bad"" and that blaming drug use on alcohol addiction is ""irrelevant."" Members of Congress are ""supposed to uphold the law,"" she said. Radel, who has been in office for 11 months, is a first-time politician. The former TV journalist-turned conservative radio talk show host represents the southwest Florida coastal cities of Fort Myers and Naples. Radel's future comes with political risks. Radel represents a safe Republican district. It contains the fewest registered Democrats in the state and he won election with 62% of the vote. If he stays, voters in the popular retirement community might not be forgiving. With the election a year away, there's still plenty of time for Republicans to find a replacement. Or the party could stay out of it and wait to see whether a Republican challenges Radel in the primary, assuming he decides to run again. Who is Trey Radel? Back in Washington, the congressman responsible for getting Republicans elected to the House, Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, offered a noncommittal response about Radel's future. ""He's going to need to explain what happened and then make some decisions,"" Walden, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Wednesday. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Radel's drug use shows ""inconsistency"" within the Republican Party, which is pushing drug-testing of food stamp recipients, a position Radel voted for this summer. Ethics problems are not confined to the Republican House. Democrats Eric Massa of New York quickly left office after he was accused of sexual harassment, as did Anthony Weiner for posting lewd pictures of himself on Twitter. There appears to be a little more tolerance in the Senate. Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho still holds his seat after pleading guilty to drunk driving and Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, remains in office after his involvement with a prostitute. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, resigned amid an ethics investigation that involved an extramarital affair. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, also resigned after alleging soliciting a police officer for sex in an airport bathroom. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Boehner on Rep.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's opposition said Sunday that it will not ""commit political suicide"" by entering into a government with President Robert Mugabe without the power to deliver change, food and jobs. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, in a speech to supporters Saturday, refused calls to step down. Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa made that comment after his party's national executive meeting and ahead of talks slated for Monday on forming a government of national unity. Last September, Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal, but they have not formed a government of national unity. The agreement, brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki on behalf of Southern African Development Community (SADC), stalled as Tsvangirai accused Mugabe of grabbing all key ministries such as defense, information, foreign affairs, finance and home affairs. South African President Kgalema Motlanthe, chairman of the regional body SADC, is coming to Zimbabwe Monday with his predecessor, Mbeki, and with Mozambique leader Armando Guebuza to try to resolve the impasse. In an interview with CNN, Chamisa said of Monday's planned meeting: ""We cannot go into positions of authority without the attendant and consequent power to enable us to deliver on change, food and jobs. ""It is an act of political hari-kari, political suicide, and we are not ready to commit suicide yet. We cannot commit political suicide by entering into a government limping and in pain. It's like swallowing poison and we become the victims. ""We are going to insist on the outstanding issues, which are to do with equity of ministries, making sure that we attain the position of governors in line with March 29 election and therefore we are going to insist and stick to our position and we hope Mister Mugabe and ZANU-PF will appreciate the nobility of our very vital position."" ZANU-PF is Mugabe's party. Describing Monday's planned meeting as a ""watershed,"" Chamisa said his party wanted the protracted talks to end. Mugabe told the state media that Monday's meeting would be the final one, and that he would form a government without the opposition if no agreement was reached. Chamisa responded by saying: ""Mugabe is a failure and cannot dictate pace. If they choose to terminate the talks by their arrogance, let it be, we will not give Mugabe latitude to be funny. ""We are the winners and therefore we should be indicating which issues to deliberate on. So we will not give Mister Mugabe latitude to be funny because there is no time for that, people are suffering."" The agreement, under which Mugabe would remain as Zimbabwe's president and Tsvangirai would become prime minister, follows last June's hotly disputed presidential runoff, which was marred by more than 200 deaths, mainly among opposition supporters. Tsvangirai had won the first round in March, but failed to reached the threshold required. The deal is seen by many as the panacea to the plethora of problems facing Zimbabwe. The once prosperous nation is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis. Acute shortages of essentials have raised inflation, now the highest in the world. The United Nations says more than five million people face starvation and there is no food aid. Added to that, a cholera outbreak has claimed more than 2,200 lives as the country fails to import adequate stocks of chemicals to treat the water. The epidemic has coincided with a strike, now in its fourth month, by doctors and nurses demanding a salary review, more medicines and better hospital equipment. Tsvangirai returned home Saturday and said he was committed to a power-sharing deal with Mugabe, despite recent threats to abandon the deal. But he vowed that he would not be rushed to join an inclusive government.","Opposition: Power-sharing deal must give it genuine power to deliver change .

"Washington (CNN) -- Four months ago, North Korea threatened to scrap the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the Korean War and resume hostilities against the United States and South Korea in response to tougher U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang after its latest nuclear test. This week, the famously reclusive dictatorship welcomed a large Western media contingent, including CNN journalists, to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice. On Saturday, young leader Kim Jong Un made an unprecedented move when he deliberately walked through the throng of foreign media as he toured a new museum commemorating what North Korea calls its victory in the Korean civil war. Such a shift in public posturing is common for North Korea, which is known for bellicose threats followed by diplomatic overtures intended to wring desperately needed aid and concessions from the outside world. Fast facts: Korean War . ""This is just a recurring pattern. Nothing special,"" said Kongdan ""Katy"" Oh, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who specializes in East Asia. The outward appearance of possible change in North Korea under Kim after decades of secretive dictatorship comes amid strained relations with its powerful neighbor and benefactor, China. It followed followed Xi Jinping's ascendancy to power in China, which essentially props up North Korea through its economic ties and aid. Since Xi became head of the ruling Communist Party last November, Beijing has signaled growing impatience with Pyongyang's tactics. In March, less than a week before Xi also became president, China joined the rest of the U.N. Security Council in backing tougher sanctions against North Korea in response to Pyongyang's nuclear test in February. Pondering Pyongyang: Beijing's problem child . The sanctions prompted the war threats by North Korea and test-firing of missiles, raising tension on the Korean peninsula. Oh explained that China was angry with Kim for a December satellite launch in violation of U.N. resolutions that raised regional tensions during Xi's transition to power. The February nuclear test further exacerbated China's anger, she said. Before Xi headed to the United States for a trip that included a June meeting with President Barack Obama, North Korea sent an envoy to China who got treated ""like cold rice,"" according to Oh. Kurt Campbell, who recently served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told CNN before the Xi-Obama meeting that the Chinese ""have just about had it with North Korea. ""They recognize that the steps that they have taken -- nuclear provocations -- are creating the context for more military activities on the part of the United States and other countries that ultimately are not in China's best strategic interests,"" Campbell said then. However, Oh dismissed any chance that China would use its leverage to try to force reforms in North Korea, saying the history and structure of the military backed dictatorship made it impossible for Kim to undo the legacy of this father and grandfather. Opinion: What Obama should tell China's Xi about North Korea . The satellite launch in December and nuclear test in February were Kim's way of establishing his leadership with the military, on which his power depends, Oh explained. She likened North Korea to an impoverished African dictatorship that happened to have nuclear weapons. Now, with chronic food shortages exacerbated in the months before the harvest, Kim is putting on what Oh called ""an early summer charm offensive"" to ensure his regime gets all the aid and economic benefit available from China and others. That means allowing in the Western media for the armistice commemoration events and reportedly signaling support for resuming long-suspended six-party talks on curtailing North Korea's nuclear program. In addition, recent visits from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman have boosted North Korea's popularity as a travel destination. Tour operators say a record number of foreigners were coming to this year's Arirang Festival, a seven-week celebration of gymnastics and music that began Monday at Pyongyang's May Day Stadium. To Oh, it amounts to cosmetic changes rather than anything close to real reform. On Friday, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that Kim supported China's call for resuming the six-party talks with the United States, South Korea and others. According to Xinhua, Kim's backing for more six-party talks came after he met with Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao, the highest-level Chinese official to visit North Korea since Kim took power in 2011 after the death of his father, longtime dictator Kim Jong Il. However, a report on Li's visit by the North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency made no mention of his call for resuming the nuclear talks or Kim's supporting it.

"(CNN) -- He's the most expensive player in the world, and one of the best paid, but Cristiano Ronaldo was given a very public reminder on the need to be humble on Wednesday. The Real Madrid superstar was told he is ""cocky"" and ""has a screw loose"" by veteran Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani, who clashed with Ronaldo during lowly Osasuna's shock win over the Spanish giants on Sunday. The 34-year-old Pandiani, nicknamed ""the Rifle,"" spoke out at a press conference after becoming angry when Ronaldo reportedly asked him how much he earned during Real's defeat -- which left Jose Mourinho's team seven points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona.

"(CNN) -- A late equalizer from Esteban Granero spared Real Madrid's blushes on Sunday night as they struggled to a 1-1 draw with bottom-placed Almeria at the Estadio del Mediterraneo. Newly-crowned FIFA world coach of the year, Jose Mourinho saw his side labor without reward for most of the match against a side which has only won twice in the league all season. A resolute performance from the home side was rewarded in the 60th minute when an effort from Jose Ulloa saw them take a shock 1-0 lead. Spurred into action, Real fought back with Cristiano Ronaldo nearly finding the net after a mazy run, but was denied by the feet of Diego Alves. But Almeria's goalkeeper could not do anything about Granero goal who fired a rocket into the roof of the net after receiving a lay-off from substitute Karim Benzema who came on for Kaka. Meanwhile, Barcelona breezed past 16th place Malaga 4-1 at the Nou Camp to open up a four point gap over rivals Madrid. Iniesta opened the scoring after eight minutes firing home off the post with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. David Villa doubled the lead 10 minutes later as Barcelona teased and tricked their way through Malaga's defences. Rodriguez made it three nine minutes before the break after Messi had carved open the defence with a perfectly weighted pass. Duda did pull one back for the visitors in the 68th minute, but David Silva netted his second of the night and Barcelona's fourth seven minutes later. Earlier in the day, Valencia overcame Deportivo La Coruna 2-0 to cement fourth place in the table. They made sure of three points late in the game with goals from defender Jeremy Mathieu in the 77th minute and Pablo Hernandez who added a second in injury time. Deportivo remain in 13th place. In the Bundesliga, Hannover moved up to second after a convincing 3-0 win at Frankfurt. Two early goals from Mohammed Abdellaoue in the 15th minute and Christian Schulz six minutes later saw the visitors seize control of the match which was never relinquished. An 88th minute strike from Didier Ya Konan rounded off a resounding victory. Hannover are now 12 points behind runaway leaders Dortmund. Frankfurt remain in eighth place on 26 points. At the other end of the table, the match between Kaiserslautern and Cologne ended in a 1-1 draw. Cologne took the lead after half an hour as Podolski found the target, only to see Moravek equalize in the 50th minute.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- President Barack Obama threw his full support behind a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws on Tuesday, saying ""now's the time"" to replace a system he called ""out of date and badly broken."" The president specified three pillars of immigration reform: better enforcement of immigration laws, providing a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country, and reforming the legal immigration system. Speaking at a majority Hispanic high school in Las Vegas, Obama said ""a broad consensus is emerging"" behind the issue across the country, with signs of progress in Congress. Mexico 'welcomes' new U.S. immigration reform push . However, he acknowledged a fierce debate ahead on an issue he described as emotional and challenging, but vital to economic growth and ensuring equal opportunity for all. ""At this moment, it looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon. And that's very encouraging,"" Obama said, later adding: ""This time, action must follow. We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate."" The president spoke a day after eight senators -- four from each party -- introduced a framework for overhauling the immigration system that would provide an eventual path to citizenship for most of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in America. While touted as a breakthrough by its drafters, the plan was similar in many aspects to previous immigration reform efforts that have failed in recent years. Obama described the blueprint as a sign of renewed desire by Democrats and Republicans to tackle the issue, saying the plan was ""very much in line with the principles I've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years."" Immigration Q&A: Amnesty or path to citizenship? He was criticized by Latino activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make overhauling immigration policy a priority of his first term. As his re-election campaign heated up last year, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated that Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves. Obama won Nevada, a battleground state with a large Hispanic population. Obama appeared on Tuesday at Del Sol High School, which has a 54% Hispanic student body, according to U.S. News and World Report rankings. To earn the opportunity for citizenship, Obama said undocumented immigrants must first pass a background check, learn English, pay a penalty, and then get ""in the back of the line"" behind people trying to come to America legally. Immigration plan: A new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity? Millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in the United States, under the compromise plan crafted by the senate group. That outline also called for strengthening border controls, improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers. Only after those steps occurred could undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence -- green cards -- as a step toward citizenship, the senators said at a news conference on Monday. Before Obama spoke on Tuesday, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said any legislation based on the framework he helped draft must include tougher law enforcement sought by conservatives to get his vote. Immigrants' days filled with fear, uncertainty, separation . ""We need border security, we need workplace enforcement, we need a visa tracking system,"" Rubio said, adding later that would oppose a bill that lacked language guaranteeing that ""nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place."" Rubio and other senators involved in the bipartisan immigration effort said Monday they plan to provide a bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, with hopes of getting the measure passed over the summer . A few hours later, Obama said he would propose his own immigration bill if Congress failed to act on the issue in a timely manner. On the House side, a similar effort on immigration is said to be under way involving a group of Republicans and Democrats. Two senior House Democratic sources briefed on that effort told CNN the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon, possibly as early as this week, but concede ""they are not as far along as the Senate."" By the numbers: Immigration and naturalization . Senate lays out blueprint . The principles described by Obama on Tuesday were similar to the framework proposed Monday by the eight senators. Conservatives split on reform . Other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty, a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. ""Our immigration laws aren't broken, they just aren't enforced,"" argued Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, after Obama's speech. "" ... We've been down this road before with politicians promising to enforce the law in return for amnesty. And then after the amnesty, they fail to make good on the enforcement promises. The American people should not be fooled. When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration."" Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah objected to the framework by his Senate colleagues, saying the guidelines ""contemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to undocumented immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country."" What's in Senate immigration plan? Rubio rejected such a characterization on Tuesday, saying that the framework would require undocumented immigrants to undergo a background check and face immediate deportation if they committed any serious crimes. Otherwise, they then would have to pay any taxes owed as well as a fine to get what Rubio called ""the equivalent of a non-resident visa that allows you to work here."" An opportunity to get a green card and possible citizenship would only come after the government undertakes other steps, such as increasing border security, he added. Obama, meanwhile, signaled disagreement with Republicans over the state of border security, saying in his speech that the Southwest border was more secure than ever. He mentioned steps to crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers, as well as unclogging the legal immigration system to encourage highly skilled and educated workers already in the country to remain instead of taking their expertise abroad. Democratic senators backing the framework unveiled Monday plan include Chuck Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado. On the Republican side were Rubio, John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Durbin said Tuesday that immigration reform must have bipartisan support to work, so it won't include everything everyone wants. Path to citizenship: Senators outline bipartisan immigration plan . ""It's going to look different than what I might write, or the president might write,"" he said. Like the Senate framework, the House plan will include a path to citizenship, but details of how that will work are still being discussed. The Senate proposal is a good starting point, Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Florida, said Tuesday on CNN. ""I think it puts us in a very good place,"" he said. A litany of left-leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators' plan, praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers. ""The people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second-class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper, even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system,"" NAACP President Ben Jealous said. Opinion: Worker visas are the key to immigration reform . AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Yahoo News on Tuesday that his labor federation representing 12 million people will mount a ""full-fledged"" campaign in support of comprehensive immigration reform. ""We think everybody ought to have the right to work hard and to progress to citizenship,"" Trumka said. Meanwhile, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue has been in talks with Trumka on the issue. He said after Obama's remarks that American business hoped for changes this year. ""We should seize this opportunity to create an immigration system that serves the interests of our economy, our businesses, and our society,"" Donohue said. In a sign of the heated public debate on the issue, a group of about two dozen protesters standing across the street from the Las Vegas high school waved signs opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants as Obama's motorcade drove past.

"(CNN) -- The world is OK -- at least this time -- and scientists are psyched. An asteroid dubbed 1998 QE2 whizzed past Earth on Friday, with its own moon in tow. ""#asteroidQE2 has sailed harmlessly past Earth,"" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory tweeted around 5 p.m. ET. It got within about 3.6 million miles of our planet. That's close relatively given the vastness of space, but still more than 15 times the distance from wherever you are to our moon. The fly-by had astronomers less fearful and more excited about getting the ""best look at this asteroid ever,"" according to NASA. The resulting images should be of similar quality to those obtained when spacecraft get up close to asteroids, said Lance Benner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Scientists have been rubbing their hands for a decade and a half for this opportunity since they discovered the asteroid on August 19, 1998, the year for which it is named. The letter ""Q"" stands for the month of August. ""As my old friend, radar astronomer Steve Ostro used to say, spaceship Earth is making a fly-by of the asteroid, so we're going to exploit the capabilities of the radars to understand as much as possible,"" Benner said, according to a story on NASA's website.

""It's certainly one to keep an eye on."" NASA has been tracking it with radar devices since Thursday, not to clock its speed but to get good pictures of it. A day before, scientists got a shot of its moon. The images look less like photos and more like ultrasound images. The discovery of its moon -- which makes it what scientists call a binary asteroid -- surprised the astronomers, said NASA radar scientist Marina Brozovic, who helped take the images at Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California. More than 15% of asteroids travel in groups of two or three objects revolving around one another, according to NASA. Destructive potential . 1998 QE2's moon, which is 2,000 feet wide, is large enough for NASA to term it a ""potential city killer."" The asteroid it revolves around is much bigger, at 1.7 miles wide. ""This is one of the big ones,"" Chodas said. Large explosion on moon visible from earth . Any asteroid as large as a half-mile across would cause a global catastrophe, if it struck the blue planet, he added. To put the potential for damage by an asteroid into perspective, the one that paleontologists believe triggered the extinction of dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago was six miles in diameter. The meteor that exploded over Russia in February, injuring more than 1,000 people and causing millions of dollars in damage, was a ""very small asteroid,"" according to the space agency. The most dangerous asteroids contain a lot of stone or iron, according to NASA. 1998 QE2 contains a good bit of carbon and well as amino acids, the building blocks of protein. The NEOP has identified 95% of asteroids of this most dangerous order, Chodas said. Luckily, there is no known possibility of one slamming into the planet. But NASA has not yet done much work on the meteors one class lower, known as the ""potential city killers."" They start at a size of 150 yards in diameter. NASA astronomers have identified only 10% of the 10,000 they believe pass close to Earth. NASA officials this year told a congressional panel, which was considering future defense systems to prevent a potential asteroid strike, that there is only a one in 20,000 chance that a truly dangerous one will hit Earth in a year's time. Having a look . Even as it jets further and further away, astronomers will continue making images of 1998 QE2 through June 9 with two radar antennas -- one in California and a second one in Puerto Rico. Amateur astronomers with telescopes as small as 10 inches long may just barely be able to see it in the southern skies. But their devices should be computer controlled because locating it otherwise will be difficult, NASA advises. The coordinates to locate the asteroid are on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory website. NASA takes threats from asteroids seriously, and will keep calculating the orbits of the large ones they identify long to check their flight paths for any potential danger to Earth. Eventually, 1998 QE2 will curve back out toward the solar system's outer asteroid belt, which is just short of Jupiter. It will go by Earth next on July 12, 2028, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But that time there will be lots more elbow space -- the asteroid is expected to be about 45 million miles away. There will be a much closer call comes in about 200 years. Even then, though, scientists believe history will repeat itself -- and our planet will once again survive. Check out CNN's Light Years blog .

"(CNN) -- Terry McMillan writes best-selling fiction, but it was real-life drama -- a very public divorce -- that garnered her some of her biggest headlines. The nasty split with ex-husband Jonathan Plummer, the inspiration for the popular novel and movie ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back,"" was dissected everywhere, from book blogs to ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" A lawsuit, fraud allegations and public accusations all played out like plot points in one of her novels. A lot has changed since then. ""I just ended up realizing I had become this other person that I didn't like,"" McMillan said. She is now friends with her ex (""I just spoke to Jonathan on the phone yesterday"") and has set out to explore other family dramas in her trademark candid and funny style. Her new book, ""Who Asked You?,"" explores grandparents raising grandchildren -- a topic that has long fascinated her. ""One of the reasons that I write is because I'm more interested in looking, as opposed to looking away,"" McMillan said. In the book, Betty Jean, or BJ, is the matriarch of a family that includes an ailing husband, two sisters, a son in jail, a daughter on drugs and a son who is trying to forget where he came from. It delves into a serious topics from 15 viewpoints, an ambitious exploration of the inner lives of characters that are not normally given a voice. Though it touches on drug abuse, coming out of the closet and prison sentences, ""Who Asked You?"" still features the typical McMillan humor and smart dialogue, connecting the themes through family and friendship. And while she insists her personal life has been an inspiration for her fiction, it is not the template. ""A lot of the characters I write about aren't like me, with the exception there might be snippets or little particles of their personality that I might identify with,"" she said. ""The fact that they think this might be real -- that means I did my job."" McMillan spoke to CNN about learning to trust her instincts, what she learned from a highly publicized divorce and where her life ends and art begins. An edited transcript of the conversation follows: . CNN: What inspired you to write ""Who Asked You?"" Terry McMillan: What inspired me to write this book was my ongoing or longstanding concern and curiosity about grandparents, and grandmothers in particular, who raise their grandchildren. I knew it would be a hardship story, and I didn't want it just to be that, based on the grandmother. So I also figured that there was another element that would probably lend itself to the story, one I was familiar with, and that is when you open your mouth to offer unsolicited advice, and people either resent it or don't use it or don't take it. And, when people do this, not just me, but when people offer advice, they don't look at their own behavior. CNN: You have spoken about drawing from real-life observations and experiences for previous novels. How do you balance that public persona that people really relate to, with the fictional stories that some might assume to be the story of your life? McMillan: Well, I'll put it this way, I separate my personal life from what I write about regardless. This book is not necessarily a reflection of my own personal experiences. But there are certain things that are universal: disappointment, love, forgiveness, just a sense of responsibility, danger, etc. You just personalize that, you bring it down to ground level. CNN: One of the stories you drew from personal experience was ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back,"" about an older woman who falls in love with a much younger man while on vacation. Your subsequent divorce from Jonathan, your ex-husband who inspired the book, became a topic of discussion. What was the lesson you took away from that public divorce? McMillan: You have to go through what you go through, regardless of what other people say. And you shouldn't have to apologize for grieving. I was grieving, and I was angry -- two bad combinations. And so I had to go through it. It took awhile for me to realize that, to this day, I still love the Jonathan that I loved, that I was with eight of those 10 years. And I stopped holding myself emotionally hostage, and I stopped holding him responsible for it. I think that's the lesson. But there's no time limit on grief or anger until you start realizing it's like a termite and it's eating you up. That's when you need to pay attention. And I realized also that I had given this man too much power over my life. And not only was he not worth it, but I was worth more. CNN: Part of your appeal is having been such an authentic voice and being honest in sharing your personal life. Do you ever regret sharing some parts because of reactions or reviews like The New York Times that comment on your life as well as your books? McMillan: No. The bottom line is this -- this book had nothing to do with my personal life. It wasn't even a reflection of it. The review was a short review, anyway; it was only two paragraphs. The entire first paragraph, she spent reviewing me. Which I thought was grossly unprofessional as well as just tacky. And plus it was tinged with anger. It was anger in that first paragraph. I mean, I can handle a bad review, especially if there's something I can get out of it. I've been out here too long. A lot of people make their own deductions about what's real and what's not real. Personally I don't really care, but when I go around and I do book tours, I often have cleared things up. And sometimes it shows up in print, and now with social media. There are people that know what I stand for and who I am. CNN: What do you want people to know about you that they may not already know about you? McMillan: That I'm a die-hard romantic. They might know that. You get energized by (love). I don't care what kind of love it is -- it could be a baby, a puppy. Romantic love probably tops all of them. Maybe -- I haven't had a grandchild yet.","Best-selling author Terry McMillan's new book is ""Who Asked You?""

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Billy Graham was admitted to a hospital overnight for treatment of a pulmonary infection believed to be bronchitis, a North Carolina hospital and his evangelistic association said. ""Upon admission, he was alert and in good spirits,"" said the statement, which was released both by Mission Hospital in Asheville and the The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The 93-year-old also was hospitalized for pneumonia last November, six months after similarly being admitted to a hospital for the same condition. Since then, he has remained ""in good overall health ... though he continues to remain at home due to age-related conditions,"" according to the hospital and the association. The influential preacher went to the hospital for treatment for bronchitis and after developing a ""slight fever overnight,"" his spokesman A. Larry Ross said via Twitter. He is being treated with oral antibiotics and improving, at one point Sunday even sitting up in bed to remotely watch his grandson Will Graham give a guest sermon at First Baptist Church in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Ross later said. Graham, who Ross said had no fever by Sunday morning, ate lunch with daughter Gigi and one of his grandchildren at the hospital, where he had been chatting up the staff, said Ross. ""Doctors are encouraged by his progress, and he's been alert all day ... taking meals (and) sitting up in bed,"" Ross said Sunday night. On Sunday, Graham was ""resting comfortably"" and in stable condition, Mission Hospital and the association said in their statement, citing pulmonologist David Pucci at the hospital. Physicians expect Graham to remain in the western North Carolina medical facility for ""a couple of days,"" according to Ross, who earlier noted that ""no date has been set for discharge."" ""He's made farther progress than for previous hospitalizations (for pulmonary infections),"" Ross said, adding that Graham is ""in good hands"" and ""feels comfortable"" at Mission Hospital, where he has previously been treated. Graham, a resident of Montreat, about 18 miles east of Asheville, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents beginning with Harry S. Truman and is the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The Charlotte native has preached to untold millions over six decades, beginning his missionary work in 1944 when he started speaking at rallies for the Youth for Christ Campus Life ministry. Five years later, Graham was holding crusades in tents in downtown Los Angeles. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the crusades drew so many followers they were extended to seven. His ""last crusade"" in June 2005 drew 230,000 people. Even with his advanced age and health issues, Graham remains ""actively involved in ministry and writing projects,"" his evangelistic association and the hospital said. That includes writing a new book, which is almost done, ""summarizing his Gospel message over the past seven decades of public ministry."" He also has weighed in on hot-button issues of late, including supporting North Carolina's constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, which voters passed earlier this year, and last month defending the president of the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain for his opposition to same-sex marriage. Also in July, in a letter released by his organization, Graham leveled deep criticism at the United States. He compared the country to Sodom and Gomorrah, the biblical cities synonymous with sin. ""Self-centered indulgence, pride and a lack of shame over sin are now emblems of the American lifestyle,"" Graham wrote. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Graham should be in the hospital for ""a couple of days,"" his spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Most fans picturing rapper 50 Cent operating a joystick would probably envision the hip-hop star blasting away opponents in his latest video game release, ""Blood on the Sand."" Rapper 50 Cent performs at the Spike TV Video Game Awards in December. Those same fans might be surprised to learn the hardcore rapper also has a soft spot for old-school throwbacks like ""Tetris,"" ""Pac-Man"" and the venerable ""Super Mario Brothers."" 50 Cent plays ""Super Mario Brothers""? Really? ""Yeah,"" said the rapper, as well known for surviving nine bullet wounds as he is for his platinum-selling albums. ""When I went to perform at the Spike TV Video Game Awards, I got a chance to see how they had the older games now on Wii. So I went and got the Wii system so I can play 'Mario Brothers.' "" Leaping, overall-wearing characters aside, 50 Cent knows what gamers like -- and that came in handy during the development of ""Blood on the Sand."" The new THQ-released game, available for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, features 50 Cent in his trademark bulletproof vest doing battle in the Middle East after he and some members of his group, the G-Unit, are cheated out of their concert fee. The action ramps up after the concert promoter, unable to pay, presents the group with a diamond-encrusted skull that is later stolen. Plenty of bullets fly and the body count mounts as ""Blood on the Sand"" lives up to its name. All that violence isn't surprising given the hardcore nature of 50 Cent's music, for which he has often been criticized. So why endorse and lend his image to a violent video game, he's asked, given the heat he's already taken for similar themes in his music? ""The violence in the music is the harsh reality,"" he responds. ""I guess they ignore the newspaper for the people who say that that's violent. I guess they would like to avoid it or don't want it to have such a strong voice with the position I have earned in pop culture and entertainment."" In reviewing ""Blood on the Sand"" for GamePro.com, writer Will Herring points out that while violent, the game is also campy fun. ""Now, if there was any inkling that I was supposed to take 'Blood on the Sand' the least bit seriously, I might venture to call the game a bit shallow,"" Herring writes. ""But with the wanton firefights and explosive Michael Bay-esque action all remaining firmly tongue in cheek, you can't help but laugh and enjoy the ridiculous ride."" 50 Cent says he was involved in the development of ""Blood on the Sand,"" but let the experts do the heavy lifting. ""I was smart enough to allow the computer programmers to design the actual game without injecting so much input that I lost what would be the highest technology for the game,"" he said. ""I made a few slight changes based on the things that influenced me."" Some of those suggestions, he said, grew out of his experience performing for the troops in Iraq as well as his viewing of the film ""Blood Diamond,"" which starred Leonardo DiCaprio. Video games are just a small portion of the rapper's ever-growing empire. He's dabbled in all types of media, including books, movies and the Web, and has benefited from high-profile partnerships with companies like Glaceau, the makers of Vitaminwater. He said he's finding inspiration for new projects close to home: he's optioned the rights to turn the THQ video game ""Saints Row"" into a movie. ""Blood on the Sand"" isn't 50 Cent's first foray into the world of gaming. A previous 50 Cent game, ""Bulletproof,"" came out in 2005. The rapper has tied music and video games together by including some game-only tracks with ""Blood on the Sand."" He's determined to keep mixing things up. His last album, 2007's ""Curtis,"" featured collaborations with an array of other artists including Justin Timberlake, Robin Thicke, Mary J. Blige and Akon. Though much was made at the time of a sales battle between 50 Cent and Kanye West -- whose ""Graduation"" was originally scheduled to be released on the same day and sold more copies than ""Curtis"" -- 50 now says that he was happy with the performance of the album, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Still, he adds, he's not convinced the audience totally grasped what he was attempting to do. ""The 'Curtis' album was an artist album for me,"" he says. ""It was me reaching out to the other artists to creatively offer a different perspective. We had to find a common ground in order to do that effectively."" He said there are sometimes tracks that don't fit in with the vision of an album. That material is what he tapped into for some of the unreleased tracks on the new video game. In the future, he says he would like to be involved in the development and marketing of a game in which he doesn't star. But his love of video games stretches back to his childhood. Having lots of time on the road has enabled him to reconnect with the fun, he said. ""Since I have been touring, video gaming has become more of an entertainment for me,"" 50 Cent said, adding that he has both the PS3 and the Xbox360 with him on tour, one for each end of the bus. ""Blood on the Sand"" is rated ""M"" for mature for the violence and language, but at least one young person has already mastered it -- 50 Cent's son, Marquise. ""He came in and already knows how to beat me in this game,"" 50 Cent said. ""He just came in like he was a pro, whupping me in my game.""","Hip-hop artist 50 Cent lends his image and ideas to new video game .

"(CNN) -- Obamacare is dying. The latest wound is largely self-inflicted. Medicaid and the new Obamacare exchanges are competing for the same young and healthy customers that Obamacare needs to survive -- and Medicaid's winning. President Obama and the entire Democratic Party have nobody else but themselves to blame. In its hubris, the Democratic Party members assured the country again and again in 2009 and 2010 that it knew enough to be able to forcibly reorganize one-sixth of the American economy without causing millions to lose their current health insurance coverage, without triggering skyrocketing costs and without causing a host of terrible unintended consequences. The problem is that it is impossible. The information that would be required to competently manage America's health care economy is too vast, complex and dispersed throughout the economy and among millions of people. It is impossible for anyone to know or control. And repeated assurances by Obama and virtually every Democrat that it was possible are the greatest lie perpetrated by the supporters of Obamacare. Consider the latest illustration of this destructive hubris of the Democratic Party. To make Obamacare work, the White House needs to attract 2.7 million Americans under the age of 35, out of 7 million uninsured, into the new Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges next year -- the young invincibles most averse to buying insurance in the first place. If the young don't sign up in big numbers, the cost of insurance premiums and government subsidies balloons to pay the expense of taking care of older, sicker enrollees. An actuarial death spiral begins, with increasing costs leading to fewer and fewer young people signing up and making the problem worse and worse until the insurance companies can no longer afford to manage the program and exit the market. But what the architects of Obamacare apparently failed to take into account is that many young people are also eligible for Medicaid and will enroll in that government program instead, in the 25 states that have agreed to expand Medicaid. According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than half of the total uninsured population qualified for Medicaid since they earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level in the states that have expanded Medicaid. Since income grows with education and experience, the younger these uninsured are, the more likely they are to qualify for Medicaid because they are also poorer. And since Medicaid is free for these young people, that means no premiums are going to the insurance companies to subsidize the older enrollees. The other challenge in signing up young people is that the Obamacare law also made it possible for young people to stay on their parents' plan until the age of 26, further reducing the pool of the eligible young who can subsidize the old and sick. Only 21% of the uninsured population are in the target age bracket of 26 to 34. This has set up an enrollment battle between Medicaid and the new insurance exchanges for this same pool of customers. Early evidence from Connecticut, Maryland, Washington and Kentucky suggests that the young who do sign up are enrolling overwhelmingly in Medicaid. According to an article in the Connecticut Mirror, figures released in October showed that most of the young enrollees were signing up for Medicaid. Data from Kentucky tell the story; 47,966 residents enrolled via the exchanges, but only 8,780 signed up for insurance. The remaining 82% went to Medicaid. Worse still, only 19% of the Kentuckians who bought insurance were between 18 and 34 years of age. In the Bluegrass State, eight times as many of the young cohort enrolled in Medicaid as insurance plans. If these trends hold up, Obamacare's exchanges will implode financially. Instead, we need a ""breakout."" Technology and the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans have the capability to deliver better health care at lower cost for all Americans. We need to replace Obamacare with reforms designed to allow us to live longer, happier and healthier lives far into the future. It all starts with an honest recognition that a one-size-fits-all model of health care cannot work in a country as large and diverse as ours. We need reforms tailored for individuals who can choose what is best for them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: Medicaid and Obamacare exchanges compete for the young .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania minister was suspended for 30 days on Tuesday after he was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, according to church officials. Frank Schaefer, 51, the pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, was found guilty by a jury of 13 ordained clergy members on two counts: officiating a same-sex wedding and being disobedient to the discipline and order of the church, according to Cathy Husid-Shamir, a Schaefer family spokesperson. Schaefer received a concurrent 30-day suspension for both counts. If he does not uphold the church's discipline after the suspension, he must surrender his credentials, according to Husid-Shamir. The jury had full power in determining Schaefer's penalty, which could have ranged from a reprimand to a full defrocking. ""I'm obviously relieved to receive a lighter penalty than defrocking,"" Schaefer said in a statement to CNN after receiving his sentence. ""I gave the jury every excuse to take my credentials when I was honest with them and said that I must continue to serve all people -- no exceptions."" Schaefer previously told CNN's Zoraida Sambolin that his son, Tim, asked him to officiate his wedding seven years ago, and he decided to do it ""out of love for him."" Despite at one point believing that homosexuality was incompatible with his Christian beliefs, Schaefer told CNN his views on the controversial topic began to change over time. ""By the time our son came out, I was ready to embrace him,"" Schaefer told Sambolin on November 14. The complaint was filed by one of Schaefer's church members, and the church leadership decided to act upon it, according to Schaefer. The church told Schaefer he could avoid a trial if he agreed never to perform another same-sex marriage again, but he refused. ""I can't commit to a statement like that, especially in light of the fact that I have two more children that are gay."" ""We want to express care and concern for everyone involved in this difficult process,"" Michele Bartlow, district superintendent of the United Methodist Church, said in a statement after the guilty verdict. ""We ask for prayer."" ""Today, grace and love won over a controversial church law,"" Schaefer told CNN.","Frank Schaefer found guilty by jury of ordained clergy on two counts .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama complained Tuesday that he doesn't get out much. Then he noted he doesn't have to when B.B. King and Mick Jagger come to play a concert at his house. The blues and rock legends were at the White House for a PBS performance series in the East Room honoring the history of blues music. A lineup of top blues performers past and present offered a selection of standards that displayed all the raw elements of a distinctly American musical genre originating from the days of slavery. Obama even got in the act. When goaded by blues giant Buddy Guy, he sang a verse of the rollicking finale ""Sweet Home Chicago."" Earlier, Obama described the genre as a form of oral history that bore witness to the struggles of African-Americans. ""The blues reminds us that we've been through tougher times before,"" Obama said. ""That's why I'm proud to have these artists here not just as a fan but also as the president because their music teaches us that when we find ourselves at a crossroads, we don't shy away from our problems. We own them. We face up to them. We deal with them. We sing about them. We turn them into art. And even as we face the challenges of today we imagine a brighter tomorrow."" Blues music, Obama said, ""speaks to something universal,"" because ""no one goes through life without joy and pain, triumph and sorrow,"" and the blues encompasses all of that ""sometimes with just one lyric or just one note."" ""In Performance at The White House: Red, White and Blues,"" scheduled in February as part of Black History Month, featured longtime blues greats King and Guy playing with contemporary musicians Shemekia Copeland, Trombone Shorty, Keb' Mo' and Gary Clark Jr. The evening also recognized the British blues invasion of the 1960s with performances by rock pioneers Jagger and Jeff Beck. Renowned rockers Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks of the Allman Brothers Band also took part, along with Susan Tedeschi, a blues guitarist and singer who is married to Trucks and forms a Grammy-winning band with him. Most of the assembled performers took the stage for an opening rendition of ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" after which the 86-year-old King -- playing ringmaster from his seat at center stage -- offered his encouragement for the president's re-election bid. ""Mr. President, I've been praying for you for three years, and I want you to keep your job,"" King said to applause. Republican candidates blast Obama . The event was emceed for PBS by actress and singer Taraji Henson, who commented on the somewhat surreal juxtaposition of the evening's lineup and setting. ""I never dreamt in a million years that I would ever say these next five words, and certainly never thought that I'd be saying them right here at the White House, but, ladies and gentlemen, Mick Jagger,"" Henson said in introducing the original Rolling Stone. In appropriate rock star fashion, Jagger ran onstage to dance and sing ""I Can't Turn You Loose"" backed by the ""house"" band led by Booker T. Jones. Before his second number -- a cover of the Howlin' Wolf song ""Commit a Crime"" performed with fellow Brit Beck -- Jagger talked about his introduction to the blues as a young man in England with the music of Sonny Boy Williamson. Recounting how Williamson visited London and even dressed the part in bowler hat with umbrella in hand, Jagger added: ""He said those English boys, they want to play the blues real bad, and they do -- real bad."" Copeland and Tedeschi then joined Jagger to provide background vocals on his Rolling Stones hit ""Miss You."" In a tribute to the roots of the blues, Copeland and Clark performed a moving version of ""Beat Up Guitar,"" and Clark followed with ""Catfish Blues"" and Mo' did a solo version of ""Henry."" Tedeschi, Trucks and Haynes played a tribute to Etta James with a powerful rendition of her classic ""I'd Rather Go Blind,"" and Jagger returned to join Guy, Beck and Clark for blues standard ""Five Long Years,"" originally written and recorded by Eddie Boyd. The finale brought the entire ensemble on stage one more time to serenade the president and first lady with the tribute to their hometown, with Obama welcoming them as the ""White House Blues All Stars."" The roughly 200 guests, including Cabinet members Kathleen Sebelius, John Bryson and Jacob Lew, stood and clapped at Obama's prompting, then shrieked when the president took the microphone after Guy called him out about his recent impersonation of singer Al Green. ""I heard you singing Al Green,"" Guy said, waving for Obama to indulge him. ""You started something. You got to keep it up."" Obama did, a bit hesitant at first and then gaining gusto, offering the microphone to King at one point to help him finish the verse. While Obama's voice may have lacked the power of the other performers, it was a presidential musical performance unseen since Bill Clinton on the saxophone.","White House tribute ends with Obama singing along to ""Sweet Home Chicago""

"(CNN) -- Pure products of Hollywood, ""The Hunger Games"" and ""John Carter"" were conceived, designed, stretched and pre-tested with one purpose: to lighten billfolds while satisfying mass appetites. These two movies seemed especially intent on seizing the wavering attention spans of young people with premises deeply rooted in science-fiction -- or, as some genre lovers might prefer to call it, speculative phantasmagoria. Same goals, different results. Drastically. Different. Results. Hunger Games, in case you hadn't heard by now, has exceeded advance expectations by reaping $155 million in its first three days of nationwide release. That's the third-highest opening tally in box-office history, just beneath the $158.4 million drawn from 2008's Batman sequel, ""The Dark Knight,"" and not too far removed from the $169.2 million made last summer by ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II."" Those latter two features were sequels, while ""Hunger Games"" is just the first installment of what will almost certainly be a trilogy of films made from Suzanne Collins' phenomenally popular trilogy of books. The stories are set in a dystopian future in which a totalitarian society forces teenagers to engage in globally televised ritual murder. This means that ""Hunger Games"" made the biggest, fattest opening-weekend nut of any movie that wasn't a sequel or spin-off. Meanwhile, after two weeks in the Great American Multiplex, ""John Carter"" continues to tumble in what many believe is a downward spiral of similarly unprecedented dimension. Disney's lavish, $250 million adaptation of the swords-on-Mars fantasy novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs brought in $5 million, increasing its overall box office to $62.3 million -- roughly half of which was made in its own opening weekend. Those using the word ""epic"" to classify ""John Carter"" now use it to describe its estimated $200 million shortfall. ""John Carter,"" for whatever it's worth, isn't quite as dismal a movie as it is a moneymaker. Thirty, even 20 years ago, it might have been exotic enough to be taken for pop-cultural innovation. Now it comes across as a lumbering, good-natured oaf who happened to stumble into the marketplace at the wrong time. On the other hand, ""The Hunger Games,"" with its reality-TV-on-toxic-drugs premise, is so very much ""of its time"" that it's tempting to think much of its imagined future has already arrived. (Do you feel a draft? I do.) Meanwhile, those who approach ""John Carter"" with foreknowledge of its box-office crash-and-burn might be surprised to see how charming it can be at times, especially when its eponymous Civil War veteran-turned-rhino-riding superhero (Taylor Kitsch) is adjusting his previously Earth-bound muscles to Martian gravity. In its heedlessly bombastic manner, the movie is faithful to its origins as a rip-snorting romantic fantasy much like Burroughs' far more famous stories featuring Tarzan. If the producers were more willing to let Andrew Stanton direct the movie as the garish, live-action comic strip it was meant to be, it might have connected, though not necessarily for a home run. But even the decision to call the movie ""John Carter,"" instead of ""John Carter of Mars"" or even ""A Princess of Mars,"" the actual title of Burroughs' first installment of the Carter opus, is emblematic of an over-cautiousness that dampens every sequence and set-piece. The whole movie feels worked-over, second-guessed, whipped to a thickness that hobbles the movie's momentum. It's as if ""John Carter"" wants you to see every single one of those aforementioned millions of dollars up on the screen. And who besides an accountant would care? The budget of ""Hunger Games"" is an estimated -- and, as with the movie itself, relatively modest -- $100 million. There are flashy things to see in Gary Ross' movie, from the chompers on Stanley Tucci's unctuous host to the pyrotechnic dress worn by the story's otherwise ice-cool heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). But the movie's adapters, including Suzanne Collins herself, know that the basic story elements have already worked their mojo on their target audience; even those who haven't read the books likely were drawn by curiosity. Whatever special effects were marshaled on the movie's behalf didn't seem as important as how Kat would wriggle or shoot her way out of trouble. Those wishing ""Hunger Games"" had more tragic dimension or made its audience more explicitly feel the sting of its carnage have a point. But the movie wasn't made for them. It was made for the millions of young readers who, for whatever reason, share Kat's smoldering resentment of the status quo. I'd like to think that as these young adults of all ages buy their tickets to this speculative phantasmagoria, they retain some suspicion, however vague, that the hype masters who made them flock to the multiplexes on cue over the weekend exert a not-altogether-benign influence over their lives. If that's so, and I'm not really all that hopeful, it may become harder over time to hurl big, bloated carnivals at them to lighten their wallets. Even if they're good-natured, slovenly lugs like ""John Carter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: ""Hunger Games,"" ""John Carter"" exist to make money, appeal to masses .

"(CNN) -- CNN Hero Wilma Melville is helping rescued dogs find new life as rescuers themselves. She and her nonprofit, the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, partner shelter dogs with firefighters and train them to save lives after a disaster. Since 1996, the group has trained 131 search-and-rescue teams around the country -- for free -- and responded to 80 disasters across the world, including the September 11 attacks and the Japanese earthquake earlier this year. CNN's Lan Trinh recently spoke with Melville about the group's efforts. Lan Trinh: What characteristics make a good search dog? Wilma Melville: We look for a dog with high energy, an ability to focus. The dog has to have what we call drive. He wants a job. ... In addition to that, he has to like other dogs (and) be affectionate with humans. He has to not care about peculiar footing under his feet, slippery stuff, moving stuff. ... He has to not be noise-sensitive. And if he is startled, he doesn't run away or freak out. Trinh: In 1995, it could take three or four years to train a search dog and his handler. Your group has shrunk that training time to about a year. What are you doing differently? Melville: (People) were raising puppies with the hope that the puppy would have all the characteristics needed to become a search dog. ... I thought, ""Where can I get a dog that's about a year old with the characteristics needed in a disaster search dog? Where can I get a dog like that?"" And I thought, ""Maybe in a shelter. Maybe the Humane Society."" ... A little math will show you that if a dog can work until he's about 10 years of age, and he's 2 or 3 when he begins his job, he has maybe six or seven years of working life. At the rate that we were producing teams in 1995, they would be retiring at the same rate we were producing them. Trinh: Most of your search dogs come from shelters. What happens to dogs that get selected but don't have what it takes to make it through the entire training program? Melville: If we do take a dog into our program, we say to him: ""You have lifetime care, buddy. You've tried hard, but if one or two characteristics are missing and you can't make it through the six- to eight-month training, we'll provide lifetime care."" This means a loving home, a good home, and staying with that home and with that dog for the lifetime of the dog. Trinh: What personal satisfaction do you get from doing this work? Melville: The personal satisfaction is making a huge difference in the way dogs are trained for canine disaster search plus the quality of teams that are produced. One can accept mediocrity in a restaurant or in a retail store, but one cannot accept mediocrity in those dogs and handlers that are searching for people that are possibly alive. The window of time to locate that person alive is very small. The relief that onlookers have when a dog is searching is immense. Trinh: Do you think you have a sixth sense for dogs? Melville: (laughs) Certainly, I've been with dogs all my life. I don't remember a time that I didn't have a dog. But much of what I know has been learned and with the right attitude. ... I think the dog tries much harder to understand us than we do him. We're a little behind in that area.

"(CNN) -- A state legislator apparently misses Colonel Reb so much, he's pushing a bill to bring the former University of Mississippi mascot back. He also wants the college band to play ""Dixie"" at games -- even on the road. ""The University of Mississippi shall bear the nickname 'Ole Miss Rebels' and its mascot shall be 'Colonel Rebel,'"" states House Bill 1106. ""The University of Mississippi's marching band ... shall play the song 'Dixie' before, during and after home and away football games and basketball games at which the band, or a portion of the band, is present,"" the legislation states. Under the bill, which is authored by Democratic state Rep. Mark DuVall of Mantachie, the band would be required to play ""From Dixie with Love"" only once -- during halftime. DuVall could not be reached for comment Friday. The university, which in recent years has sought to dim the Old South imagery associated with the institution, retired the white-haired and moustachioed mascot in 2003. Ole Miss, a Southeastern Conference member, went without a mascot until October 2010, when students adopted Rebel Black Bear in a campuswide vote. Since then, however, a vocal minority of students and university boosters have pleaded for the return of the colonel.","Lawmaker wants Colonel Reb restored as Old Miss mascot, ""Dixie"" played at games .

"Vitoria, Brazil (CNN) -- Jaina Maria never enters the studio in the pretty second-floor apartment she used to share with her husband. Behind the door, which she now keeps locked, is the room where she says her husband beat her, time and time again. It still bears the scars of violence. ""He grabbed me by the hair and slammed me into the mirror,"" she says. A big chunk of glass is missing. Jaina Maria says they were married for six years before the violence started, but then it dragged on for four more years. At first she was silent. ""He was the love of my life. I loved him so much,"" she explains as her eyes fill with tears. ""But then you get beaten again and again."" Jaina Maria is one of nearly 40 women in the coastal Brazilian city of Vitoria who have been given an innovative mobile ""panic button"" -- part of a pilot project to curb rampant domestic violence. Even after they divorced and Jaina Maria obtained a restraining order, she says her ex-husband would still show up at the house and threaten her. One day he pulled out a knife. After that incident, a court decided to issue her with the panic button. When activated the device emits a GPS signal and automatically starts recording the conversations around the victim -- which can later be used in court. Soon after she got it, Jaina Maria was forced to use it. One day her ex-husband appeared, shouting at her, from the street below her apartment. ""The police arrived in four minutes,"" she says. Restraining order . Her ex-husband was sentenced to 21 days in jail for violating the restraining order. He hasn't been back since. The authorities say there have already been five convictions thanks to the panic button project, which was launched by the state judicial system earlier this year. It's no accident the project was developed in Vitoria -- the city has the highest female murder rate in Brazil. ""Femicides"" are overwhelmingly committed inside a woman's own home, and police and social services say, they are an indicator of wider levels of domestic abuse. According to the Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies, in 2010 13.2 in every 100,000 women were murdered in Vitoria, triple the national average of 4.4, which is already high. The Center's figure for the United States is 2.1 women in every 100,000, as of 2007. The panic buttons have been distributed to women who already have restraining orders against abusers -- mostly former partners. According to court officials, the project has also worked as a deterrent for would-be abusers because no one knows who actually has them. The device itself is smaller than a mobile phone. Women carry it on an elastic belt under their clothes. When the victim activates it, by holding down a small button for three seconds, a GPS signal is sent and an alarm goes off at the police station handling the panic button project. The alert is then sent to the smartphones of four teams trained to respond. The victim's location appears on a map, as pictures of the victim and her abuser pop up and the device begins to transit audio so police can hear what's going on around her. Constant fear . So far, officials say, they've arrived in under 10 minutes every time. ""We want to get there as quickly as we can because this person is the target of serious violence,"" says officer Jadir Almeida da Silva. The project has already caught the attention of officials across Brazil and in neighboring Latin American countries also battling high levels of domestic abuse. The United Nations has also praised the project and invited Vitoria's mayor to give a presentation in New York. Experts say the panic button works on many levels. Dr. Sonia Lyra is a gynecologist who specializes in female trauma at the Jayme Santos Neves hospital. She was also a victim of domestic abuse, brutally beaten, she says, by her ex-husband for nine years. ""There were times when I would stay in bed for 10, 15 days,"" she says. ""I had to reschedule all my patients until the marks on my body disappeared."" She says the panic button not only helps stop violence before it happens, but it also gives women the security they need to rebuild their lives. Lyra says her divorce dragged on for years and she wasn't able to keep her ex-husband away until she saved enough money to hire a criminal lawyer. ""If I'd had the panic button, I would have re-established myself faster without the constant fear that he could hurt me or my children,"" she says. For Jaina Maria, it has meant she now has the confidence to leave her home: She now takes her dog for walks and is even starting a new job.","Brazilian victims of domestic violence given mobile 'panic button' in pilot project .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama begins a nine-day trip through the Asia-Pacific region Saturday with a stop in Hawaii for a weekend economic conference where he will press for progress on a trans-Pacific free trade agreement. The administration is taking care to highlight the importance of strong Asia-Pacific relations to the president's efforts to create jobs domestically. ""The U.S. exports to this region are essential to the president's goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next several years,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters in a briefing Wednesday. ""In fact, nearly all of the efforts that we're going to be making towards that export goal take place in this part of the world."" The 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum account for 55% of the world's gross domestic product, 43% of world trade and 58% of U.S. exports, according to the group. ""So I think when the American people see the president traveling in the Asia-Pacific, they will see him advocating for U.S. jobs and U.S. businesses,"" Rhodes said. ""He will be trying to open new markets, and he will be trying to achieve new export initiatives, and he will be trying to foster a trade agreement through the, for instance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that takes us beyond the Korea Free Trade Agreement towards a multilateral agreement that, again, has very high standards to ensure that our interests are being protected."" The Obama administration is pushing for the expanded trade agreement to help boost reduce barriers to U.S. exports, boost trade and create jobs. The United States has been negotiating with Singapore, Chile, New Zealand, Brunei, Australia, Peru and Vietnam develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk's office says would eventually expand to include most of the APEC's 21 nations. No final decisions are expected on the agreement this weekend. Rhodes said he expects the leaders to discuss progress negotiated at the ministerial level and begin looking toward the next phase of discussions. But he declined to put a timetable on the negotiations. During the APEC conference in Honolulu, Obama is also scheduled to have a discussion with business leaders, as well as side meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, and Chinese President Hu Jintao. After a break Monday for a political fundraiser, Obama is scheduled to depart Tuesday for Australia and later Bali, Indonesia, where he will stress the U.S. role in the Asia-Pacific region and seek to reassure U.S. allies of the nation's continued commitment to the region, Rhodes said. He is scheduled to leave Bali on November 19.","Obama departs for Hawaii and a weekend Asian-Pacific economic conference .

"New York (CNN) -- Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress was released from a New York prison Monday after serving 20 months on a weapons charge stemming from a shooting incident at a nightclub. The former New York Giants player accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol he was carrying in his waistband. The incident occurred in November 2008, in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan. Burress was not licensed to carry a pistol in either New York or New Jersey, where he lived. In August 2009, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and agreed to serve two years under a plea agreement. He spent the last 20 months at the Oneida Correctional Facility in Rome, New York. Burress became a hero to New York Giants fans in the 2008 Super Bowl when he caught the game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning with 35 seconds remaining in the game. The following season, Burress' career with the Giants was marred by a series of incidents. He was suspended by the team in early October for missing a practice. Later that month, he was fined $45,000 by the NFL after arguing with a referee and throwing a football into the stands. After the nightclub incident, Burress was suspended from the Giants. The team later released him.","NEW: Burress was released Monday morning .

"Washington (CNN) -- As petroleum giant BP comes under congressional scrutiny as its ruptured oil rig pumps thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, its political contributions are being scrutinized, too. The top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 presidential election was Barack Obama, who collected $71,000, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. When questioned about the donations Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs made a point of noting that the money came from employees and not the company itself. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt added that Obama wasn't tied to big oil companies. ""This claim lacks one thing: credibility,"" LaBolt said in a statement. ""President Obama didn't accept a dime from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists during his presidential campaign. He raised $750 million from nearly 4 million Americans. And since he became President, he rolled back tax breaks and giveaways for the oil and gas industry, spearheaded a G20 agreement to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and made the largest investment in American history in clean energy incentives."" BP employees gave more than $3 million in campaign contributions during the past decade and almost $110,000 in 2010. Fifty-seven percent of BP's contributions went to Republicans, while 43 percent went to Democrats. BP America President Lamar McKay has been asked to appear next week to discuss the oil spill before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose members received the largest share of BP's campaign contributions over the last two election cycles, the Center for Responsive Politics notes. ""In 2009, individuals and political action committees associated with BP donated $16,000 to members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,"" the center found. The center says five of the top 10 recipients of BP dollars in the House sit on that committee: John Dingell, D-Michigan; Joe Barton, R-Texas; Ralph Hall, R-Texas; Roy Blunt, R-Missouri; and Fred Upton, R-Michigan. ""All have received upward of $13,000 from BP-related individuals and political action committees during the past two decades,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Dingell, the second most favored recipient of BP money in the House, has received $31,000."" Congress is demanding answers in its investigation of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the BP executives likely to be grilled in the weeks ahead are no strangers to the ways of Washington. ""If BP faces heavy federal scrutiny, it's well-positioned to fight back: The London-based company has consistently spent top dollar to influence legislative and regulatory activity in Washington, D.C.,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The company spent almost $16 million lobbying Congress in 2009 and more than $3.5 million this year, the center found. BP's ruptured undersea well off Louisiana continues to spew about 210,000 gallons -- or 5,000 barrels -- of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico. Efforts to corral the rapidly growing spill have been unsuccessful. There is a sheen of oil up to 60 miles across in the Gulf, threatening the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as well as the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The overall area affected by the spill, CNN estimates, is almost as large as the state of Delaware. CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Hornick, Shawna Shepherd and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Obama received $71,000 in 2008 election cycle, nonprofit says .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police probing a deadly blast outside the Delhi High Court on Wednesday have released two sketches based on descriptions of suspects from eyewitnesses and they are focused on leads that an Islamic extremist group carried out the attack. At least 11 people were killed Wednesday after a bomb inside a briefcase went off outside the Delhi High Court, India's home minister told lawmakers. The home minister's website said another 76 people were injured and officials fear the death toll will rise. It was the second explosion outside the court complex in four months. ""This is a cowardly act and we will never succumb to the pressure of terrorists,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said during a visit to Bangladesh. Several TV news channels received an e-mail from an Islamic extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihar-al-Islami taking responsibility for the attack. Government officials said its too early to jump to conclusions but National Investigation Agency officials told local media the group is known to be ""lethal"" and they are taking the e-mail ""very seriously."" The blast took place about 10:15 a.m., after the court opened and shortly before cases usually begin. It was a particularly busy day at the court. Wednesdays are dubbed ""public interest litigation"" days, when many members of the public arrive to put cases before judges. The briefcase was placed in front of Gate No. 5, used by litigants and lawyers. ""Whatever we could gather from the blast investigations is that it is an IED (improvised explosive device) with ammonium nitrate. We are working with the Delhi Police to get details,"" National Security Guard Director Gen. Rajen Medhekar told reporters. Pandemonium covered the streets of Delhi as emergency vehicles weaved around crowds, casualties were rushed off on stretchers and stunned residents wandered about with hands over their mouths. The area was cordoned off, and police and bomb-sniffing dogs continued working the scene as rain poured down. The NIA, a security agency set up after the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, was also investigating. On May 25, ammonium nitrate wrapped in a bag and placed in a car exploded outside the court's Gate No. 7. No one was hurt, but the explosion prompted authorities to place Delhi on high alert. ""Delhi is a target of terrorist groups. When parliament is in session, and during certain other times of the year, Delhi is placed on high alert,"" Home Minister P. Chidambaram told lawmakers. Despite ongoing work between intelligence agencies and police, Chidambaram said, ""at this stage, it is not possible to identify the group that caused the bomb blast today.""

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich celebrated the Bundesliga's 50th birthday by setting a new club record in Saturday's Bavarian derby against Nuremberg. The European and German league champions triumphed 2-0 at home for a new milestone of 28 top-flight matches without defeat, giving new coach Pep Guardiola a perfect start of three wins from three. The win left Bayern in third place on goal difference behind Bayer Leverkusen and table-topping Borussia Dortmund. Having hit the post early on through Daniel Ginczek, Nuremberg had seemed set for a third successive draw after frustrating the home team in front of a 71,000 sellout crowd, as Raphael Schafer saved David Alaba's first-half penalty and denied several other Bayern efforts. However, France midfielder Franck Ribery broke the deadlock with a header in the 69th minute after a teasing cross by captain Philipp Lahm to ensure that Bayern scored for a 40th successive match. Arjen Robben, who had been fouled for the penalty, wrapped up the points nine minutes later as he finished a trademark run into the box with a low shot into the corner of the net. Xherdan Shaqiri also hit the Nuremberg woodwork, having come on to replace Ribery. ""It's an important victory,"" said Guardiola, whose team next travels to Freiburg on Tuesday and then goes to Prague for Friday's European Super Cup match against English side Chelsea -- a rematch of the 2012 Champions League final. ""I'm satisfied, especially with the second half and our control of the game. Just like in Frankfurt, we hardly let them hit us on the break, which is something I've talked about a lot with the team. ""Especially when Franck and Arjen have the ball, we can attack at pace. Nuremberg were unbelievably well organized. It's always difficult against this type of team."" The match marked the debut of Bayern's new signing Mario Gotze, who played 68 minutes before being substituted in favor of Toni Kroos. Thomas Muller came on six minutes earlier, replacing Thiago Alcantara -- another newcomer, who made his first start. ""We ran out of gas in the course of the second half,"" said Nuremberg coach Michael Wiesinger, a Champions League winner with Bayern in 2001. ""I was impressed with the way Bayern never became impatient. They imposed their game on us and deserved the win."" Leverkusen claimed second place after beating Borussia Monchengladbach 4-2 at home, with Germany winger Sidney Sam netting twice. Mainz made it four clubs on nine points with a 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg, whose new signing Luis Gustavo was sent off in the 64th minute for a second booking. It was the Brazilian's second game since leaving Bayern. Schalke's poor start continued with a 2-1 defeat at Hannover, leaving coach Jens Keller under pressure ahead of next week's Champions League qualifier against PAOK Salonika. The Royal Blues have just one point from three games. Hoffenheim drew 3-3 with Freiburg, while Hertha Berlin beat Hamburg 1-0 in Saturday's late match. On Friday, last season's runners-up Dortmund won 1-0 at Werder Bremen thanks to a second-half goal from Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. That match took place 49 years and 364 days after the two clubs met in the opening round of the newly-formed Bundesliga competition in 1963. In France, Marseille notched a third successive win to move two points clear at the top of the table. Striker Andre-Pierre Gignac netted a late winner at Valenciennes, while Lyon stayed third after losing 1-0 at home to Reims. Second-placed Monaco drew 0-0 at home to Toulouse on Friday, while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain will seek a first win this season at Nantes on Sunday, following two draws.","Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben score in Bayern's 2-0 win over Nuremberg .

"(CNN) -- As historically high flood waters receded in Tennessee on Wednesday, dramatic stories of tragedy and survival emerged, including that of a woman who saw her husband and daughter swept away. Sherry Qualls watched in horror as chest-deep water washed away her husband and daughter as he tried to save the girl from a rushing creek roaring through their backyard in Linden, Tennessee, on Sunday, according to CNN Nashville affiliate WSMV. ""From his neck up, he was staring at me,"" Qualls said of her husband Bobby. ""He didn't say anything, just staring at me. She was screaming for her daddy to help her, and then by the time the rescue squad got her, I didn't see them any more."" Their bodies were found the next day, washed almost a mile away, the affiliate reported. ""He was a hero,"" Qualls said Wednesday of her husband, who earlier had rescued the couple's son from floodwaters. ""He sacrificed himself for his kids, that's what I think."" Surveying the property where her home once stood, Qualls said it's hard to believe her husband and daughter are gone. ""Every time I drive in the driveway, I see my daughter standing at the door smiling, and him, too, and I expect them to call me and ask where I'm at,"" she said. Linden is located between Nashville and Memphis in western Tennessee. CNN iReporter Nathan Clark went to his father's house in Dickson, Tennessee -- west of Nashville -- on Saturday to help him salvage possessions as waters from a flooded creek rose on his dad's property. Clark says they got out just in time. ""The water was at the top of his truck's hood."" Clark said. ""If we had stayed any longer, we wouldn't have gotten out of there."" With waters receding on Wednesday, Nashville Mayor Karl Dean announced that most city government offices would reopen Thursday and that city bus service would be restored. Nashville students will have another day off Thursday, though teachers and other staff will return to work. ""The news is largely good,"" Dean said at a Wednesday evening press conference. ""We're making progress and we'll continue to make progress in the days ahead."" The weekend deluge in the Mid-South has swelled many rivers to historic levels, turned roads to lakes and caused at least 28 deaths. The rains were especially cruel to Tennessee, killing 19 and immersing landmarks like the Grand Ole Opry. Two Nashville residents are still missing, Dean's office said Wednesday night. President Obama has declared six Tennessee counties major disaster areas, which makes federal funding available to affected residents. Many area waterways remained well past flood level on Wednesday. The Cumberland River, which cuts through Nashville, stood at just over 48 feet on Wednesday evening -- about 13 feet above flood stage -- said Jim Moser, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. On Wednesday afternoon, more more than 100 Nashville firefighters and police officers were going door-to-door on foot in flood-ravaged neighborhoods, checking on residents and providing assistance. Search and rescue teams visited more than 700 homes Wednesday and will visit more Thursday, Dean's office said. One Nashville neighborhood, Metro Center, remained closed to residents and workers Wednesday because of standing water. The city allowed some business owners and managers to survey their businesses for a few hours in the afternoon but limited access to people in trucks and SUVS and made clear that they entered the area at their own risk. With one of Nashville's main water treatment plants still closed from flooding, the city asked residents Wednesday to use water only when absolutely necessary, telling them to put off washing dishes and to limit toilet flushing. ""Citizens are using water at a greater rate than we can treat it and pump it out to the community,"" said Sonia Harvat, a spokesman for Nashville's water department, in an e-mail message. City officials said Wednesday that the city would be forced to rely on bottled water unless more people started conserving. Still, flood waters should recede significantly in the next couple of days, the National Weather Service's Moser said. ""We're not expecting a significant amount of rain through Monday,"" he said. ""It might amount to a quarter or half inch but not enough to affect things."" After an aerial tour of central Tennessee Wednesday, Gov. Phil Bredesen warned residents to beware of con artists looking to capitalize on the flood response. ""There are always people who come in and do these scams of charging people -- and they seem to prey on elderly people an awful lot -- just charging people an awful lot to do something,"" Bredesen said. ""(They say) 'I'm going to fix your house, you have to do it or the state's going to tear it down, and it's like $20,000. Write me a check or give me cash.'

"(CNN) -- The fiercest clashes since anti-government demonstrations began in Taiz four months ago erupted overnight Monday between anti-government gunmen and members of government security forces, witnesses said. They cited heavy gunfire near the Republican Palace, which is less than two miles from the city's Freedom Square, where tens of thousands of anti-government protesters had taken to the streets. The witnesses did not want to be identified, citing fear for their safety. The goal of the anti-government gunmen was to protect the anti-government demonstrators, who have repeatedly come under fire from security forces during the past two months. Last week, Yemen's government faced condemnation from the United Nations and others for the killing of as many as 50 anti-government demonstrators in Taiz. The unrest came shortly after Saudi state-run Ekhbariya television reported Monday that Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh had undergone two operations in Saudi Arabia and would return to Yemen after he recovers. Saleh is in Saudi Arabia for treatment following a rocket attack on his presidential compound on Friday. There were conflicting reports about his health, with Western diplomatic sources saying Sunday that Saleh was undergoing brain surgery, while a spokesman for his party described the procedures as ""simple checkups."" A senior U.S. official said Saleh had suffered shrapnel wounds and severe burns to his face and chest, adding that the severity of the wounds was not clear. The official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. Another U.S. official told CNN Monday afternoon that Saleh had suffered serious injuries. ""It's not an insignificant wound; he is severely hurt,"" the official said. The official did not have an update on Saleh's prognosis, but did say it was ""unclear if and when"" he would be able to return to Yemen. He's ""under a lot of political pressure,"" the official said. The official added that Acting President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi is ""probably not a long-term player, but (is) a caretaker for the regime,"" although he could become a post-Saleh candidate in any future elections. The official pointed out that some tribes have honored Hadi's call for a cease-fire. ""He carries some weight"" in running the government, the official said of Hadi. The official said the Yemeni military was behind the government, but the source would not predict if that would last. The official acknowledged that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, had enjoyed free rein in certain parts of Yemen even before the current unrest. They probably have ""slightly more free rein now,"" the official said. According to the official, AQAP was trying to take advantage of the current situation. The organization has said it opposes the Saleh government and would like to see it collapse. AQAP will try to establish a foothold in other areas of Yemen -- either alone or allied with others, the official said. The group has a significant presence in the southern province of Abyan, also home to an Islamic militant movement that has targeted government troops for the past three days. The militants killed four soldiers and five civilians Monday in the city of Zinjibar, the scene of several recent battles with Yemeni forces, according to a security source in Abyan, who has asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Another 17 people, most of them civilians, were wounded in the clashes, the security official said. And a total of 10 government troops died in Saturday and Sunday ambushes in Abyan, a senior Interior Ministry official told CNN. The U.S. official called AQAP ""a small group,"" although ""a potent force."" ""There are not thousands of them,"" the official said, referring to the situation with AQAP as ""a scale factor."" It's questionable whether they can mount a sizable opposition, but they could influence the political and military situation in Yemen, the official said. The official said the unrest makes it ""more difficult"" for U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. ""We rely on the Yemeni government as partners. The more the government is distracted by the political unrest, the more difficult it is for us."" The Yemeni government has had a ""big impact on acquiring information on AQAP,"" said the official, adding, ""if that information flow slows or stops, it inhibits our ability to gather information."" The official would not comment on whether the instability is an opportunity for the United States to take more aggressive actions in Yemen. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday that one of President Barack Obama's top security advisers, John Brennan, has spoken to the acting president in Yemen. No details of the discussion were provided. Two opposition leaders in Yemen expressed support Monday for Hadi, the vice president who . assumed temporary power when Saleh flew to Saudi Arabia. ""We do not have any problem if Hadi takes control of the government. He is respected by the people,"" said Tawakkul Karman, adding that Hadi ""must use this historic moment to enter Yemen's history as a leader and revolutionary."" But she warned that if he does not ""conduct immediate reforms, the youth protesters will go against him the same way they did against Saleh. It's Hadi's choice to decide which door of history he wants to go through."" Ahmed Bahri, a senior official of the opposition Joint Meeting Parties, said that if Hadi can lead peaceful change, ""we welcome it. If not, he should step aside and not stall the revolution."" ""Hadi has been respected by all the political factions for decades, but Saleh did not give him a chance to lead positive change,"" Bahri said. ""Today is his opportunity to repay the Yemeni people for their patience and work for the sake of the people and not for Saleh."" In other violence Monday, three Hashed tribesmen were killed by Yemeni government snipers despite a cease-fire between the sides, a spokesman for the tribe's leader said. The cease-fire was agreed upon late Sunday between Hashed leader Sadeq Al-Ahmar -- who opposes the Yemeni government -- and Vice President Hadi, said Abdulqawi Al-Qaisi, spokesman for the Hashed leader. He blamed Yemen's Republican Guard for the tribesmen's deaths in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. ""The tribes are insistent that the cease-fire continues, but the Republican Guard wants chaos as usual to show the people that, without Saleh, clashing will take place everywhere,"" Al-Qaisi said. But the government denied being behind the deaths. ""The government does not attack people who are not going against the law,"" government spokesman Abdu Ganadi said. ""These are claims from the tribes in order to cause more crimes in Sanaa."" Supporters of Al-Ahmar are suspected in the Friday attack on the Yemeni presidential compound. Yemen's state-run news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, reported last week that three guards and an imam were killed. Yemeni security forces shelled Al-Ahmar's home on Friday in response to the attack, leaving 10 people dead and 35 others wounded, according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi, an official with the Hashed tribal confederation. The cease-fire deal followed two weeks of clashes between government and tribal forces in Yemen, where thousands of protesters have been pressuring Saleh to give up power since January. The fighting erupted when Saleh balked at a deal with the opposition that would have eased him out of office in 30 days. Yemen's largest opposition bloc had vowed to prevent Saleh from returning. ""The Yemeni people will do all in their power to not allow Saleh to re-enter the country,"" JMP spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said Sunday. CNN's Pam Benson, Tim Lister, Nic Robertson and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Islamic militants kill troops, civilians in southern Yemen .

"(CNN) -- Space, it has been said, is big. Really big. But big enough for two companies that want to mine near-Earth asteroids? A venture announced Tuesday in California hopes so. Deep Space Industries says it wants to start sending miniature scout probes, dubbed ""Fireflies,"" on one-way missions to near-Earth asteroids as soon as 2015. Larger probes, ""Dragonflies,"" that will bring back 50- to 100-pound samples from prospective targets could be on their way by 2016, company CEO David Gump told reporters. The goal is to extract metals, water and compounds that can be used to make spacecraft fuel from the chunks of rock that float within about 50 million kilometers (31 million miles) of Earth. Gump said the ability to produce fuel in space would be a boon for NASA, as the U.S. space agency shifts its focus toward exploring deeper into the solar system. As much as 90% of the weight of a prospective months-long Mars mission could be fuel -- and it costs between $5,000 and $10,000 per pound to put anything into space. ""If NASA can launch just the hardware and tank up in orbit, where the fuel is cheap, that means we could get to the Red Planet a lot sooner than we currently expect,"" Gump said. That could also allow commercial satellite companies to extend the life of hardware that's now written off when fuel for maneuvering thrusters runs out. ""If you give it one more month of active work in orbit, it's worth about $5 (million) to $8 million to the owner of that satellite,"" Gump said. Tuesday's announcement comes nine months after the unveiling of a similar project by Planetary Resources, a company led by space tourism pioneers Eric Anderson and Peter Diamandis. That group, backed by investors such as filmmaker James Cameron and Google executives Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, says it hopes to get its first unmanned probes into space by the end of 2013. Since the retirement of its space shuttles, NASA has hired out supply missions to the International Space Station to the private rocket company SpaceX. It completed the first commercial flight in October and is vying for a contract for manned flights into orbit alongside Boeing and Sierra Nevada. Deep Space Industries said it can build its first class of probes largely with off-the-shelf parts and book them on other launch vehicles, such as the French-built Ariane rockets or the Falcon boosters developed by SpaceX. Executives said Tuesday they're also developing a foundry designed to produce metal parts from nickel, an element abundant in asteroids, and operate in space, and a class of ""Harvestor"" craft to extract valuable material from the asteroids. But John Mankins, the company's chief technology officer, said its plans are based on existing technology, not ""magic."" ""You don't see any space elevators. You don't see antigravity. You don't see warp drive,"" said Mankins, a former NASA scientist. ""There is really nothing the business plan Deep Space Industries is using that cannot be done with the technological research that has already been accomplished in laboratories across the planet."" Coronal mass ejection blasts Earth . NASA landed a probe on the 20-mile-long asteroid 433 Eros in 2000, while Japan's space agency not only landed its Hayabusa spacecraft on the roughly 1,700-foot asteroid Itokawa in 2007 but also returned it to Earth with small samples in 2010. Andrew Cheng, project scientist for the Eros probe NEAR-Shoemaker, said the big question facing commercial space ventures remains what it will cost to get their equipment off Earth. ""The physics are feasible. The economics is a different story,"" said Cheng, who now leads space research at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. He said he's hopeful that ventures such as Deep Space Industries can succeed as more companies venture into space, however. ""If someone identifies a way to do something out there that makes a lot of money, and there's a lot of traffic and a bigger market, then the cost will come down,"" he said. ""It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem."" Space is a new legal frontier as well. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty provides for ""free access to all areas of celestial bodies"" by any nation, but isn't clear about commercial rights, said Henry Hertzfeld, who researches space policy at George Washington University. Until that's cleared up, that adds risk to any business venture, he said. Cheap access to space has been ""the sort-of Holy Grail"" for decades, ""and we're not much closer to that than we were 50 years ago,"" said Hertzfeld, who is also an adviser to Planetary Resources. But Deep Space Industries Chairman Rick Tumlinson, a longtime booster of private space efforts, said the company sees itself as the 21st-century version of the ""settlers and shopkeepers"" who followed the Lewis and Clark expedition into the American West. ""One company may be a fluke. Two companies showing up -- that's the beginning of an industry,"" Tumlinson said. ""Space is big. There's room for everybody,"" he added.","Deep Space Industries is the second company to announce plans to mine asteroids .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Republican candidates attack one another on the campaign trail, Republican outside spending groups are taking aim at President Barack Obama over failed energy company Solyndra. Given such easy targets as the poor state of the economy and mortgage foreclosures, why take aim at Obama on Solyndra? Both parties view Obama's ethical standards and his personal likability among his greatest strengths with voters, and deep-pocketed GOP groups want to change that image. They see Solyndra as a way to erode the president's brand as ethical and honest. Since the fall, two Republican outside spending groups have collectively spent $9.4 million on four ads attacking Obama for his administration's $535 million loan to Solyndra. The ads accuse the president of being part of ""typical Washington"" and engaged in ""politics as usual."" The latest assault, a 30-second spot by Karl Rove-advised Crossroads GPS, says the Obama ""gave his political backers billions."" At first look, the ads seem to challenge the president over spending and the role that government should play in the economy. But they also make a more emotional appeal, attempting to imprint in voters' minds that the Obama of 2012 is not the same candidate who ran in 2008 on the promise to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. Put simply, the ads seek to undermine the perception that Obama is an ethical politician. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, which spent $8.4 million airing Solyndra-themed ads, said, ""We have a president who proclaimed he was going to be different, and it turns out he is not. He is just the same old, same old we've seen from politicians in both parties over the years."" Phillips said the administration ""has not lived up to its own lofty rhetoric"" and believes the president ""is using tax dollars by the bushel-full to promote his ideology, an ideology that leads to cronyism."" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has picked up on theme, telling a Jacksonville, Florida, crowd Monday: ""He practices something I call crony capitalism, and instead of it being driven by the market and consumers, it's driven by politicians."" This strategy is what you'd call attacking a perceived strength. A November ABC News/Washington Post poll suggested that 57% of Americans believe the president is honest and ethical. And operatives on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that Obama remains well-liked personally even when his job performance numbers are low. Some operatives say that could count for a point or two in a close race and could be meaningful in November. Steven Law, CEO and president of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, explained that voters who are still impressionable include independents, ""soft"" Democrats and Republicans who voted for Obama in 2008 but now ""feel a deep sense of disappointment."" Law said his research shows while this group of voters believes the president is ""not up to the job,"" they're still ""looking for signs of success"" and ""want to validate their decision"" to vote for him. At the same time, he says Obama ""is starting to own part of the D.C. dysfunction"" and these voters ""fault (the president) for failing to clean up Washington."" That's where these ads come in. ""When (the president) says he wants to change rules of game to help people, what it looks like is Solyndra,"" Law said. ""It reminds people that his interventions lead to failure and poor results and wasting money."" As the president tries to run away from Washington, these ads attempt to anchor him in the swamp. All this is not lost on the Obama campaign. The Solyndra ad war prompted the Obama team to play defense. Its first ad of the election was a spot reacting to Americans for Prosperity's Solyndra ads, calling them ""ads (that) fact checkers say are not tethered to the facts."" The Obama campaign ad continues, ""Independent watchdogs call this president's record on ethics unprecedented"" and ""President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen America's energy economy."" Despite this seemingly defensive posture, Democratic operatives are adamant the president's record on ethics -- dating back to his days in the Illinois Legislature -- makes him unshakable on this count and Republican groups can throw millions at him without making a dent. Expect those millions to flow. The groups plan to keep their messaging -- they call it ""advocacy"" -- going. Together, Americans for Prosperity, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS raised more than $100 million in 2011.","Republican outside groups have spent $9.4 million on ads critical of President Barack Obama .

"(CNN) -- Activists working to break Israel's siege of Gaza remained afloat in the Mediterranean Sea after their ship was taken over Thursday in Libya, an official with their organization said. The ship, the Strofades IV, was part of a Gaza-bound convoy sponsored by the independent activist group Road to Hope. The group said that the incident took place after the ship owner ""went berserk"" in an argument with an Egyptian broker. Ten convoy members -- seven Britons, two Irish citizens and an Algerian -- were taken hostage, the group said. As many as seven Libyans, including customs inspects and border police, were also being held on the ship, according to Road to Hope. ""All of them are gelling together and staying as a team,"" Leyla-Rubaina Hyda, a British representative for the activist non-profit group, told CNN. According to Hyda, who talked to a Road to Hope member on board the ship, the hostages ""are all doing fine."" In a release, fellow Road to Hope official Ellie Merton wrote that all 10 had used mobile phones to contact friends and family. After first being confined to the loading bay in the back of the ship, the activists were moved to a smoking room where they have been given a meal, Merton said, based on her conversations with crew members. Two Road to Hope members found a radio and sent a mayday message, Hyda said, and soon thereafter they saw military jets flying around the ship. Road to Hope's Facebook page stated that four Libyan naval vessels and two fighter jets had surrounded the ship, before it headed into international waters. Still, there was no rescue on Thursday night, and Hyda said the ship later appeared to be approaching Crete. The British Foreign Office said its diplomats, as well as others, were working to resolve the crisis. ""We are aware of the incident at Derna Port in Libya, and have been in close contact with the convoy organizers,"" the British Foreign Office said. ""Our embassy in Tripoli has been urging the Libyan authorities to resolve the situation rapidly and ensure that those caught on the ship are returned to safety. ""Our embassy in Athens has spoken to the shipping company and is also in close contact with the Greek authorities. Our priority remains that there be a safe resolution to this incident."" Greece's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the ship -- sailing under a Maltese flag -- is heading toward the Greek island of Crete but was still in international waters. The ministry initially said the ship was Maltese-owned but later said the vessel may be partly Greek-owned. ""The matter is a serious breach of every maritime law possible. We have asked all relevant embassies to supply urgent, immediate, consular assistance. We are extremely concerned for the safety of all the nationals on board,"" Road to Hope said in a statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- While the first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha were away this weekend, President Barack Obama has been enjoying what some have jokingly referred to as a bachelor's weekend with friends -- golfing, playing basketball and grilling out on the South Lawn. The festivities are all part of a belated birthday celebration of sorts for the president, who turned 49 on Wednesday. First lady Michelle Obama and youngest daughter Sasha, 9, were on vacation in Spain, while 12-year-old Malia is attending camp. Friends from Hawaii, Chicago, Illinois, and college joined the president on Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base for a round of golf. The sports outings continued Sunday with a basketball game at Fort McNair where Obama -- along with such NBA stars as LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Grant Hill and Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson -- played in front of an audience of wounded servicemen and participants in the White House mentoring program. Obama was scheduled to return to the White House Sunday evening with friends and some of the basketball players for a seafood barbecue on the South Lawn. Workers were seen setting up grills on the lawn Sunday morning in preparation for the party. Tables set up with white and yellow linens and adorned with centerpieces of lemons and limes dotted the lawn. The menu is expected to include shrimp from the Gulf Coast, where the seafood industry has been hard hit by the BP oil disaster, according to White House aide Katie Hogan. CNN's Jonathan Helman contributed to this report.","The president turned 49 on Wednesday .

"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) -- Something funny could happen on the way to the Republican presidential nomination next year. Mitt Romney might actually win South Carolina. A triumph by the former Massachusetts governor in the first-in-the-South primary state has long been considered unthinkable by Republican insiders here, where Romney's northern pedigree and evolving positions on core conservative issues have been viewed with skepticism since his last White House bid in 2008. But, as in Iowa, Romney is holding steady at or near the top of the polls in the Palmetto State with roughly a quarter of the GOP vote in his corner. And crucially, no other candidate has managed to rally conservatives and emerge as a serious alternative to the presumed front-runner. Romney's top backers in this conservative bastion have been cautious about forecasting a victory, especially after his dreary fourth-place finish in the 2008 primary. But in recent weeks they have started to see an opening, especially with serious questions surfacing about the candidacies of businessman Herman Cain and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""It's gone even better this election cycle than I thought,"" said state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, one of only three elected officials here supporting Romney. ""It used to be, 'Hey, the guy's a Mormon. He's the Yankee governor.' But now it's the economy people are focused on. I am liking his chances. It would surprise me if he didn't win South Carolina."" Even Romney skeptics who have been yearning for a grass-roots conservative savior are beginning to come around to the prospect of a buttoned-up Harvard grad being the only viable choice come Election Day. ""I don't know if the evangelical community is going to rally to one particular candidate or not,"" said Bob Taylor, the Bob Jones University chancellor who endorsed Romney in 2008 but has kept his distance this year. ""It's just kind of unpredictable. ... If I can't make up my mind, I'm going to say, 'Which one of these has the best chance at the general election?' More than likely that's going to be Romney."" A top GOP fundraiser in the state who backed Romney during the last campaign but has actively searched for another candidate this cycle told CNN that the ex-governor could win the primary simply by default. ""It's like a soccer game: He is going to win a 0-0 overtime battle,"" said the fundraiser, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the candidates. ""At the end of the day, I am going to be forced to pick the smartest, most capable guy in the room. At some point you look around the field and that becomes Romney."" After pouring a small fortune into the state in 2008 and lining up a bevy of endorsements -- including the blessings of Sen. Jim DeMint and then a little-known state representative named Nikki Haley -- Romney has just three paid staffers in the state this time around. He has not run a single television ad or sent out a piece of mail. He can no longer count on the support of DeMint or Haley, now the governor, both of whom have expressed concerns about the health insurance mandate Romney implemented in Massachusetts. And on Friday, he will make just his fifth campaign stop in the state ahead of a Republican debate this weekend in Spartanburg. The South Carolina race is still extraordinarily fluid, with nearly 70% of GOP voters still undecided about the race, according to a Clemson University poll out this week. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich appears to be the latest candidate on the rise in the state, and he's adding staff and opening field offices to capitalize on his recent surge. But even without a serious organizational footprint in the state, Romney has weathered boomlets from two Southerners, Perry and Cain, to maintain a poll position in the low to mid-20s throughout the summer and fall. A healthy plurality may be enough to win in a fractured Republican race as Sen. John McCain of Arizona proved in 2008 when he won the primary with 33% of the vote, while Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson and Romney divided up the rest of the electorate. Romney's support is not growing, but it's not shrinking either. ""Everybody keeps saying he's stuck at 25%, 22%, 27%,"" said GOP strategist Luke Byars, who worked for Romney in 2008 but is not currently on any candidate's payroll. ""Well put me in that briar patch. I'd love to be stuck at that number where you're that close to winning."" Both Romney's supporters and detractors agree that he probably needs to increase his share of the vote into the 30% range to win in January, meaning that a Romney victory in the land of barbecue and college football is far from certain. Several factors are working against him, including the prospect of an all-out assault on the television airwaves from his Republican foes. Romney has yet to be hit by a negative ad in this race. There are also lingering anxieties about Romney's squishy moderate reputation among a segment of GOP primary voters, particularly in the evangelical-heavy upstate. Tony Beam, a Christian radio host in Greenville, gave Romney credit for running a respectable campaign and said that voters who dial into his show are primarily concerned about economic issues, not social ones. He also said he hears almost no talk about Romney's Mormon faith. But Beam said he is looking elsewhere in the Republican race. ""As an evangelical Christian who is concerned about politics, I believe that when Romney decided to run for president he changed his views in order to put them in line with enough conservatives to get elected,"" he told CNN. The good news for Romney is that the impact of race and religion in campaigns has waned in recent election cycles. In 2010, after all, the state elected Haley -- a woman of Indian descent who was raised as a Sikh but later joined the Methodist Church -- to the Governor's Mansion. The idea of South Carolina as ground zero for Christian conservative voters is also somewhat overstated. The share of Republicans who identify themselves as fundamentalist Christians or evangelicals is exactly the same in South Carolina as it is in Iowa: 40%, according to recent NBC News/Marist poll. Economic concerns also remain the pivot point of the GOP race, and Romney's data-driven turnaround artist pitch is well-tailored to a state with the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the nation. Then there's the overlooked fact that Romney played relatively well in South Carolina in 2008 and was competitive up until his devastating January losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans who worked inside the 2008 McCain and Romney campaigns told CNN that their internal polling in the closing weeks before Iowa showed the South Carolina race to be essentially a three-way tie between Huckabee, Romney and McCain. Still, the Romney campaign has only a scant presence in the state this year, while rivals such as Perry, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Gingrich and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota have either been frequent faces in the state or can point to large campaign organizations. South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Chad Connelly said Romney should not be counting on the fact that he ran in the state once before. ""The dynamics are different, and I wouldn't assume that I could tap into the same grass-roots network that I had four years ago,"" Connelly said. ""It's a little presumptuous to think all those people are still in place."" But it's an open question whether a candidate actually needs a robust political organization to win the state, which has sided with the ""establishment"" pick in each and every Republican primary going back to 1980. Again, South Carolina Republicans point to Haley: The tea party darling won a statewide Republican primary in 2010 with just four paid staffers and little support from Columbia insiders. Similarly, Romney is leading the pack with little infrastructure in place, while Perry has almost two dozen state legislators backing his campaign but is mired around 10% in the polls. Romney has done more to help himself in the state by displaying a toughness in the presidential debates that have come to define the GOP race, said longtime Republican strategist Warren Tompkins, who advised Romney's 2008 bid. ""He's shown a new mettle during the course of these debates,"" Tompkins said. ""When everyone was attacking Romney, he stood up and fought back."" State Sen. Tom Davis, a leading conservative voice in the state with close ties to the tea party movement, said Romney's impressive national campaign may be enough to carry him over the finish line in South Carolina. It's a sentiment few here would have expressed in the early days of the Republican presidential fight. ""If you had asked me a month ago, I would have said he probably can't win, given that South Carolina is a pretty red-meat Republican state,"" said Davis, who has not endorsed a candidate. ""Now I think he can.""","Mitt Romney leads the pack in South Carolina with little infrastructure in place .

"(CNN) -- The undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico has been brought under control, but the worst oil spill in U.S. history will continue to be felt along the Gulf Coast for some time, Obama administration officials said Sunday. ""If you're sitting in Barataria Bay, it's still a disaster. If the folks have not come back to the panhandle of Florida, it's still a disaster,"" former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the administration's point man for the disaster, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" A report from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration last week found three-quarters of the oil spilled between late April and mid-July has been collected, dispersed or evaporated. But Allen said, ""We need to keep a steady hand at the tiller to keep the cleanup going."" ""It's a catastrophe. It's a catastrophe for the people of the Gulf, and it requires our attention until we get the job done,"" he said. And White House environmental adviser Carol Browner told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the ""first phase"" of the disaster was over -- but it is ""not the end by any means."" The well erupted after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 men dead. A temporary cap contained the spill on July 15, and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the well back into the ocean floor last week. The final step -- the completion of a relief well that will permanently seal the blowout from below -- is expected to be completed sometime between August 13 and 15, Jim Lestelle, a spokesman for the relief effort, reported Sunday. Lestelle said the rig drilling the relief well was within the final 100 feet of intercepting the blown-out bore. The spill inflicted heavy blows on gulf Coast industries like tourism and fishing, but Allen said some parts of the region are beginning to see a recovery. ""It's starting to happen already, but it's happening incrementally, where the oil is not there now, where we've cleaned it up,"" he said. ""Some beaches are reopening. Fisheries are reopening. And that will happen as soon as we can, either by cleaning up the oil or having the areas tested through NOAA and FDA for seafood safety and so forth."" The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped. Since then, fresh, green grass has begun growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in places. ""There's a lot of clean-up working going on here, and that's excellent,"" Maura Wood, of the National Wildlife Federation, told CNN last week. ""But the tide keeps coming and going each and every day."" Federal authorities say up to 1 million barrels of oil may still lie beneath the surface of the Gulf. Browner said cleanup crews from the government and well owner BP fought to keep the oil out of beaches and coast marches, but what did reach shore ""has to be cleaned up."" ""Some of it may continue to come on shore, the residual. It'll come on in tar balls and tar mats, and that can be cleaned up,"" Browner said. In addition, she said scientists are examining marine life in the Gulf, ""and right now nobody is seeing anything of concern."" CNN's Eric Fiegel, Ed Lavandera and David Mattingly contributed to this report.","Former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen: ""A steady hand at the tiller"" needed for cleanup .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Larry King might be only person whose surprise birthday party guest list would include Pat Boone and Larry Flynt. The talk show host turned 80 Tuesday, but the celebration started over the weekend when Boone, known for his conservative political views, serenaded King with ""Happy Birthday"" while Flynt, publisher of Hustler magazine, watched. The surprise party in the middle of Dodger Stadium, produced by wife Shawn King, also included Paul Anka delivering a custom rendition of his classic song ""My Way."" King left his CNN throne almost three years ago, but he's staying busy as he begins his ninth decade. He hosts ""Larry King Now"" on Ora TV and his show is also seen online through Hulu. He still does daily radio segments on Cumulus stations. ""I thought I could retire, but I couldn't,"" he told CNN at his party. ""I love doing what I do. I love asking questions. I love being in the mix."" What is King's secret to interview success? ""I leave my ego at the door; the guest counts,"" King said. ""I see a lot of guys now, the interview is more about them than the guests. I never use the word 'I' when I interview someone. I think it's irrelevant."" Between swings in the Dodger batting cage, Boone talked about King, who is just 6 months older. (Yes, Pat Boone can swing a bat surprisingly well at 79.) King ""invented the whole thing of celebrity interviewing,"" Boone said. Their first interview together was more than nearly 50 years ago when King broadcast from a restaurant booth in Miami, he said. Celebrities feel comfortable with King because they know he's not trying to trap them, he said. ""He was never was trying to trap you or take advantage or present his own agenda, but inquisitive, truly inquisitive. So you never knew what he was going to ask. They were good and probing questions. You gave revealing answers, but you were more revealing because you thought you were talking to a friend."" Longtime ""Entertainment Tonight"" host Mary Hart called King ""wonderfully unique."" ""The network of friends that he has built up, throughout the world, no matter if it is political circles or celebrity circles, it is unparalleled,"" Hart said. Dr. Drew Pinskey said that the times he filled in for King -- before hosting his own HLN show -- made him realize ""hard it was to do his job and how easy he made it look."" King gives his guests a ""spoonful of sugar"" while ""he's sticking the shiv in you,"" Pinskey said. ""It's pleasant and so fun that you don't even realize it."" Singer-songwriter Paul Anka became King's friend during the Miami days in the 1960s. ""Larry never takes a real dirty run at you,"" Anka said. ""He always gets to the real deal without hurting anybody."" ""Inside Edition"" correspondent Jim Moret, who substituted as host on King's CNN show at least 30 times, called him ""a mentor, a friend."" He expects King will be working for many more years.

"(CNN) -- Politicians, generals and clerics have all played their part in shaping the new Iraq, with varying results. Now the geeks are giving it a shot. In recent months, Baghdad residents from science, engineering and tech backgrounds have been meeting regularly to participate in Iraq's first ""hackerspace."" Known as Fikra Space, from the Arabic word for ""idea,"" this open-access laboratory is intended as a technological playground to promote collaborative innovation, entrepreneurship -- and potentially solutions to some of the problems facing the country. ""There's nothing else like this here,"" said Salih Ammar, a 16-year-old high school student with an interest in smartphone technology, who has become heavily involved in the project. ""It's open for all people, no matter their ages and their religion."" Sectarian tensions have been a hallmark of life in Iraq following the ouster of former dictator Saddam Hussein. Shia Arabs form the largest group in the country, but for centuries were dominated by the Sunni minority. Today, Shias dominate the government, and Sunni activists routinely protest what they consider discriminatory treatment. The hackerspace concept, where participants were free to drop in, experiment with specialist tech equipment and share ideas, has been imported to Iraq via Bilal Ghalib, a 27-year-old Iraqi-American. Ghalib became involved in hackerspaces when he visited about 50 across the United States in 2009, shooting footage for a possible documentary. The model, he told CNN, had originated in Germany in the 1990s, but had taken off in the U.S. in the wake of the global financial crisis, as skilled, newly unemployed people sought different ways to re-tool and channel their energies in a more entrepreneurial way. Ghalib says he saw parallels with the situation across the Middle East where a young generation looking for greater control of their own destinies were being worn down by high unemployment and political instability. ""How do you look into the future and see your (hand) in it?"" he added. ""That's what entrepreneurship is, putting control back into your hands and letting you create what you want to see and make a living doing it."" See more: Ten of the Gulf's coolest green buildings . Ghalib started Fikra Space during a flying visit to Iraq in October, paid for through crowd-funding to his organization GEMSI (the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative). Having put the word out through online networks, he convened a series of workshops to demonstrate the new technologies people could play with in the setting -- such as a 3D printer -- and to introduce them to the ethos of the hackerspace itself. Since then, the group, which meets in the offices of a local journalism institute, has been drawing as many as 30 active participants to its meetings, held weekly if security allows, said Fikra Space member Mujtaba Zuhair. Although attacks by sectarian militants in Iraq have decreased since the height of the insurgency in 2006 and 2007, religious violence is still common and security remains a prime concern for civil society groups and other organizations pushing a progressive agenda. Zuhair, a 19-year-old student with an interest in electronics and programming, said many locals struggled to wrap their heads around the concept, while Ghalib added that the project has been regarded with suspicion in some quarters. ""First, they're confused by the word hacker -- they think it's something to do with piracy,"" said Zuhair. Rather, the term here refers to an inventor or creator. The ""open-source,"" everyone-is-welcome philosophy that underpinned the project is also unique. ""There aren't many communities in Baghdad that operate like this,"" said Zuhair, who has been using his time in the lab to conduct experiments in home automation -- connecting items in the home to a network which can be operated through a mobile phone. ""We don't have a manager, board, administration. We're all equal and every member can do whatever they want."" But despite its novelty, the facility is proving a major draw to a certain type of technologically curious, enterprising Iraqi, the majority of whom are college students or professors. ""The most interesting thing is the people themselves, the people who want to help their community and others,"" said Ali Mohammed, a 21-year-old student of materials science and engineering who uses the labs to further his interest in artificial intelligence. Read more: Who will win the battle for the new Tunisia? Along with others behind the space, he hopes the lab might eventually prove an incubator that could generate products and services providing solutions for problems facing Iraq. ""The problem here in Iraq is that people have lost hope in making things,"" said Zuhair. ""People became unused to making things -- they just wanted to survive. If someone has a great idea they will get discouraged. But the new generation want to change, and they're looking for other people like them who want to change."" To this end, Ghalib has had a similar hand in the establishment of hackerspaces in Lebanon and Egypt -- operating on the basis that he helps seed the idea, then lets the community take over -- and has a vision for a chain of similar spaces throughout the region. ""I want to see 1,000 hackerspaces from Turkey to Morocco,"" he said. Ghalib added that you don't need to spend long in Iraq to be exposed to the challenges the country faces -- when he was in Baghdad, explosions occurred close to where he was staying -- and the Middle Eastern hackerspaces had some way to go before they began generating solutions to those problems. Experiments thus far had been more modest in scope. Projects in Egypt include a high-tech reimagining of a ""fanuz,"" the colourful lamp traditionally lit during Ramadan -- a home-grown response to the loss of the fanuz-manufacturing industry to China. Beirut's hackerspace has conducted experiments with clay and cryptography, and while Baghdad's experimental makers are a long way from solving the city's notorious traffic issues, Zuhair is proposing a simple intervention to make it more tolerable: Starting a podcast to entertain gridlocked commuters. ""We haven't gotten there yet,"" said Zuhair, acknowledging that the sort of game-changing innovations promised by the hackerspace movement were probably some way off. But that's okay, said Ghalib. ""I think it's really important for the people in the Middle East to feel like they have a place to come and play. People don't really have that."" He acknowledges that his faith in the hackerspace concept has previously been described as ""irrationally optimistic"" -- but says that's a good fit for the city. ""I think that's the only way to be when you're working in a place like Baghdad,"" he said. ""I believe it's this type of optimism that will allow me and others around me to look past the challenges that surround us, and begin to do something.""","Hackerspaces have begun operating in Baghdad and elsewhere in the Middle East .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A total of 39 hostages in Pakistan were freed Sunday morning after being held by five militants at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, an army spokesman said. Pakistani soldiers take up position after an attack on the army headquarters in Rawalpindi on Saturday. Four militants and three hostages -- two of them civilians -- were killed in the 22-hour standoff, Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN. Two security personnel were killed during the rescue operation, and five others were injured. Abbas said two of the militants -- one wearing a suicide vest -- held 22 of the hostages in one room and threatened to blow up the building. Security forces fatally shot both gunmen before the explosive detonated. Two other militants, who were in another part of the facility, blew themselves up, Abbas said. Whether the three hostages died in during those explosions was unclear. A fifth militant -- who led the attack -- was injured and captured, Abbas said. That militant was identified as Aqil, aka Dr. Usman, one of the suspected masterminds in the March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, Pakistan. Police there also have said he was involved in the July 2007 attempt to attack the airplane of former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Dr. Usman was injured when he blew up explosives in the building he was holed up in, Abbas said. The military continued to revise its initial numbers of the dead and injured and those taken hostage after the standoff ended about 10 a.m. Sunday. Earlier, Abbas told CNN that the hostages included civilians and military personnel. Military officials said sporadic shootings flared between the gunmen and authorities for several hours. Abbas said security forces communicated throughout the standoff with the militants, who made demands. Though Abbas did not immediately elaborate on the nature of the demands, another military official -- who was not authorized to speak on the record -- said the gunmen wanted the government to release several militants in Pakistani custody. The standoff started after an attack on the army checkpoint, which occurred about noon. The gunmen, wearing camouflage and riding in a minivan, opened fire Saturday at the headquarters checkpoint, Abbas said. Six army guards were killed initially in the gunbattle, Abbas said, and five gunmen were killed. Another military official said the Taliban had claimed responsibility for the attack. Rawalpindi, the closely guarded home to the general headquarters of the Pakistani army, has experienced suicide bombings and other attacks before. Saturday's assault was the third major attack in Pakistan this week. A suicide car bomb in the northern city of Peshawar killed at least 52 people Friday, and a suicide attack at the offices of the U.N. World Food Programme in Islamabad on Monday killed five employees.","NEW: Total of 39 hostages released after 22-hour siege .

"(CNN) -- Henrik Stenson kept his cool to collect the biggest paycheck of his career Sunday, landing a $10 million FedEx Cup jackpot along with the $1.44 million prize for winning the Tour Championship in Atlanta. The Swede, who also collected $1.44 million for winning the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month, finished three shots clear of young American hope Jordan Spieth and veteran Steve Stricker. The 37-year-old went into the final day at East Lake with a four-stroke advantage, having been nine ahead halfway through Saturday's round, but Spieth ate into that as he fired a superb six-under-par 64. The 20-year-old, who won his first PGA Tour title in July while still a teen, had carded eight birdies until his second bogey at 17 dimmed his hopes of a remarkable victory. ""It's been a dream come true,"" said Spieth, who had nine top-10 finishes in his rookie year. Stricker, second behind Stenson in Boston and tied for fourth at last week's BMW Championship, made his charge with an eagle three at the 15th but he could only par from there as he also finished on 10 under. It put the 46-year-old in third place in the FedEx Cup standings, while Spieth was seventh. Stenson had given them hope when he dropped a shot at 14, but allayed any fears of another blowout like Saturday as he bounced back immediately with a birdie and finished with pars to complete a memorable wire-to-wire victory. Webb Simpson shot the round of the day, a flawless seven-birdie 63 that lifted the 2012 U.S. Open winner up to fourth on 271 -- two shots ahead of his successor Justin Rose (67). Dustin Johnson, whose late charge collapsed with a triple-bogey seven at the 17th hole, rebounded with a birdie at the last to claim sixth place. Tiger Woods had led the FedEx Cup standings going into the fourth and final playoff event, but ended up second behind Stenson after finishing tied for 22nd in the 30-man field. The world No. 1 said he was happy after carding his best round of the week, a five-birdie 67. ""There are days where I just don't have it,"" said the American, who has won five tournaments this year but struggled in the four majors. ""Game doesn't feel right. Body doesn't feel right. Things just don't work. But I still grind it out and post some numbers. ""I wish I would have been a little more consistent in some of the events, but overall, at the end of the day, to add to the win total for the year, it's always a good thing."" Woods' old rival Phil Mickelson was tied for 12th after a 68, which put the British Open champion on four under along with Keegan Bradley -- who eagled the par-four seventh in his 67. Masters champion Adam Scott was another shot back tied for 14th after carding a mixed 69 which featured a double bogey and four birdies. Last season's FedEx Cup winner Brandt Snedeker, who has battled bone disease this year, tied for 20th after closing with 68.","Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson wins PGA Tour's end-of-season playoffs .

"(CNN) -- Soccer player Fabrice Muamba has made an emotional first return to the ground where he suffered a career-ending heart seizure in March. The 24-year-old wiped away tears after being allowed to address the fans at Tottenham's White Hart Lane during the English team's European match on Thursday. At halftime, Muamba came onto the same pitch where he collapsed while playing for his former club Bolton eight months ago -- his heart stopped for 78 minutes but he was resuscitated and later made a remarkable recovery in hospital. However, the Zaire-born England under-21 international was unable to resume his playing career and he officially quit the game in August. ""I can't express... All I can say is thanks to the Tottenham fans for the way they reacted,"" said Muamba, who had earlier been at London's O2 Arena to watch tennis star Roger Federer in action. ""There are people out there who prayed for me. I want to thank the chairman, and to all the Spurs fans. I am grateful to them. They are awesome fans. ""Today I wanted to visit that place one more time for closure."" Before Thursday's Europa League match against Maribor, Tottenham's website hailed Muamba as an ""inspiration"" and referred to his work with the ""Hearts & Goals"" campaign -- which aims to give communities across the UK access to 500 new defibrillators, as well as training. ""Amazing day at WHL tonight. Thank you guys for everythings spurs fans tonight were awesome. Thank you,"" Muamba wrote on Twitter -- the web platform where his then fiancee and now wife Shauna kept fans around the world updated about his recovery. ""So proud of my husband @fmuamba for his fighting spirit and courage. Also proud of the humanity in the UK the support has been amazing,"" she wrote on Thursday after the match. He earlier revealed: ""Off to white hart lane, for the first time the incident happen. I am so nervous is unreal. Hope spurs win tonight."" Muamba got his wish, as Tottenham beat Slovenian side Maribor 3-1 to bounce back from two Premier League defeats and boost the club's hopes of progressing in the second-tier European competition. Muamba's longtime friend, England international striker Jermain Defoe, scored all three goals for Tottenham to put the club second in Group J behind Italian side Lazio -- which also won, 3-0 against Greece's Panathinaikos. Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas was not in charge when Muamba collapsed, but he welcomed the former Birmingham and Arsenal player in his prematch program notes. ""What happened to Fabrice at this stadium eight months ago has obviously changed his life forever,"" Villas-Boas wrote. ""Everyone in the game and the wider footballing world was delighted to see him make a full recovery. We are thrilled to have him here tonight and I would like to wish him the very best for the future.""","Fabrice Muamba receives standing ovation as he returns to White Hart Lane for first time .

"(CNN) -- Against a background of conflict, strife and economic hardship, the Palestinian territories hope a $4.5 million football grant can help reshape the world's view of this troubled region. On Thursday world soccer's governing body FIFA announced it will help promote the growth of Palestinian football by establishing a youth academy and building artificial pitches in the disputed territory with the investment. The academy will be in Al-Bireh in the West Bank, while the new pitches will be located in Tulkarem -- also in the West Bank -- and Al-Ram on the outskirts on Jerusalem. The grant is part of FIFA's Goal program, which aids the development of football in emerging associations. The Goal program is already helping with the construction of Palestinian Football Association (PFA) headquarters in Al-Ram. ""Our aim is to change the world's impression of the people of Palestine, highlighting our passion for football and sports in general,"" PFA technical director Mazen Khatib said in a FIFA statement. New era . In December, FIFA's finance committee approved a $200,000 investment for the reconstruction of a stadium which was destroyed in Gaza. Gaza City's Palestine Stadium was bombed by Israeli forces on November 10 during combat operations on the Gaza strip. The Israelis claimed rockets had been launched from the stadium, which was denied by Hamas' armed wing when contacted by CNN. ""It's quite remarkable the extent to which football has become a key tool to promote social development in Palestine,"" commented FIFA's director of member associations and development Thierry Regenass. ""It's our intention as FIFA to contribute to the implementation of an efficient football infrastructure, while fostering the general PFA structures and enabling Palestinian people to practice their favorite sport."" PFA president Jibril Rajoub welcomed the finanical boost at what he considers to be an exciting time for football in Palestine. ""PFA is starting a new era with the move to our new headquarters,"" explained Rajoub. ""We are confident that with the support from FIFA's Performance Program we will be able to properly implement our general strategy and train PFA staff accordingly."" The PFA was established in 1928 and it joined FIFA in 1929. In 2001 it entered the Asian Football Confederation. Football in the area is set to receive a further boost in June, when Israel hosts the under-21's European Championships.

"(CNN) -- Facebook is abuzz with talk about ""Breaking Bad."" The social-networking site has just started surfacing the data about what users are mentioning in public Facebook posts, and CNN producers noticed that ""Breaking Bad"" came up as a popular subject among Facebook's community over a given 24-hour period. The AMC show, about a cancer-stricken science teacher's misadventures as a meth-cooking mogul, is a crowd-pleaser. It just came off of a buzzed-about episode titled ""Ozymandias,"" and its finale airs September 29. Coincidentally (or not?), it also comes up as a favorite for best drama series in CNN's predictions for the Emmy winners. Of course, timing is very much the key here. Other shows have generated significant conversation in the past few months. The most recent season of ""Downton Abbey"" had a shocking ending that drew much attention on social media. But ""Breaking Bad"" seems to be a fan favorite at the Emmys, and many people will be hoping for it to win. Click through the gallery above to see charts about the Facebook users. Remember, it's a set of data, not a study. Although not a scientifically verifiable indicator in any way, Facebook chatter gives a glimpse into what real people are actually talking about. Facebook is one of the places people go to discuss their lunches, puppies, politics and, yes, the TV shows they love (or love to hate). There are clear age and gender differences in the Facebook mentions. PBS' ""Downton Abbey,"" for example, was talked about mostly by women, while ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men"" had a majority of its mentions coming from men. Some shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Homeland"" are more evenly divided. The ages also vary. ""Downton Abbey"" and ""House of Cards"" mentions seem to have been made by an older group of Facebook users than the other shows. A lot is up in the air, but it's almost certain that channel-flippers will be keeping plenty busy. The Emmy Awards and ""Breaking Bad"" both air Sunday night. Can Facebook posts help predict the winners? We'll find out on Sunday, and surprises are always a possibility, but looking at the posts and at CNN's expert picks is perhaps one more way to get a leg up on those prediction ballots.","""Breaking Bad"" entering final episodes; AMC show will air Sunday alongside Emmys .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer may have given up his No. 1 ranking, but the Swiss tennis star's grip on end-of-season supremacy is showing no signs of loosening. Federer marched into the semifinals of the $5.5 million ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday, beating in-form Spaniard David Ferrer 6-4 7-6 (7-5) for his second successive straight-sets win in Group B. The 31-year-old has not lost at the eight-man London showpiece since 2009, and has now won 70 matches this year -- a feat he had not achieved since 2006 when he was at the peak of his powers. ""This is a very special tournament in many ways,"" said Federer, who has reached the last four in 10 of his 11 appearances. ""It's always been the tournament I wanted to be part of when I started playing at the beginning of the year, many years now. I had breakthrough results at this event. I learned a lot. ""I've loved everywhere I've played over the years at the World Tour Finals. But I think this one is obviously special, because it's in London and The O2 is an amazing venue. I'm happy it's going to stay here for the next few years."" The 17-time grand slam champion relinquished the year-end top spot to Novak Djokovic when he decided not to defend his Paris title last week, having pushed his record tally to 302 weeks at the top. Fifth-ranked Ferrer took advantage of a weakened field and shock defeats for Djokovic and No. 3 Andy Murray by winning his first Masters level tournament, following up his title in Valencia. However, the 30-year-old had never beaten Federer in 13 previous attempts, winning just three of 30 sets played -- including defeat to Federer in the 2007 final of the elite event when it was held in Shanghai. That run continued on Thursday after Ferrer failed to covert three break points on Federer's serve in the opening game. Djokovic edges Murray at ATP finals . ""It was a long match and I'm extremely happy to win,"" Federer said after ending Ferrer's 11-match unbeaten run. ""I played a great match. I've qualified and I'm obviously relieved and thrilled that that's the case. ""David's been on a great run and he is so respected by his fellow competitors. I enjoy playing against him, not because I've got a good record, but because he's a great guy and a great competitor."" Federer now has a 102-1 record against players aged over 30 since his 2002 defeat by Andre Agassi in the final of the Miami Masters. If he retains his title, extending his record to seven overall in the indoor hard-court event, he will match third-placed John McEnroe on the ATP's career title list with 77. Ferrer has won an ATP Tour-leading 73 matches this year, one more than Djokovic -- who will seek to clinch his semi spot in his third and final closing Group A match against sixth-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych on Friday. Ferrer, who also has a tour-leading seven titles in 2012, must now beat Janko Tipsarevic if he is to emulate last year's achievement of reaching the semifinals in London. ""I had a lot of chances to break his serve,"" Ferrer said of his latest Federer defeat. ""When he had one break point, he made it. ""Sometimes with these players, if I don't take my chances, I don't win the important points -- it is very difficult to win."" Ferrer is fighting for a semifinal place with Juan Martin del Potro, who beat Tipsarevic 6-0 6-4 in Thursday's late match to end the Serbian's hopes. The Argentine now also has one win and a defeat ahead of his final match against Federer, but has the advantage over Ferrer in sets and games won.

"London (CNN) -- Its windows are boarded up, the red-painted exterior is peeling and the roof could do with re-tiling -- but this derelict house in a village in the Borinage region of Belgium was once the home of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. The house and surrounding industrial area, in the village of Petit Wasmes, might not look too impressive, but it was here that Van Gogh decided to become an artist. Now local authorities have agreed a deal with the owner of the house to rent it for 27 years, with the aim of turning it into a museum and possibly a guest-house, in time for the city's partnership with neighboring Mons, the European Capital of Culture in 2015. An exhibition covering Van Gogh's time in the region is planned for the Mons Museum of Fine Arts, while a documentary exploring the artist's life as an evangelical preacher among the mining community there is also in the works, with the house sure to feature. ""There is [currently] no one living in the house,"" said Gregory Dufert, a spokesperson for the municipality of Colfontaine. ""You have four walls, you have something that looks like a roof and that's it."" The municipality plans to fully restore the house, so that it will eventually look as it did when Van Gogh lived there. It is an important cultural resource to the local area, said Dufert. ""We are a very poor region and it's really amazing to know that someone as celebrated as Vincent van Gogh stayed there,"" he said. According to Teio Meedendorp, an expert on Van Gogh at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, local people in the Borinage still ""have a lot of sympathy for Vincent himself, because he had an eye for their needs and troubles."" Van Gogh's humanistic side was developed during this time and he even tried to endure the same hardships as the impoverished miners, said Meedendorp. But it was when he was discharged from his job as a preacher that he made the decision, on the advice of his brother, to become an artist. ""It was a struggle to make this decision and he had to work really hard, which is what he did -- he drew hundreds and hundreds of drawings before he saw himself fit to be an artist,"" said Meedendorp. Few of these early sketches survive, but a drawing entitled ""Mine workers in the snow"" from 1880 and in the collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands, depicts workers trudging towards a mine which looms darkly in the background. In a letter to his brother in 1880, Van Gogh said of the drawing: ""I have made a hasty scribble of miners and haulers (both boys and girls) going to the shaft in the morning through the snow, by a path along a thorn hedge; passing shadows, dimly visible in the twilight."" According to Meedendorp, there is very little evidence left of Van Gogh's time in the Borinage, which is why the house is so important. The area, too, is changing rapidly, with the mining industry now almost completely gone. ""I have a lot of sympathy for that region,"" said Meedendorp. ""From the tourist point of view [the house] would help the region get some attention,"" he said. Van Gogh lovers will hopefully be able to visit the restored house in 2015. And for those who can't wait, an exhibition entitled ""Van Gogh Up Close"" opens at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in February, while the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is currently focusing on Van Gogh's studio practice.","Local authority in Belgium working to save Van Gogh's one-time home from dereliction .

"MASAI MARA, Kenya (CNN) -- The migration of more than a million wildebeest between Kenya and Tanzania is one of the wonders of the natural world. Tourists from around the globe have flocked to Kenya to witness the herds streaming across the savanna and over the Mara River. Poachers set steel snares amongst the thorn trees to capture wildebeest headed on their annual migration. But now this annual migration is under threat from poachers. ""When the animals come into Kenya there is this big influx of poachers,"" says Brian Heath, CEO of the Mara Conservancy that manages animal protection in the border regions of the park. ""Unless we control it we are in danger of the number of animals being poached not being able to sustain the population."" The conservation NGO depends on tourists to finance their anti-poaching operations. A portion of each tourist's entrance fee goes to their operations. They have had plenty of funding in normal years, but this is not a normal year in Kenya. The political violence stemming from Kenya's disputed election caused visitors to cancel their trips or look elsewhere for their vacation. And though the country has been peaceful for months, the tourists have stayed away. As a result, the Mara Conservancy is running at a massive shortfall and has had to scale back on anti-poaching efforts. The low numbers of tourists hurts the economy in Kenya, but it also puts the wildlife at risk.  Watch how poaching is threatening the wildlife of the Masai Mara » . ""If we cannot run our operations as normal, then we fear that poachers may invade the park, kill the animals and then at the end of the day we do not have animals. They will destroy the Mara,"" says Joseph Kimojino, one of the head rangers. It sounds alarmist, but the facts back him up. Every herd requires a critical mass to survive and to move. Experts believe that between 40,000 and 100,000 wildebeest are poached a year. If the poaching increases to a certain level, it could spell disaster. ""If the numbers of animals in the migration were to reduce below a certain number then that migration may not be sustained into Kenya,"" Heath warns. ""And that would have a huge and devastating effect on Kenya's tourism.""  Watch astonishing footage of migrating wildebeest » . The rangers are after an elusive foe. The majority of the poachers come from Tanzania. They sneak over the fenceless border and hunt animals for bush meat.  Watch David McKenzie's behind the scenes report on shooting this story » . During the migration, they set up snares made from steel wires.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Entering the 80th day of a hunger strike Wednesday, former Palestinian national football player Mahmoud Sarsak said he will continue until he is released from the Israeli prison where he has been held without charge since July 2009. Sarsak is protesting Israel's controversial policy of ""illegal combatant"" -- also known as administrative detention -- which allows Israeli authorities to detain Palestinians indefinitely. Also Wednesday, two human rights organizations expressed concern about Sarsak and two other hunger strikers: Akram Rikhawi, whose protest was entering its 56th day, and Samer Al-Barq, who's been held since July 2010. A month ago, most of the 1,650 Palestinian prisoners on a hunger strike against administrative detention ended their protest after an Egyptian-mediated agreement between Israeli and Palestinian authorities to improve prison conditions. However, Sarsak and a handful of other prisoners continued to starve themselves. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN that Sarsak's case ""has been brought before numerous judges who have seen the evidence and have ruled in favor of his continued detention. He is part of Islamic jihad, one of the most extreme Iranian-supported terrorist organizations, that has a track record of brutal murder against innocent civilians."" A native of the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Sarsak, 25, was on his way to join the Balata football team in the West Bank when he was arrested three years ago despite having the proper Israeli permits to travel, his family told CNN. ""The Israeli occupation is unjust in arresting my brother without any reason,"" Imad, Sarsak's 36-year-old brother, told CNN. ""He has been in an Israeli prison for more than three years without any charge. On what basis does Israel arrest him? He was not carrying any explosives, only his football outfit and his football shoes. Israel is violating international law, my brother does not belong to any militant organization,"" Imad Sarsak said. Human rights lawyers contest Israel's detention of Sarsak and say it is politically motivated. ""The use of the 'illegal combatant law,' like in the case of Mahmoud Sarsak, is a political reason and not a security reason as Israel is claiming,"" said Sahar Francis, the director of Addameer, a group that advocates human rights and provides prisoner support. Francis went further, accusing Israel of detaining him to damage his career. Sivan Weizman, a spokeswoman for the Israeli prison service, told CNN that ""Sarsak has not been on a hunger strike for all the 80 days; he eats and restarts his hunger strike. He is in an Israeli military medical center and getting medical care."" But human rights activists are worried about his health. In a joint statement, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and the Palestinian Council of Human Rights Organizations said that Sarsak's protest has caused ""an imminent threat to his life."" They say he has lost muscle tissue and 33% of his body weight, and suffers from frequent fainting and lapses in memory. They also said pulse disruptions are endangering his life. Anat Litvin, the director of prisoners and detainees for Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, told CNN that ""Sarsak is the longest Palestinian on hunger strike, and we are afraid that the medical center of the Israeli prison service is not the right place for him to be, because they are not able to give him the proper treatment, especially if something happens in his condition while on hunger strike. The fear is that there will be rapid deterioration; they cannot perform medical tests such as blood tests and ultrasound or an X-ray on the spot."" Rikhawi, the statement said, has lost muscle tissue and a drastic amount of weight, and needs immediate hospitalization. He has been in a prison medical center ""since his arrest in 2004, as he suffers from many different chronic conditions."" Doctors are force-feeding him, the statement said. The human rights groups said that Al-Barq, 38, began his hunger strike in April, suspended it on May 14 and restarted it on May 21. The statement called for the strikers to be moved to civilian hospitals with access to independent doctors and family members, and urged the United Nations, United States and Europe to pressure Israel to end administrative detention. An Amnesty International report released Wednesday calls on the Israeli government to release all prisoners held under administrative detention or to give them fair trials. Titled ""Starved Justice,"" the report says that the nonviolent protests, which brought several detainees close to death, drew global attention to the fact that Palestinian prisoners held by Israel continue to be starved of justice. The report also alleges torture and ill treatment during interrogations of Palestinian prisoners, especially those held under administrative detention.","Mahmoud Sarsak's protest at an Israeli prison entered its 80th day Wednesday .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Oil prices have some drivers looking for new rides, but some truck and sport-utility vehicle owners are remaining true to their gas guzzlers. They say, $4-a-gallon gas be damned; they need the space. Gas prices have drivers reconsidering what they drive, but some SUV owners say they have no real alternative. ""You've got to have that room when you're moving around,"" said Steve Sharp, who has three active children and whose wife owns a dance studio. ""It would be impractical for us to own a Prius with everything we've got going on."" Toyota's hybrid sedan just wouldn't work, said Sharp, 36. In addition to hauling their 11-year-old boy to soccer games and their 10- and 7-year-old daughters to dance recitals, Sharp's wife, Caren, also totes large props and background displays for her studio. In March, as consumer cynicism toward SUVs soared alongside gas prices, the Sharpsburg, Georgia, family purchased a new Chevy Avalanche truck, which gets between 17 and 20 miles per gallon on the highway. When GM chief Rick Wagoner announced Tuesday his company would close four North American plants by 2010, he cited skyrocketing gas prices as a factor in the automobile giant's decision.  Watch how gas prices drove the move » . ""These higher gasoline prices are changing consumer behavior, and rapidly,"" Wagoner said. ""We don't think this is a temporary spike or shift. We think it is permanent."" Peter Brown, the executive director of the trade publication Automotive News, said in an interview last month that SUV sales were down almost 33 percent this year, and sales of pickups were down almost 20 percent. He likened the behemoths to dinosaurs on the fast path to extinction. iReport.com: Still driving that gas guzzler, and loving it? ""If gas prices stay where they are at or continue to rise, the body-on-frame SUV is an endangered species and the pickup truck as a personal car is an endangered species,"" he said. But some consumers say they'll strive to keep the beasts alive, even if it costs $100 or more to fill the tanks.  See gas prices across the country » . Stephanie Torgerson, 32, of Pataskala, Ohio, said she simply can't put her three boys in her husband's Mazda 626. The 1-year-old needs a car seat, the 5-year-old needs a booster chair and she doesn't feel comfortable wedging her 8-year-old between the two. Sure, she could probably get better mileage in a minivan, but she doesn't like the stigma. ""I don't want to be labeled as a soccer mom,"" she said. Torgerson said her 2006 Chevy Trailblazer, which gets about 20 mpg, affords her and her kids protection -- not to mention four-wheel drive traction in the snowy winter months. But security comes with a price. Torgerson's daily commute to Hilliard -- another Columbus suburb -- is 72 miles roundtrip. She spends about $82 a week on gas, she said.  Watch a Florida driver document gas prices » . Asked if she had considered a hybrid SUV with four-wheel drive, she promptly said no. ""They're all brand-new vehicles, and I can't afford a $500-a-month car payment,"" she said. Orlando Tapia, of Cabot, Arkansas, said he considered trading in his 2001 Chevy Suburban to buy his wife a new car. The 45-year-old U.S. Air Force education manager said he reconsidered after learning he'd get about one-seventh of the vehicle's market value.  See how SUV sales are on the decline » . ""They want to give you nothing for it,"" he said, lamenting the low demand and high supply of such vehicles. Tapia, who also owns a 1988 Chevy Silverado pickup (his wife drives a Toyota Camry), said his family uses the Suburban only about 10 times a year, for vacations, hauling his flatbed trailer and when piling friends and relatives into the Suburban saves driving two cars. Tapia decided to keep his cars simply because they're paid for. ""Do I pay $5,000 a year in car payments, or do I put $5,000 of gas in the Suburban?"" he asked. ""Right now it's cheaper for me to just put gas in the Suburban."" Tapia has felt the pinch of high gas prices, he said, but he has ways to alleviate the burden on his wallet without hocking his truck or SUV. ""If I'm running to the store and the Camry's out there and the Suburban and pickup are out there, I definitely jump in the Camry,"" he said. Sharp said his family looks for similar ways to save money on gas. For instance, his wife will time trips to the bank or grocery store so she can pick up the children from school while she's out running errands. Extra trips mean extra gas, Sharp said.  See how Lamborghinis, Bentleys fare on gas mileage » . But simple solutions don't work for everyone. ""I've got several of these things that I've been pouring liquid gold in the tank of,"" said Mark Antley, 47, of Sharpsburg, Georgia. The computer and technology contractor used to drive his 1999 Suburban from Sharpsburg through Atlanta to the northern suburb of Alpharetta. The 145-mile roundtrip to work put a dent in his 45-gallon gas tank. Making matters more costly were his wife's car -- another '99 Suburban -- and his diesel 2002 Ford F250 pickup. So last month, Antley got on eBay, where he found a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire for $1,000. The car is a ""piece of junk,"" he said, but it gets about 37 mpg, almost tripling his Suburban's mileage. He has already put 5,000 miles on it, which has saved him about the cost of the car in gas, he said. ""Last month, before I bought this car, it was running in the neighborhood of $1,400 to $1,800 a month,"" Antley said of his family's gasoline budget. Though Antley has left his F250 parked since Christmas, his wife still needs her Suburban for carpooling to school and school events. The Antleys' daughter just turned 16, and is driving her own Toyota Corolla, but the couple's boys need rides to soccer practice and their sister's gymnastics meets. Antley said he doesn't think the SUV is on the verge of extinction. He laughs at folks willing to pay $1.25 for a pint of bottled water -- $10 a gallon -- but who gripe about $4-a-gallon gas. All products go up in price, he said. Gas prices eventually will level off and families will adjust their budgets accordingly. SUVs will either become luxuries for those who can afford the gas or necessities for those who need what SUVs have to offer, he predicts. ""There will still be a niche market for them,"" he said. ""I don't know what other vehicle affords you the luxury of carrying as much as they do.""

"(CNN) -- If one image can tell an entire story, this is a powerful example. The photo is set in a hospital room. A patient with a neck brace, tubes attached everywhere, draped in a red, white and blue quilt, is lying in a bed. His bandaged right arm is raised in what we now know is a salute. His face is mostly obscured, but the photo captures details such as the color of the patient's hair, the shadow of what appears to be a large bruise on his left cheek and a Purple Heart medal pinned to the quilt. The patient is Cpl. Joshua Hargis, 24. His wife, Taylor, calls him Josh. The photo has been shared thousands of times since Taylor posted it to her Facebook page nearly a week after he was injured during a military operation in Afghanistan that killed four troops and injured 14. She posted the image with the following story: . ""I received this picture today along with a letter from the commander of the team Josh was a part of on the night of his injuries. A letter to explain to me what kind of man I have the privilege of being married to. He explained to me what happened and what was going on in the picture."" She then posted the contents of the letter she says she received: . ""Josh was seriously wounded as you know and survived for almost two hours after his injury before arriving to the hospital. Josh was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in Afghanistan. Despite being in intense pain and mental duress, Josh remained alert and compassionate to the limited Rangers that were allowed to visit him bedside. ""Prior to Josh being moved to Germany for his eventual flight to America, we conducted a ceremony to award him with the Purple Heart for wounds received in action. A simple ceremony, you can picture a room full of Rangers, leaders, doctors, and nurses surrounding his bedside while the Ranger Regimental Commander pinned the Purple Heart to his blanket. ""During the presentation the Commander publishes the official orders verbally and leaned over Josh to thank him for his sacrifice. Josh, whom everybody in the room (over 50 people) assumed to be unconscious, began to move his right arm under the blanket in a diligent effort to salute the Commander as is customary during these ceremonies. Despite his wounds, wrappings, tubes, and pain, Josh fought the doctor who was trying to restrain his right arm and rendered the most beautiful salute any person in that room had ever seen. ""I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day. Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character. The picture, which we believe belongs on every news channel and every news paper is attached. I have it hanging above my desk now and will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army."" A military spokeswoman confirmed that Hargis was awarded the medal while hospitalized in Afghanistan. Tracy A. Bailey, a deputy public affairs officer, also confirmed the sentiment expressed by the commander in the letter. The Bravo Company commander, Bailey said, did not want to be identified. Hargis is one of 14 troops injured during a night combat operation in the Zhari district of Kandahar province, Afghanistan, on October 6. During the mission, a suspected suicide bomber detonated an explosive near the assault force. As the assault force reacted to the initial blast, they were struck by a series of explosions, killing four soldiers, including two Army Rangers. While the photo continues to circulate around social media, Hargis is recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. Bailey said Hargis was ""not in a position"" to make a statement to the media, but he did post a thank-you to supporters on his Facebook page last week. ""A huge thank you to everyone who was a part of this and is now a part of it. Only through your love and support may we overcome this difficult road ahead,"" Hargis wrote. Neither the family nor the military immediately disclosed details about his injuries. But Joshua's father, Jim Hargis, told CNN affiliate WXIX that his son lost both legs when he stepped on an improvised explosive device. A friend posted this response, which sums up most responses from people who've seen the photo: . ""So wonderful to see your post Joshua. You are so loved and so many people have been touched by you and what has happened. May you have a speedy recovery and may you know how much you are loved and wished all the best.""","Cpl.

"(CNN) -- Wrestling legend and reality TV star Hulk Hogan reveals in a new book that he would have committed suicide were it not for a surprise phone call, according to a story in the New York Daily News. Hulk Hogan says a call from co-star Laila Ali saved his life. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, credits boxer and ""Gladiators"" co-star Laila Ali with making the call that prevented him from taking his own life. In his new book ""My Life Outside the Ring,"" the former wrestler describes how he hit rock bottom after breaking up with his wife of 23 years, Linda, and coping with his son Nick's accident in which he lost control of Hogan's Toyota Supra. The accident injured his son's friend, who is now brain-damaged, and led to Nick Hogan being jailed. According to the story, the book documents Hogan's distress about his marriage ending, especially given the turmoil the family was experiencing after Nick's accident. ""I practically begged her, 'Please, don't file,' "" the Daily News story quotes the book as saying. ""Our son's just had this accident -- if we do this now, it'll make us look like the Britney Spears family. Please, don't file for divorce.'"" Hogan also says that his ex-wife is an abusive alcoholic who once threatened to beat their son with a wine bottle. Her behavior was not documented on their VH1 reality show ""Hogan Knows Best,"" he said, because ""There were plenty of times when Linda would lose it, but no one wanted to see that kind of ugliness on TV."" Hogan said Ali, the daughter of boxing great Muhammad Ali, prevented him from committing suicide after he had downed a cocktail of Xanax and rum. She called after noticing he had been looking distracted at work. Hogan said in the book that he had reached for a gun and put his finger on the trigger when Ali called.","In new book, wrestling legend and reality TV star talks about hitting rock bottom .

"New York (CNN) -- In the cutthroat world of elite New York City private schools, the college admission process can bring out the worst in people. One senior student at a prestigious private school is learning that the hard way, after someone sent a malicious letter to colleges, apparently with the intention of sabotaging that student's prospects for admission, according to school officials of Horace Mann School in Manhattan. The student named in the destructive letter was made aware of the incident, and officials at Horace Mann have been working with the student's family to investigate the nasty note, according to a letter addressed to senior students and parents that was obtained by CNN on Tuesday. Horace Mann officials are not releasing the name of the student in the letter. ""I've been in contact with deans of admission at several of the colleges in an effort to minimize the damage,"" Canh Oxelson, director of college counseling at Horace Mann, said in the letter. Students panic over online college application glitches . Oxelson was alerted to the sabotaging letter by admissions offices of numerous colleges that had received it, according to a school official. It is unclear exactly what was written in the letter in question. ""The claims made in the letter are absolutely false and while we don't know who wrote and sent the letter, an investigation is ongoing,"" Oxelson said. ""I have never witnessed anything so disrespectful,"" said Oxelson. ""For a student to have worked so hard for so many years, only to have those efforts jeopardized by an act of sabotage, is absolutely unconscionable."" Oxelson said one of the inquiries that college admissions officials had for him was whether or not the letter's author would also be applying to colleges that received the letter -- which brings into question whether the saboteur is a fellow student. ""There are positive and negative stereotypes out there about the HM community,"" Oxelson said. ""While we don't have control over everything that is said about us, we do have some ability to shape those opinions among those trying to get to know us.""

"(CNN) -- Two separate people came up with the same name in response to computer-generated sketches of a man whom London's Metropolitan Police are working to identify in possible connection with the disappearance of then-3-year-old Madeleine McCann, the case's lead investigator revealed Monday. The two people had phoned in the same name based on the sketches, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said during the BBC's ""Crimewatch"" program, which aired an appeal Monday night for information about a man police want to track down. The man was seen carrying a child matching McCann's description on the night she vanished in 2007 around the resort town of Praia da Luz in Portugal. The man is described as white, between 20 and 40 years old, with short brown hair and a medium build. He was seen carrying a blond child, who might have been in pajamas and who was estimated to be 3 to 4 years old, around the time Madeleine disappeared, police had said. The sketches are based on descriptions from separate witnesses, investigators said. Since the program aired, British police said they have received more than 300 phoned tips and 170 e-mailed ones. ""We will now take the time to follow up these lines of enquiry,"" Redwood said. Police target 38 'people of interest' in Madeleine McCann's '07 disappearance . The latest revelation is critical in reconstructing what exactly happened more than six years ago on the night of May 3, 2007,when McCann disappeared from her family's villa while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The girl was just days shy of her fourth birthday. Neither her parents nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. ""There may be an entirely innocent explanation of this man, but we need to establish who he is to assist with our inquiries,"" Redwood said earlier. Additionally, investigators believe they have a better understanding of when Madeleine may have been abducted, Redwood added. ""The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance."" John Walsh: Madeleine McCann could be alive . Police announced in July that they have identified 38 ""people of interest"" in connection with the case. Twelve of them are UK nationals who police say they think were in Portugal at the time the girl went missing. All the others are European nationals. Metropolitan Police officers have also been talking to authorities in other countries to get more information about them and their potential involvement, the statement said. Meanwhile, Madeleine's parents continue to keep hope that their daughter will be returned to them, explaining on their website: ""We still worry about her, we miss her as much as we ever did, we remain as determined as ever to find her and to know what has happened.""

"(CNN) -- Schoolchildren were home, planes were grounded and some highways were closed because of heavy smog in one of northeast China's most heavily populated areas Monday. The smog was thick enough that visibility was less than 50 meters (164 feet) in downtown Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, and it prompted authorities to close Harbin's Taiping International Airport, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. All primary and middle schools in Harbin also were closed due to the smog, which began a day earlier, according to Xinhua. Some public buses did not run in Harbin, so many people -- because they walked or sought other means of transportation -- were late to work, the news outlet reported. Video from China's state-run CCTV showed some people -- obscured by smog even just steps away -- wearing masks over their mouths as they walked in the province. Some drivers who braved the roads flashed hazard lights. The smog is forecast to continue into Tuesday, Xinhua reported.

"(EW.com) -- Late last year, news broke that The Simpsons were going to turn a decades-old spec script written by Judd Apatow into an episode. As it turns out, the A-list comedy writer-director-producer is collaborating with the animated series in front of the microphone as well. EW has learned that a different episode â€” which was already known to boast Will Arnett as a guest star â€” features the voices of Apatow, frequent collaborators Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen, plus Channing Tatum and... Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford. EW: 'The Simpsons': Daniel Radcliffe to guest . Fed up with movie theaters, Homer is taught by Bart how to illegally download films, and he starts screening them in his backyard for folks in Springfield. ""Even though Homer is stealing, he's doing it for the community, he's doing it out of the goodness of his heart,"" says executive producer Matt Selman. Alas, an overzealous FBI director in charge of anti-piracy (Arnett) doesn't quite see it that way and sets his sights on Homer. How do our celebrity guests fit into the plot? One of the movies that Homer shows is a This is 40-esque Apatow dramedy titled Life is Funny that stars Mann and Rudd, who joined forces in Knocked Up and This is 40. Halford winds up singing a parody of the Judas Priest classic ""Breaking The Law"" in an effort to nab Homer, while Apatow testifies against our patriarch ""with a hilarious, self-important speech about Hollywood people,"" says Selman.

"(CNN) -- Another week has passed for the world's most popular sport. Another week of brawls, scandal and allegations of racist abuse which has left the football's lawmakers grappling as to how best to tackle discrimination. On Tuesday, England's Under-21 match with Serbia was overshadowed by ugly fighting and alleged racist chants directed at Danny Rose, an incident that led to calls from leading figures within the English game to ban the Balkan country from international football. Not that England could in any way claim the higher moral ground as two days later former England captain John Terry decided against appealing his four-match ban and $356,000 fine for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. That punishment raised questions about the even handedness of the English Football Assocation given Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches and fined $64,000 for comments he made to Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011. Back in Switzerland on Thursday, European governing body UEFA decided to hand Lazio a $52,000 fine for racist chanting by their fans during a match with Tottenham Hotspur. It is against this backdrop of abuse, bans and fines that Reading striker Jason Roberts launched his own protest against what he perceives to be a lack of action by anti-racism group Kick It Out. On Saturday, before Reading's match with Liverpool, the Grenadian striker will refuse to wear a t-shirt displaying the logo of the anti-racism organization. With the English seemingly fissuring over how best to tackle racism, former English Premier League striker Vincent Pericard questioned Roberts' boycott and called for a united front in the continued fight against discrimination. ""If we are going to fight racism, we can only do it by being united,"" said Pericard, who played in England's top flight for Portsmouth having previously playing Italy and France. ""Having different parties will only give more power to the racists, which isn't what we want to achieve."" It is rumored other black players may follow Roberts' lead, while Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Aston Villa confirmed their players will wear the t-shirts. ""I know that just wearing a t-shirt is not going to make a difference, without action nothing is going to happen,"" continued Pericard. ""So I can agree with Jason Roberts, but one solution suggested by the Kick It Out chairman Herman Ouseley is for them to have more independence and more power, so they can have a bigger say. ""It is unfortunate we have had two very high-profile incidents,"" added Pericard, referring to the cases involving Terry and Suarez, ""but I can speak from my own experience -- England is winning the battle against racism."" Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been unwavering in his support of his younger brother Anton, but his manager Alex Ferguson questioned Roberts' planned action. ""I have to disagree with Jason Roberts. I think he is making the wrong point,"" said the Scottish coach. ""Everyone should be united, with all the players in the country wearing the Kick It Out warm-up tops. ""I don't know what point he is trying to make.

""When you do something, and everyone believes in it, you should all do it together. There shouldn't be sheep wandering off. I think he is making the wrong message. All the players are wearing it.""

""We have seen firsthand the amount of work they are doing behind the scenes at the moment,"" continued the 30-year-old, who runs a company which aims to help integrate foreign players who move to England. ""They are listening to what is being said by different black players and I can guarantee a lot is being doing done at the moment,"" added Pericard, who retired earlier this year after a playing career which included spells with Juventus and Stoke City. ""They promote education, mentoring, inclusion and equality across different cultures. I have been talking to them about improving the integration of foreign players into a country and providing them a level of support.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A man who set himself on fire at the National Mall has died from his injuries, police said Saturday. Authorities haven't been able to identify him due to the extent of his injuries, so they will conduct DNA tests and use dental records, said Officer Araz Alali, spokesman for D.C. Metropolitan police. The man was taken to a hospital Friday night after officers rushed to the scene and found the man engulfed in flames. Alali said authorities are trying to figure why the man self-immolated. Adam Stifel saw part of the incident while he was jogging. ""I saw a man sitting in flames,"" Stifel told CNN. ""He had already doused himself in gasoline, I believe."" Stifel said five or six people used their shirts to pat out the fire. He said he saw a red gasoline canister near the man. The incident occurred near the National Air and Space Museum. The location where the man was found on fire is about six blocks from the U.S. Capitol, where a high speed car chase on Thursday ended with a woman being shot and killed by law enforcement officers.

"(CNN) -- A battle is raging in the nation's capital over who should be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. As President Obama considers his choices, all sides are pushing their candidates. The two main contenders to replace outgoing chairman Ben Bernanke are the current vice chairwoman of the Fed, Janet Yellen, and Larry Summers, an economics adviser to President Obama, former Treasury secretary and president of Harvard University. Summers' acerbic and dismissive intellectual style, his support of bank deregulation (he was a key leader in the Clinton administration's team that worked with Congress to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law separating investment banking from institutions with federally insured deposits), his fight against regulating financial derivatives (a major source of the financial crisis) and his successful advocacy with Congress to allow higher executive pay and bonuses for financial executives whose firms received billions in federal bailouts during the financial crisis all feed the opposition, who believe that Yellen is perfectly well qualified to lead the Federal Reserve. Although many people don't know it, the Federal Reserve doesn't just regulate the money supply -- it is also a principal regulator of America's largest banks. It's not so much that Yellen is a far superior candidate -- after all, she and Summers are on the same page when it comes to monetary policy. There is little indication from her record about what kind of approach she would take on regulation. But compared with Summers, she cannot be worse. The real issue is: Given Summers' track record, could he be a tough regulator? Supporters of Summers say he can be tough. But evidence from his days in government and on Wall Street suggest otherwise. Summers has advocated for limited regulation throughout his career. In September 2000, while he was the Treasury secretary, he said that the role of financial regulation was to find policies that ""help to expand the size of (financial) markets. ... Deregulation becomes that much more important, to ensure that government is not preventing or distorting the development of fast-growing markets."" He also told the Securities Industry Association that ""it is the private sector, not the public sector, that is in the best position to provide effective supervision. ... In the past few years, the private sector has risen to meet the challenges ... and we have seen significant self-correction."" A decade later, at a conference in 2011, Summers showed no second thoughts on his previous deregulatory policies, arguing that the financial crisis was not caused by ""new-fangled financial instruments,"" including the derivatives that he fought to protect from regulation in the late 1990s. When it comes to Wall Street, Summers said he obtained insights based partly on working part-time for the hedge fund D.E. Shaw and Company where he earned over $5 million in just one year. Summers said the experience gave him ""a better sense of how market participants sort of think and react to things from sort of listening to the conversations and listening to the way the traders at D. E. Shaw thought."" According to former colleagues at D.E. Shaw, Summers was directly involved in sales, including sales of what turned out to be highly overvalued mortgage-backed securities to Asian sovereign wealth funds, the kind of securities that were deeply implicated in the financial meltdown. He was also a ""prized spokesman"" for D.E. Shaw, ""routinely made himself available for private consultations"" with prospective and existing clients, and met with investors from the U.S. and abroad. One young female quant who worked with him had this to say on her blog, ""But when I think about that last project I was working on, I still get kind of sick to my stomach. It was essentially, and I need to be vague here, a way of collecting dumb money from pension funds. There's no real way to make that moral, or even morally neutral."" By ""dumb money,"" she is referring to the fact that investors, including those who manage public pension funds, routinely buy certain types of secure assets on a regular schedule or in other predictable patterns. Hedge funds like D.E. Shaw take advantage of that predictable behavior by selling these assets to investors for a slightly higher price. Because of the huge dollar value and volume of these investments, such strategies can make hundreds of millions of dollars for hedge funds. Now, Summers has defenders. Michael Barr, a strong advocate of financial regulation who worked for Summers at the Treasury as assistant secretary for financial institutions said, ""I wouldn't have gone to work for Larry if he didn't believe in financial regulation."" But arguing that Summers' multi-million dollar sales work for a hedge fund somehow adds to his qualifications for the Fed chairman job is ludicrous. He was working for and dressing up the work of financial professionals selling high-priced investment products made even more expensive by the exorbitant fees charged by hedge funds. Moreover, hedge fund investments often are inferior for investors. In 2012, an investor would have done much better by simply buying the S&P 500 index instead of a hedge fund. To convince investors to pay their high fees, hedge funds do a lot of active selling and cozying up to money managers. Summers was part of this public relations strategy -- a glittering ornament to lure in investors. There's nothing illegal in all of this. But there's also nothing in Summers' experience to suggest that he would be a tough regulator. His supporters include people like Robert Rubin, former chairman of Citibank and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Timothy Geithner, who as president of the New York Federal Reserve and later Treasury secretary, refused to take a tough line on bank regulation. Think they are pushing Summers because he'd be a tough regulator? Think again. America needs a Fed leader who will protect small businesses, ordinary investors, and the economy from misbehavior by big banks and financial corporations. We need a fierce regulatory watchdog, not a lapdog of the banks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick McGahey.","Larry Summers is a top contender for the job of chairman of the Federal Reserve .

"(CNN) -- As a teenager, it's easy to feel lost, to get swallowed up into the mob mentality and lose your voice. We've all been victim to that; anyone who says they haven't is either lying or under the age of 13 years. And so when a teenage girl undertakes such an incredible task of courage, one adults cower in fear of doing, the event takes on utmost significance. This is exactly what Malala Yousafzai, a huge inspiration to me and so many other girls, did. Malala stood up for herself, for her education and for her fundamental rights when confronted by a fearsome terrorist group. Malala has created a chain reaction all around the world, bringing change, light and hope to girls across all continents. Being teenage girls in the United States, so many times, we forget the opportunities we have been given. We roll our eyes and joke about dropping out of school, a right we take for granted in this country. I don't know if I speak for all girls when I say this, but I know for me that after hearing about Malala's fight for education, I cannot take mine so lightly any longer. I plan to continue my education so that I can fight for those who cannot. Malala has inspired me to study politics, gender studies, social justice and peace so that I am equipped with the tools I need to help others, the tools so many girls are not given. Malala wins Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought . But Malala has inspired more than just my own education; she has inspired my entire outlook and goals. After I first learned of Malala, I couldn't stop thinking about her. Yes, I was more serious about my education and understood its importance now, but I wanted to become an activist and do something. I became co-president of my school's club School Girls Unite, a group that sponsors the education of 66 girls in Mali and lobbies Congress annually to increase foreign aid for education. I also became involved with the International Day of the Girl Child as the Day of the Girl U.S. youth outreach coordinator so I could speak to more girls about issues like education. I have heard some people say that Malala is a mere poster child for Western ideals of education, but that could not be further from the truth; Malala is the hero who created the domino effect of change, bringing attention and empowering girls and boys alike to act on this issue. Malala: Accolades, applause and a grim milestone . It may sound corny, but I assure you that it is true: I believe that Malala has changed the course of my life, and I only hope that through activism around the world, other girls will have their lives changed as well. Thank you, Malala. Thank you for your bravery, your passion and your heroism. You inspire me and so many other girls so much, and what you do is incredible. You go, girl!

"(CNN) -- Explosions targeting a passenger train carrying hundreds of passengers traveling after Eid holidays killed at least seven passengers and wounded 16 others in Pakistan's southern Balochistan province on Monday, authorities said. Three improvised explosive devices went off in a coordinated manner as the train approached an area in the Naseerabad district of the province, said Muhammad Azhar, a local police official. The train, the Jaffar Express, had come from Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab, Azhar said. The explosions damaged the train and the rail tracks, he said, and authorities suspended the train service after the attack. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. Baloch separatists have been targeting security forces and infrastructure in the region for more than a decade.","Three explosive devices explode around a passenger train in Balochistan .

"(CNN) -- A common view is that U.S. politics have gone into shutdown, that the whole system can no longer function and deliver the kind of government that Americans want and need. That's certainly the opinion in my native Britain, where I'm regularly told the United States -- particularly the Republican Party -- has been gripped by a kind of madness. I can't agree. The current crisis is certainly traumatic for those involved and bodes badly for the next round of debt ceiling negotiations. But it's not historically unique or a symbol of conservative insanity. First of all America has gone through shutdowns before. Andrew Stiles notes in National Review that the U.S government has shut down 17 times since 1976. The vast majority of those shutdowns happened when the Democrats controlled the House. They happened under Jimmy Carter over abortion policy (remember when that divided the Democrats?) and under Ronald Reagan, mostly about budget priorities -- including efforts to nix Reagan's pet projects (sound familiar?). During the 21-day face-off between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, unemployment fell slightly and America emerged with a welfare reform deal. Not too bad. Those shutdowns remind us that U.S. politics have always been partisan and rancorous -- as the two-party system was established with the intention of being. Honest, heated debate is part of being a democratic nation. Before the 1960s, progressive legislation in the House was constantly stonewalled by coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans -- a bloc that it took a civil rights revolution to undo. In the 1940s, Harry Truman found his legislation blocked by a ""do-nothing"" Congress of Republicans (although that Congress still got a lot done). Of course, in the 19th century, partisan divisions reflected the battle lines of a bloody civil war. Abraham Lincoln's superhuman effort to get a ban on slavery through Congress testifies to the timelessness of the battle between executive and legislature. And Congress in recent decades has rarely been popular. True, today a shockingly low 10% of the population approves of its performance. But its rating never exceeded 40% throughout the 1970s and 1980s and sunk to 20% in 1979 and 1992. Today, no one is denying that we find ourselves in an almighty mess with the potential for disaster as the clock ticks toward default. But there's logic to the arguments of everyone involved. Barack Obama and the Senate Democrats refuse to give up on Obamacare, especially since the president's re-election. John Boehner is indeed being held hostage by members of his Republican caucus, but those tea partiers have a right to argue that the polls show Obamacare is unpopular, that they have evidence it will threaten the economic recovery, that they can use their sway in the House to say how the money should be spent, and that they are pursuing a valid constitutional strategy to get what they want. The polls also show that the shutdown is bad politics, and that the public blames the GOP for it. But would we rather the House do exactly as the president tells it to and not follow its conscience on the vital subjects of health care and finance? America is not Britain, where a party's control of one aspect of government (the House of Commons) effectively guarantees control over the entire system. The American way has the potential for divided government built into it, precisely because its founders wanted to protect against the growth of the state and to keep it in check by making it hard to pursue utopian manifestoes through to their glorious end. Passing lots of laws and spending lots of money ought to be a difficult, complex business. But for anyone dreaming of a government so hamstrung that it can't do anything at all, I have some sad news to impart. The Internal Revenue Service has stopped sending out refunds but is still collecting money. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Tuesday announced a troop deployment shift for America's two wars, a move that reflects a more stable Iraq and an increasingly volatile Afghanistan. President Bush said Tuesday that he soon will start bringing some U.S. troops home from Iraq. Through early next year, about 8,000 American troops will leave Iraq and not be replaced. Some 4,500 other U.S. service members will go to Afghanistan. Bush also emphasized the U.S. intention to help Pakistan defeat insurgents who are using the country's tribal areas to stage attacks in Afghanistan. ""Iraq, Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan pose unique challenges for our country,"" Bush said Tuesday in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington. ""Yet they are all theaters in the same overall struggle."" Bush said he is making the Iraqi troop withdrawal decision based on a recommendation from top military officers, including Gen. David Petraeus, the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in Iraq.  Watch Bush announce the troop reduction in Iraq » . ""He and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended that we move forward with additional force reductions,"" the president said, citing military and political strides in stabilizing the country and dramatically bringing down violence. Bush adopted the entire recommendation from Petraeus, a senior military official in Iraq told CNN. The source said five people saw the plan before it went to the president. Debate the Iraq issue! Join The Forum . In explaining progress in the war effort, Bush cited the ""surge"" offensive, winning the hearts and minds of Sunni tribes, Iraqi political reconciliation efforts, economic improvements, an improved Iraqi army leading the fight against Shiite and Sunni insurgents, and a return of hundreds of doctors who fled the fighting. ""Over the next several months, we will bring home about 3,400 combat support forces -- including aviation personnel, explosive ordnance teams, combat and construction engineers, military police and logistical support forces,"" he said. ""By November, we will bring home a Marine battalion that is now serving in Anbar province. And in February of 2009, another Army combat brigade will come home. ""This amounts to about 8,000 additional American troops returning home without replacement. And if the progress in Iraq continues to hold, Gen. Petraeus and our military leaders believe additional reductions will be possible in the first half of 2009."" At present, there are about 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. An adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki welcomed Bush's decision. ""We look at this step as a positive step that there is stability in Iraq, there is a real improvement in the security situation in Iraq and there is a real improvement in the capability of the Iraqi security forces in protecting and keeping the security in Iraq,"" said Sadiq al-Rikabi, al-Maliki's political adviser. Democrats were less than enthusiastic about Bush's announcement. The plan ""may seem to signal movement in the right direction,"" but it ""defers troop reductions until the next administration,"" said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ""More significant troop reductions in Iraq are needed so that we can start to rebuild U.S. military readiness and provide the additional forces needed to finish the fight in Afghanistan."" Skelton said Iraq ""cannot continue to overshadow other critical U.S. security needs."" ""The effort in Afghanistan must move to the forefront and once again become our top priority,"" he said. Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama praised Bush for announcing additional troops for Afghanistan and ""moving in the direction of the policy that I have advocated for years."" However, ""we will continue to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a $79 billion surplus,"" Obama said. ""In the absence of a timetable to remove our combat brigades, we will continue to give Iraq's leaders a blank check instead of pressing them to reconcile their differences,"" he said. Obama criticized the timing and scope of Bush's move. ""His plan comes up short -- it is not enough troops, and not enough resources, with not enough urgency,"" the senator from Illinois said of Bush's call for more troops in Afghanistan. In his speech, Bush praised other members of the U.S.-led coalition, saying many of those nations will be able to end their deployments to Iraq this year. He said Australia has ""withdrawn its battle group"" and Polish troops are ""set to redeploy shortly."" The president said Iraq and the United States will work ""toward the conclusion of a strategic framework agreement and a status of forces agreement,"" pacts that will spell out the terms of their relationship. ""These agreements will serve as the foundation for America's continued security support to Iraq once the United Nations resolution authorizing the multinational forces there expires on December 31."" Bush focused his remarks just as strongly on Afghanistan, where al Qaeda and Taliban militants have been making a comeback. ""For all the good work we have done in that country, it is clear we must do even more,"" he said. ""As we learned in Iraq, the best way to restore the confidence of the people is to restore basic security -- and that requires more troops."" He said that a Marine battalion of around 1,000 will deploy to Afghanistan in November instead of Iraq and that an Army combat brigade of around 3,500 will go in January. Bush said the U.S. would make additional forces available in 2009 and called on allies to increase their force levels. Bush said stepped-up insurgent efforts in Afghanistan have necessitated the increase of U.S. troops from ""less than 21,000 two years ago to nearly 31,000 today."" He said these troop increases and those by allies, including Britain, France, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Australia, Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic, have resulted in what he calls a ""quiet surge"" in Afghanistan. Bush described challenges in Afghanistan that don't exist in Iraq. ""This is a vast country,"" he said. ""Unlike Iraq, it has few natural resources and has an underdeveloped infrastructure. Its democratic institutions are fragile. And its enemies are some of the most hardened terrorists and extremists in the world."" He said Americans will help develop Afghan security forces and are improving efforts on the civilian side, adding more personnel to deal with issues of diplomacy, development, the rural economy and the fight against the drug trade.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- The coming winter is likely to bring a new drought to parts of the Southeast and little relief for the long-parched Southwest, federal forecasters reported Thursday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's seasonal outlook predicts below-average precipitation in those regions, while the northern Rocky Mountains will see more snow and Hawaii more rain than usual. Large portions of the Southwest and the Plains states have been dealing with a three-year drought that has begun to ease only in the past few months. Texas Gov. Rick Perry extended a drought emergency proclamation at the beginning of November, citing threats to aquifers and reservoirs and an increased risk of wildfires across all but 10 of the state's 254 counties. New England, the Southwest, south-central states and parts of the Southeast are expected to have a warmer-than-average winter, while the northern Plains will be colder than normal, NOAA reported. Alaska's Panhandle will be colder and drier than average, while western Alaska will be warmer than usual, it said. NOAA said the winter isn't expected to be influenced by either an El Nino or La Nina, the oscillating Pacific Ocean climate patterns driven by sea surface temperatures. El Nino years result in a warmer eastern Pacific, wetter winters and drier summers, while a La Nina typically has the reverse effect. ""Without this strong seasonal influence, winter weather is often affected by short-term climate patterns, such as the Arctic Oscillation, that are not predictable beyond a week or two,"" Mike Halpert, acting director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, said in a statement accompanying the forecast. ""So it's important to pay attention to your local daily weather forecast throughout the winter."" Winter officially begins December 21.","Dry winter seen for U.S. Southeast, Southwest .

"(CNN) -- The immediate future of the ATP Tour's showpiece event was confirmed on Wednesday, and that news was quickly followed by proof that men's tennis has another classic rivalry to savor. Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray are longtime friends, but their on-court clashes are showing all the hallmarks of following Federer-Nadal, Borg-McEnroe, Sampras-Agassi and Edberg-Becker in the annals of modern greats. Murray may have had the better of their meetings at the Olympics and the U.S. Open, but Djokovic hit back in Shanghai and now the Serbian has a 9-7 career advantage after another tight tussle in London. The UK capital's hosting of the ATP World Tour Finals has been confirmed for the next three years, ending fears that it would move because of top players' unhappiness over the country's tax laws for top earners. Murray and Djokovic make winning starts at ATP finals . Djokovic won the season-ending tournament in 2008, its last year in Shanghai, but has not reached the final since. Last year he didn't even make it out of the group stage, fading with fatigue after a breakthrough 12 months that he ended as world No. 1, but Wednesday's 4-6 6-3 7-5 win in more than two and half hours was his second in a row this week. It was a match that see-sawed either way, leaving world No. 3 Murray needing to win his third and final match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Friday if he is to progress in the elite eight-man event. Tsonga also has a win and a loss after being beaten 7-5 3-6 6-1 by Tomas Berdych in Wednesday's late match. ""It was another great match, another great performance from both of us. I hope that people who watched it agree with my opinion,"" said Djokovic, who plays his final match against sixth-ranked Czech Berdych. ""I didn't expect anything less other than a tough match that went down the wire and was decided on the last point."" It was the sort of match that has helped bring in 250,000 people each year to London's O2 Arena. ""This week we look forward to welcoming our one millionth fan through the gates since 2009,"" ATP Tour chief executive Brad Drewett said after announcing the extension of the tournament's sponsorship deal with banking group Barclays. ""We thank every one of these passionate tennis fans for helping to create the electrifying atmosphere at The O2, which has offered a spectacular stage for our biggest event."" While the tournament, which attracted a television audience of 70 million viewers in 184 countries last year, does not have the prestige of the sport's four grand slams, the stakes are high -- the prize purse increased to $5.5 million this year and will climb to $6.5 million by 2014. Murray cut a forlorn figure last year when he pulled out after his opening match due to injury, but this season he has won his first grand slam under the tutelage of Ivan Lendl -- a five-time winner of the ATP showpiece. ""In about the last two minutes of the match probably is what decided it,"" the Scot said of his latest clash with Djokovic. ""He broke from 15-40 and then I had 15-40 in the next game and didn't break. ""I think both of us probably see each other's games pretty well. Especially this year, because we've played so much. You kind of know a little bit what to expect. ""I think that's why all the matches, especially the last few, have been so close and decided by a few points. The intensity of my matches with him have been extremely high this year. ""I think both of us probably have seen things in each other's games improve and that's why there's a lot of long rallies and the matches are incredibly tight."" They both have some way to go before matching Roger Federer, who has won the tournament a record six times and on Wednesday was named the ATP Tour's most popular player by fans for the 10th year in a row. The 31-year-old, who conceded the year-end No.1 ranking to Djokovic when he decided against defending his Paris title last week, also won the ATP's top sportsmanship award -- voted for by his peers -- for the eighth time in his career. ""We have great matches all over the world, and the recognition is a great feeling. We're trying to inspire the next generation,"" said the 17-time grand slam champion, who beat Janko Tipsarevic in his opening round-robin match on Tuesday.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic beats third-ranked Andy Murray at ATP World Tour Finals .

"Calvert County, Maryland (CNN) -- Getting out of her car, the wife of a furloughed government worker walked toward a small building full of free food. She approached the door with her head down. An attendant asked for her name, she looked up and began to sob. ""It's ok, it's not your fault,"" the volunteer said as she wrapped her arms around the crying woman. Chesapeake Cares Food Pantry, located 30 miles from the political impasse in Washington that resulted in the shutdown, put together a food giveaway tailored to affected workers not at their jobs and not being paid. Roughly 200 people received bags of frozen meat, canned vegetables and other staples on Monday morning. ""These folks (furloughed government employees) don't know how to be poor,"" said Rev. Robert Hahn, the head End Hunger in Calvert County, a consortium of food pantries in the area. ""These folks are fish out of water and they feel humiliated, like they have lost their dignity."" This is the second offering Hahn's group has made to federal employees. Last week, the group passed out 2,700 pounds of food to 71 different families. And if the government shutdown continues, Hahn said he anticipates his group will continue this sort of offering. The shutdown that began on October 1 has impacted hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors in the Washington region, including people at the epicenter of the partisan shutdown showdown in Congress. Washington-area food banks have responded to an unexpected need this fall created by the shutdown, their efforts already tested by a continued, uneven economic recovery and tough job market. Men and women were on both sides of the help on Monday in Calvert County -- those receiving and those distributing food. Those helping out included one person who works for the Department of Justice and another employed by the Navy. CNN agreed not to identify furloughed workers receiving food due to a combination of their embarrassment and not wanting to hurt their employer. ""Getting paid helps, but it doesn't help right now,"" said one, who acknowledged she'll probably get paid once the shutdown ends. Still, the woman said she is struggling to put food on the table. Some told CNN they were living paycheck to paycheck. ""The biggest thing (people are feeling) is fear,"" said Hahn. ""Even a lot of federal employees who know that they're going to get their checks made up, they're still going to be shy"" if they miss a couple of pay periods. President Barack Obama visited a food pantry in downtown Washington on Monday where he helped make peanut butter sandwiches. He told reporters that he stopped by Martha's Table because many of volunteers there had been furloughed. ""They're here contributing and giving back to the community and I think that shows the kind of spirit that we have among all kinds of federal workers all across the country, people who dedicate their lives to public service,"" Obama said. Hahn, who has worked for Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said many of the men and women he saw collect food on Monday were new faces who had never sought their help in the past. While a study by Main Street showed that Calvert County was the 13th wealthiest county in the United States in 2012, Hahn said that ranking doesn't show how many ""working poor"" live in the area. ""It's a damn shame,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told CNN. ""It's no fault of their own, but they find themselves now in a position of, of having to come here for help."" O'Malley, who attended the event, said he would recommend that ""those who for ideological reasons feel shutting down our government is a good idea"" should ""come here and see the families that are showing up for help to feed their families for the first time in their lives."" As volunteers passed out food, there was obvious frustration with political leaders in Washington. Those in line lamented the fact they were expected to just go without pay. Hahn said he had more important things to do than worry about how things will shake out on Capitol Hill. ""I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems,"" Hahn said. ""We are here solving problems.""

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut woman who rammed barricades and led police on a chase near the U.S. Capitol last week was carrying a box that contained her driver's license, passport, Social Security card and foreign currency. The gray lockbox was found inside Miriam Carey's 2010 Infiniti sedan, according to court documents filed Tuesday. Carey, 34, died after police shot her following a wild chase. Her 1-year-old daughter, who was in the back seat, was uninjured. Who was Miriam Carey? Authorities also found in the lockbox hospital discharge documents, keys, a lease agreement, various mail documents and a check for Carey in the amount of almost $1,800. The foreign currency, both paper and coins, was inside a plastic Ziploc bag. The documents didn't specify where the money was from. The discovery was the latest twist in a story that started Thursday. The incident played out in one of the most heavily policed places in the world, temporarily locked down Congress and sparked anxiety among tourists and staffers alike. No clarity on whether shooting was justified . Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. Two law enforcement officers were injured. An officer attempted to block her car with a bicycle rack, but Carey pushed over the rack, knocking the officer to the ground, according to the documents filed Tuesday. She entered a traffic circle against the flow of traffic, and had been driving in reverse when she was fatally shot. 'My sister just totally didn't deserve this' Carey's boyfriend reportedly told police last winter that she appeared to be delusional. The boyfriend said she claimed President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where she lived, under lockdown and that her house was under electronic surveillance, said a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not authorized to release details to the media. Reports have surfaced following the deadly incident that Carey was being treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, claims her family has vehemently denied. Her family has questioned whether shooting Carey was the only way to end the chase. ""We want to know if protocols were followed,"" family attorney Eric Sanders said last week on CNN's AC360. ""We are interested in finding out what happened. ...We are going to conduct our investigation, and we are not going to go with just what the government said."" Police Chief Lanier has said that officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Secret Service acted within commonly accepted use-of-force policies and practices in reaction to an intentional series of violent acts. Mental health paperwork found at home of Miriam Carey .","Authorities find hospital discharge documents, a check, in Miriam Carey's car .

"Washington (CNN) -- For more than a week into a government shutdown, Paul Ryan kept a low profile amid the political uproar. When he finally emerged, the time was ripe for someone with his conservative cred and fiscal bona fides to step in and try to corral his bucking Republican Party. While a group of conservatives were driving the agenda in the quagmire over spending, Obamacare and the looming debt limit, Ryan dropped an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal outlining the Republican path forward. Yes, he did stir up divisions between tea party conservatives and establishment GOP lawmakers, but he also enabled party leaders to grab the reins and regain control of their caucus. Prologue: Ryan's strategy . To remain silent. In new book, Paul Ryan asks 'where do we go from here?' As Texas Sen. Ted Cruz staged a public fight over defunding President Barack Obama's signature health care law, which led to the shutdown, Ryan tread lightly. For instance, CNN has asked every member of Congress if he or she would support a government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached -- something Obama and Democrats are demanding. Ryan's office chose not to comment. His recent reticence was more noticeable because the issues front and center now fell into his wheelhouse. Cue Paul Ryan. Act I: The adult in the room . Ryan Williams, former spokesman for 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said that Ryan speaks about issues when necessary. ""He intends to be the adult in the room when needed,"" Williams said. ""He felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we're witnessing in Washington."" Supporters stand by representatives, and government shutdown . A source told CNN this was the plan all along. Ryan thought the better issue to demand concessions from the president was around the debt ceiling and that he'd play a larger role in that debate. Ryan's low profile, however, was evident on Thursday when Republicans emerged from a conference to announce what they planned to take to the White House. As nearly a dozen House leaders approached the microphone to announce a deal, Ryan refrained from speaking. He stood in the background, barely in the frame of the television cameras. Act II: Ryan's backlash . Ryan, who was previously considered the conservative knight in shining armor for his fiscal policies, took a beating from the home team when he released his op-ed urging the terms of negotiations revolve around the deficit and entitlement programs. Lisa Miller, Founder of the Washington-based Tea Party WDC, told CNN that she is skeptical of Ryan's plan. ""Paul Ryan is a numbers guy; I just don't like his numbers,"" Miller said. And a spokeswoman for Cruz noticed something else that irritated conservatives. ""There is one big work missing from this op-ed. It's start with an O and ends with BAMACARE,"" she tweeted. Ryan was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda. Ryan responds to criticism over op-ed . Appearing on conservative talk show ""Bill Bennett's Morning in America,"" Bennett asked Ryan if dismantling Obamacare was no longer a priority. Ryan insisted that it still was. ""Obamacare's an entitlement just like any other entitlement,"" Ryan said, according to Politico. ""If you look at the op-ed, I say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation's health care laws."" Act III: Ryan's defense . But Ryan has some support on this matter. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus echoed Ryan's defense, and said the op-ed included ""OBAMACARE,"" even though it didn't specifically mention it. And Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called Ryan's proposal a ""must read."" Act IV: Ryan's impact . One day later, however, Ryan's timely action has proved significant. Republican leadership has now effectively transitioned GOP negotiation demands away from health care. Republican leadership said the proposal they are bringing to Obama is a discussion on ""an array of issues."" Missing from the proposal were the words ""health care"" or ""Obamacare."" Opinion: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy . The subtle omission is significant because the parameters of the debate have dramatically changed. Dismantling the health care law is a top priority among a core group of conservative lawmakers. The demand to defund Obamacare resulted in the government shutdown, despite reluctance from Republican leadership to back their plan, knowing that the president and Democratic Senate would never agree to that. Epilogue: Ryan's future . Ultimately, his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot. As a young politician with a bright future, speculation is rampant that he might be running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. That speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first presidential nominating states. He will keynote a birthday fundraiser for Iowa's Republican governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in New Hampshire. Ryan stood back while Cruz, another potential 2016 hopeful, pushed the Republican Party into a difficult position. With some experience on his side having served in Congress for 15 years and running on a presidential ticket, Ryan understands the risk of speaking too often and too soon. It creates more opportunity to mess up. CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.","After keeping a low-profile, Paul Ryan emerges with key role in Washington's standoff .
His op-ed on a path forward first generated a conservative backlash .
But his timely emergence has proven effective .

"(CNN) -- Can your credit card buy you a second-hand memory? Is it possible to purchase the warmth of recollection in a cash transaction? Apparently a lot of people think so. According to Richard Sandomir of The New York Times, former New York Yankee Chris Chambliss recently decided he would endeavor to sell the bat he swung and the ball he hit to win the 1976 American League Championship Series. Sell them he did. For $121,874. And Mike Eruzione, captain of the 1980 ""Do you believe in miracles?"" U.S. Olympic hockey team, decided to find out how much the uniform he wore in the defeat of the Soviet team would bring. He found out, all right: $657,250. There seems to be a growth market in the items found in the closets and storage lockers of retired big-name athletes. For many of them, it makes perfect sense to cash in on the old uniforms, gloves, balls, bats, gym shoes and cleats. The allure of all that scuffed and fraying stuff shines brighter to strangers, and the athletes, as the years pass, have families with their own financial needs. But three names in Sandomir's story jumped out, because each of the three athletes proved to me, a long time ago, that the finest memories are free. Bill Mazeroski, the second baseman for the Pittsburgh Pirates who won the World Series against the Yankees in 1960 with a thrilling home run, is selling his old gear at an auction next month. The family of the late golfer Sam Snead sold the claret jug he won at the 1946 British Open for $262,900. Bob Cousy, the great guard for the Boston Celtics, sold just about all the uniforms and memorabilia in his basement for around $320,000, which he gave to his two daughters: ""That was a much greater priority than hanging on to it."" Maybe the people forking over their money for the sweat-stained clothes will find a lasting connection through their ownership. Yet as soon as I saw Mazeroski's name, I thought about a long-ago afternoon when he gave a buddy and me something beyond price: his time. When my best friend Jack Roth and I were 12 years old and crazy about sports, we hatched a plan. Any time there was a big sports awards dinner in our Ohio town -- one of those events that would bring in famous athletes as draws -- we would meet at one of our houses and go to two separate telephones. We'd call the hotel where we knew the event was being held, and we'd lower our voices a few octaves and ask for the room of the sports star we dreamed of talking to. Sometimes it worked; sometimes it didn't. And sometimes, even when we got through, the athlete would decline to talk with us. We even loved those moments -- at least we'd been able to briefly hear the voice of the famous quarterback or center fielder, even if all he was saying was ""No."" When an athlete would agree to talk with us, though -- we said we wanted to do a sports interview, but were a bit vague in specifying that our only outlet was a little self-produced mimeographed newspaper -- it was something we sensed, even at the time, that we would never forget. And we never did. Jack died nine years ago, and in his final months we reminisced about those afternoons, and about our gratitude for the athletes who had given us those memories. Bill Mazeroski and Sam Snead were two of them who were the most generous with us; sure, they may have just been killing time in the hours before they had to go down to the banquet room, but they shared a little of that time with us. We didn't own a tape recorder -- Jack would hold one receiver of those big old rotary-dial phones, and I would do the same on another extension in the house, and we would trade off questions and take notes -- and I'm glad that we didn't have tapes, because if we had, the tapes might have replaced the memories, the tapes might have become cold stand-ins. (I don't need a tape to recall, with a smile, what one celebrated ballplayer told us after we asked him our standard final wrap-up question: ""What is your advice for young athletes?"" His reply: ""Keep them grades up."") And Bob Cousy? He never came to our town, as far as I knew. But some of us, as kids, would, just about every day, send an envelope to one famous professional athlete or another in big-league cities. Inside each envelope was a pre-stamped, self-addressed postcard. We would hope that, before or after a game, the athlete, opening his fan mail in the locker room, would see our postcard, sign his name on it and drop it in a mailbox. It was like playing the lottery. You never knew. One day, when the mail carrier arrived at my parents' home, there it was: the postcard I had sent to Bob Cousy in care of the far-off Boston Garden, now bearing his signature, with a personal inscription to me above it. It was just such a great day. Decades later, when I would get to know Cousy, and I would run into him from time to time, I would always remind him of that story, and would always thank him anew. Being a gracious man, he would smile and say it was nothing. It wasn't nothing. It was everything. I hope that the people who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in pursuit of memories of their sports heroes will feel that they got their money's worth. But the best memories in life, the most enduring, are nontransferable, and never for sale. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Big-name athletes are cashing in on old uniforms and balls to the tune of a lot of money .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray is set to step up his rehabilitation program by returning to practice next month. The World No.4 underwent back surgery in September following a longstanding injury and was forced to pull out of the end of season ATP World Finals in London. ""Rehab is going to plan and he's aiming to be in Miami in mid-November,"" Murray's spokesman told CNN. Murray is currently planning to play in an exhibition tournament in Barbados at the end of November before making a competitive return at the ATP 250 event in Brisbane in December. The two-time grand slam winner has suffered with back injuries throughout his career and was forced to withdraw from this year's French Open in May before going on to triumph at Wimbledon. Murray's failure to compete at Roland Garros was the first time he had withdrawn from a grand slam tournament since 2007 where a wrist injury prevented him from playing in the French capital. Last month he failed in the defense of his U.S. Open title, losing out to Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka at the quarterfinals stage in straight sets. He will hope to return to grand slam action in Australia next January before playing for Great Britain in its Davis Cup tie with the U.S. the following month.","Andy Murray set to return to practice in Miami next month .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The last four years of economic sanctions by the U.S., the European Union and other western partners have ground down the Iranian economy. At this time last year, the Iranian rial had plummeted 80% from its peak, inflation had shot up, poultry and bread were in short supply and there were numerous reports of layoffs in the state manufacturing sector. But the most glaring example of the pain exerted has to be in the energy sector. READ MORE: Rouhani -- Nuclear weapons have no place in Iran's security . Iran's oil output has plummeted to the lowest level since 1992, to just 2.6 million barrels a day this summer. According to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy, production peaked out at 4.39 million barrels before sanctions in 2007. That lost export production is currently costing Iran $58 billion a year, based on conservative pricing of $95 a barrel. It's incentive enough to get back to the bargaining table. The industry is salivating at the potential return of Iran to the energy market, although there is a great deal of diplomatic ground to cover. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has opened the door to compromise and U.S. President Barack Obama is open to breaking a 30-year impasse, but it is just the beginning. We often hear that it will take years for Iran's energy sector to recover, but getting back to pre-sanctions levels may be easier than most people believe. READ MORE: China set to pass U.S. as top oil importer . ""This is a thirty day proposition, to get back to where they were before the sanctions,"" Fereidun Fesharaki, the Chairman of FACTS Global Energy told me. ""Now if you want to get higher volumes then it takes many, many years to build up the capacity."" Not only is Rouhani speaking in moderate tones, but he has placed a like-minded individual at the ministry of energy. Bijan Zanganeh was oil minister from 1997-2005, what many refer to as Iran's ""golden era"" of production. Major contracts were signed with French energy giant Total, Anglo-Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell, Norway's Statoil and Gazprom of Russia. Little has happened since. READ MORE: Threat of military strike sends ripples through oil industry . The potential is clearly there. Iran sits on 9.4% of proven global oil reserves, putting it in the top five worldwide. The outlook is more promising for natural gas, with 18% of global reserves, placing Iran number one, according to BP's annual survey. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister of Energy, Hussain al-Shahristani, told me he hoped diplomacy will take its course. He said world energy markets should count on a slight easing of sanctions over time, which he doubts will impact the price of crude in 2014. But one can see a perfect storm brewing, with some major factors converging over the next 12 months. Oil kingpin Saudi Arabia is building capacity to pump 12.5 million barrels a day. Iraq is aiming to go from 3.5 million by the end of this year to 9 million by 2020. The U.S., according to the International Energy Agency, will be level-peg with Saudi Arabia by the end of the decade as well. This is why producers here in the Middle East may not be jumping for joy if Iran mounts a surprisingly quick return the markets in 2014. READ MORE: From hope to despair: Egypt slides into economic collapse . ""Nobody wants Iranian oil back on the market,"" said energy consultant Fesharaki. ""If they came in today, the immediate reaction is the Saudis either have to cut back production or the price of oil must fall. It's not possible to just continue business as usual."" In early 2012 Saudi Arabia's energy minister Ali al Naimi told me the Kingdom wanted to defend $100 a barrel, and it has been able to do so. As a result, OPEC producers have been swimming in surpluses, making $1.25 trillion in 2012. READ MORE: Where Keystone's oil will go . If Iran's nuclear development plan can be agreed within the IAEA -- a very big if at this juncture -- it would lower the tenor of anxiety in the region.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' agent says he may take legal action after the world's No. 1 golfer was accused of cheating on the course this year. Mark Steinberg, who has helped the American become the planet's wealthiest athlete, criticized a ""shameful, baseless"" report on the Golf.com website by TV commentator Brandel Chamblee. Chamblee, a former pro golfer, said in his end-of-season summary that Woods had been ""cavalier with the rules"" -- and he made parallels with one of his own school experiences when he was caught cheating in a math test and marked down from a grade of 100 to an ""F."" He said his teacher quoted the 19th-century poem ""Marmion"" by Walter Scott: ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive!"" ""I never did ask my teacher how she knew I cheated and I certainly didn't protest the grade,"" wrote the 51-year-old, who gave Woods an ""F"" for his season's achievements, crossing out a ""100"" mark. ""I knew I had done the wrong thing and my teacher the right, but I never forgot the way I felt when I read that quote. ""I remember when we only talked about Tiger's golf. I miss those days. He won five times and contended in majors and won the Vardon Trophy and ... how shall we say this ... was a little cavalier with the rules."" Woods was named the PGA Tour's player of the year for the 11th time after a season in which he won five tournaments and had two top-10 finishes in the four majors. However, at April's Masters he was controversially not disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after taking an improper drop, but was penalized. The 37-year-old was also given two-stroke penalties in Abu Dhabi in January and last month at the BMW Championship for rule infringements, while he was suspected by some of taking a favorable drop at May's Players Championship after hitting a water hazard. ""There's nothing you can call a golfer worse than a cheater. This is the most deplorable thing I have seen,"" Steinberg said in a statement he later verified to CNN. ""I'm not one for hyperbole, but this is absolutely disgusting. Calling him a cheater? I'll be shocked, stunned if something is not done about this. Something has to be done. There are certainly things that just don't go without response. It's atrocious. I'm not sure if there isn't legal action to be taken. I have to give some thought to legal action. ""This is, 'Hey, look at me,' in its lowest form. Brandel Chamblee's comments are shameful, baseless and completely out of line. In his rulings, Tiger voiced his position, accepted his penalty and moved on. There was no intention to deceive anyone. ""Chamblee's uninformed and malicious opinions, passed on as facts, and his desperate attempt to garner attention is deplorable. Brandel has a right to form his opinion. If he wants to give him an 'F' for his year? It's silly. But this goes so far above that and is out of bounds. It's stunning."" Chamblee debated the issue on his Twitter account, where he denied calling Woods a cheat. ""To be accurate, I said he was cavalier with the rules. How is it anyone would argue to the contrary,"" he wrote. British golf journalist James Corrigan responded: ""The fact you wrote that and gave him an 'f' meant you called him a cheat. That isn't right."" Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy -- whose season has gone from bad to worse since missing the cut with Woods in Abu Dhabi when they were No. 1 and 2 in the rankings -- dropped out of contention at the Korea Open Saturday. The Northern Irishman, now sixth in the world, blamed a ""weird"" day after his third-round 75 left him 10 shots behind leader Kim Hyung-tae of South Korea, who was four clear. ""It was weird. I actually started the round really well,"" said the 24-year-old, who has begun legal proceedings against his management company and reportedly also split from tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki. ""I just think the story of the day is that I missed a lot of putts, missed a lot of chances for birdies at the start of the round and then mixed a few short ones for pars in the middle and end of the round. That's really what it was. ""So yeah, a frustrating day because I was in contention after two days and if you shoot a solid score today you're right in there tomorrow.""","Report giving Tiger Woods an ""F"" for 2013 is called ""absolutely disgusting"" by his agent .

"(CNN) -- Five years ago, on October 3, 2008, with the economy in a tailspin, President George W. Bush signed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program into law, giving the government the ability to bail out the big banks to prevent further calamity. A number of factors caused the economic collapse, but one in particular stands out -- a witch's brew of money and politics. As the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission wrote in its 2011 report, ""It did not surprise the Commission that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators. From 1999 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions."" Five years later, with millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed, not much has changed. Wall Street is still the biggest player in Washington. The industry dished out more dough than any other industry during the 2012 election. In the first six months of 2013, the finance, insurance and real estate sector has already given $63 million to federal candidates and committees. It has spent $242 million on more than 2,000 lobbyists. The Dodd-Frank financial reform was an important legislation and it has, and will continue, to protect consumers from abuses of the banks. But the industry played a major role in what rules were passed and it continues to play a role in the implementation of regulation rules. Soon, the Supreme Court may give bankers and wealthy special interests -- the same guys and gals who wrecked the economy in 2008 -- even more influence. On October 8, the court will hear oral arguments in McCutcheon v. FEC, a case brought by Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give, in total, to federal candidates and committees each election cycle. For the 2014 election cycle, that total is $123,200 -- more than double the median American family income. If the court sides with McCutcheon, an individual donor could bundle more than $1 million to congressional fundraising committees. So what does this have to do with Wall Street and TARP? Plenty. Some 28% of the roughly 1,200 individuals who got within 10% of the aggregate limit in the 2012 election work on Wall Street. These super donors work at Goldman Sachs, Elliott Management and other top financial firms. Wall Street was the biggest industry to put money into politics. If aggregate limits are thrown out, a future presidential candidate could be allowed to ask for a $2 million donation for his campaign and various committees. Congressional leaders could set up a fundraising committee that could take in $3.5 million from one donor. That's a sweet deal for Wall Street, but it's a raw deal for democracy. Based on past precedent, the court should uphold the current limits. But whether the justices do or do not, our democracy is already in trouble. Congress must act to raise the voices of We the People. StampStampede.org brings the issue home to Main Street. The Stampede encourages people to legally stamp messages such as ""not to be used for bribing politicians"" on our nation's currency to support reforms to #GetMoneyOut of politics. Every bill is seen an average of 875 times and helps demonstrate a growing, sustained demand for reform. One solution is modeled on successful systems in Arizona, Connecticut and Maine, which allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office by relying on a mix of small donations and limited public funds. There are a handful of similar measures already introduced in Congress. They would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists, bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks. The American people want and deserve a representative democracy that represents the people, not super-rich donors. But unless we come together and demand change, Congress will continue to be owned (or at least rented) by big money. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Cohen and Betty Ahrens.","It's been five years since the government bailed out banks during the economic crisis .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The United Nations and the United States condemned a wave of bombings in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities that left 15 dead and wounded dozens Sunday. The latest blast hit a coffee shop in a Shiite Muslim district in southeastern Baghdad, killing four people and wounding 10, police said. Another 11 people were killed and at least 70 were wounded in five car bombings south of Baghdad, most of them also in the Shiite districts of Mahawil, Mahmoudiya, Kut, Basra and Aziziya, authorities said. Sunday's attacks came six days after another rash of bombings in northern Iraq that killed nearly 60 people, from police in the northern city of Mosul to shoppers at a vegetable market in Baghdad. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence in recent months, leading to fears that the sectarian warfare that raged between Shiite and Sunni communities last decade could be rekindled.

""Nothing can justify such despicable and heinous crimes, targeting innocent people going about their daily business,"" Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, said in a statement issued late Sunday.

Many Sunni Arabs, who dominated Iraq under longtime strongman Saddam Hussein, have felt marginalized under the Shiite-led government that took power after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Hussein in 2003. The United States has kept an extensive diplomatic presence in Iraq since the last American military units left in December 2011. In a statement on the attacks, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said, ""We mourn the loss of life and stand firmly with the Iraqi people who seek to live in peace and who reject cowardly acts of terrorism such as this.""","NEW: Baghdad coffee shop blast kills 4, wounds 10 .

"(CNN) -- I go to the gym. It's an excellent place to watch SportsCenter while occupying a bench press that somebody else might otherwise use for actual exercise. ""You done with this?"" ""Define done."" My other favorite part of an early workout is when the gym staff finally plops the morning newspapers on the media table, where thumbing through USA Today for 20 minutes seems to be another great way to not improve my personal well being. Then I hit the sauna. Because, clearly, I've earned it. So, my daily routine isn't exactly CrossFit. In fact, it just barely even qualifies as being awake. Which is a little pathetic when you consider that, now, even toddlers are taking on CrossFit. Yes, one of the most controversial and interesting fitness crazes around -- one that some people (with incredibly loose standards) even label as a ""cult"" -- is actually offering age-modified classes to children. That's the larger story that people were talking about this week online. But, before diving deeper into that, I think it's important, first, to understand what CrossFit actually is. You know ... as explained by someone who's never done it. As best I comprehend the phenomenon, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program that focuses on highly functional real-world movements that are constantly varied and performed at amazingly high intensity. Participants work out in groups and meet not in a gym, but an industrial-looking ""box"" that is void of all the things I love most -- you know, SportsCenter and USA Today. Making CrossFit even more unique is the fact that you don't decide your own routine. Instead, there is a posted daily exercise that everyone does together. It's called the workout of the day -- or the WOD. On some days it might include nothing but front squats, and on another day you might find yourself lifting weights. But whatever it is, you'll do it as a group, it's going to be intense, and there's a decent chance you might barf all over your Nikes. My gym franchise would be slightly different. ""Yesterday we napped. Today we're going to stare at our hands. Be champions."" People who do CrossFit absolutely swear by it. Others simply see it as snobbish, especially considering that it's far more expensive than just joining an ordinary gym. For example, the ""box"" nearest me in Atlanta -- BTB Fitness -- charges $250/month. My current gym is $360 for the year. So, it's definitely a lot of money. But, that doesn't mean it's snobbish. As someone who doesn't really care one way or the other, I just see a lot of really fit men and women working incredibly hard. And that's more than I can say for myself. Thus, if you want to have your own lingo and dress a certain way, I say go for it. Tube-sock-a-palooza! Really, I harbor no judgement in support of or in opposition to CrossFit. I'm not a health expert, and I'm literally sitting here writing with a Super Big Gulp. Which is just like a normal Big Gulp, but with slightly more type-2 diabetes. So, in general, I just applaud anyone who exercises. And I wish I could look as good as the people I see doing CrossFit. Which is why, at first glance, CrossFit for toddlers seems completely fine. It's not like the kids are deadlifting kettle bells or hauling giant bags of dirt around the neighborhood. If that was the case, I'd let the neighborhood kids pay me to clean my backyard. ""Billy, here's a Kroger bag. Now give me 10 more dog poop lifts. And 50 bucks."" Instead, at CrossFit Gantry in Long Island City Queens -- the affiliate that made news this week -- children starting at 3 years old will focus on traditional CrossFit movements but without any weight. The classes will also incorporate counting and colors, as well as bear crawls and crab walking. Basically, it's just a bunch of fun kid stuff. But with a price tag. If your son or daughter attends two classes a week, the fee for the month is $280. And, that, some argue, makes it all completely unnecessary. Especially when playgrounds are free. And outside. But, come on. We're simply talking about a fun, organized group activity for kids. It's just like karate or ballet. People shouldn't let their contempt for the word ""CrossFit"" overshadow that it's just something active and interesting for children to do. And people are certainly free to spend their money however they please. But don't listen to me. My kid is a dog. And Mikey's primary workout routine is dropping giant turds on my lawn.

"(CNN) -- It hasn't been a blockbuster year for Nintendo, the video-gaming company that brought us ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Super Mario Bros."" and the Wii. Sales of the Wii U, Nintendo's latest gaming system, have been soft and the company has struggled to get enough top-tier games in front of the players clamoring for them. And while Microsoft and Sony have made headlines at E3, the video game industry expo underway this week in Los Angeles, Nintendo has kept a lower profile, forsaking its usual splashy keynote in favor of a smaller news conference. But Satoru Iwata, president and CEO of Nintendo, believes the company can rebound by focusing on Wii U games. In an interview this week for CNN, Iwata admitted the company made missteps with the introduction of the Wii U. But he remains convinced a strong lineup of upcoming Wii U software will get gamers excited about the living-room console. He just needs them to play it. ""Those people who have already purchased the Wii U and are enjoying Wii U, they have already realized the value of the Wii U, and I understand that they are highly appreciating the entertainment experiences provided by Wii U,"" Iwata said through a translator. ""But the fact of the matter is Wii U has yet to prove what is so unique (about it), unlike how ... with a first glance, people were able to understand how different Wii was."" At E3, Nintendo's booth on the trade-show floor offered people a hands-on experience with six new Wii U titles: ""Pikmin 3,"" ""Super Mario Bros. 3D World,"" ""Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD,"" ""Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze,"" ""Bayonetta 2"" and ""Mario Kart 8."" Nintendo is letting fans demo four of these games -- ""Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze,"" ""Super Mario 3D World,"" ""Mario Kart 8"" and ""Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker"" -- at select Best Buy stores in North America this Saturday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Players can also visit the Nintendo World store in New York to try out the new titles. Nintendo faces increased competition from Microsoft and Sony, both of whom have new consoles -- the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, respectively -- coming out this fall in time for the holiday season. To compete, Iwata believes Nintendo needs to get the games into as many people's hands as possible so more gamers can understand the value of the Wii U. ""We just don't care too much about what other companies are doing or are trying to do,"" he said. ""Our primary focus is to think about and actually carry out something which other company's hardware can never realize. We are trying to provide consumers gaming experiences that can only be available on Nintendo platforms. ""Software sells hardware,"" he added. ""The number of hardware selling and the number of people who can experience the unique attractions of the Wii U are going to increase, and thereby the knowledge and the understanding about the Wii U system shall naturally expand."" Wii U problems . According to Nintendo's financial statement for the fiscal year ending March 31, Wii U hardware sales had a negative impact on the company's profits to the tune of 36.4 billion yen, or more than $385.7 million. The report directly blames a delay in development of new games for the soft sales (3.45 million units worldwide). But the company is forecasting 9 million units sold for this fiscal year based on its games-first plan. Critics of the company have been saying the Wii U needs more new and exciting games to succeed. Brett Molina, online tech producer for USA Today, said the Wii U can rebound even though it might appear they are already behind the times. ""Once we see more first-party content for the Wii U, we could see momentum improve,"" Molina said. ""But they need the equivalent of 'Wii Sports' for the Wii U to convince consumers of the strength of the GamePad. There hasn't been that kind of game yet."" Max Parker, video game columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, thinks games are indeed important to the future success of the Wii U, but Nintendo's early mistakes with the console could hamper any recovery efforts. ""Nintendo did a poor job in marketing the Wii U. Sharing part of its name with its predecessor was a misstep,"" Parker explained. ""The public was unsure if the Wii U was a new console or a peripheral of the Wii. Nintendo didn't make it clear in their marketing that the Wii U was their new home console to replace the Wii."" If history is any indicator, the release of games for the Wii U could help drive hardware sales for Nintendo. Their handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, also suffered from lagging hardware sales in the beginning but has rebounded to become a powerhouse in the marketplace. A May report by NPD Group, a video games market research company, said the handheld console sold more than 2 million units of first-party software titles in the first four months of 2013, something that took them more than seven months to do last year. Nintendo 3DS was the only gaming platform to show a year-to-year growth despite an overall decrease in industry sales by 25%. Handheld gaming . Five of the top ten best selling franchises in home console history are exclusive to Nintendo -- Mario, Zelda, Smash Bros., Mario Kart and Wii Fit. Molina said they need to get their stars out front. ""Nintendo isn't just coming out with rehashes of the same game. They're doing more to make sure these games are original,"" Parker said. "" 'Super Mario Galaxy' was one of the best franchises on the Wii. They can keep reusing the same characters if you ask me, as long as they keep coming up with new ways to play."" In addition to the looming shadow of its competitors' new consoles, Nintendo has also contended with the rise of smartphone gaming as a potential threat to its handheld Nintendo 3DS console. Iwata says he's not concerned. ""There are a number of people who have watched the spread of smart devices today who are concluding that handheld gaming devices would not have a future at all,"" Iwata said. ""(But) a number of trade people, retailers and distributors, are visiting the E3 show right now, and I understand they believe the potentially biggest seller for them this year ... is going to be Nintendo 3DS."" According to Nintendo, 3DS software sales of first-party titles in countries such as France, Germany and Belgium are driving hardware sales as well. The company is projecting sales of 1.8 million hardware units and 8 million software units for the 3DS in the next fiscal year. ""Nintendo should be thankful for the success of the 3DS,"" Parker said. ""They have managed to turn that handheld around since its dark beginnings, and it has become quite a success for them."" ""Whether it happens with Wii U remains to be seen,"" Molina added. Again, it all comes back to games. But is it too late to get people's attention? Iwata says no, and is ready to back it up with action. ""Starting from this summer, Nintendo is preparing for a very strong first-party software line-up that people really want to try out. By selling the software, we'd like to expand the hardware sales of the Wii U system. That's our message.""","Nintendo president says new titles will turn around lackluster Wii U sales .

"(CNN) -- Let's be clear: An agreement that would put Syria's chemical weapons under U.N. lock and key is not a solution. It is a partial measure that could help U.S. officials avoid the uncomfortable task of having to authorize military strikes in the face of clear public opposition and save the Syrian people from further gas attacks. That is, of course, if it works. And that is a big if. As history has shown, previous cease-fire agreements under U.N. leadership have failed to gain the compliance of Bashar al-Assad. More to the point is that confronting the scourge of the humanitarian disaster consuming Syria and threatening neighbors is not dependent on removing access to chemical weapons. More than 200,000 people have been counted as killed, more than 6 million have been displaced and millions of Syrians are facing starvation and death by common disease. These casualties are not the result of chemical attacks. They are the result of a protracted civil war in which the Assad regime carries the disproportionate blame for atrocities. But let's also be clear about what is at stake now. After two years of military stalemate, a diplomatic breakthrough involving key protagonists in Syria's war would be no insignificant feat. Russia, which has long given al-Assad cover from international censure, agreed to the diplomatic proposal publicly floated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in London. China has registered its acquiescence. France drafted a resolution listing tough parameters for a disarmament deal, parts of which were rejected by Russia, which submitted a counterdraft. All eyes turn to Geneva talks on Syria . That negotiations are taking place at the U.N. Security Council is significant. Although Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, signaled at a news briefing Tuesday that substantial differences remain between the United States and Russia that could very well end in deadlock, should a resolution be adopted, it will likely reflect the agreement of the Syrian government and Iran -- both of which have a role to play in achieving an eventual resolution. With Iran backing Syria materially with money, strategic military advice and fighters, observers of Syria have long understood that its participation would be necessary to getting a viable political plan moving. The Iranian Foreign Ministry has voiced its support for the plan. If Russia and Iran were in agreement with the United States, a diplomatic framework aimed at a de-escalation of the civil war would be in place. Enforcement opportunities would be increased if such an agreement were adopted in a Security Council resolution. This could in turn usher in an avenue for a broader initiative to de-escalate violence in Syria. In fact, a U.N. weapons inspection team operating in Syria would by its very presence likely bring about a decrease of violence alone. There are many that are rightly skeptical of the chances of success at the United Nations, but all indications are negotiations between the United States and Russia have been ongoing since President Barack Obama announced his intention to use force against the Syrian government. These negotiations should be allowed to bear fruit without unnecessary posturing that could scare off the Russians. Insisting on language that al-Assad should go is not worth the risk of losing this opportunity. Al-Assad's legitimacy has been clearly squandered to the point of no return. As the parties are to go to the table for ""Geneva II"" negotiations, the diplomatic track initiated by Russia and the United States to resolve the conflict politically, discussion will undoubtedly begin from the premise of the need to transition Syria to new leadership. The Syrian opposition holds this strong card that few can dispute, although the timelines and details of the transition still need to be worked out. American and European negotiators should also consider whether it is worth fighting for a resolution falling under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Chapter VII, invoked to authorize international intervention in Iraq, Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, would back up any U.N. deal with enforcement powers, ranging from sanctions to military force. The issue, however, constitutes a contentious point in the negotiations. It appears clear that by threatening military intervention, Obama was able to advance Syria's conflict toward a potential point of agreement for action. The United States should reserve that right to use force within a particular timeline but without letting it become a stumbling block at the Security Council. The administration should also continue to make the case to the American people that Syria's suffering didn't start with chemical weapons and will not end in the chance that they are secured or destroyed. If these negotiations are to be a real opportunity, they must be viewed as a step toward a larger political initiative to achieve conditions for a negotiated transition from civil war to relative stability and eventually the democratic Syria for which so many have sacrificed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leila Hilal.","Leila Hilal: Securing Syria's chemical weapons is a partial measure but could be first step .
She says it's a ""big if,"" but such an agreement would fuel other efforts to end Syria war .

"(CNN) -- Ramin Bastani believed he was about to get lucky. A woman he'd met earlier that night was making her way toward his bedroom. Suddenly, he hesitated. It didn't go unnoticed. ""What's your deal? Are you gay?"" the woman asked. No. He wasn't gay. ""What is it?"" she wondered. ""Oh my gosh! Do you have an STD?"" No, it wasn't that either. Alarmed, she stepped away from him. ""Oh my God! Yes, you do. You have an STD,"" he recalls her saying emphatically. Bastani confessed what was bothering him -- he barely knew this woman. ""No,"" he told her. ""I'm afraid you might."" She slapped him across the face and walked out of the room. It's the kind of awkward moment a lot of men might prefer to forget, but for Bastani it was the impetus for starting his company, Qpid.me, a free website that lets users text and share their verified sexually transmitted disease results with potential partners. ""I remember sitting back thinking, 'There's got to be a better way,' "" Bastani says. At any given time, there are 110 million sexually transmitted infections among men and women across the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young people contract half of all new cases. They're also tech-savvy, and that's driving the development of new high-tech STD prevention tools geared toward them. Qpid.me users can share their verified test results for HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. Their status comes directly from their own U.S. health care provider. It shows when they got tested and includes a disclaimer that notes the user may have had sex since then. The company promotes the service as a way to ""spread the love, nothing else."" It's a modern, flirtatious version of ""I'll show you mine, if you show me yours,"" Bastiani says, that can make would-be lovers more attractive to each other. ""We're lining the idea of getting tested with actually getting more action,"" he says. Another STD tech tool helps people have difficult conversations with past lovers. Studies show 23% of partners of people diagnosed with STDs are ever warned they might also be at risk. At sotheycanknow.org, users can provide that warning anonymously by e-mail for free. ""There is obviously a lot of anxiety with talking to a past partner about a diagnosis, particularly if you're not close to that person, or if it was a casual partner, or if it was someone that you had a falling out with,"" says Jenny McManus, the company's director of operations. ""We're hoping to get those patients who wouldn't normally tell their partners to do it through our anonymous service."" The U.S.-based service lets users notify former partners about chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis. The anonymous e-mail has information about the STD exposure and where the recipient can go to get tested. Users are asked to certify that they are sending the e-mail for the right reasons, but the site doesn't require the results to be verified. Recipients can report misuse of the service to the company. For users who are willing to speak to their former sex partners, the site also offers scripts for the difficult discussion. Another STD tech tool out there is an app called STD Triage. Worried you might have symptoms of an STD? This service lets you take a picture of a rash, for example, on your private parts, and for about $40, you can send it in and get a response back from a doctor within a day about what it might be. The app screens for STDs that result in physical symptoms such as syphilis, herpes and genital warts. Twenty-five percent of the images screened are actually STDs, the company says. Often the images show something else entirely, such as an infected hair follicle. ""There are a lot of worried people out there,"" says the company's founder, Alexander Borve. ""People actually think they have an infection and they don't."" The service is available internationally. The screenings are not definitive -- they only provide potential diagnoses. The results include information about what the user may be experiencing and recommendations for treatment, including when to see a dermatologist or visit an STD clinic to have the diagnosis verified. ""We're not a diagnostic service. We're not trying to substitute the doctor relationship,"" Borve says. ""We're getting the right patient at the right time to the right level of health care.""","Users can text and share STD test results with potential partners .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has proposed high-level talks with the United States to ""ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula,"" its state news agency reported early Sunday. The topics that ""can be sincerely discussed"" include easing military tensions, changing a truce treaty to a peace treaty, and nuclear matters, according to a statement from the North's National Defense Commission, as reported by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. It left some details -- like where and when the talks might be held -- up to Washington, and insisted U.S. officials should not lay out any preconditions for talks. ""(The United States should) not lose the opportunity that is laid out and should actively agree with our resolute step and good intention,"" the commission said. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said the United States has always been willing to talk. ""We will judge North Korea by its actions and not its words, and look forward to seeing steps that show North Korea is ready to abide by its commitments and obligations,"" Caitlin Hayden said. A senior administration official said Washington will discuss the reports with Japan and South Korea at an upcoming meeting. For years, North Korea has been at odds with many in the international community, including the United States, over its missile and nuclear programs. Whether Pyongyang's offer is accepted -- and if so, on what terms -- and whether the talks will happen remain to be seen. Last Tuesday, North Korea called off what were supposed to be the first high-level talks between North and South Korean officials in years. That meeting was supposed to start the next day. High-level talks between Koreas called off . South Korea's Unification Ministry said the North dropped out after a dispute about who should be involved in the talks, after each side contended that the other wasn't sending a sufficiently high-level official. The talks were to focus on, among other things, reviving joint economic activities. Amid a spike in tensions, the North in April halted activity at the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a shared industrial complex and major symbol of cooperation between the two countries. North Korea removes missiles from launch site, U.S. official says . It was not immediately clear what might be on the agenda if U.S. and North Korean officials meet. Washington has been at the forefront of those demanding an end to Pyongyang's nuclear program, pushing for sanctions and rallying other nations to its side. Tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula surged in December -- one year after Kim Jong Un assumed power after his father's death -- when North Korea launched a long-range rocket, then conducted an underground nuclear test two months later. Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, said in April that North Korea's missile and weapons programs posed ""a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability."" Why North Korean intelligence is so hard to read . That same month, North Korea set out demanding conditions for talks. They included calling for the withdrawal of U.N. sanctions against it and a permanent end to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The United States and South Korea ""should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the DPRK and apologize for all of them,"" the North's National Defense Commission said in a statement carried by state-run media, using the shortened version of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But those talks never came to be, with South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young describing the North's demands as ""preposterous."" The United States has said that, in order for it to engage in talks, North Korea would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from its nuclear program. If new talks actually happen, it will be the second senior-level meeting between the U.S. and North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power. The first talks were in February 2012, when North Korea's first vice minister, Kim Kye Gwan, held talks in Beijing with Glyn Davies, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy. At the time, North Korea agreed to stop nuclear activity at its main facility in Yongbyon and impose a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches in exchange for 240,000 tons of food assistance. However, the agreement fell apart after the U.N. imposed sanctions in response to North Korea's failed long-range rocket launch in April 2012.","NEW: Washington says North Korea needs to back up its words .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's rebuke of Republicans who are ""beating the drums of war"" in encouraging the United States to take military action against Iran should be targeted not just toward those critics but also, and more important, toward the Israeli government. An attack on Iran would not only fail to achieve its stated goal of denuclearizing the country, it would unleash a devastating confrontation between Iran and Israel that would harm thousands of Israelis and Iranians, and affect those in neighboring states. It would drag the U.S. into another Middle East quagmire, and it would launch an oil crisis that would throw the global economy into turmoil. Then, once the dust settles (or before it does), Iran would only be more motivated to pursue its nuclear ambition. Four scenarios on Iran's nuclear plan . In the current environment of heated rhetoric from all sides, there is too much focus on when and if Israel would launch a preemptive strike against Iran. What's missing in the talks are the chance of success in stopping Iran's nuclear plan through a military option and the regional and global consequences of a new war. Given the territorial distribution of Iran's nuclear facilities and the likelihood that Iran has readied them for possible attacks, Israel probably does not have the military capacity to eliminate, or even seriously damage, Iran's alleged nuclear program. Some experts have compared Israel's airstrikes against nuclear facilities in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007 with a possible strike against Iran. But this is a flawed analogy. In those cases, Israel launched surprise attacks against one facility, which would not be the case with Iran. Moreover, Iran and Israel both possess extensive arsenals of missiles. There is little doubt that a strike would trigger an unprecedented war in the Middle East. Israel would be far more vulnerable in such a war than Iran, due to its small size and the fact that the country's epicenter is in one single region, the greater Tel Aviv area. Although Iran has come under immense international pressure to halt its nuclear plan, it has refused to do so. However, Iran, unlike its reputation in the West and in Israel in particular, is a rational country with rational leadership, which seeks to enhance its regional and global power. Iran is not suicidal. Therefore, comparing Iran with Nazi Germany, as is often done by Israeli leadership, is historically problematic and extremely dangerous politically. Unfortunately, given the track record of engaging with Iran, perhaps in the long term we may have to learn to live with a nuclearized Middle East that would operate based on the Cold War dynamics of mutually assured destruction. A nuclearized Iran might even launch a nuclear arms race involving other regional players such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The only alternative to this pessimistic forecast is to reconsider Middle East inter-state politics, the Arab-Israeli conflict and U.S. policy in the region. Constructive communication should be encouraged between the Iranian leadership and the U.S., and it should involve other key players. The U.S. should acknowledge the importance of having strong regional players in the Middle East, including Iran. If the regional inter-state dynamics can be changed for the better, Iran may be forced to rethink its strategy, including its nuclear ambition. A rebalanced Middle East will also need the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to be resolved sooner rather than later, since that has been a source of continuous friction. Regrettably, with Israel, Iran and the U.S. entrenched in their positions, it does not look like we are heading in a direction that would solve the Iran problem anytime soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Asher Kaufman.","President Obama said the GOP are ""beating the drums of war"" about attacking Iran .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. regulators are directing 31 nuclear reactors similar in design to the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, where an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown two years ago, to take additional steps to help contain radiation and other damage from any accident that is not quickly halted. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission directive on Thursday requires enhancements to systems for venting accumulated pressure from containment structures during an emergency. Vents must also be able to safely handle rising temperatures, hydrogen concentrations and radiation levels. The changes also aim to ensure that plant personnel can continue to operate vents safely if a reactor core melts down, the agency said. Plants in the United States were ordered last year by the NRC to take other steps to upgrade their ""hardened"" venting systems after the 2011 disaster in Japan that crippled three reactors and released radiation into the atmosphere. It was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. ""Strengthened vents will help these plants continue to protect the public and the environment even if emergency systems can't immediately stop an accident,"" NRC Chairman Allison Macfarlane said in a statement. ""By safely releasing built-up pressure and hydrogen, the plants will preserve the buildings that contain radioactive material,"" she said. U.S. plants covered under the directive are older, boiling-water reactors mainly similar in design to the Fukushima facility. During the meltdown in Japan, containment pressure exceeded twice the design limit, and there was no power or air to vent systems, according to an overview of the disaster by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators. The goal for completing venting improvements in the United States is 2014, depending on refueling schedules. Additional steps would take longer, if deemed necessary. The directive covers scenarios for structures meant to condense steam generated during an accident and control pressure and for the larger structures that surround the reactor. The NRC also plans to develop a rule to improve the filtering of radioactive material from any vented gases and to improve procedures for preserving the integrity of containment systems. An industry group said the new order is in line with its assessment of the ""most effective means"" to address venting. ""Venting to protect containment integrity and to mitigate the impact of a serious event is among the long-established training responses that are part of these facilities' severe accident mitigation guidelines,"" according to a statement from the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group for the industry. The organization said the timetable is achievable but it did not provide a cost estimate. Plant operators may have to spend nearly $3.6 billion over the next three to five years on modifications to the nation's 102 nuclear facilities in response to the Fukushima accident, according to a Platts survey released on Thursday. This includes costs for government mandates to handle threats from flooding and earthquakes as well as related engineering studies, Platts, an energy industry information service, said.","Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires changes at 31 plants .

"(CNN) -- Now, 45 years later, I still see it. I still feel it. Among the most exhilarating moments of my life was when I touched the fingertips of Robert Francis Kennedy. That's ultimately where I'm going. Until then, let's discuss the months, weeks and days before everything stood still for a 12-year-old that bright Thursday afternoon on a mostly empty street in northern Indiana. This journey of fate began in a classroom of politically astute sixth-graders at Benjamin Harrison Elementary School in South Bend, Indiana. It was the spring of 1968, when turmoil was everywhere, and it was just the start of horrors to come for what would rank among the most violent years in American history. Just like that, courtesy of the Tet Offensive in late January and early February, the Vietnam war went from winding down to raging out of control. There were nerve gas leaks in Utah. There was the Orangeburg Massacre in South Carolina, where state police killed three college students protesting a segregated bowling alley. Then there was our discussion in a back corner of that classroom involving a small gathering of sixth-graders on who deserved the Democratic nomination that year for the presidency of the United States. It was a discussion that had nothing to do with the scheduled agenda of our teacher, Mr. Petrass, and it was a discussion that came out of nowhere. What about Lyndon Baines Johnson who couldn't solve Vietnam, but who had done more with Civil Rights than any president since Abraham Lincoln? Three years earlier, in Mrs. Plummer's third-grade class, she ushered us to the window to see LBJ's helicopter fly by in the distance en route to landing in town to kickoff his ""Great Society"" program. For those who despised war, Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy made sense. He even caused Johnson supporters to squirm in early March by finishing a tight second to the sitting president in the New Hampshire primary. One more name ... RFK. He actually spurred the conversation. He was charismatic, and he was highly sympathetic to the black community of which I was a part. Not only that, he was a Kennedy, which was as magical a name then as it is now. On March 16, a few days before our discussion, he did what many thought he would do earlier: He declared he was running for the Oval Office that once belonged to John Fitzgerald Kennedy, his brother who was assassinated five years earlier. During JFK's administration, Robert was the ruthless attorney general who doubled as the confidant of the president. In 1968, his edges became softer, partly because of his ongoing grief, but mostly because of his sense of mission. He was a 42-year-old senator from New York who was obsessed with helping the poor, and he was an outspoken champion of racial and social justice. Robert Kennedy also was anti-war. The same as McCarthy. The difference was that McCarthy wasn't a Kennedy. Neither was Johnson nor Hubert Humphrey, LBJ's vice president, who later ran for president after Johnson shocked the universe by abruptly dropping from the race at the end of March. Our consensus was RFK. Consider, too, our discussion involved white and black kids. In fact, most South Bend schools were racially mixed, and such was the case even when my parents moved through the school system during the 1940s and 1950s. South Bend also was the definitive blue-collar town back then as the headquarters for Studebaker cars, Singer Sewing Machine and the Bendix Corporation. Plus, you had the free thinkers at the University of Notre Dame within the city limits. Notre Dame is the world's most famous Catholic university, and the Kennedys are Catholic. Despite their overwhelming wealth, RFK became the face of the Kennedys' desire to help the less fortunate while promoting racial harmony. Translated: South Bend was made to hug Kennedys. With that in mind, several days after our discussion in Mr. Petrass' class, a wonderfully crazy thing happened. The principal announced over the intercom that school was finishing early that afternoon to give everybody a chance to stand on the curb in front of the building to see a passing motorcade -- RFK's motorcade. He had landed in town to begin his campaign for the Indiana primary, which would be his first primary since announcing his candidacy. My birthday is in October, but it came early back then, along with Christmas, Thanksgiving Day and the Fourth of July. Robert Kennedy? We were just talking about the guy. There were no cell phones during the spring of 1968. No Internet. No opportunity to contact the parents, other relatives or friends to inform them about our pending dance with history -- and, yes, even then, we knew this would be something huge for the ages. So my crew of sixth-graders joined hundreds of others on the edge of Western Avenue waiting. We waited some more. We kept waiting. As 20 minutes became a half-hour, the crowd dwindled to half. By the time the wait reached an hour, it was clear RFK was MIA. My brother, Dennis, and I were in the same grade. We thought of waiting some more, but we decided to begin our usual half-mile walk home. We moved down Western Avenue, looking over our shoulders along the way -- hoping, praying. Nothing. The motorcade must have gone a different way to the South Bend airport en route to wherever, or maybe RFK just left earlier than expected. Or maybe ... nah. We kept walking. Once we got home, we were supposed to start our daily routine. Off with the school clothes, then on to homework and house chores. Then we could enjoy the great outdoors. School day after school day, we did that routine without fail, but this time, Dennis talked me into altering things to take a quick spin around the block on our brand-new bikes. Good thing. Soon, we heard sirens. We glanced at each other with wide eyes, and without a word, we pedaled faster than a sunbeam toward Western Avenue, which was a block or so in front of us. We jumped off our bikes with the banana seats and stingray handle bars, and after a group of South Bend motorcycle cops passed by, a convertible headed our way with flashing lights. We knew. We just knew. So we stood there, waiting, hoping, just the two of us, with nobody else in sight on the street. The convertible got closer, and the man sitting on its right side stood up with his light-colored hair waving in the wind as he gave a signal to the driver to slow down. With the car shifting into a lower gear, the man leaned over as much as he could without tumbling out of his car. It was RFK, alright, and as his convertible kept traveling toward its destination in slightly less than a hurry for that moment, he touched my brother's fingertips and then mine. We watched the motorcade fade into the distance. Then, after Dennis and I looked at each other with even wider eyes, we unleashed the biggest ""WOW!"" of joy ever known. That was in contrast to the sorrow we felt two months later after our mother shook us out of our beds in the middle of the night/morning of June 5. We rushed to the television in our parents' room to see a heavy dose of live grief across the television screen. The man with that light-colored hair waving in the wind was gunned down in the kitchen of The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, and this was after he moved closer that evening to the Democratic nomination by winning the California primary. It was as if a family member had died. We touched fingertips. As the years became decades, I kept thinking: When did that happen? Then came last autumn, when I satisfied my curiosity. I was back in South Bend for a Notre Dame football game, so I dedicated an afternoon to searching old South Bend Tribune newspaper editions at the public library. Within the hour, I found a brilliantly written story of RFK's 1968 trip to northern Indiana in the Tribune's evening edition, and it mentioned how Kennedy was leaving South Bend for Indianapolis. I got chills. I touched RFK's fingertips a few hours before he gave one of the most passionate speeches ever. He spoke without notes. He urged a potentially angry crowd to stay calm. He preached the need for everybody in Indianapolis to practice nonviolence, especially since he had experienced the suffering that comes from the gruesome death of a brother. It was April 4, 1968 ... The day Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terence Moore.","Terence Moore was 12 when Robert F.

"(CNN) -- They are being billed as the Jimmy Choos of horseshoes but it's more than just the design that will appeal to jockeys and trainers. Australian company CSIRO Titanium Technologies claims to have built a lighter horseshoe by using titanium rather than the traditional cast aluminum. It says the shoe can be up to 100 grams lighter, which could mean that horses run faster in races. Now, 100 grams might not sound like much but as Clive Woodward -- given a knighthood after coaching England to glory at the 2003 rugby world cup -- says, such small margins can make the biggest of difference. And whereas a pair of shoes made by Jimmy Choo can fetch more than $3,200, a set of four titanium horseshoes costs a mere $560. ""We are aiming to build confidence with the horse and the racing team,"" John Barnes, a titanium expert with CSIRO Titanium Technologies, told CNN in an email. ""We still believe we can take more weight out."" In producing the titanium model, scientists scanned a horse's hooves using a hand-held device before formulating the design with software, CSIRO said in a news release with a headline referring to the famous Malaysian-born designer. ""Four of the customized kicks were printed within only a few hours!"" according to CSIRO. ""It was a team decision when we were trying get people to understand the potential of additive manufacturing and how you don't have to be an expert designer,"" said Barnes. ""Advances in 3-D scanning provide an easy, affordable way to get a customized object and still have ultimate design flexibility. ""There are so many ways we can use 3-D titanium printing."" Richard Perham, a senior jockey coach at the British Racing School in Newmarket, England, said the new technology has potential. ""My job as a jockey coach is to get the riders to understand more about making finer points count,"" Perham, a flat jockey for 16 years prior to retiring, told CNN. ""So if you add all those little points up and all those little 100 grams up, then I think there would be an advantage. ""Every bit helps.""","An Australian company says it can manufacture a horseshoe made of titanium .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's blockbuster announcement that he is in favor of full marriage equality is the most courageous thing he has done since he entered the White House three and a half years ago. Coming after his successful strategy to get Congress to repeal don't ask, don't tell so that gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military and the decision of his Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in federal courts, he has now done nearly as much for gay people as Lyndon Johnson did for African-Americans with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Obama: 'Same-sex couples should be able to get married' People like me, who were among his most passionate supporters in 2008, felt a sense of gigantic relief. The man who seemed like such a courageous candidate four years ago finally sounded like a genuinely courageous president. Coming so soon after his decision not to sign an executive order that would have banned discrimination against gays and lesbians among federal contractors, Wednesday's statement instantly obliterated the doubts of millions of his gay supporters. In some ways, the momentum of his own presidency on gay rights made Wednesday's declaration inevitable. In his interview with ABC News, the president himself cited the end of don't ask, don't tell as one reason he felt compelled to speak out. ""I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that don't ask, don't tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,"" the president said. Many polls have shown healthy majorities among Americans younger than 30 in favor of marriage equality, and the president noted that even college Republicans who oppose the rest of his policies ""are very clear that when it comes to same-sex equality or, you know, sexual orientation that they believe in equality."" The other two facts that probably made his decision easiest were contained in a Gallup Poll released this week, which showed that 65% of Democrats and 57% of independents agree that gay marriage should be legal. What made the decision most difficult is the closeness of the presidential race in battleground states such as Ohio and North Carolina -- especially after North Carolina residents voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to change the state constitution so that not only marriage but all forms of domestic partnership would be banned for same-sex couples. The effect on the president's base was immediate and electric. Andrew Tobias, the long-time treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, said that most ""LGBT donors were already willing to focus on all the great stuff that has been done and how much more we'll get done if he's re-elected. But today has ramped up the enthusiasm dramatically. I've gotten calls and five-figure credit card authorizations already from people who were just waiting for this. The enthusiasm level is very high."" Former New York City Mayor Edward Koch is a strong supporter of the president. The dean of New York Democrats also has one of the oldest and strongest records in support of gay rights of any modern American politician, having first come out in favor of the repeal of New York State's anti-sodomy law in 1962. When informed of the president's action by CNN.com, Koch said, ""Someone should write a play about this -- there's so much drama here!"" ""The question will be, was he pushed, or are these his real feelings?"" Koch continued. ""I believe this is how he really feels. I commend him for doing this."" The former mayor pointed out that until today, the president was getting the ""worst of both worlds"" by continuing to say that his feelings were evolving on this subject. ""He was evolving into dust. And now he has evolved into a major figure who should be thanked by the country."" Among the president's most fervent supporters, a latent fear remains that this announcement could cost him the election. But a new feeling offers gigantic compensation: the conviction that we really did elect a genuinely transformational president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Kaiser.","Charles Kaiser: Obama's stance on gay rights has effect similar to Civil Rights Act .

"(CNN) -- The Middle East might account for less than one tenth of global private jet sales, but the passengers flying on the region's luxury planes can be the most demanding in the world. ""Yes the people who fly our planes are demanding, and they have a right to be,"" says Faisal Ghazi Kayal, managing director of Saudia Private Aviation. ""You're talking about the businessmen who very much invented the rules of the game."" Capturing the small but significant patronage of the region's super rich is becoming increasingly competitive as more private jet charter companies tap into a market that is expected to grow by around 12% in the next two years, according to the Middle East Business Aviation Association. To do that ""it's about offering the full experience, from pre-flight through to well after the plane has landed,"" says Kayal. ""The journey doesn't end with the aircraft landing, we have to think 'Where should we take him to, to which hotel?'"" The in-flight experience is just one part of it, although private jet manufactures and companies that fit out jets are continually pushing the limits of what can be done to meet client needs on board. Later this month Lufthansa Technik is set to flight test its first steam shower aboard a Boeing 737 -- not an easy job given the hazard of creating pressure and heat within the cabin. Condensation also must not be allowed to form inside or on the plane's structure. The royal treatment . For Kayal's clients who wish to be treated like kings, Royal Jet, the UAE-based charter company, actually caters for members of the Emirate's royal family. The company is jointly owned by Abu Dhabi Aviation and the Presidential Flight Authority, the royal flight service. ""It's like having a fleet of boutique hotels,"" says Shane O'Hare, the company's CEO, from the luxurious confines of one of the firm's 737 Boeing Business Jets. Cultural needs are taken into particular consideration. ""Among Arab clients there is a desire for separate areas for men and women and they are very specific where the bedroom may be located,"" says O'Hare. ""It's important that the bedrooms are located near the front of the plane, while for some other markets its OK for them to be located near the back; so configurations are very important."" Other business jet manufacturers like Gulfstream find their larger models are more popular in the region. They attribute the popularity to how many more high net worth individuals in the region travel with extended families, than those from other parts of the world. ""Gray market"" Together Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for around 70% of the private jet market in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Middle East Business Aviation Association, but there are some clouds on the horizon for the charter companies. One of the biggest problems they face in the region is the ""gray market"" -- planes owned by private individuals who then rent them out without having to go through the same regulatory scrutiny (or expense) of the charter companies. ""It's like having unlicensed taxi cabs,"" says O'Hare. ""There is a network or brokers out there who cater for this and it actually undercuts the legitimate businesses."" ""We like competition but we like competition that is fair and legal. It's a very expensive business to be in, the margins are razor thin, and we'd prefer it to be an industry of well-funded organizations experienced in aviation rather than aviation enthusiasts -- the owner-operator syndrome."" This is one of the reasons companies like Royal Jet and Saudia Private Aviation are keen to highlight the safety and security of their planes and the experience of their pilots, as well as the level of service. Efforts are being made to close the loops in the system, according to Kayal, ""and ultimately it will be [fixed], like in any maturing market."" Until then private jet charter companies will continue to provide luxury services and play the necessary ""game"" in order to secure the loyalty of clients. ""The price has to be right and the product has to be right,"" says Kayal.","Middle East's private jet market expected to grow 12% in next two years .

"(CNN) -- I'm finding it hard to get too worked up over the revelation that the National Security Agency has been authorized by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect all our call data from Verizon. Hasn't everyone already assumed this? Everything we do in the digital realm -- from surfing the Web to sending an e-mail to conducting a credit card transaction to, yes, making a phone call -- creates a data trail. And if that trail exists, chances are someone is using it -- or will be soon enough. This particular style of privacy invasion looks a bit different from those old TV movies where FBI agents sit in a van listening in on phone calls and recording them on reel-to-reel tape recorders. The government isn't interested in the content of our phone calls -- our conversations -- so much as who is calling whom and when, or what has become known as metadata. Your life and pursuits are less important than the statistical profile of the way you use your digital devices. This is the world of big data. I remember the days when talking about such possibilities was considered conspiracy theory or paranoia. Many of us imagined a future in which people would be planted with chips that monitor our conversations and whereabouts. Perhaps we'd even accept such tagging voluntarily, if it meant being able to track down our children in the unlikely event of a kidnapping. What does the Verizon order mean for me? But such extraordinary measures proved unnecessary; we're all walking around with tracking devices in our pockets, which are capable not simply of broadcasting our phone calls, but our physical locations, our movements, our interests -- and then tying all this data to our consumer profiles, credit histories ... everything. Yes, it's still creepy, but it's a different kind creepy than it appears. Big data analysis works by identifying patterns and anomalies in our behavior. Nobody cares about the reasons why certain people do certain things. They only need to be able to predict the future. Marketers use big data profiling to predict who is about to get pregnant, who is likely to buy a new car, and who is about to change sexual orientations. That's how they know what ads to send to whom. The NSA, meanwhile, wants to know who is likely to commit an act of terrorism -- and for this, they need us. The only way for them to identify the kinds of statistical anomalies that point to a terror candidate is to have a giant database of all those behavior patterns that don't suggest imminent violence. What is different about the Tsarnaev brothers' patterns of telephone usage from that of every other young male Chechen immigrants? You need both sets of data to figure that out. We are not the targets so much as the control group. Opinion: The great privacy debate . Of course, that's small comfort to a people who have long valued and assumed some measure of privacy from government observation. The American assumption of privacy allows those of us who do break certain laws -- say, smoking pot or engaging in prostitution -- from the fear of selective enforcement if we happen to be personal or political enemies of those in charge. As recent Internal Revenue Service scandals prove, our most trusted agencies are not above targeted investigations of ideological foes. The harder truth to accept is that we are moving into a digital reality where the assumption of privacy must be exchanged for an assumption of observation. Our telephone metadata is just the tip of the iceberg. Sure, President Barack Obama was quick to respond to the surprise discovery of his administration's covert surveillance operation, promising Americans that the leaked document describes the full extent of this technological intrusion on our privacy. But this court order was already ""top secret."" Had it not been uncovered, its provisions would have been denied as well. My own friends in the digital telephony and networking industries have long told me about ""splitters"" at all major communications companies, through which every data signal can be observed and diverted. Other technicians have told me about giant server farms in Virginia and Utah, where all of our digital data -- including encrypted e-mails and phone calls -- are being stored. No, they don't have the technological ability or legal authority to search this tremendous repository of data (if it really exists). But they may at some point in the future. Besides, the lack of court orders authorizing a particular style of surveillance don't stop any of this surveillance from happening. It simply makes any information collected inadmissible in a court of law. Since the dawn of the Internet, I have always operated under the assumption that if the government or corporations have technological capability to do something, they are doing it -- whatever the laws we happen to know about might say. Digital media are biased toward replication and storage. Our digital photos practically upload and post themselves on Facebook, and our most deleted e-mails tend to resurface when we least expect it. Yes, everything you do in the digital realm may as well be broadcast on prime-time television and chiseled on the side of the Parthenon. Does this excuse our government's behavior? Of course not. But the silver lining here is that this digital transparency cuts both ways. No sooner does the government win a court order to spy on us than the digital trail of that court order is discovered and leaked to the press. The government's panicky surveillance of Associated Press reporters and disproportionate prosecution of WikiLeaks participants lay bare its own inability to contend with the transparency of digital communications. It is disheartening and disillusioning to realize that our government knows every digital thing we say or do. But now, at least we know they know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: NSA collecting call records from Verizon should not be surprising .
He says we hand out vast amounts of personal info about ourselves via smartphones .
He says NSA wants call info for database to help track terrorists, and we are control group .

"(CNN) -- In 2005, about two weeks after 52 people in London were killed in bombings targeting the English city's mass transit system, terrorists decided to strike again. A police CCTV camera observes people walking in central London. Similar to the July 7 attacks, they chose the city's transit system -- three subway trains and a double-decker bus -- as the targets. But this time, four homemade bombs stuffed into backpacks did not fully explode. One person was injured. About a day later, photographs of four suspects were broadcast on television. Their images had been captured on surveillance cameras near the sites of the attempted attacks. The remarkable speed of that investigation was repeated in June this year when terrorists attempted to detonate two car bombs in London. Aided by surveillance cameras, British investigators began unraveling the plot later that day and tracked the suspects to Glasgow, Scotland. Several suspects were soon arrested. Police officials credited the ""Ring of Steel"" -- a network of thousands of surveillance cameras that line London's intersections and neighborhoods -- for providing license plate numbers, suspects' image and other important clues in investigations. New York City, specifically lower Manhattan, the site of two terror attacks, will have a similar system in place by the decade's end if it gets the needed funding. Police officials say the surveillance cameras can help combat crime and terrorism, perhaps even deter it. Civil liberties advocates say such systems are a threat to privacy rights and another step for a society creeping toward a constant state of surveillance. The implementation of the plan, called the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, will require about $90 million, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. It will cost about $8 million a year to maintain. The city so far has raised about $25 million. Part of it has come from the Homeland Security Department and the rest from city coffers. Kelly said the money being spent on the system is well worth it. ""The 1.7 square miles of lower Manhattan are arguably one of the most valuable and sensitive pieces of real estate in the world,"" he said during a telephone interview. The area includes the New York Stock Exchange, the Mercantile Stock Exchange, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the site where the World Trade Center once stood and where the Freedom Tower is being built. The system has four components: license plate readers, surveillance cameras, a coordination center and roadblocks that can swing into action when needed. The primary purpose of the system is deterrence, and then an investigative tool, Kelly said. The license plate readers will be in place by the end of the year. The rest of the plan is scheduled to be completed during the next two years. New York City already has many cameras located in its airports, banks, department stores and corporate buildings. The city's law enforcement uses them when needed as part of a public-private partnership, Kelly said. Such partnerships can be found in many cities across the United States, including Washington D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; and Chicago, Illinois. Baltimore police officials told CNN the city had 500 cameras and crime was reduced by 17 percent in neighborhoods where they are located. ""The feedback from the community has been fantastic, and in fact, most people want cameras in their neighborhoods,"" said Maj. Dave Engel of the Baltimore Police Department. Atlanta Police Deputy Chief Peter Andresen said the city had applied for federal funding to implement a surveillance camera system of its own. Atlanta has a public-private partnership in several of its neighborhoods that gives police access to cameras, he said. He recalled a drug deal being busted because someone monitoring a camera grew suspicious of two cars idling in a parking lot with their hoods up for a long time. ""We feel that [the cameras] go a long way toward preventing crime,"" he said. But Steve Swain, who served for years with the London Metropolitan Police and its counter-terror operations, doubts the power of cameras to deter crime. ""I don't know of a single incident where CCTV has actually been used to spot, apprehend or detain offenders in the act,"" he said, referring to the London system. Swain now works for Control Risk, an international security firm. Asked about their role in possibly stopping acts of terror, he said pointedly: ""The presence of CCTV is irrelevant for those who want to sacrifice their lives to carry out a terrorist act."" Kelly disagreed, pointing out that it is practically impossible to know what has been deterred. ""We don't know acts that may have been planned that -- because of the surveillance and deterrence systems that are in place -- did not go forward."" Swain does believe the cameras have great value in investigation work. He also said they are necessary to reassure the public that law enforcement is being aggressive. ""You need to do this piece of theater so that if the terrorists are looking at you, they can see that you've got some measures in place,"" he said. Privacy advocates said they are concerned about the possible abuse of surveillance power. Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was alarmed by the prospect of government and law enforcement officials having records of a person's daily activities. ""It wasn't that long ago that J. Edgar Hoover was up to his dirty tricks using government spying to interfere with lawful dissent, undermine critics and pursue an unlawful agenda,"" she said. However, police officials repeatedly note there is no expectation of privacy in a public area and it is not a constitutional right. A majority of Americans said they approved of the use of surveillance cameras by nearly a 3 to 1 margin in a recently published ABC News/Washington Post poll. Jeffery Rosen, a professor at George Washington University and the author of two books on privacy issues, said the poll reflected the fact that ""the arguments against the cameras tend to be abstract, whereas people's desire for security is understandable and immediate."" ""But I think many people can understand life would be different in a world where, literally, government authorities could click on pictures of you at any point in the day and retrace your movements 24/7,"" he said. Lieberman said privacy is not a quaint notion despite a rapidly changing world. ""Technology is an unstoppable train,"" she said. ""The question is whether we can maximize the benefits and minimize the harms."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- At least 21 people were killed and dozens wounded in shootings and explosions across Iraqi on Friday, officials say. The deadliest attack occurred in the neighborhood of Dora, southern Baghdad, where twin improvised explosive devices were detonated near an ice-cream shop. Officials told CNN seven people -- including children -- died in the blasts and 18 others were wounded. In Al-Sayidia, southwest Baghdad, three people died and 11 were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded outside a Sunni mosque. A bomb at a busy outdoor market southeast of Baghdad killed four more people and wounded nine. Other shootings and explosions across the country killed seven people and wounded 31. This week in Iraq was a bloody one as more than 120 people were killed in acts of violence. On Thursday, a suicide car bombing killed at least 25 people and injured 40 others at an outdoor market in al-Sadiya, about 140 kilometers (nearly 87 miles) northeast of Baghdad, police said. The attack came the day after shootings and bombings left at least 60 dead and dozens injured. Most of the deaths occurred in Baghdad, where eight car bombs and two roadside bombs were detonated in predominantly Shiite areas. Sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites, and political unrest have festered in recent months. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq estimates at least 979 Iraqis -- 852 of them civilians -- were killed in October alone.","At least 21 people were killed in shootings and explosions across Iraq Friday, officials say.

"(CNN) -- There is a lot to be said for enjoying the work that you do. ""Downtime would probably just get me into trouble,"" Freddie Roach said jokingly. Roach, one of the most sought-after boxing trainers in the sport, loves coming to work each and every day, and he says it's that passion that helps him deal with Parkinson's disease. ""I have a job I like to go to, and not everyone in the world can say that,"" he said. The five-time trainer of the year has worked with the likes of Mike Tyson, Oscar De La Hoya and James Toney. But his star pupil by far is current World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao. Roach, 51, is a former boxer but he admits his career didn't go exactly the way he envisioned it. ""I put everything into this sport and didn't get much out of it,"" he said. ""I was a little frustrated with my life."" He retired in 1987 after 54 professional bouts and became a trainer later that year. The Parkinson's diagnosis came a few years later. ""I've been on medication since 1992, and I've been holding my own,"" he said. ""I've been very functional."" Whether boxing contributed to or caused Roach to develop Parkinson's disease is unknown. Roach and his doctors say his condition could have been trauma-induced. But Parkinson's disease also runs in Roach's family.

"(CNN) -- A former Massachusetts chemist has indicated she will plead guilty to charges stemming from an investigation into how she allegedly mishandled sensitive evidence affecting thousands of state criminal cases dating to 2003, according to a source with knowledge of the agreement. In an open door lobby conference last week, Annie Dookhan asked prosecutors and the judge overseeing her case what the ramifications would be if she were to change her plea from not guilty to guilty, according to the source. Prosecutors indicated they would seek a minimum of a five- to seven-year sentence if Dookhan were to plead guilty. Her lawyer, Nicholas Gordon, asked for a one-year maximum sentence, according to the source. ""After consideration of the submissions of the parties and the arguments of counsel before this judge on October 18, 2013, I have decided that, if the defendant were to plead guilty before me, I would not exceed a sentence of three to five years in state prison, with a probationary term to follow,"" Suffolk Superior Court Justice Carol Ball said, according to court documents. Dookhan, 34, is facing 27 counts, including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. The list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering by the former Massachusetts chemist has grown to more than 40,000, according to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers, who alleged her work might be unreliable. The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly had tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely ""dry labbing"" samples. ""Dry labbing"" is a term used for visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test. Authorities arrested Dookhan at her home in Franklin, Massachusetts, in September 2012. Dookhan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In a statement from the Massachusetts attorney general's office, spokesman Brad Puffer said: ""It is the defendant's decision whether or not to plead guilty and the judge's decision to determine the sentence. Our office has not agreed to any plea deal and we are prepared to go to trial and prove our case before a jury. The defendant has indicated to the court that she will likely change her plea to guilty."" A hearing in Dookhan's case that was scheduled for Wednesday has been canceled. A new change of plea hearing has been scheduled for November 22, when Dookhan is expected to plead guilty. Dookhan's attorney, Nicholas Gordon, could not be reached for comment Monday. CNN's Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.","Annie Dookhan, accused of mishandling drug evidence, asked about possible sentences .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Open any fashion magazine and you're instantly bombarded with a collection of blindingly beautiful celebrities, bedazzled with shimmering jewels and perfectly coiffed ""messy hair."" Anna Boccia Lewis has been a DVF fan since the 1970s. Do you own a wrap dress? Tell us why. They teeter on gorgeous stilettos strutting their perfectly toned figures in clothing that could cost as much as a typical mortgage. Close that same fashion magazine -- or maybe ever-so-gently hurl it at the wall -- and perhaps you're left feeling slightly inadequate and envious. After all, why should we be left out of all the fun just because we can't afford the clothing in the magazine? But there is one fashion item that has arguably been bridging the gap for more than three decades between the wealthy elite and the average woman. This item is Diane Von Furstenberg's wrap dress. Just like the ""Little Black Dress,""  Furstenberg's wrap dress is considered an essential in many womens' wardrobes. Diane Von Furstenberg, or DVF as she's known, sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s. ""It has been a unique phenomenon, "" the Belgian designer told CNN. ""What was new about my wrap dress was that I did it in jersey and therefore it molded the body and it was very flattering to the body."" Technically speaking, a wrap dress is like a kimono. ""It's a very traditional form of clothing, it's a dress that has no buttons and no zipper,"" said Von Furstenberg. Since its inception, millions have flown off the racks. But that isn't to say the dress didn't see its dark periods as well. There was a time when the trend for wrap dresses was declared over, but like any good (or bad) fashion, it experienced a revival. ""Fashion changed completely and things went away,"" said Von Furstenberg. ""Ten years ago I started again because I saw that very hip young girls were buying them in thrift shops."" That trend continues today. While the dresses are stocked in DVF stores, they are regularly bought and sold in vintage stores and through online auction sites, such as eBay. ""My love affair with the DVF wrap dress began in the 1970s,"" says Anna Boccia Lewis, a self-confessed ""DVF addict"" from California. ""One of my first purchases was a yellow floral vintage DVF shirtdress that I found at Goodwill in South San Francisco for $4.75. ""I think what I love the most about Diane's designs is that each one has its own special personality -- just like the woman who is wearing it,"" Anna said. CNN asked other women to tell us what it is about DVF dresses that make them so special. Tell us your story -- ""Sound Off"" below. ""They make me feel not only sexy, but successful, sophisticated and timeless,"" said Carolyn Yapp, a 24-year-old DVF devotee from Jamaica. Melissa Calivis Green from Baltimore told us: ""For me, the iconic prints represent a sense of powerful femininity and the promise of endless possibilities."" Tracey Jennings of the United Kingdom has been wearing DVF dresses for the last ten years. She said: ""Like a lot of women, I have varied in size from year to year. As a result, my wrap dresses range from size four to size 10."" Kirsty Palmer, also from the United Kingdom, recently sold one of her DVF dresses on eBay. ""I like to change my selection,"" she said. ""Buying vintage wrap dresses makes them more affordable for me, yet I still get the benefit as if I were buying new due to their classic cuts and their durability."" Do you own a wrap dress?

"(CNN) -- Calling his drug possession conviction a ""wake-up call,"" U.S. Rep. Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program. ""I have no excuse for what I have done. I have let down our country,"" he said at a news conference Wednesday night, hours after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine. He said he will donate his salary to charity while he's away. Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to Fort Myers, Florida, Wednesday night. Earlier in the day, he was in a Washington, D.C. courtroom answering to the misdemeanor charge. He was sentenced to a year of probation. ""I will be going into treatment, and I'm going to start with intensive, in-patient treatment,"" Radel said. ""That's what's next for me. I have already begun the process. Sometimes in life you need a wake-up call. This is my wake-up call."" During the brief news conference, the 37-year-old, first-term Republican from Florida said he ""grew up with a mom who struggled with alcoholism."" ""I don't want my son to struggle with that,"" he said. Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife. ""My wife is my rock, and she has been so supportive through this,"" he said. ""I have to mend her heart which I've broken, and I've broken a lot of hearts."" The hearing . The plea and sentence were part of a deal that Radel's attorney struck with federal prosecutors. He could have received a maximum sentence of 180 days imprisonment or a $1,000 fine, or both. Instead, he was placed on one year probation, and if it is ""successfully completed,"" his guilty plea will be cleared from his record. ""Your honor, I apologize for what I've done,"" Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday. ""I think in life I've hit a bottom where I realize I need help."" Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones. The sting . He was charged after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover police officer in Washington's Dupont Circle area on October 29, court documents say. Who is Trey Radel? It was a sting that stemmed from a broader FBI/Drug Enforcement Administration investigation of a drug trafficking organization in the nation's capital, law enforcement officials told CNN on condition of anonymity. The targets of the investigation are dealers and high-level people in the organization, not buyers and users. But a dealer who was arrested last month told federal agents that one of his customers was a congressman, one of the law enforcement officials said. So, deciding they couldn't turn away from that, agents set up the sting, the law enforcement officials said. The admission . Court documents say Radel gave the undercover officer $260 for the cocaine outside a restaurant, and the two got into the officer's vehicle, where the officer gave Radel the cocaine. Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents. Radel then agreed to talk to the agents in his apartment, where he admitted he bought cocaine, according to the documents. ""The defendant also retrieved and provided to the agents a vial of cocaine that he had in his apartment,"" the court documents say. The background . A tea party favorite, Radel was elected last year to represent southwest Florida's 19th Congressional District. He is a former journalist and TV news anchor, having worked for WINK in Fort Myers, Florida. He also owned and eventually sold the Naples Journal newspaper, according to a biography on his congressional website. Radel is married with a young son. He is active on Twitter, where he posts about touring the Capitol, listening to hip-hop, playing guitar and opposing Obamacare. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said in a prepared statement this week that members of Congress ""should be held to the highest standards, and the alleged crime will be handled by the courts."" ""Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents,"" Boehner's spokesman said.

"(CNN) -- When flight attendants needed help with a disruptive passenger, Mets pitcher LaTroy Hawkins didn't balk.

Hawkins, 40, tweeted about the experience, which he said interrupted his American Airlines flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Santiago, Chile, where the ballplayer planned to go dove hunting. Hawkins said a passenger became upset when a flight attendant told him he couldn't sit in an open seat in business class. ""They started to wrestle and landed in my lap,"" Hawkins tweeted.

"Washington (CNN) -- A team of engineers will delay until Wednesday their plans to rappel down the sides of the Washington Monument, a photographer for the contractor said Tuesday, citing bad weather as the cause. ""They plan to start first thing in the morning,"" photographer Ryan Pratzel told CNN as rain and possible thunderstorms approached. The engineers will be looking for damage caused by the August earthquake. ""The engineering team and the rappelling team, a combination of people from Denali National Park in Alaska as well as from an engineering firm, will come out of the windows at the 500-foot level,"" said Bill Line, spokesman for the National Park Service. ""What they will do is do a very close visual inspection to check to see if there are any smaller cracks that were sustained during the earthquake,"" Line said. Engineers will work ""to determine whether those cracks could, in the next couple of years, grow."" Officials need to ""get up close"" and search for possible damage, Line said. The concerns stem from the August 23 earthquake, which shook much of the East Coast. The Park Service said Monday that the interior assessment found the monument is structurally sound. ""The heaviest damage appears to be concentrated at the very top of the monument, in what is called the pyramidion, where large cracks of up to 1-1/4 inch wide developed through stone and mortar joints,"" said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Daylight is visible through some of the cracks, and rain water has gotten into the monument, which could cause further damage. The difficult-access rappelling team -- which includes members of the firm of Wiss, Janney and Elstner -- will scale the outside of the structure to get a closer look. They will install climbing ropes and safety lines on all four sides, then clip onto those lines, Vogel said. Weather permitting, they will climb up the pyramidion and then descend the length of the monument looking for exterior damage. On Monday, the Park Service put on its web page video of the interior of the monument that was shot during the earthquake. It shows park rangers and tourists rushing down the stairs as debris falls onto the observation deck. The video also shows a ranger, Niki Williams, helping visitors and remaining calm. ""She had the presence of mind, she had the composure, to make certain that she got people down to the 490-foot level and started walking down the stairs,"" said Line. ""She showed a lot of courage, in fact, by coming back up to the 500-foot level to collect the last remaining visitors and to ensure their safety and put their safety ahead of her own in order to get everybody out safely. So we're extremely proud of the work she has done."" In a few weeks, after the exterior assessment is completed, the Park Service expects to come up with a timeline to reopen the monument to the public. The Washington Monument, built between 1848 and 1884, is 555 feet, 5-1/8 inches tall. Its walls, 15-feet thick at the base and 18-inches at the top, are composed primarily of white marble blocks, according to the Park Service. The monument ""is not going anywhere,"" Vogel said. ""It is a testament to the original builders that the monument has withstood not just this earthquake but an even larger one in the late 1800s."" CNN's Sally Holland and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Weather delay means the team will try again Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- In 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan defended the highly divisive renovation of Taksim Square in central Istanbul by invoking history. Referring to the plan to build a replica of a monumental 19th century Ottoman army barracks that once stood there, he said: ""We are working to bring back history that has been destroyed. ...We will unite Taksim with its history."" As it turned out, Erdoğan's attempt to unite Taksim with its history has revealed very deep fissures in Turkish culture. Starting at the end of May, more and more opponents of the renovations began gathering in the square. Protests evolved into a general condemnation of the government, becoming more chaotic, with police attacking protesters with water cannons and tear gas. Thousands have been injured and at least two protesters and one police officer have died. The demonstrations have spread to other cities. Although Erdoğan has claimed to be open to ""democratic demands,"" he has denied the legitimacy of all the public unrest. A day after the prime minister proposed talks with protesters, bulldozers and riot police swept through the square and blanketed the area with tear gas. Chaos and standoffs between police and protesters continue. Turkey looks for 'legitamite protestors' Debating the causes of the conflict, some commentators focus on the role of Islam in Turkey; others emphasize disagreements about the nature of Turkish democracy, the lack of civil liberties, or the nascent environmentalist movement, which was stirred by plans to take down trees in the square's Gezi Park. All these played a role in igniting unrest, but the issues surrounding the reconstruction of the Ottoman Taksim Military Barracks in particular point to deep unresolved historical tensions within the Republic of Turkey. The protesters and the government are engaging not only in a battle for their park and perhaps their country's future, but also for control over the past. When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic of Turkey in 1923, after years of war, he was embraced by a population eager to return to the days of the great Caliphs. But Atatürk chose, instead, to modernize, Westernize, and secularize the country. He disbanded the Caliphate, secularized the education system, outlawed Sufi Islam, enforced gender equality, Westernized the Turkish alphabet, and famously banned the fez. But these radical and sometimes ruthless steps, especially those that ran counter to perceived Islamic mores, engendered deep resentment and resistance. Opinion: From victim to villain, Erdogan's unfinished transformation . In the last decade, Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party, known as AKP, have exploited that resistance as an element in their rise to power. Under AKP rule, the Ottoman past has re-emerged in a culturally powerful way. The movie ""Fetih 1453,"" a highly dramatized account of the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, had the biggest budget in the history of Turkish cinema, an investment handsomely rewarded by its box office returns. Turkish television is full of Ottoman-era dramas and soap operas, including the wildly successful ""Magnificent Century,"" set in the era of the famous emperor Suleiman the Magnificent. More and more aspects of elite Turkish culture embrace Ottoman architecture, fashion and even food. But according to some opponents of the AKP, the cultural embrace of Ottoman history promotes a political agenda of regional domination. The decision to rebuild a symbol of Ottoman militarism, the Taksim Military Barracks, like the decision to name the new Bosphorus bridge after Sultan Selim I, conqueror of the Arab world, feeds this speculation. In popular Turkish culture, the Taksim Barracks are associated with the killing of Christian army officers in 1909, while the Alevis -- a large minority group in Turkey -- remember Selim I as the murderer of their people. Thus, both bridge and barracks pit one view of history against another. But the Ottomans were not merely expansionary conquerors, nor were they generally devoted to Islamic purity. At their best, the Sultans ruled over a surprisingly pluralistic society that enabled people of diverse religions and ethnicities to flourish and live in relative autonomy. Both non-Turkish Muslims and non-Muslims rose to great heights of political power. Jews fled from Christian persecutions into Ottoman territory. In the wake of the riots, elements of this Ottoman legacy have begun to emerge as well. Devrim Evin, who played Sultan Mehmet II in ""Fetih 1453,"" declined to join Istanbul's formal celebration of the 560th anniversary of the conquest of Constantinople. Instead, joining actors from ""Magnificent Century,"" he went to Gezi Park to support the protests. Thus, the protesters were treated to actors playing Mehmet the Conqueror and Suleyman the Magnificent marching and tweeting alongside them. Evin, like Erdoğan, invoked Ottoman history. He said, just before the violence began, that Mehmet preserved the Orthodox basilica Hagia Sophia when he took the city. ""Such were our ancestors,"" he said. ""They preserved things, did not destroy or tear down."" As with any turbulent situation, it's hard to predict what will happen in Gezi Park or within the broader cycles of social unrest emerging in Turkey. Erdoğan looks unlikely to back down, at least not without a huge loss of face. Because the AKP has enjoyed broad popular support for its agenda, it will require internal pressure from within the movement to push Erdoğan toward a consensus settlement. But even if issues involving Taksim Square are eventually resolved without greater riots and brutality, the question of the meaning and relevance of the Ottoman past remains powerful. In ""Fetih 1453,"" Mehmet proclaims, ""Making history is no job for cowards."" The events unfolding in Taksim remind us that remembering history can be just as dangerous as making it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Perry.","David Perry: Plan to reconstruct Ottoman era barracks in Taksim Square revealed deep divisions .
When Atatürk modernized Turkey, he says, many resented parting with old Islamic ways .
Perry: Prime minister and his AKP party exploited that resentment in their rise to power .

"(CNN) -- Just ten miles south of the Polish city of Krakow is a remarkable place carved from salt. Hidden 1,000 feet (305 meters) underground lies a dimly-lit labyrinth of subterranean chambers, with saline lakes, horses' stables, a chapel and even a salt-sculpted hall. Decorated with elaborate sculptures -- the most astounding perhaps being ""The Last Supper"" carved into a rock salt wall -- even the crystals of the chapel's chandeliers are hewn from salt, dissolved and reconstituted to resemble glass. It might sound like something out of a Jules Verne novel, but the Wieliczka salt mine is not science fiction but one of Poland's 13 UNESCO Cultural World Heritage sites, many of which date back to the medieval period. Warsaw's Old Town (meticulously reconstructed after 85% of the capital's historic center was destroyed during the war) and Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp are must-visit spots. But beyond them, you can find hundreds of years' worth of fairytale-like medieval history. Deeper underground . Few places capture the imagination like the salt mine at Wieliczka, believed to have been completed in 1280. Tourists can delve into its depths on guided tours. ""You see a little more than 1% of the mine on the tourist route,"" said Marek Strojny, a guide for more than 20 years. Consider that the tourist route is three kilometers (1.8 miles) long and takes three hours to explore. ""It would take years to see all of the mine,"" said Strojny. ""There are nine levels, with 300 kilometers (186 miles) of tunnels and more than 3,000 chambers."" Tourists view the mine at just over 300 feet (91 meters) below the surface, but its intricacies continue down for more than double that depth. Mining here was dangerous work; there were cave-ins, and occasional methane explosions. This accounts for why the miners built the chapel in the 14th century -- they prayed constantly for their safety, and carved religious figures in their spare time. (Strojny estimated ""The Last Supper"" alone would have taken a year to complete.) However, the job came with its perks. ""There was great respect for the miners among the community on the surface,"" he noted. ""And they were given privileges by Polish kings. For example, each worker was allowed to carry three kilograms of salt to the surface with them each month and sell it. Salt was (a valuable) preservative and was almost as expensive as silver."" ""Vampires"" in Krakow . The salt would doubtless have been traded at Krakow's Rynek Glowny, the largest medieval market square in Europe and the site of another intriguing underground voyage. In 2005, an archaeological dig in the square was intended to last six months, but stretched into five years, such was the volume of treasures exhumed. The result is Rynek Underground, a subterranean museum built under the square. ""The square has risen about four meters since early medieval times,"" said Dominik Lulewicz, an archaeologist at the museum. ""Over the years, the debris from earlier phases (of the square's history) was spread across its surface."" READ MORE: Krakow becomes world center for literature . While the entire historical center of Krakow is a UNESCO site, the 40,000 square meters of Rynek Glowny is its beating heart. In the 14th and 15th centuries it was a major center of European trade, abuzz with merchants selling everything from luxury goods (such as silks and spices) to cloth and lead. As well as seeing some of those treasures, visitors to the museum can also see reconstructions of burial sites that were discovered during the dig, including what Lulewicz called ""anti-vampiric burials"". ""There are a few with tied hands and legs, probably due to the remains of Pagan beliefs,"" he said. Choosing their religion . Diversity of belief is a uniting facet of Poland's UNESCO heritage sites. Among the prettiest listed monuments are the wooden churches of Malopolska. Winding through the looming mountains and sprawling fields of this picturesque pocket of south east Poland, are 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of trails that take hikers past striking examples of timber churches in everything from Roman Catholic to Greek Orthodox styles. READ MORE: Bison thrive in Poland's wild woods . ""The multicultural history of Poland is marked by the variety of houses of worship from different periods,"" said MaÅ‚gorzata Trelka, of the National Heritage Board of Poland. She pointed to the 18th and 19th century wooden mosques that can be found in north east Poland by way of example. Indeed, Trelka revealed that a 14th UNESCO site has been approved -- wooden Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, in the Carpathian mountain range. And yet another enduring example of Poland's long tradition of religious tolerance is the UNESCO-listed Churches of Peace in Jawor and Swidnica. These 17th century Protestant churches were permitted by a Catholic emperor following the Thirty Years war, which had sprung from those very religions' rivalry. But maybe what unites these sites most of all is that, whether deep underground or spread throughout the countryside, Poland is rich in a tangible cultural landscape.","Poland has 13 cultural UNESCO world heritage sites .

"(CNN) -- If you've read Suzanne Collins' ""Hunger Games"" trilogy, then the odds are ever in your favor when it comes to cocktail party conversations about Katniss, the Mockingjay and the Quarter Quell. If you haven't, then that was all gibberish ... but it doesn't have to be. As ""Catching Fire,"" the second movie in the series, comes to theaters November 22 we've got all the information you need to dazzle friends with your talk of Effie Trinket and Caesar Flickerman in our ""HG 101"" -- as well as some insider facts about the movie that'll make even the most hardcore fans feel a little more informed before heading into the arena. Happy ""Hunger Games""! The games . HG 101: Every year in post-apocalyptic Panem, two tributes, aka children, from each district are selected in a public reaping to compete in the win-or-die Hunger Games. But every 25 years, there's a Quarter Quell, where a dark twist makes the games even more treacherous. As punishment to heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) -- who not only outwitted the Hunger Games, but also ensured her partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) survived too (unprecedented!) -- the Quarter Quell finds them back in the arena, competing against other past winners. As if that weren't enough, there's also a love triangle, family drama, a score to settle, several districts to save and an uprising that can't be quieted. With evil monkeys and even more evil victors from previous games to battle, it's a lot for one movie to tackle, but the tributes in ""Catching Fire"" are more fully-formed characters, and they help set the story apart and keep the conflict interesting. Expert tip: These games are getting darker and sexier. Yes, the very premise of kids fighting to the death for the public's amusement ensures that there's a dark thread throughout the entire story, but the look and feel of ""Fire"" is darker as well, with new director Francis Lawrence amping up the action and suspense. And while costume designer Trish Summerville didn't allow tributes to be nearly nude as in the books, she did pull some form-fitting designer duds for them to wear. The fandom is growing up, and the movies are following suit. The big question: With several big names joining the cast, are there any new standouts? Sam Claflin shines as cocky tribute Finnick Odair, and Jenna Malone makes an equally splashy (and equally clothing-free) entrance as Johanna, who's good with an axe, but takes a bit to warm up to. Both have great moments with Katniss. 'Hunger Games' theme park? We have some ideas . The love triangle . HG 101: So there's this girl Katniss and she's a total badass, and she's basically best buds with the male version of her, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), but she gets sent off to the Hunger Games with Peeta, saves his life a million times and now all the viewers want them to be an item. So they sort of are. Besides fighting for basic survival, the Quarter Quell gives them more time together to explore their relationship, for real and for the cameras. The love triangle is what grounds the entire series in reality, and it ain't over until it's over, so don't expect anything to be decided halfway through the series' four-movie run. Expert take: Peeta might not be such a bad option for Katniss after all! Fans of the books were outraged that -- spoiler alert! -- Katniss ended up with Peeta after so clearly having a stronger connection with Gale. Peeta always seemed like too much of a damsel in distress for our Katniss, but in ""Catching Fire,"" Peeta is stronger and more independent -- and he can swim, so thankfully you won't have to see a near-drowning when they enter the water-filled arena. We wish he'd get a skill a little more exciting than painting his body with mud to be camouflaged, but we'll take any improvement on the character we can get. The big question: What about Gale? While Gale is once again on the sidelines for most of the movie, he does have a particularly haunting scene in ""Catching Fire"" that stays somewhat true to the book. The big difference? This time the changes leave the door open for Gale to really make his presence (and his intentions with Katniss) known in the two-part ""Mockingjay"" final installments. They've got Hemsworth -- they're going to use him! A brief history of young adult literature . The Capitol . HG 101: While the tributes from the districts must compete to take their next breath, residents of the Capitol are the 1%. Their excess knows no bounds, but they're still human. While they felt like caricatures in the first movie, ""Catching Fire"" reveals some chinks in the otherwise bedazzled armor, all thanks to Katniss and her act of rebellion that's now sparked a revolution. Expert tip: Yes, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is still the most stylish tribute sympathizer, but Effie Trinket is more lovable than ever. In ""The Hunger Games,"" Effie (Elizabeth Banks) epitomized everything the Capitol stood for: fashion, material things, excess and an obliviousness to the real issues in the districts around them. But as the stakes of the games are raised, so are Effie's concerns, and seeing cracks in her very colorful faÃ§ade helps make her more than a one-note character. We saw glimpses of her conscience in the books but, onscreen, Banks takes her from unemotional escort to compassionate cog in the wheel. The big question: Who's the new big bad? After the execution of ""Hunger Games"" gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), who ignored orders and let both Katniss and Peeta win, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) steps in -- and he's not going to make the same weak mistakes as his predecessor. With direct orders from President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make sure Katniss doesn't survive the 75th Games, he becomes the scariest new villain in the Capitol and the biggest potential threat. The role feels tailor-made for Hoffman. With the Panem rebellion in full swing, and Katniss as their poster child, there's more to prove in this 75th Hunger Games than ever before. Alliances will be tested and monkey mutts and Jabberjays will terrorize the returning victors, all while the clock is ticking to save their families, their districts and themselves.
