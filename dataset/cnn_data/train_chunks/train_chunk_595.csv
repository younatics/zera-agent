A gang of burglars spent four hours dismantling a wall 'brick-by-brick' to break into a jewellery shop. The gang were caught on CCTV casually chatting and smoking as they broke into Grace and Co in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire. Once inside, the raiders - whose faces were covered with hoods or masks - smashed glass display cabinets and grabbed a number of Pandora bracelets and charms. The value of the stolen items is still being calculated. The aftermath of the break-in after burglars mounted a four-hour operation to get through a wall into a jewellery shop . The shop's security cameras filmed the men outside the back of the shop as they took the external wall apart. The raiders were also filmed inside the shop, where they stayed for only two minutes. Shop manager Olivia Towey said: 'We have four hours of CCTV footage of them taking the wall apart, brick-by-brick. 'You can see them chatting and smoking. They seem to have known exactly what they were doing and what they were looking for.' Police believe the men began making the hole in the wall at 12.30am on Friday and left the shop at about 4.30am. Shop owner Mick McQuillan said: 'We sell a wide range of jewellery and watches but they were only interested in Pandora.

Detective Constable Alf Doyle said: 'The owners of the shop are understandably angry and upset their property has been taken and they are keen to have it returned. 'The suspects spent some time outside the premises while they made attempts to break in. Anyone who was in the area between 12.30am and 4.30am may have seen them at the shop.

A Premier League player has been left furious after he was victim of a gruesome prank by teammates who left a pig's head in his locker in the club's changing rooms. Kenwyne Jones, a striker for Stoke City, opened the locker to find a 'huge bloody pig's head in his clothes', according to his girlfriend, who today launched into an angry Twitter tirade directed at other players. Reports claim that Jones then smashed the car windscreen of another Stoke player in retaliation for the practical joke. The team's manager Tony Pulis today launched an investigation into the incident, which comes just two days before the final day of the Premier League season. Hamming it up: Brek Shea posted this image of him holding a pig's head in the Stoke changing room . Some players appeared to make light . of the prank - defender Brek Shea tweeted an image of someone holding up . a pig's head in the team's dressing room, captioned, 'Dressing room . banter gone wild!' The image, which the American posted on his Instagram page, shows a player holding the head by its ears, with what . appears to be a large gash in the middle of its head. It seems that the head at some point ended up in the locker belonging to Jones, a 28-year-old Trinidadian who has played for Stoke for three years. The footballer's girlfriend Kissa Abdullah wrote on Twitter: 'Big men acting like kids a pigs head is not a prank its just . disgusting!!!!! Wtf??? I don't get how was that sup 2 be funny!!!! Really??? 'They put a huge bloody pigs head in his clothes at training. He warned them 2 keep out of the banter or else! u kno the rest.' Anger: Kenwyne Jones' partner spoke out against the prank on her twitter, hinting at religious outrage . Not happy: Kenwyne Jones is believed to be the 'victim' of the prank, and is understood to be angry . She added: 'Listen 4 all those who don't get it lay the f! back! Where I . come from that's not anywhere close 2 funny! Esp not knowing religious . beliefs,' before concluding, 'It just takes a minute to be sensitive to . someone's beliefs no one says u . can't have a sense of humour but let it be a joke! This wasn't!' Some sources have suggested that Jones was so angry about the head that he attacked another player's car. Stoke City said in a statement: 'The Club takes seriously reports of an incident at our training ground this afternoon. 'A full internal investigation will be carried out and those responsible for any unacceptable behaviour will be dealt with in accordance with the Club's disciplinary procedures.' Happy Sunday: Michael Owen woke up to find his car caked in eggs and flour before his final game . Apparently not all the Stoke team were equally appalled at the joke. Heather Weir, girlfriend of Jones's teammate Jamie Ness, commented on the image saying: 'Totally love my boyfriend coming home to tell me a pig's head was . getting passed round the changing rooms!' This is not the first over-the-top prank to take place at Stoke in the past week. Michael Owen, the former England . legend who is retiring this season, was given an unwelcome send-off by . his team-mates ahead of his final home game. He posted a picture on Twitter of his . black Mercedes C63 covered in eggs and flour and wrote: 'This is what I . will miss once I hang up my boots!

Embarrassment for the CIA's wig-wearing Agent Blond deepened yesterday as it was revealed he was detained by the very FSB officer he was seeking to recruit. Undercover diplomat Ryan Fogle has been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West for his apparently amateurish Boy's Own approach to espionage in Moscow. But yesterday the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was hoping to lure to treachery wasted no time in personally apprehending him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities. Scroll down for video . Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . 'The man behaved like an officer . worthy of his name, detaining the recruiter and handing him over to . counterintelligence authorities' said an FSB source yesterday. 'He will continue to serve. There is no threat to his career.' The Russians have not named the . target of the CIA approach but he is believed to be a specialist in . terrorism linked to extremist Islamic groupings. Fogle called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him, it is claimed. Instead he ended up face on the . ground, and handcuffed, before being taken to the notorious Lubyanka HQ . of the secret services for questioning. FBI agents first came across the . Russian agent when they were given assistance by Moscow over the Boston . marathon bombings, it is understood. Fogle, 29, a third secretary in the . embassy's political department, was detained wearing a blond wig under . his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the FSB operative on the . night of May 13. In his possession, Fogle had another . wig, a compass, a map of Moscow, sunglasses, and a 'Dear Friend' letter - . apparently translated into Russian on Google - which offered $1 million . a year plus bonuses to the FSB man. Fogle has been ordered to leave Russia in the next few days. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. The FSB stressed yesterday that the . US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan . Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their . relations'. But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. Diplomat . Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the . FSB secret service – formerly the KGB. He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue . checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010. The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US . intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees . of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’","Pinned to the ground by Russian agent at secret meeting and led off for questioning on Monday .

Obsessed: The Old Bailey heard how Stuart Hazell used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp . Google is under pressure to act over the ease with which Stuart Hazell was able to use the internet to fuel his child-sex fantasies. Hazell was obsessed by paedophile websites and used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp. Police found searches including the terms ‘naked little girlies’, ‘illegal under-age incest pics’ and ‘schoolgirl abuse’ in his Google browser. There were also Google searches for ‘violent forced rape’, ‘little girls in glasses’, ‘daddy daughter pictures’ and ‘under-age incest galleries’, and he visited a child abuse website on August 6 last year – as Tia’s body lay hidden in the loft of the home he shared with her grandmother. Experts believe Hazell’s habitual use of violent and paedophile pornography on the internet saw him progress from petty criminal to child killer. Last night child safety charities, including the NSPCC, demanded Google introduce immediate controls to stop monsters such as Hazell from getting access to child pornography. John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘If these images were not available on the internet then men like Stuart Hazell might not go on to kill. ‘We cannot blame the internet for the likes of Stuart Hazell but it has opened pathways that lead them on to violent pornography and paedophile material.’ Scroll down for video . Campaigners say Google can 'do more' to block access to child pornography . Mr Carr wants web companies such as Google to trigger online warnings when attempts are made to access explicit sites. He also wants Google to make their ‘safe search’ facility the default on their web browser. He added: ‘That is something Google could do overnight.’ Jon Brown, of the NSPCC, said: ‘Google need to do more in terms of blocking searches for child abuse imagery but they also need to be alerting the authorities if someone is  blatantly doing these searches.’ Jim Gamble, the former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said the internet could create a ‘spiral of abuse’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like-minded people who normalised their behaviour. He added: ‘Ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world.’ Hazell had some 30 previous convictions dating back to the early 1990s for offences ranging from dishonesty, drug dealing and violence to a conviction for possessing a machete. He had no history of sex offences and there was no suggestion he was a threat to children. However the Old Bailey heard how he had become obsessed by pornography and had downloaded ‘extensive’ illegal images onto memory cards he had hidden at his home. Critics believe stopping monsters like Hazell accessing child porn could save victims like Tia Sharp in the future . He kept photographs and video clips showing Tia sleeping - and on one occasion filmed her as she rubbed cream on her legs in her underwear. Police also discovered a grotesque image of a girl believed to be Tia which is thought to have been taken after she died. The highly disturbing ‘keepsake’ image showed a naked girl, whose face cannot be seen, posed on all fours on a bloodied bed. Mr Brown added: ‘The use of imagery in sex offending is not new. The Moors Murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley photographed and filmed their victims. ‘But the internet means this kind of behaviour has taken on a new dimension. There are clearly some violent and particularly psychopathic who use the internet. ‘We are very concerned that the ease with which they can get child abuse images to fuel their fantasies.’ Police found Hazell had used Google on his mobile phone to access websites that glorified incest and child abuse. But his behaviour had escalated from accessing images of abuse online to actively seeking to spy on, photograph and film Tia. He is believed to have removed the bathroom door at Tia’s grandmother’s home so he could spy on the schoolgirl. And Hazell is also thought to have modified the light socket in her room to create a spyhole. Tia's mother Natalie Sharp hugs a loved one after Stuart Hazell was jailed for 38 years for her murder . A report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre has identified a link between viewing child porn online and ‘contact’ sexual offences against children. Jim Gamble, the former head of Ceop, said the internet could create a ‘spiral of abuse’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like-minded people who normalised their behaviour. He added: ‘Ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world.’ Hazell’s escalation in offending is similar to Vincent Tabak who murdered Joanna Yeates in Bristol in 2010 after becoming fixated with extreme pornography sites showing women being strangled. Miranda Suit from the Safetynet campaign which is calling for a family friendly internet believes Google should do more to block illegal images. She added: ‘The ease of access provided by the Internet means more people than ever before are going down that route.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously. When we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’","Stuart Hazell was obsessed by paedophile websites .

It found Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire was the fastest growing town on the list with dollar millionaire numbers rising there by 25% since 2007. That compares with a general decrease by 9% in the number of dollar millionaires in the UK as a whole over the same period. Majestic: Residents in Windsor enjoy stunning views of the castle and the River Thames . The research also found Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire has the highest average house prices outside London at £490,000 and the highest average income per household at £71,700.

Turkey has warned of reprisals after it accused the Syrian government of being linked to two car bombs that killed 46 people. The explosions in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, are the deadliest in Turkey since the start of Syria’s bloody civil war. They left the town of 60,000 people devastated, damaging more than 850 buildings and leaving a further 50 people in hospital.

Turkey has blamed pro-Damascus groups for the tragedy and is vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice .

The violent and deadly force of the explosions is clear and rescuers confront the enormity of the clean-up task . He said: ‘With their secret services and armed groups, they are certainly one of the usual suspects to instigate and carry out such an outrageous plot.’ Turkey, a Nato member, is a strong supporter of the opposition and has hosted its leaders, rebel commanders and thousands of refugees. Syria has accused the Turkish government of facilitating the flow of arms, explosives, vehicles, fighters and money to rebels across the border. And the bombings on Saturday have raised fears that Turkey is being pulled deeper into the uprising against Syria’s President Bashar Assad. Britain, the United States and Nato have all pledged to support Turkey in the dispute with Syria. Foreign secretary, William Hague, said yesterday: ‘We stand with the people of Turkey.’ The first bomb exploded outside the town hall on Saturday, the second detonated 15 minutes later beside a post office. Turkish foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu today said he believed fighters loyal to Syrian President Assad were responsible. A view of the exploded area in Hatay, Reyhanli District.

Our security forces will take all necessary measures.’ He also warned Syria against trying to . drive a wedge between Turkey and the thousands of refugees who had . arrived since the violence erupted in March 2011. After the explosions, Turks vented their anger by vandalising cars with Syrian number plates and attacking some refugees. Police had to fire weapons into the air to help restore order. Mr Davutoglu said the attacks ‘have . nothing to do with the Syrian refugees in Turkey, it’s got everything to . do with the Syrian regime.’ He said it was time for the . international community to take action against Syria, with the security . risks in Turkey and Syria’s other neighbours mounting. There has been an escalation in tension on the border for some months . Syria's regime is being blamed after several explosions killed at least 40 people and injured dozens in Reyhanli, near Turkey's border with the war-torn country . In Damascus, the Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi yesterday denied the Assad regime was behind the attacks. He said Syria ‘did not commit and would never commit such an act because our values would not allow it.’ Instead he claimed it was the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party that were responsible for the atrocity. Mr Zoubi demanded that Mr Erdogan ‘step down as a killer and as a butcher’. Mr Erdogan is due to meet President .

A woman cries at the scene of one of the explosion sites, after several explosions killed so many. The US has vowed to support Turkey in finding those responsible . The main opposition Syrian National Coalition said the attacks were a failed attempt to 'destroy the brotherhood' between Syrians and Turks . The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: ‘The United States condemns [the] car bombings and we stand with our ally, Turkey. ‘This awful news strikes an especially personal note for all of us given how closely we work in partnership with Turkey.’ The United States has provided humanitarian aid to the Syrian opposition, but has been reluctant to provide military aid. That’s in part because al-Qaida-linked militants are becoming increasingly influential in the armed opposition. The blasts took place right on the Syrian border in the town of Reyhanli .

A teenager accused of raping an 11-year-old girl in a park had attacked another schoolgirl a year before, a court heard. Opemipo Jaji, 18, is alleged to have followed the 11-year-old girl as she made her way home from school on a bus. He followed her and dragged her into Jubilee Park, Enfield, north London, and subjected her to a three-hour rape ordeal in November, last year, the court heard. Her glove had been stuffed in her mouth and she had been stripped and assaulted. Rosina Cottage, QC, prosecuting, said the child had caught a bus in Enfield Town along with her friend at 4.30pm. 'She was 11-year-old and was wearing her school uniform,' said Miss Cottage. 'She got on the bus with her friend and they were giggling and chatting. Also on the bus was a young male, the defendant. He watched her get off the bus and followed her. 'He dragged her into a local park in the dark and raped her. She ran home bleeding and injured. Her blood and DNA were found on his clothes and bag.' Miss Cottage said the girl had been expected home by 5pm and her parents rang police by 5.30 after she failed to turn up. The girl appeared at 8pm. 'She was dishevelled, dirty and panicky. 'She had a crop-top bra in her hand and said she had been attacked.' The girl said her attacker 'had kept making fists and cracking his knuckles'. She later told police that after getting off the bus, she noticed a male walking in front and then behind her. She had tried to avoid him because she felt something was not right. In the park, he kept asking for her phone - which she did not have - her Oyster travel card and her keys. At one point, he had threatened to stab her if she moved and caught her when she tried to run away. He had also threatened to film her and send copies to children at her school, she said. The girl ran home dishevelled and bleeding and underwent an operation for her injuries. Jaji, of Edmonton, north London, denies rape and says he was not the attacker, although he was on the same bus. He claims her DNA on his bag, trainer shoe and the waistband of his boxer shorts was from when he went into the park later that evening, the Old Bailey heard. But Rosina Cottage, QC, prosecuting, said it was 'not a coincidence' that in 2011, Jaji pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and robbing another girl dressed in her school uniform. Miss Cottage said a tie had been placed in her mouth, her clothes had been removed and she was robbed of her telephone and sexually assaulted. She added: 'He had an interest in pre-pubescent girls and sexual acts with pre-pubescent girls.' Blood belonging to Jaji’s victim was found on his trainers and Adidas bag and provided a one-in-a-billion DNA match, the court heard later. Police search teams in Jubilee Park in Enfield looking for clues at the time of the rape in November 2012 .

But he then changed his story and now says he . went to Jubilee Park to ‘think about his music’. ‘He says he must have picked up the traces of her DNA from the grass,’ said Ms Cottage. ‘The prosecution say this is a desperate attempt to find any explanation.’ The park was cordoned off for sniffer dog searches very shortly after the girl reported she had been attacked, she added. ‘He brutally terrified and raped her,’ said Ms Cottage.‘ . Jaji had attended an appointment with the probation service just 90 minutes before the attack, the court has heard. Jaji was arrested a few days later after CCTV was viewed, and his bedroom searched. A book was found about a little girl . being sexually assaulted, ads for child care vacancies and a picture of a . little girl in Australia marked FC - a possible reference to Facebook. There was also an article about missing April Jones 'the little girl who was taken,' said Miss Cottage. Miss Cottage outlined the attack on the schoolgirl in the park.

The 20-year-old, who lives in Canning Town, east London, said: 'He always looked after me, always provided for us when I couldn't provide for my two-year-old child. 'He always acted like my older brother, so protective of me. I bought him cupcakes because I thought he would be injured and I could just say to him, 'Don't get yourself into any more trouble'.

"By . Keith Gladdis and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 04:13 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:55 EST, 10 May 2013 . Abu Qatada yesterday made a shock offer to leave Britain  – as long as his human rights are protected. The Al Qaeda hate preacher has spent eight years fighting deportation to Jordan, inflicting a string of humiliating human rights court defeats on the Government and costing taxpayers £3.6million in the process. But Qatada’s lawyers now say he will board a plane without any further protest if Britain and Jordan ratify a treaty guaranteeing him a fair trial back home. Remaining in Britain? Abu Qatada's legal team have used a hearing today to pledge he will leave the UK for Jordan if a non-torture treaty is signed . David Cameron welcomed the news, saying: ‘We have a fully worked-out plan to get this man out of our country, and if he goes of his own accord, frankly, I’ll be one of the happiest people in Britain.’ It means the Muslim cleric, once described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could leave within months. Once he is out of the country, security officials will put a block on the fanatic ever being allowed to return to the UK. Qatada’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald QC, made the unexpected announcement at a bail hearing at the special immigration appeals commission in London. Mr Fitzgerald also said that his client, who is being held in Belmarsh prison on bail violations, wanted to spend some time with his family before leaving for Jordan. The Home Office released this image of Home Secretary Theresa May signing the fair trial guarantees with Jordan that she believes will reassure courts that torture evidence would not be used against Abu Qatada . David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain . Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed . September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport. May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment. February 2001 . - He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of . £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the . mujahedin in Chechnya'. August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan. April 2008 . - The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human . rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been . obtained through torture. February 18 2009 . - In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the . Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the . basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be . deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months. March . 6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was . trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions. March 27 2013 . - Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules . sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court. April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal. He gave no indication as to whether they . would be joining him in Jordan, where he faces terror charges after . being convicted in his absence in 1999. But it is understood there is no legal . basis for forcibly removing his wife and five children from their . taxpayer-funded home in North London. Two of the children were born in . Britain. The breakthrough is a victory for . Theresa May, who announced last month that she had thrashed out a mutual . assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair . trial. Human rights judges in Britain and . Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the . evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Mr . Fitzgerald said Mrs May’s treaty had been the key development in the . case. He added: ‘In light of that treaty I’m . authorised to say that if, and when, the Jordanian parliament ratifies . the treaty he will voluntarily return to Jordan.’ The new treaty is expected to be . ratified in the UK next month and a Jordanian minister has suggested it . could be cleared in his country within a matter of months. After telling the hearing of Qatada’s . pledge to leave, Mr Fitzgerald attempted to secure his client’s release . from Belmarsh prison to his home in north London. He said: ‘Bail . conditions can be as stringent as possible. Even, if necessary, 24 hours . in the house.’ Mr Fitzgerald insisted Qatada’s pledge to return voluntarily to Jordan meant there was no longer a threat that he could abscond. He said: ‘All he wants, when obviously he is planning to go back to Jordan, is some time with his family. ‘The risk of absconsion, which was a . major concern, has gone.’ Robin Tam QC, appearing for the Home . Secretary, said the treaty would be put before the Jordanian parliament . in the next few weeks, while the British side of the process should be . completed by late June. Mr Justice Irwin asked Mr Tam to provide evidence of the process in the UK and Jordan in bringing the treaty into force. He added: ‘The critical point is not merely ratification but when the treaty is enforced.’ Qatada’s bail conditions prevent him . from turning mobile phones on in his house. But the court heard how . Qatada had been remanded in custody after police searching his house on . March 7, 2013 discovered mobile phones, USB sticks and recordable CDs. Mr Justice Irwin told the court that 17 mobile phones were found in the house. He said: ‘Six of them were switched . on, two belonging to one of the sons, one found in [Qatada’s] bedroom, . two belonging to daughters and the sixth which was switched on was in a . bag in a downstairs room.’ Mr Fitzgerald said: ‘It’s accepted he did not exercise due diligence in relation to the phones and USB sticks. Probe: Police inspected the hate preacher's . London home as the radical cleric was arrested for allegedly breaching . his bail conditions in March . Mrs May said the deal will 'finally' make it . possible to kick Qatada out and Labour's shadow home secretary  Yvette Cooper said the QC's statement 'could be very good news' ‘All he would say would be they were not his phones and there is no evidence they were used unlawfully.’ But Mr Justice Irwin warned that the . breaches were ‘significant’, adding: ‘The bail conditions are really . focused on one thing, stopping this man spreading his ideas.’ The bail application was adjourned until May 20, with Qatada remaining in custody. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home . affairs select committee, said: ‘The Home Secretary must get on a plane . to Jordan and secure ratification immediately before Mr Qatada changes . his mind.’","UK agreed deal with Jordan pledging to ignore evidence gained from torture .

Serial rapist Dean Goodwin was jailed for nine terms of life imprisonment but told him he must serve a minimum of 15 years in jail . A serial sex offender who raped two women - leaving one for dead - while on the run from police was today jailed for life. Judge Samuel Wiggs jailed Dean Goodwin, 32, to nine terms of life imprisonment but told him he must serve a minimum of 15 years in jail. He had been released early from prison for similar offences before he carried out the horrific sex attacks last November in Dorset and Hampshire. In 2000 Goodwin was jailed for 12 years for two sexual assaults on a 13-year-old girl and a 63-year-old woman. He served 10 years of his sentence, and his name was placed on the sex offenders’ register. He was released from prison in 2010 and was kept under observation by the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) body. Shaven-headed Goodwin sparked a massive manhunt after raping a 30-year-old woman in her flat in Poole, Dorset, in what was described in court as a degrading five-hour ordeal. The 4ft 11in victim was attacked, forced to watch child porn and raped four times by burly 18-stone Goodwin after he barged into her home pretending to be the police. During the ordeal he said: 'I’m not leaving until I get what I want.' When the attack was over he told the woman: ‘I’m off now - see you in court’. A court heard how Goodwin had no self . control and later told police he had ‘wanted to go out with a bang’ after attacking his first victim. The woman, who vaguely knew Goodwin, called the police and he became a wanted man, Bournemouth Crown Court was told. A few days later Goodwin, who was high on cocaine and steroids, lay in wait in Andover, Hampshire, and attacked a complete stranger - a 49-year-old mother-of-two on her way home to take her children swimming, Kerry Maylin, prosecuting said. She was dragged into the garden of a derelict house, raped and then beaten so badly she lost consciousness. Armed Police at the scene of one of Goodwin's sex attacks in Poole, Dorset . Miss Maylin told the court that Goodwin told her to 'watch it or I will kill you' and 'scream and I will kill you'. He then hit her repeatedly with his fists and a brick and left her for dead. 'She thought she was going to die. She thought the only way she would survive was to play dead,' the barrister explained. The victim was not found for five hours until her shocked husband, out looking for her because she had not returned home, found her hypothermic. The court was shown a picture of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in hospital so badly beaten her eyes are closed. She was in court with her husband to see her attacker jailed. The court heard she has suffered what is likely to be permanent facial paralysis from nerve damage resulting from the attack and said the assault had 'destroyed my life and the lives of those I love.' Goodwin, from Poole, was later arrested in Bournemouth and told police he thought he had killed the woman in Andover. Bournemouth Crown Court heard how Goodwin had no self control and later told police he had ¿wanted to go out with a bang¿ after attacking his first victim . He admitted attempted murder, five counts of rape, sexual assault, false imprisonment, two counts of burglary and robbery. He committed his first sex offence against a five-year-old boy in 1994 when he was 14, the court was told. He later physically attacked care staff and teachers and indecently assaulted two other women as well as committing burglary, robbery and car theft offences, serving lengthy jail terms. A psychiatric report found he had a dangerous personality disorder and he told a psychiatrist “he wanted to go out with a bang” after the first rape. Jailing him, Judge Samuel Wiggs said: 'You are very dangerous indeed. It may be that you want to stop yourself but it’s plain from all the evidence that you cannot.' After the case, Detective Inspector Marcus Hester from Dorset Police said: 'Dean Goodwin was responsible for a number of heinous crimes and his victims were understandably left terrified by his vile actions. 'I believe that Goodwin poses a significant risk to the public, and this result means he will spend a minimum term of 15 years in prison. 'He will then be assessed and depending on whether it is safe to do so he may be released, or may spend the rest of his life in prison. I am certain that Dorset will be safer with Goodwin behind bars.'","Dean Goodwin had been released EARLY from jail in 2010 for similar offences .

The brother of a woman jailed 'in secret' for trying to remove their father from a care home where they feared he was in danger of dying has spoken today of his anguish at the treatment of their family. Ivan Maddocks said his sister Wanda has been made ill by their ordeal and called for a full investigation into the care their father John received. Miss Maddocks, 50, is the first person known to be imprisoned by the Court of Protection, which settles the affairs of people too ill to make their own decisions. Ivan Maddocks said his sister Wanda, left, has become ill after being jailed for taking her father John, right, out of his care home against the instructions of a court order that he should not be moved . Ivan Maddocks said his family feels powerless after their experiences with the court system. He said: 'There were so many injunctions it was unreal. ‘It’s wrong. People should be able to speak out. I’ve never heard of anyone being . jailed for trying to look after their father. ‘This has made Wanda ill. There were a lot of bad women in jail with . her. One said she was a killer. 'They didn’t believe her when they asked . what she was in for. It was really frightening.’ A . judge ruled that Miss Maddocks should go to prison for five months for contempt . of court even though she was not present or represented by a lawyer. Details of the case were made public for the first time yesterday and provoked a fresh row over behind-closed-doors justice. Miss Maddocks, who served six weeks of her sentence, was jailed because she ignored the court’s orders not to try to remove her father John from Park Hall care home in Bentilee, a suburb of Stoke on Trent. She was condemned for incidents including taking the 80-year-old dementia sufferer to a court hearing and to see a solicitor. She was also censured for producing a leaflet to try to publicise details of the case and giving her father a wooden cross ‘to ward off evil’ in the care home. Miss Maddocks was jailed on September 11 last year after the sentencing in her absence by the Court of Protection in Birmingham, and sent to Foston Hall prison in Derby . Her family said Mr Maddocks, a . retired painter and decorator from Stoke-on-Trent, had been held ‘like a . prisoner’ on the orders of a local council. Miss Maddocks was initially not allowed to be named after the hearing and was identified only by her initials WM. And the court’s ruling containing details of her sentence was not published. The Court of Protection is a branch of the High Court and its hearings are always conducted in private. Judge Martin Cardinal jailed Miss Maddocks for five months . Judge Martin Cardinal merely went through the motions of observing open justice when he handed down his sentence. He . ordered the doors of his courtroom in Birmingham to be unlocked and . told ushers to announce in the corridor that members of the public were . free to come in. But there was no wider announcement of the judgment and no-one who was not directly involved is thought to have attended. The ban on naming Miss Maddocks was lifted because there was no reason for it to remain in place after her release.  Mr Maddocks has since died. He separated from wife June more than 30 years ago. She remarried but now suffers from Parkinson’s Disease. The extraordinary case began when the grandfather-of-one was found collapsed at his own home last year. He was placed in a care home and the local authority applied for a legal order which said he must stay there. These are introduced when officials believe someone could be at risk of harm, and put the Official Solicitor in charge of their affairs. After a few months Ivan Maddocks took him out of the care home for lunch. Miss Maddocks was alerted and flew her father to Turkey, where she owns a number of properties. They stayed for 13 weeks before returning to Britain, and her father went to a different care home. Mr Maddocks said: ‘Wanda was certain she could care for him herself but the social services said he had to be put in the home. Wanda was very angry that they were taking Dad away from us.’ Miss Maddocks, a former buy-to-let landlord, was jailed on September 11 last year after the sentencing in her absence by the Court of Protection in Birmingham. She was freed from Foston Hall prison . in Derby on November 1 after returning to the court to purge her . contempt by apologising to the judge. Ivan Maddocks said his family feel powerless after their experience with the court system after his sister was jailed when she tried to remove their father John from Park Hall care home in Bentilee, Stoke on Trent . The inside of Park Hall care home in Bentilee, Stoke on Trent, where Wanda Maddocks's father John was being looked after . Judge . Cardinal said in his ruling that ‘there is a history of the family . being difficult with the local authority’ and that Miss Maddocks knew . she had been ordered not to interfere with her father. He . said she had done so on a number of occasions. On one she took him from . his care home to attend a court hearing. On another she took him to . Birmingham to talk to a solicitor. The judge recorded that she also gave her father a wooden cross ‘to prevent the evil in the home from hurting him’. Miss Maddocks also ‘produced and . distributed a leaflet prior to and during the final hearing giving . details of the case, containing a photograph of her father and other . information so as to identify him and that is in breach of Court of . Protection rules.’ Miss Maddocks was said to have left a long and abusive message on a social worker’s voicemail describing ‘you in your tarty little stuck up voice’ and to have called council staff names including ‘arrogant little cunning b*******’. In one message she said: ‘I hope you all end up where my Dad is and I hope you all end up cursed.’ Judge Cardinal said she had ‘the attitude of someone who is simply not going to obey court orders’. He said Miss Maddocks was causing her father ‘very considerable grief’ and ‘it seems to be only right she should go to prison’. But the whistleblowing MP who first learned of the case, Lib Dem John Hemming, said: ‘The jailing of people in secret for contempt is not supposed to happen. ‘No records have been collected. I believe the judges have broken the rules of their own courts, but nobody is doing anything about it.’ ‘One of the charges against the woman . was that she took her father from his care home to see a solicitor. We . now live in a country where ordinary people get locked up for taking . their father to see a lawyer. Even in Iran they do not jail people for . taking legal advice.’ Councillor . Gwen Hassall, Stoke-on-Trent city council cabinet member for social . services, said: ‘This is clearly an extreme case, but one that the Court . of Protection supported the council on. It was the court’s decision to . issue a custodial sentence to Wanda Maddocks. ‘Our . chief concern was always centred around the welfare of her father, who . was suffering from a deteriorating condition and required 24-hour . supervision in a stable environment. ‘This . was a decision reached by medical consultants, geriatricians, social . workers, community psychiatric nurses, dieticians, consultant health and . nursing professionals and others who were involved in assessing his . needs.’ She added: ‘This . decision was also ratified by the Court of Protection, which carried out . its own  independent assessment of his needs. ‘Unfortunately . safeguards had to be put in place to ensure he had the support of a . stable environment because there were no signs that this could be . provided otherwise. 'Safeguards also had to be put in place to protect the care professionals who looked after Mr Maddocks.’","Ivan Maddocks said his sister Wanda was made ill by the treatment .

The couple are due to be granted a 'quickie' divorce at London's High Court on Thursday after the breakdown of their eight-year marriage. After raging over Twitter, Ben - the son of the late billionaire James Goldsmith and socialite Annabel Goldsmith - admitted he was 'stupid' to have become embroiled in a nasty row after their breakup two years ago. He is now dating lingerie model and film producer Jemima Jones, while the exact nature of Kate's relationship with rapper Jay is now unclear after the pair were believed to have had a 'passionate' affair. Mistake: Ben Goldmsith has admitted he was 'stupid' to have rowed on Twitter with his ex-wife Kate Rothschild, pictured together in 2011, left . New Orleans-born rapper Jay, 36, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro . Thedford, is the father of singer Erykah Badu's daughter, Mars Merkaba Thedford. The couple were together for nine years. Financier Ben, 32, has just returned after whisking off his girlfriend of six months, Jemima, 25, to Morocco. And earlier this month, he told the Mail's Richard Kay: ‘Things are good. We’ve just returned from a romantic trip and it was wonderful.' The pair made their first public appearance last September at fundraiser for anti-factory farming campaign Pig Business at London restaurant Sake No Hana. ‘I am going to introduce her to Kate in the next two weeks,’ financier and environmentalist Ben told his sister-in-law Alice at the event, organised by the Marchioness of Worcester. ‘Kate doesn’t love me any more – she doesn’t care.’ In love: Ben Goldsmith and new girlfriend, lingerie model Jemima Jones, in London in September last year. All smiles: Ben Goldsmith and new love Jemima Jones at a London bash last September . His elder brother, MP Zac, 38, made Kate’s younger sister Alice, 26, his second wife, in March.

It's no excuse, but I was devastated,' he told The Telegraph. Police arrested Ben at the couple’s . £20million Kensington home in April 2011 on suspicion of actual bodily harm. Kate Rothschild and US rapper Jay Electronica seen together after her split from Ben Goldsmith . It followed a confrontation between the Eton-educated financier, who . inherited £300million after the death of his father, and his wife over explicit texts and emails between her and Jay Electronica. Mr Goldsmith later accepted a caution for assault before announcing he was filing for divorce on grounds of adultery. The couple married in 2003 when they were aged 23 and 21. A friend of Mr Goldmsith told The Sunday Times: 'He was in a terrible state. Unless you've been through an acrimonious divorce you can't imagine what they were going through. Ben was desperately in love with her and I think marrying so young was a way of escaping the Goldsmith playboy image and establishing a stable foundation for his life. Then it all went wrong.' During the Twitter row, Mr Goldsmith responded to an interview his estranged . wife had given, blaming their split on the young age at which they . married, said: . ‘Someone PLEASE shut this girl up. It’s embarrassing.’ His tweet then . provoked a response from the man Ms Rothschild left her husband for. Responding to Mr Goldsmith, American rapper Jay Electronica tweeted: ‘I’m getting sick and tired of your bull***t, Ben,’ and he added: ‘Get a grip.’ After the series of bitter messages, the couple released a joint statement through a PR company.

Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews clashed with police as they protested in Jerusalem against plans to enlist men from their community into the military. The controversial proposal is supported by the secular majority pushing for a more equal share of the burden on Israeli society. A sea of black coats - the traditional attire of ultra-Orthodox men - engulfed Jerusalem streets near the city's military draft bureau yesterday, where the crowd heard rabbis warn that army service would irreparably harm their way of life. Tens of Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Israelis have clashed with police after protesting against newly proposed government legislation that would see them drafted into the military . Passionate protest: Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said at least 20,000 protesters took part . Face off: Israeli riot police stand guard as ultra-Orthodox demonstrators set bins on fire in Jerusalem . 'The government wants to uproot (our traditions) and secularise us, they call it a melting pot, but people cannot be melted. You cannot change our (way of life),' Rabbi David Zycherman told the crowd in an anguished plea. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government has committed to increase drafting ultra-Orthodox men, most of whom receive exemptions on religious grounds, in order to share the national burden and reduce pressure on the middle classes. The party of Finance Minister Yair Lapid, Netanyahu's main coalition partner, received wide support at the polls in January on a pledge to resist demands by religious parties and to spread the load of army service and taxation more evenly. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said at least 20,000 protesters took part and about a dozen arrests were made when violence erupted and men hurled bottles and stones at officers, some on horseback, who used stun grenades to quell the unrest. A water cannon was also deployed as protesters set alight garbage bins, a regular occurrence at ultra-Orthdox demonstrations .

A water cannon was also deployed as protesters set alight garbage bins, a regular occurrence at ultra-Orthdox demonstrations. At least six officers required medical treatment and two were taken to hospital, Rosenfeld added. An Israel Radio commentator said the participants came from the most hardline elements of the ultra-Orthodox community who shun any compromise with the authorities on army service and even refuse to recognise the Jewish state for religious reasons. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up some 10 percent of Israel's population of 8 million. Most do not work, they receive military service exemptions and rely heavily on state subsidies for their religious studies and to support their families. About 60 percent of ultra-Orthodox men engage in full-time Jewish religious studies, keeping them out of the labour market.

Lapid has warned that failure to implement public spending cuts could cause an economic collapse. Israel's budget deficit was 4.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year - more than double its initial target -due to overspending by the previous government and lower-than-expected tax revenues as the economy slowed.

Russia’s Federal Security Service has publicly named the man who it says is the CIA station chief in Moscow. The unusual decision to release the identity of the agent who arrested US diplomat Ryan Fogle after he tried to recruit him, is said to be a breach of intelligence protocol. According to the Telegraph, there could be an angry response from the US Government as the names of intelligence officers are not released to the public. A diplomat with the same name is . listed as a Counsellor in the US Moscow embassy. It was unclear if he . was still based in the country, said the Telegraph. Undercover diplomat Ryan Fogle has . been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West for his . apparently amateurish Boy's Own approach to espionage in Moscow. Scroll down for video . Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . But the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was . hoping to lure to treachery wasted no time in personally apprehending . him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities. 'The man behaved like an officer . worthy of his name, detaining the recruiter and handing him over to . counterintelligence authorities' said an FSB source yesterday. 'He will continue to serve. There is no threat to his career.' The Russians have not named the . target of the CIA approach but he is believed to be a specialist in . terrorism linked to extremist Islamic groupings. Fogle called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him, it is claimed. Instead he ended up face on the . ground, and handcuffed, before being taken to the notorious Lubyanka HQ . of the secret services for questioning. FBI agents first came across the . Russian agent when they were given assistance by Moscow over the Boston . marathon bombings, it is understood. Fogle, 29, a third secretary in the . embassy's political department, was detained wearing a blond wig under . his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the FSB operative on the . night of May 13. In his possession, Fogle had another . wig, a compass, a map of Moscow, sunglasses, and a 'Dear Friend' letter - . apparently translated into Russian on Google - which offered $1 million . a year plus bonuses to the FSB man. Fogle has been ordered to leave Russia in the next few days. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. The FSB stressed yesterday that the . US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan . Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their . relations'. But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. Diplomat . Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the . FSB secret service – formerly the KGB. He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue . checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010. The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US . intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees . of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’","Russian agent who arrested US diplomat after he tried to convert him, has been named .

This piano could be the narrowest in the world but pianists won’t have the chance to play a waltz or a sonata - as it has only five keys. With three white keys and two black and one pedal, composers would struggle to come up with a catchy tune. And that's before you factor in the problem of it no longer having its strings and not making a sound. The 3ft 9in piano is less than a foot wide, so it's probably for the best that it is now a sculpture, not a functioning instrument. Sculptor Bjorn Perborg took a saw to a grand piano and turned it into a sculpture that sold for £2,400 . The piano only has three white and two black keys - even Status Quo might struggle to work within such limits . The sculpture is less than a foot wide - so even if sound were possible, you'd have to stand up to play it . The miniature grand was created by sculptor Bjorn Perborg, who took a saw to a full-size piano that was being thrown away. He chopped the instrument into three sections and threw away the middle piece, before sticking the two ends together. The piano strings had to be stripped out during the demolition, so you can tinkle the ivories but it won't make a sound. The piano was showcased at an exhibition and then sold for £2,400 to a museum. Mr Perborg, 38, a full-time sculptor from Paris, France, said: 'I made this piece for a gallery show. 'I showed an installation about the Collyer brothers, two hoarders who lived like hermits in Manhattan during the first half of the 20th century. 'One of the brothers used to be a concert pianist and I thought a crippled piano could go well with their story. The piece was sold by Perborg to a museum for £2,400 . The grand piano that was being thrown away has had its life extended by the sculptor - and will be preserved in a museum . 'There were people giving away pianos for free, so I took one and cut it into three pieces, threw away the middle section and reassembled the other two parts. 'The lid and the music stand had to be cut separately as well. 'I didn’t have the proper tools to cut the heavy casted metal frame that holds the strings inside the piano, the harp, so I decided not to use it. 'It is not a functioning piano and I consider it to be a sculpture.'","Sculptor Bjorn Perborg rescued the instrument from the scrapheap .

Aimee Copeland, 24, of Snellville, Georgia, was cut in her right leg in a zip-lining accident in April 2012. She fell from the line into the Tallapoosa River, where the wound became infected with necrotizing fasciitis which threatened to kill her. Doctors were forced to amputate her left leg, right foot and both hands to keep her alive. New hands: Aimee Copeland, 24, revealed her $200,000 bionic hands for the first time today . State of the art: The hands allow Aimee to carry out everyday tasks like signing her name and chopping vegetables . Everyday activities: The 24-year-old said she was glad to be back to doing normal things like cooking and cleaning . But today was a happy one for the . University of Georgia student, she showed off a major milestone in . her recovery - her prosthetic hands. Appearing on the Today show she . revealed what she is now able to do from signing her name to chopping . vegetables and shaking hands. The hands are already proving so effective that she feels she can do 'pretty much whatever she wants to'. She first tried the Touch Bionics hands at the beginning of the week at the company's clinic and already she's able to lift and grip with both hands. She filmed herself picking and eating a potato chip out of a bag which she said was the most satisfying activity so far. Her prosthetist Robert Kistenberg, who . is co-director and prosthetics coordinator at Georgia Institute of . Technology, is the expert behind the limbs. Explaining them on the show, he said . that they work off the electrical and chemical reaction created every . time we flex or contract a muscle. 'That electrical signal is very, very . slight,' he said. 'But our electrodes are sensitive enough to pick it up . through the skin.' 'She’s very smart and very adept,' Kistenberg said of Aimee. 'I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next month or two . she’ll be able to use them without thinking about it.' 'There are things that she's done in . two days, three days that it takes other people 6 months or a year to . gain control over these devices.' For Aimee her ambitions are simply to restore a bit of normality. Cooking and cleaning: Aimee said everyday activities were the things she had missed most. She couldn't wait to use the hands on returning home . Hope: Aimee Copeland, the graduate student who had to have four limbs amputated after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria, has been given $200,000 prosthetic hands .

'I'm really looking forward to . cooking with these and to cleaning my house,' she said. ""I’m . sort of OCD, so it seems like a weird thing to want to do, but I really . want to clean.' 'Sometimes I wake up and I’m just . like, ‘Oh my God, is this my life? This is . crazy!' 'I look at . pictures of how I was before, and I feel almost disconnected from that . person because my perspective now is so different than the point of view . of that girl.' 'And so, in a way, it almost feels . like I died a year ago and I was reborn as someone different.' Discussing using the hands for the first time, she said she was hopeful it would develop naturally. 'It's almost like a muscle memory with . these things. 'You know, it's like you got to find the . sweet spot and be able to pick things up naturally. And that'll come . with time.' She is currently finishing her master’s degree in psychology and then plans to start a program in social work. The hands would normally cost . $100,000 each but the company who produces them have hired Aimee as a . spokeswoman so are providing them free of charge. Support: Prosthetist Robert Kistenberg is impressed by how well Aimee has adapted to having the hands . Electrical impulse: The hands react to the chemical and electrical signals made when muscles are moved . She is also due to have a prosthetic leg fitted later this year. The wound on Aimee's leg initially received 22 stitches and ran up to her thigh. However, she quickly suffered problems returning to the emergency room as it was clear the wound wouldn't heal and her leg turned a dark purple color. As soon as doctors realized what the infection was they amputated her leg. 'I wasn’t able to walk,' she told show host Katie Couric. 'I wasn’t able to speak. The only thing I was able to babble was, ‘I think I’m dying'.’ It was then her hands and foot turned back and doctors had to amputate them too. Speaking on her recovery earlier this month, Aimee said she wanted to spread a message of hope. 'I'm . doing great, and regardless of what happens to you, regardless of the . circumstances in your life- there's always so much joy out there and . you've just gotta find it,' she said.

Plans to ensure the toughest Press regulation regime in British history which could see papers fined £1million were published yesterday. Culture Secretary Maria Miller unveiled plans for a Royal Charter to approve a new system of watchdogs in response to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. Under the scheme, the newspaper and magazine industry will set up a regulator to give victims of Press intrusion a quick and inexpensive system of seeking redress. Publishers who sign up will face fines of up to £1million if they break the rules. But under the Tory proposals those who fail to sign up – including bloggers or those who publish news online – could face far larger exemplary damages. Newspaper lawyers say this breaches European law. The Royal Charter will create a ‘recognition panel’ to decide every three years if the regulator has fulfilled requirements set out by Lord Justice Leveson. All three main party leaders would have to agree the proposals to recommend them to the Privy Council who would pass them for approval by the Queen. Crucially, the plans mean there would not have to be new Press laws, which critics say would undermine freedom of speech. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘The Royal Charter would allow the principles of Leveson to be implemented swiftly and in a practical fashion. It would see the toughest Press regulation this country has ever seen, without compromising Press freedom.’ The plans was welcomed by the industry and the Lib Dems but both raised concerns on details. Labour complained the proposals did ‘not comply’ with standards laid down by Lord Justice Leveson and said they would seek to change them when cross-party talks on the proposals begin again tomorrow. The Royal Charter contains provisions to stop meddling by politicians. Any changes must be approved by party leaders and a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament. But in a letter to the Tories last night, Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman said the Privy Council – made up of senior politicians – can change any Royal Charter. She said: ‘At the heart of Leveson’s proposals was that a new system should be independent of politicians and independent of the Press. There is nothing to stop the Privy Council from amending the Charter at any time, thereby changing the terms of the recognition and regulatory framework.’ Industry representatives said the plans do not go far enough to safeguard Press interests.Supreme Court judge Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, chairman of the appointments committee, would pick Press representative on the recognition panel. The rules exclude serving editors and publishers. The plans also ban anyone who has ever been an editor from serving on the recognition panel. This has raised concerns that the panel will lack the necessary expertise. Paul Vickers, Chair of the Newspaper and Magazine Industry Implementation Group, welcomed ‘this very constructive announcement’. He said the regulatory body should be set up ‘without statute, which would raise dangerous constitutional questions’. He added: ‘We remain opposed to exemplary damages, which are unnecessary, unjust and against European law, and we have grave reservations about the proposed arrangements for appointments to the Recognition Panel. ‘However these are issues which can be addressed over the coming days: the newspaper and magazine industry are determined to have a new, Leveson-recommended regulatory system up and running as soon as possible.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘The onus is now clearly on those who oppose statute to demonstrate a Royal Charter approach can be shown to meet the requirements set out by Leveson. We are not yet convinced today’s proposals meet that test, but we welcome them as a starting point.’ Campaign group Hacked Off rejected the plan. Gerry McCann, father of missing girl Madeleine said: ‘This plan falls far short of Leveson.’","Plans for a new watchdog announced by Culture Secretary yesterday .

A former Premier League star's girlfriend has been embroiled in a legal battle with her millionaire ex-husband after the footballer became involved in a row over a £7million property. Elie Taktouk claimed his former wife Daniella Semaan understated the amount of financial support she receives from boyfriend Cesc Fabregas during their divorce proceedings. He launched a legal bid yesterday in a further attempt to stop the sale of the luxury Belgravia flat they once shared after he was ordered to use profits from the sale and a top-up payment to give her £1.4million for a new home. Daniella Semaan's ex-husband Elie Taktouk argued that she understated the amount of support she receives from new boyfriend Cesc Fabregas during their divorce proceedings (pictured together) Elie Taktouk's application for leave to appeal was refused . The Lebanese property tycoon applied for leave to appeal after a company owned by Barcelona star Fabregas put in a bid for the Grade II-listed Upper Belgrave Street flat. The Court of Appeal heard the company offered about £5.4million for the property. Mr Taktouk said the move means his ex-wife would be allowed to stay in their former home if the former Arsenal footballer buys the luxury flat and still receive the top-up payment. However, the court rejected his application for leave to appeal the order yesterday. Mr Taktouk and Miss Semaan divorced months after photographs appeared in the media of her on holiday with the 25-year-old Spaniard in Italy. Miss Semaan, who has two children by Mr Taktouk, gave birth to her and Fabregas' first daughter last week. Mr Taktouk claimed that during the divorce hearings his ex-wife understated the amount of financial help she will receive from Fabregas, who is believed to earn £5million a year. Her evidence led to judge Mr . Justice Coleridge ordering the sale of the luxury London flat. Mr Taktouk's barrister, Stephen Lyon, told the . Court of Appeal that Miss Semaan had argued that Fabregas' obligations . were only to their child, and not her. He said she claimed she only received money to travel to Barcelona from London and financial support while she was there. 'Mr Fabregas, we say, is quite clearly . a resource of far greater significance than the wife let on in the . course of her evidence,' claimed Mr Lyon. 'We . say it is rather extraordinary that, less than three weeks after . judgment was handed down, through his company in Barcelona he was . offering to purchase (the flat). 'What . would happen is she would remain in occupation with £1.4 million in the . bank, which was not the intention of Mr Justice Coleridge. 'It . is quite clear from the judgement that the broad thrust of his . assessment was that Mr Fabregas was a wealthy boyfriend who provided her . with funds when she was in Barcelona, paid for taxis, flights, and . expensive presents. 'He is . clearly a resource of far greater significance. Had Mr Justice Coleridge . known that, the outcome might well have been a different one.' The court heard that Mr Taktouk had . previously claimed that the flat was not theirs, but actually ultimately . owned by his wealthy father. The court heard a company run by Fabregas put in a £5.4million offer on the Upper Belgrave Street flat . However, Lord Justice Jackson rejected Mr Taktouk's application for leave to appeal yesterday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 5 December 2011 . David Cameron has been accused of putting patients' privacy at risk over plans to share their medical records with private firms. The Prime Minister wants to change the NHS constitution to give drugs giants and other healthcare companies the right to access patients' confidential data in the hope it will help them develop new treatments. He outlined the plans today at the launch of the Strategy for UK Life Sciences in London. David Cameron, seen chairing a Cabinet meeting at Adastral Park in Ipswich this morning, will outline plans to share patients' medical records in the hope it will help develop new treatments . He revealed the Government is to invest £180 million to reduce the so-called 'valley of death' period between the development of new drugs and their use, as part of a drive to ensure that NHS patients are the first to benefit from health breakthroughs. 'The most crucial, fundamental thing we're doing is opening up the NHS to new ideas,' he said. 'The end-game is for the NHS to be working hand-in-glove with industry as the fastest adopter of new ideas in the world, acting as a huge magnet to pull new innovations through, right along the food-chain - from the labs to the boardrooms to the hospital bed.' Thousands of cancer patients could be given access to breakthrough treatments that are not yet available in Britain. Those . who have exhausted every option would be offered a 'last chance' by . trying drugs a year before doctors are allowed to prescribe them. David . Cameron wants to speed up the time it takes between a life-extending . treatment being invented and it being given to the sickest patients. The process can take up to 20 years, . but today the Prime Minister has announced a consultation on an 'early-access . scheme' that would enable drugs to be fast-tracked through months of . bureaucracy. Speaking at . the launch of the Strategy for UK Life Sciences in London, Mr Cameron . said: 'As long as the drug qualifies for the scheme, it should be up to . patients and doctors to decide whether they want to use it. Officials insist patient data would be anonymous and firms would never be able to identify individuals. But campaigners warn it will herald the 'death' of patient confidentiality. Ministers believe the NHS has some of the most detailed patient records in the world. It could potentially provide vast amounts of data on the 60million patients living in Britain. This could potentially help drugs firms to develop treatments by enabling them to look at certain trends. For example, it could help them to discover whether cancer patients taking drugs for other unrelated illnesses had better survival chances. A Government spokesman said: 'The life sciences industry is of vital importance to the UK economy and we are committed to greater collaboration with the NHS to ensure that patients can get faster access to valuable innovative treatments. 'All necessary safeguards would be in place to ensure protection of patients' details – the data will be anonymised and the process will be carefully and robustly regulated.' In the lab: Britain has been particularly reliant on pharmaceutical firms for success in manufacturing . Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman, warned the Prime Minister to 'tread carefully'. He added: 'What he calls red tape others might see as essential safeguards. Some areas need proper regulation and patient records is certainly one of them.' Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: 'This is the death of patient confidentiality. 'There is no guarantee that information will be anonymised. In any case, anonymised data can just as easily be re-identified.' The life sciences industry – which includes research into drugs for cancer and Alzheimer's – turns over £50billion a year and employs 160,000 people in 4,500 companies. While Britain has been particularly reliant on pharmaceutical firms for success in manufacturing, the industry has been under pressure in recent years and forced to make cutbacks. David Cameron chats to BT's Rob Mayhew today, where he was shown some of the latest developments in health technology . A decision by the world's largest pharmaceutical company Pfizer to close its research and development site in Sandwich, southern England, in February with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs was a sign of Britain's vulnerability. Investment returns from researching new drugs have fallen nearly 30 percent in the past year at the world's 12 top pharmaceutical companies, highlighting the productivity dilemma facing the sector, according to a study by Deloitte and Thomson Reuters published last month. Despite this, Mr Cameron insisted: 'Don't . doubt our ambition - not just to stay in the game, but to lead the game. Not just to hold on to the big companies we've got, but to see more . businesses setting up here. 'Not just to rest on past glories, but to keep on striving for more breakthroughs.'","Britain's life sciences industry has a £50billion annual turnover .

The horrific moment that a medical director lay down in the middle of a busy motorway as an HGV bore down on her was today described to an inquest. Dr Kaja Lerum Sammartino was struck by at least one lorry after she suddenly appeared in the slow lane of the M4 in the early morning of October 26. The 38-year-old mother-of-two from Newbury, Berkshire, who was the star of the pharmaceutical company where she worked, was killed almost instantly after she lay down on the carriageway. Minutes before she had crashed into a safety barrier in her car but was not believed to have been seriously injured. Dr Kaja Lerum Sammartino (left), pictured with husband Pablo Sammartino, died after she 'lay down' in front of a lorry on the M4 in October. She had been in a minor road accident just minutes before . HGV driver Richard Hanton told the coroner: 'I was driving normally and nothing was out of the ordinary. 'Then I saw a woman lie down in front of me after coming from the hard shoulder and lying down in the slow lane.' Mr Hanton violently swerved his 44 tonne HGV to avoid hitting the woman before stopping some 200 metres up the hard shoulder. The experienced driver then walked back down the carriageway and spotted an empty Mazda parked off the carriageway and peered inside. He then spotted the body of Dr Lerum Sammartino in the motorway which was then struck by a heavy goods vehicle. Other drivers described what they thought was a deer in the slow lane of the eastbound M4 between Newbury and Reading. The inquest into Dr Lerum Sammartino's death, which took place on what would have been her 39th birthday, heard that she was on her way to work at the pharmaceutical company in Reading when, for an unknown reason, she careered off the carriageway and struck the safety barrier on the hard shoulder. Dr Lerum Sammartino had a history of depression, but her husband Pablo Sammartino insists she would not have killed herself as she was devoted to her children . Accident investigators could find nothing mechanically wrong with the car but the impact damaged its entire length and the nearside airbags had been deployed. Location: Drivers described what they thought was a deer in the slow lane of the eastbound M4 between Newbury and Reading . Following the collision the doctor, who was born in Norway, turned off the engine, put on the hazard warning lights, left the car from the passenger door and contacted the emergency services. However she declined the assistance of an ambulance, fire and police. Forensic collision investigator Tony Reading described the collision as 'not significant' and as a 'glancing blow'. He said it was unlikely to cause 'significant injury'. The hearing in Newbury was told how accident investigators could not rule out that Dr Lerum Sammartino may have hit her head when her car collided with the safety barrier. 'If you have a bleeding to the brain you can function perfectly normally for a period of time and then the pressure can cause a problem,' said Mr Reading. Due to the disruption of the body a pathologist was unable to discover whether she had suffered a head injury. A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford asked: 'So, it is not something you can rule out?""' Mr Reading said: 'Absolutely not.' Husband Pablo Sammartino said he had . known his wife for more than 20 years and although she had suffered from . periods of depression in the past and took anti-depressants, he said . she would not have committed suicide. Road: Dr Kaja Lerum Sammartino was struck by at least one lorry after she suddenly appeared in the slow lane of the M4 in the early morning of October 26 . 'She was extremely dedicated to her family. She would basically do anything for her children. 'I am in no doubt.' Coroner Peter Bedford said: 'What we . will never fully understand is why on that particular morning she struck . the armco (a type of barrier) and we will never know how it affected . her, both emotionally and physically. - Husband Pablo Sammartino . 'The potential for physical injury cannot be ignored.' He recorded an open verdict into the death of the doctor. Speaking after the hearing Mr Sammartino said: 'Six months after Kaja's departure we still miss her like the first day, perhaps a touch more today, it being her birthday. 'Her generous, humble, caring persona is our daily beacon of strength, we trust in God and the confidence that her angel looks after us, especially my children, every single day. 'Thankfully, out of the tragedy some good often emerges and I would like to thank the people and institutions that are helping our family in this extremely challenging time.'

Former I'm A Celebrity contestant Aggro Santos raped two girls, one aged just 16, when he took them back to his hotel room after performing at gigs, a court has heard. The 24-year-old Brazilian-born rapper is alleged to have forced one of the victims to have sex with him after he performed at the opening of Club Soho in Yeovil, Somerset, on September 25, 2010. He is then accused of raping a then 16-year-old girl in 2011 after the University of Chichester summer ball while friend and co-defendant Tyrelle Ritchie, 22, forced her to perform oral sex on him. Chichester Crown Court was told that in the Yeovil incident the victim and a friend had gone to the club opening to see Santos perform because they were fans. Afterwards, as they waited in the car park, they spoke to Santos and she went back to the hotel where she had consensual sex with Santos's manager while her friend went to another room with the rapper. The alleged victim, who is in her 20s, said that a few minutes later the pair returned to the room and Santos then tried to initiate sex with her which she resisted and then he raped her. In the second incident in Chichester, West Sussex, on May 7, Santos had performed at the university's summer ball when his crew invited the victim and her relative, who was a student at the university, and two friends to a backstage room for drinks. Isobel Ascherson, prosecuting, said the group were then invited to an after-show party at the nearby Ship Hotel and they agreed to go. The rapper denied the accusations at Chichester Crown Court, which heard that he is alleged to have raped two women . Miss Ascherson said the 16-year-old then had consensual sex with Santos in his hotel bathroom while her relative had consensual sex with 21-year-old Ritchie in another room. She explained the victim then accused Santos of forcing her to have sex for a second time at the same time as Ritchie forced her to perform oral sex on him in the hotel room when they were alone. The police were then called when the relative found out what had happened and confronted the men, the jury heard. Miss Ascherson said the victim of the . Yeovil incident only reported the allegation there after she read . reports that Santos had been arrested for rape following the Chichester . incident. Miss Ascherson said all of the girls involved in the two incidents had consumed 'considerable' amounts of alcohol on the nights concerned and what happened was 'confused'. She said Santos denied there was any sexual contact with the victim in Yeovil when interviewed by police and said the girl in the Chichester incident initiated the sexual activity with him and Ritchie. She added that Ritchie told police that the 16-year-old had consensually performed oral sex on him. Santos, who is charged under his real name Yuri Santos, of Tooting, south west London, denies two counts of rape. Ritchie, of Lambeth, south east London, denies one count of oral rape. Santos's debut single, Candy, featuring former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt, shot to number five in the UK charts in 2010. But he became more popularly known by his appearance in the 2010 series of ITV's reality game show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, in which he reached the final six.

Viewers of the hit BBC1 programme, hosted by judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace, say they have been turned off the cookery contest by the contestants' kitchen habits. In one episode, viewers watched as a contestant's sweat dripped into a sauce, while in another a female chef's long hair was seen dangling over her lamb tagine.

One poster on the BBC Points of View online messageboard wrote: 'When you are cooking food for other people I think that hygiene standards need to be some what higher! 'Rings and nail varnish on fingers and greasy hair falling into food is not really nice and I often wonder how Gregg and John can so happily tuck into it when they must surely have seen how the food is prepared. It puts me off yuuk!' Another viewer wrote: 'Does the production team know anything about food hygiene? John Torode certainly does that's for sure but the contestants certainly don't! 'I just watched the episode aired on the 17th (April) and I am concerned about the mass catering challenge.

'One of the contestant's hair was almost being stirred into her lamb dish whilst the other contestants were using the first chopping boards they came to........ Red for vegetables.....Yellow boards for fruit? 'Picky picky but I teach this for a living and I teach about cross contamination which includes colour coded chopping boards. 'Does the BBC care what it's teaching the public or are they only concerned with recipes.' Another viewer responded: 'I'm with you! One episode saw someone drip sweat into a sauce, barf!

Horror find: A German shepherd dog was discovered with its head crushed in an apparent ritual killing (file picture) Fears have been raised over the mysterious disappearance of around 30 dogs in southern Idaho after a missing German shepherd was found with its head crushed in a suspected ritual killing. Animal control officials raised the alarm after dogs of various sizes, breeds  and ages mysteriously began to vanish. 'The dogs seem to vanish into thin air,' said Debbie Blackwood, director of the animal shelter in Twin Falls, Idaho. Officials say some 30 dogs have gone missing in recent months in Twin Falls and nearby communities in an agricultural region in south-central Idaho known as the Magic Valley. A man and his young daughter hiking along the north rim of the Snake River Canyon northeast of Twin Falls earlier this month discovered the remains of a German shepherd that had apparently been stoned to death, Blackwood said. The dog, found in an area known as the Devil's Corral in neighboring Jerome County, appeared to have suffered a 'ritualistic execution' in which its head was crushed with rock and its carcass covered with a purple cloth, she said. The case has prompted the Humane Society of the United States to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the dog's death. The incident was under investigation, said Jerome County Sheriff's Deputy Rick Ustick. No one has stepped forward to claim the dog. It was unclear if that case was linked to the rash of dog disappearances, authorities said. Dogs have been removed or released from private yards, unleashed from chains or failed to return home after roaming. 'Animals go missing every day. What's disturbing about this trend is that there is absolutely no trace of them,' said Lisa Kauffman, Idaho director of the Humane Society of the United States. John Goodwin, head of animal cruelty policy for the Humane Society, said it was unlikely dogs were stolen by people engaged in dog fighting, which is illegal in Idaho, because it was rare for those involved in the activity to use just any dog. Twin Falls spokesman Josh Palmer said city officials on Wednesday consulted with the Humane Society and other animal rescue officials about the missing dogs. Meanwhile, authorities were asking residents to report 'any unusual activity, like the stalking or taking of pets,' he said.","Animal control officials raised alarm following mysterious disappearances .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 26 October 2011 . Revelation: In a letter Joseph Heller wrote that his experience of combat was in direct contrast to his central character of John Yossatian, and that he actually enjoyed it . He may have written one of the anti-conflict classics - but it has now been revealed that Catch-22 author Joseph Heller actually enjoyed his military service during the second world war. In a letter to an academic preparing a collection of essays about his satirical 1961 novel, he wrote that his experience of combat was in direct contrast to his central character of John Yossarian. Writing to James Nagel, English professor at Northeastern University in Boston: 'How did I feel about the war when I was in it? 'Much differently than Yossarian felt and . much differently than I felt when I wrote the novel … In truth I . enjoyed it and so did just about everyone else I served with, in . training and even in combat. 'I was young, it was adventurous, there was much hoopla and glamour. 'In addition, and this too is hard to get across to college students today, for me and for most others, going into the army resulted immediately in a vast improvement in my standard of living.' The three-page-long typed letter, which is due to be auctioned in the U.S., was written in 1974 and reveals he made $65 to $75 a month while in the military. This was more than the $60 he received as a filing clerk and he said that 'all food, lodging, clothing and medical expenses paid'. Transformation: Catch-22 was later made into a film, released in 1970, starring Alan Arkin (pictured) as Captain Yossarian . He added: 'There was the prospect of travel and a general feeling of a more exciting and eventful period ahead … more freedom than I enjoyed in the long years afterwards.' Aged 19, Heller joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and then served, just like his book's protagonist, on the Italian front. He flew 60 combat missions as a B25 bombardier. He then spent much of the 1950s writing the book. Publisher Simon & Schuster granted him a book deal based on the contents of the first chapter. In the letter he added: 'I knew [the book] would be published. I knew I worked slowly. 'I took my time and tried to make it the best book I could possibly write on that subject at that time.' Two of the letters to Nagel will be auctioned by Nate D Sanders online auction house over the next two weeks. They are expected to fetch between $2,000 and $3,000. Catch-22 was later made into a film, released in 1970, with Alan Arkin as Captain Yossarian. Jon Voight and Orson Welles also starred. Heller, who was made a millionaire by the film, went on to write Something Happened, Good as Gold and Picture This. Born on May 1, 1923, in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, he was the son of poor Russian Jewish parents Lena and Isaac. He died of a heart attack on December 12, 1999 at his East Hampton home. After his death, publishers Simon & Schuster released his final work, called A Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. It was a collection of his memoirs and essays.","Joseph Heller wrote: 'In truth I enjoyed it...'

"By . Christian Gysin and Larisa Brown . UPDATED: . 02:27 EST, 14 February 2012 . When Caroline Barrett moved in with her boyfriend for 18 months before their wedding, she was only doing what millions of other young lovers do. But for her, the consequences were rather costly. Her grandmother, a staunch Catholic, had a ‘pious abhorrence’ of couples ‘living in sin’ and, after a bitter High Court battle, those traditional beliefs have been cited as a reason for Mrs Barrett being cut out of her £220,000 will. Bitter feud: Caroline Barrett, left, lived with her boyfriend before they married. She has now lost a share of her Catholic grandmother's fortune following a battle with her two uncles - including David Murray, right - and aunt . The businesswoman – who has since . married Alastair Barrett – was unaware that her Irish-born grandmother, . who died in July 2010 at the age of 87, held such strong views about . couples cohabiting. The bitter family rift over whether . Mrs Barrett should inherit any of Bridget Murray’s money came to a head . in London’s High Court after a protracted dispute involving her aunt and . two uncles. Mrs Barrett, of Basingstoke, . Hampshire, was named as a beneficiary in her grandmother’s will, which . she had drawn up months before she died. Upsetting: Caroline Barrett's brother David Robertson, pictured, also lost out on a share of Bridget Gabrielle Murray's will . But lawyers for Mrs Murray’s two sons, David and John Murray, and her daughter Catherine, asked a judge to ‘rectify’ the will. A fourth child, Monica, died three . years before the grandmother and it was her children, Mrs Barrett and . her brother, David Robertson, who stood to gain a quarter share of the . will – £27,500 each. But that was before the other children . – their uncles and aunt – went to court to have them struck out. They . argued that Mrs Murray had vowed she would never include Mrs Barrett in . her will because she  ‘co-habited’ before getting married. They further claimed that a clause in . the will bequeathing Mrs Barrett a share of her £220,000 fortune had . been a drafting ‘mistake’. Judge Robert Miles QC, sitting at . London’s High Court, ruled that the devout pensioner had not intended . Mrs Barrett – or her brother David – to benefit from her will. Last . night Mrs Barrett said: ‘I don’t want to speculate on the reason. The . cohabitation issue could have been the reason – but it seems really . harsh and she was not a harsh person. She was lovely. ‘We spoke about it and she was vaguely disapproving of it but like grandparents are with lots of things. ‘We were on good terms and I think it . was more about financially looking at the whole family. It doesn’t make . any sense that both me and my brother were cut out of the will.’  The . judge accepted that some might view the elderly Mrs Murray’s attitude . and views as ‘capricious’ and ‘not particularly fair’ as he ordered that . the will be rectified so Caroline and David were removed as . beneficiaries. Mrs Murray had always maintained her . firm religious beliefs after leaving Ireland and was an active member of . the Catholic Council when she died. A family rift developed after Mrs . Murray’s surviving three children disputed the document, insisting that . her ‘intentions differed from those expressed in the will’. Mark Dubbery, representing Mrs . Murray’s aunt and uncles, said she had not wanted Monica’s children to . benefit and that they only did so due to an error in drafting. Battle: The family feud over Bridget Gabrielle Murray's will was played out at The Royal Courts of Justice in London . Edward Hicks, for Caroline Barrett and . David Robertson, said Mrs Murray had no logical reason to exclude them . and called the step ‘very unusual’. He added that he understood Mrs . Murray had checked the will and was happy with the document. However, 61-year-old David Murray told . the judge his mother’s religious feelings were so powerful she would . never have been happy with her granddaughter benefiting from her will – . primarily for having lived with a man ‘out of wedlock’. ‘If you talk . about the Irish way of living ... people are struck out of wills all . over because of religion,’ he explained. Mrs Barrett married her partner Alastair in September 2008. They now run a solar panel firm from their Berkshire home. Asked in court about her grandmother’s . attitude to her living with a man out of wedlock, Mrs Barrett said: ‘I . wouldn’t ever say that she was stern about it.’ Deputy Judge Miles ordered that the . will be rectified after ruling that the two grandchildren had only been . named due to a clerical error which the court could correct. The £220,000 estate will now be divided between Mrs Murray’s three surviving children.","28-year-old spent 18 months living with her partner before they married leading to bitter family dispute in the High Court .

At first, the funeral procession looks like that of any other much-loved relative, adorned with flower arrangements spelling out 'dad' and 'uncle'. But the final one gives some hint that this is not a usual funeral: for the '240DC' is believed to be a knowing wink to notorious London gangster Charlie Richardson's favoured method of torture - electrocuting the bodies of those who had crossed him. Many gangsters from the past reared their heads to pay their respects to the man who was once one of the most feared criminals in the capital, whose empire embraced fraud, gambling, protection . rackets - and torture. Put to rest: Charlie was the leader of the Richardson gang (also known as the Torture gang) from Camberwell . Torture reference: The funeral cortege arrives at Honor Oak Crematorium in south London today . Gangster: 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 88 (middle) - who has spent 42 years of his life in jail, has been certified insane three times, and was a feared member of the Richardson gang, Sixties rivals of the Krays - attends the funeral . 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, Kray associate Chris Lambrianou, and Charlie's brother Eddie Richardson were seen, along with many 'of the great and the good' of the 1960s. Mad Frankie, so-called for his preference for pulling teeth with pliers, made his way into the Camberwell New Cemetery. Chris Lambrianou, convicted for his involvement of the 1967 murder of Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie, also came to pay his respects. Lambrianoi was convicted for his role . in disposing of the body, spending more than 15 years in prison and . finding God while he was inside. Eddie Richardson was there - but witnesses say he did not enter the church. The brothers are believed to have . fallen out several years ago over money, and Eddie said he had not . spoken to his brother since then. Also there: Frankie Frasier (left) and reformed Krays associate Chris Lambrianou (right) - convicted of murder in 1967 - both attended the service .

Also present was Charlie's wife Ronnie, . wrapped in a fur-lined shawl, watching as the procession made its way to . the cemetery, guided by the same funeral director who presided over . Jade Goody's funeral in 2009. Charlie Richardson died last month - . the 78-year-old heavy smoker finally succumbing to blood poisoning . following gall bladder complaints. His funeral procession, bedecked in flowers as it slowly drove down the A20, remembered him as a 'dad', and an 'uncle'. But the legends that surround him paint a very different picture. He was arrested on . the day England won the World Cup in 1966. His trial heard he was . alleged to have used iron bars, pliers and electrodes on anyone who . crossed him. Notoriety: Richardson, pictured in 2007, was thought to have earned millions through his notorious gang's operations but left an estate worth just £21,000 . The . Camberwell-born crime lord was found guilty of fraud, extortion, assault . and grievous bodily harm, and was jailed for 25 years. Together with his brother Eddie, he was as infamous as Ronnie and Reggie Kray and ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser. Known . as the ‘Torture Gang’, their trademark was pinning victims to the floor . with six-inch nails and removing their fingers and toes with bolt . cutters. The Richardson Gang . were also known for torturing enemies at their scrap metal yard by . attaching electrodes to their nipples and genitals and delivering . electric shocks, having already placed them in baths of water to make . the electricity more potent. The . gang would frequently carry out mock trials for victims, before . administering punishments including whippings, cigarette burning and . teeth being pulled out by gang member 'Mad' Frankie Fraser. They were then made to clean up their own blood. The . brutal method of trial by kangaroo court and subsequent torture was . said to be known as 'taking a shirt from Charlie', as Richardson would . often give victims a clean shirt in which to return home afterwards. The coffin was carried into the chapel to the strains of Stand by Me by Ben E King. The service included a poem by his second wife, Ronnie, which said: ‘Many have judged him over the years, some good, some bad and said they feared. ‘But they never knew this incredible man. A legend, a father – not gangland!’ Mourners left the chapel to the sound of My Way by Frank Sinatra. Afterwards, one said: ‘There’s not many of them left now. The Krays are dead and now Charlie. Frankie’s about the only one still going. It’s a changing world.’ Following his release from prison in 1984, Richardson sought to become a legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a cameo in a film of his life. Pallbearers, believed to be Charlie's grandsons, carry the coffin into the church in New Camberwell . A pallbearer carries a portrait of Charlie into the church while (right) Charlie's wife Ronnie watches procedings .

He and Eddie turned to a life of crime when the departure . of their father left their family penniless. Eddie Richardson, speaking just after . his brother's death, said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him in years so I am . not the best person to . speak to about his death. But he will be missed by his six children. ‘I can’t say he was a good father, but he was a father. He leaves a big family behind him. ‘Members of his family were with him in hospital. I’m sure they will be upset and disappointed, losing a dad is difficult.' ‘I lost count of how many grandchildren he had. ‘It . came as a surprise to some, but not to me. He had been ill for years . and has suffered with breathing problems – emphysema – for a long time . due to smoking.' He also refused to get medical treatment for his stomach pain . because he was scared of doctors, despite suffering in agony for weeks. His . close friend David Fraser, son of Richardson Gang enforcer “Mad” Frankie Fraser, said: 'He kept putting off going to the doctors. 'When he finally went, he was admitted to hospital and never came out.' Tribute: A floral tribute to the former gangster pictured in one of the hearses used in his funeral procession .

Renowned: Charlie Richardson (2nd right) along with brother Eddie (3rd right, holding face) dabbled in torture, protection and drug dealing in the 60s . Richardson always insisted the torture stories were just a myth and were simply used to help convict his gang. He . added: ‘If you can find anyone who says they got nailed to the floor by . us or got their toes cut off I will give you £10,000 for each one. 'We were fitted up. I never touched a single toe. I did 18 years for nothing.’ The . Richardsons, along with 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and George Cornell, were . the main rivals of twin brothers Ronald ""Ronnie"" Kray and Reginald . ""Reggie"" Kray during the 1950s and '60s. The . two rival sets of brothers controlled London, operating through armed . robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and torture, with the . Krays based in East London and the Richardson gang from South London, . also entrenched in the West End. Their turf war began after a brawl during a Christmas party at the Astor Club in December 1965. It . was here that George Cornell, insulted Ronnie Kray, calling him a ‘fat . poof’ after first meeting the Krays while in Shepton Mallet Prison. Shortly . after the incident Cornell was seen walking down Whitechapel Road . shouting: 'Where's that fat w*****?' referring to Ronnie Kray. Ronnie Kray showed up at the Blind beggar pub where Cornell was drinking, and shot Cornell through the head at close range. In . March 1966 a gun battle took place in a club called Mr Smiths in Rushey . Green with the Richardson gang going there with the intentions of . wiping out the Krays. However . there was only one member of the Kray gang present. He was shot dead. Frankie Fraser , a good friend of the Richardsons was shot in the hip . and Eddie was shot in the backside. They . were taken to hospital and on their release they were charged with . affray and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Frankie Fraser was originally . charged with the murder of Dickie Hart but was found not guilty. Other . notable characters in the Richardson gang included the notorious hit . man Jimmy Moody, Roy Hall (who operated the electric generator), Albert . Longman, and Tommy Clark. Moody . was the main enforcer for the Richardsons, but also did 'freelance . work' for the Krays and became one of the most feared criminals to . emerge from the London underworld. A . further member of the gang, Harry Beard, is known for frequently . urinating on a collector of protection money, who was twice warned by . the Richardsons after he pocketed the money.Another . infamous killing at the time was that of Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie, a . minor member of the Kray’s gang, killed by Reggie Kray, in a move that . eventually led to their convictions.","Charlie Richardson died in September aged 78 following a gall bladder complaint .

Wanted criminal Sam Greenwood taunted police by writing 'Catch me if you can' on Rochdale police's Facebook page - only to be caught hours later . When police put an appeal for a wanted teenager on Facebook, they were hoping for tip-offs from the public. They probably didn’t expect the criminal himself to reply, saying: ‘Catch me if you can.’ But the officers had the last laugh when they arrested Sam Greenwood just 12 hours later...and added their own riposte: ‘Caught you. Do not pass Go, do not collect £200, go straight to jail.’ Police wanted Greenwood, 19, for breaching the terms of his release after he was locked up earlier this year for driving while disqualified and with no insurance. Officers from Greater Manchester Police put out an appeal on the official GMP Rochdale North Facebook page, alongside Greenwood’s photograph. The next day Greenwood wrote underneath: ‘Catch me if you can.’ Police urged him to hand himself in, posting: ‘You are a talented young man. Don’t waste your life away. So many people are willing to help you – but you’ve got to start helping yourself.’ Greenwood failed to heed their advice, but was spotted by officers out on patrol and placed back behind bars. They then returned to Facebook to respond a second time: ‘Caught you. Do not pass Go,  do not collect £200, go straight  to jail.’ Inspector Umer Khan of Rochdale North said: ‘Unfortunately this man was always going to be a hostage to fortune once he decided to goad us on Facebook. I tried my best to coax him into handing himself in, but he seemed determined to remain at large. ‘Thankfully, we managed to track him down in no time at all and he is now back where he belongs for the time being – behind bars.’ Greenwood, from Rochdale, was sentenced to four months in a Young Offenders’ Institute in January after his driving conviction. He was freed on licence last month, but failed to attend mandatory appointments at Rochdale Probation Service.

Derbyshire chief constable Mick Creedon said the Met's Special Demonstration Squad routinely gave officers false identities based on dead children . The use of dead children’s identities to create aliases for undercover police officers was ‘common practice’, a senior officer has admitted. But none of the families of the children had been contacted by police, Chief Constable Mick Creedon said. He is investigating undercover policing, including the use of dead children’s names by Scotland Yard’s Special Demonstration Squad. Earlier this year it was claimed up to 80 identities were stolen over a  30-year period, without families knowing. Officers used birth certificates from real people to create fake passports so that their aliases appeared genuine. In one case, an officer infiltrating an anti-capitalist group took on the name John Barker, using the birth certificate of Philip John Barker, who died of leukaemia aged eight in 1968. Sergeant John Dines used the identity for five years starting in 1987. In February, Philip’s 81-year-old aunt Beryl Ramsell, said she thought it was a ‘sick joke’. In a letter to MPs published yesterday, Mr Creedon, who is leading Operation Herne into undercover policing, said he was unable to say how many identities had been stolen. His team of 23 officers and ten police staff has 50,000 documents yet to process. The investigation has cost £1.25million and is expected to cost another £1.66million over the next year. In a letter to Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, Mr Creedon said: ‘This issue is very complicated and mistakes could put lives in jeopardy.’ Asked how many dead children’s names . had been used, he said: ‘I am not able to answer this question at this . time with any degree of absolute certainty but I can say that this was . common practice within the SDS. Former undercover cop Mark Kennedy told Channel 4 he 'devastated lives' when he took on the guise of eco protestor Mark Stone . ‘No families of children whose identities have been used have been contacted and informed.’ Home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said victims must be given an apology . He added: ‘Unravelling all the complexities of this is going to take a considerable effort and not a little time.’ Operation Herne was set up in October . 2011 to look into allegations made against the Met’s Special . Demonstration Squad, including the use of dead children’s identities and . inappropriate sexual relationships. The Derbyshire chief constable said . it would not be appropriate to provide details on the number of children . born out of relationships with undercover officers. Mr Vaz said: ‘With 50,000 documents . to go through and years of undercover police operations to examine, it . is vital that Herne does not go the way of the original phone-hacking . investigations. ‘It is imperative that a timetable is . set for completion of the operation, and the victims informed and . apologised to as soon as possible.’ A raft of allegations have been made . since former PC Mark Kennedy was unmasked in 2011 as an undercover . officer who spied on environmental protesters as Mark ‘Flash’ Stone – . and had at least one sexual relationship with a female activist.","Families of children whose names were used by officers were not told .

"By . Geraint Anderson . PUBLISHED: . 16:12 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 18 May 2013 . Every major investment bank’s trading floor has a number of different ‘tribes’. There are the barrow-boy bond traders and the nerdy research analysts, the upper-crust equity salesmen and the derivatives ‘rocket scientists’. But at the four banks I worked at during my 12-year City career, there tended to be one breed louder, flasher and brasher than the rest — the commodity traders. And the most important commodity of all is oil, which is why the global oil-dealing market is worth £1.65 trillion. Invariably male, this elevated breed — they can each earn up to £1  million a year, plus bonuses — like to think of themselves as the kings of the banking jungle. And they have social lives to match. Kings of the jungle: Hard-partying oil traders like to see themselves as an elevated breed among City types (picture posed by models) In my time, most Thursdays would see them heading out in a pack for a traditional night of ‘extra-curricular’ activities in the Square Mile, with each blowing as much cash in an evening as most people earn in a month. Cocktails and champagne at the Coq D’Argent at Tower Bridge might be followed by a rowdy meal at the Michelin-starred Petrus, and then a visit to one of their favoured ‘exotic-dancing’ establishments — be it Stringfellow’s or Spearmint Rhino. The volume of alcohol consumed would make Oliver Reed look sober. No matter how late these alpha males stayed out, they would all make sure to come in especially early the next day — as a sign of their macho resilience. On many Friday afternoons, we would hear their snores coming from the cubicles of our trading floor’s loos. Thus far, these hard-partying oil traders have been exempt from the big banking scandals that have rocked the City since 2008. They did not create toxic mortgage products, indulge in insider trading or manipulate the Libor inter-bank lending rates to make borrowing more expensive. However, that may be about to change. This week, competition investigators from the European Commission raided the offices of BP, Shell, and the Norwegian oil and gas company Statoil, as well as those of the oil price reporting agency Platts. Suspicion: If accusations of price-fixing by companies including Shell are true, British motorists have been paying inflated petrol prices for years . They were trying to find out whether individuals from these companies had colluded to fix the ‘reported’ price of certain oil benchmarks. The authorities want to know whether traders artificially pushed up the price of oil, thus making bigger profits for their employers, but also making life more expensive for the motorist. Certainly, when you examine the system that records the price of oil — the Platts price reporting  system — it does seem vulnerable to abuse. This system records only a fraction of the oil trades that are made on any given day, and the companies that trade oil can choose to submit only a portion of their trades if they so desire. A certain amount of trade verification does take place on the trades submitted to Platts, and some that appear too high or low are rejected. Nonetheless, an unethical oil trader could send Platts — typically via an instant messenger text system or by telephone — details only of trades that suggested a higher price than was generally being achieved. Or they could simply supply false information. If traders did this in collusion with others so that several reported artificially high prices, then the official price recorded by Platts could be moved a few cents higher. Here’s how they might do it: if a trader at a major oil firm bought a million barrels of oil at, say, $100 a barrel, there appears to be little stopping him reporting to Platts that he actually bought the oil for $100.10 a barrel. Then, if he’s colluded with enough of his trading competitors to deliver similarly inflated prices, Platts will, in good faith, report that oil is being bought and sold at a higher price than the one it is really being traded for. Of course, the increase in the Platts benchmark figure will be less than 10 cents a barrel because most traders report accurate data, and an average figure is arrived at. Still, the increase, even if it is only a few cents, could lead to massive profits if the trades are big enough. Despite these shortcomings, the Platts price is widely recognised as the best available method for reaching an average price in an otherwise opaque oil market, and so is used as a benchmark for oil deals worth billions of dollars. And it is not just the price of oil — and thus the price of petrol at the pumps — which such manipulation would affect. It could also affect the price of European gas, which in turn dictates how much we pay for gas in this country, which also happens to be a major influence on the cost of electricity. There are reports that the European Commission competition authorities are concerned that any possible price-fixing may have been going on for a decade. If so, then the impact on the average family’s finances will have been dramatic. If oil speculators have pushed up the prices we pay for petrol, gas and electricity by just 1 per cent for the whole of the past decade, then the British people might have been conned out of more than £5.5  billion. In fact, the impact would have been much higher because the cost of oil has a direct effect on the prices of so many other products (including paint, petrochemicals and so on) — and, of course, the price of nearly everything we buy has to include transport costs — which increase as oil becomes more expensive. Rip off: Oil speculators may have conned the British people out of £5.5billion over the past decade . So far, no investment banks or hedge funds — some of whose traders also buy and sell oil — have been raided, but common sense tells us that if this investigation is based on any truth, then such developments cannot be far away. Indeed, as yesterday’s Mail revealed, there are other methods that could be used to manipulate the price of oil. The AA has published a report claiming that speculators are using an age-old trick to make a fast buck at the expense of Britain’s 33  million motorists. Traders working for major commodity-dealing firms are said to have been buying up vast amounts of oil with a view to making a large profit when they sell it. They do this by refusing to release the fuel onto the market and, in so doing, force a squeeze in supply. That inevitably pushes the prices up. The problem with City traders is that they generally exhibit three main character traits — intelligence, greed and ruthlessness. Combine these with the fact that they work in a short-term, hire-and-fire world, and it is easy to see why they might break rules to enhance their bonuses. All City traders assess risk and reward on a daily basis. Since the rewards for market manipulation can be massive and, until recently, the risk of being caught has been minimal, some traders would regard breaking the rules as almost a logical business strategy. I’m afraid that given the choice between artificially raising a pensioner’s gas bill and adding £100,000 to your bonus, it would be heresy in the City to even mention the former concern. This investigation into price-fixing is at an early stage and the companies being investigated say that they are co-operating with the commission, but there are three reasons why I think this may turn into a major scandal. First, the system is too open to abuse for a group of clever participants not to have realised its vulnerability. Second, personal experience informs me the ethics of many commodity traders are not what they might be. And, third, my City contacts tell me there have been rumours of strange pricing data for some time. If price-fixing has occurred, then it will prove once again that Britain is not the incorruptible country we like to think it is, and that tougher regulation is needed to cleanse our system of this widespread abuse. More than 200 years ago, the economist Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations that ‘people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices’. Sadly, that may be as true today as ever it was.","Oil traders see themselves as an 'elevated breed' among City workers .

Accident: Lord Vestey, one of Britain’s richest men and a close friend of the Royal Family, was taken to hospital after the riding accident . The Queen’s Master of the Horse has been injured falling from his saddle. Lord Vestey, one of Britain’s richest men and a close friend of the Royal Family, was taken to hospital after the riding accident. Buckingham Palace yesterday said the Queen was being ‘kept informed’ of the situation. Multi-millionaire Lord Vestey, 71, attends important ceremonial occasions as the man responsible for the Royal Mews and the Queen’s carriages and horses. He is the third Great Officer of the Royal Household and has held the title Master of the Horse since 1999. His duties include being present at the State Opening of Parliament and he was due to be on horseback at next month’s Trooping the Colour. The former chairman of Cheltenham racecourse watched the 2011 Derby with the Queen at Epsom and accompanied her at Cheltenham in 2009. He is regularly photographed with the monarch at equestrian events and was alongside her at the Royal Windsor Horse Show earlier this month. The Vesteys, who own the 6,000-acre Stowell Park Estate in Gloucestershire, were among the guests in St Paul’s Cathedral for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. The Vestey family has an estimated £750million fortune through the family meat business, Vestey Foods Group. The company – which once owned Dewhurst butchers – has been privately owned since it was founded in 1897 by brothers William and Edward Vestey. Two months ago it was drawn into the horsemeat scandal after it emerged that it supplied products contaminated with horsemeat to one of the world’s biggest catering companies. Lord Vestey falls at a fence in Hickstead in 1975. The Queen has been informed of his latest accident . It sold minced beef and minced halal beef to Sodexo which supplies hospitals, schools and the Armed Forces. Lord Vestey is also a close friend of Prince Charles and his wife Cecilia is Prince Harry’s godmother. She nearly died when she suffered a serious stroke in 1995. Lord Vestey was told by doctors at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, that his wife had less than a one in ten chance of survival. She recovered after neurosurgeons removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball from her brain and said afterwards it was the support of her husband that gave her the strength to recover. ‘He is my hero,’ Lady Vestey said. ‘He was a tower of strength.’","Buckingham Palace yesterday said the Queen was being ‘kept informed’ of the situation .

David Chaplin returned to work following the death of his wife wearing a blonde wig and a dress. The 65-year-old said he was now called Jane and was undergoing hormone replacement therapy.Miss Chaplin, as she is now known, has asked staff and colleagues at Wellington town council in Shropshire to refer to her as a woman. Sex change: David Chaplin, left, has returned to council work as a woman named Jane, right . She revealed that she was having a sex change because she had felt trapped in the wrong body for almost 50 years but had told no one for fear of how they would react. Miss Chaplin, who was married for 37 years and fathered two children, said: ‘I’ve known more or less my whole life what my true gender is, but when I was growing up people weren’t as understanding about it as they are now. ‘I was petrified of telling people, because I knew in those days I would have been marginalised and ridiculed. It was an awful burden to carry all those years.’ Elected as David Chaplin three years ago, the burly town councillor took leave of absence following the death of wife Rosemary, 65, in May last year. Tory: Jane was elected to Wellington Town Council three years ago as a Conservative . Part of the reason for the long wait to change sex was out of respect for her. ‘I cared a great deal for my wife, and didn’t want to dump that kind of news on her,’ said Miss  Chaplin, from Telford, Shropshire, who works as private sector housing manager for Cannock Chase Council. ‘I was obviously racked with nerves when I had to tell my family and friends, but I was shocked to learn a lot of them kind of already knew. ‘They had no idea I was a woman deep down inside, but most of them sensed there was something different about me. ‘But I have known for many years that I have wanted to go in this direction and transition, which means you follow the process that takes you from one gender to another. But life gets in the way. ‘My fellow councillors have been wonderful, and it hasn’t affected my career in any way. ‘It is a great relief to be able to be who I am, and who I have always regarded myself to be. I am very happy in my life now.’ Sensitive: Jane did not want to come out as transgender while her wife Rosemary was alive . Residents in Wellington said most people in the area had been very supportive. Paul Carpenter, 42, said: ‘It doesn’t change what her policies are or how good she is at her job as a councillor. ‘It is her choice – although I suspect her more liberal colleagues might have warmed to the idea a bit more so than her Tory friends.’ However, student Tom Walker, 19, said: It’s just going to confuse people. ‘We always referred to Jane as Big Dave, but we can’t really do that now.’","David Chaplin always knew he was a woman but didn't want to upset wife .

Celebrity psychic Sylvia Browne has finally broken her silence following the discovery of Amanda Berry - the missing girl whose mother Browne informed was dead. Browne told Miss Berry's mother, . Louwanna Miller, on a 2004 episode of the Montel Williams show that . Amanda, who went missing the year before, was no longer alive. Following the psychic's words, Ms Miller walked away being '98 per cent' sure that her daughter was dead. She died of heart failure two years later. Hope lost: Sylvia Browne (left) released a statement on her website today saying 'only God is right all the time' after she told Louwanna Miller (right) that her daughter Amanda Berry was 'not alive' in 2004 . The self-described medium broke her silence on her website . today: 'For more than 50 years as a spiritual psychic and guide, when . called upon to either help authorities with missing person cases or to . help families with questions about their loved ones, I have been more . right than wrong. 'If ever there was a time to be . grateful and relieved for being mistaken, this is that time. Only God is . right all the time. 'My heart goes out to Amanda Berry, her family, the . other victims and their families. I wish you a peaceful recovery.' Amanda's cousin Sherry Cole had supposedly reached out to Browne, according to the psychic's website. Ms Cole said: 'Our family in no way blames Sylvia. This doesn't change anything. We still love her and believe in her.' Nearly a decade before Amanda Berry . was found alive in the home of her alleged abductor Ariel Castro, the . young woman's mother went on The Montel Williams Show looking for . answers from Browne. Tragic end: Louwanna Miller, pictured with Amanda Berry, died from a heart failure in 2006 . 'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told Miller on the show, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' Browne added that she would only see her daughter 'in heaven, on the other side.' Amanda . Berry, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on May 6 . with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from . the same block ten years ago. They . were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda . gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade. Amanda went missing on April 21, . 2003, on the eve of her 17th birthday shortly after she called her . sister to say that she was getting a ride home from her job at Burger . King. On Monday night, Amanda had a smile . on her face as she hugged her weeping sister Beth as the pair were . reunited for the first time in a decade following her decade in . captivity in the home of Ariel Castro. The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal. After 19 months of refusing to accept that her daughter was dead, Ms Miller was finally forced to face what she believed at the time to be the awful truth. Reunited: Amanda Berry (centre) at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) and the daughter that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . Before the kidnapping: Amanda Berry, pictured . before her disappearance, was last seen leaving her job at Burger King a . day before her 17th birthday and told her sister that she was getting a . ride home . The grieving mother gave away her daughter's computer and took down her pictures. 'I'm not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told the paper. Miller . was devastated by what she heard on the nationally syndicated talk . show, but said that she believed '98 per cent' in Browne. The . mother said after her on-screen conversation with Sylvia Browne that . while she wanted to hold on to hope that Amanda was still alive, after a . year-and-a-half without any breaks in the investigation, she had little . to go on. 'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home,' Miller said. The . FBI and police working on the missing person case were skeptical of the . psychic's verdict, saying they will consider Amanda Berry was alive . until her body and evidence proving that she was dead is found. House of horrors: Amanda Berry was freed along with two other women from this home in Cleveland, Ohio, where the three had been held captive for 10 years . Louwanna Miller died at age 44 from a heart failure and a host of other ailments a little more than a year after her 2004 encounter with Sylvia Browne. Miller had spent three years searching for her daughter, during which time those who knew her said the woman’s health had deteriorated. Amanda Berry was discovered alive after she managed to escape from the Cleveland home of a man she said had kept her in captivity for the past 10 years along with two other young women. Those who knew Mrs Miller, among them Councilwoman Dona Brady, said that the devastated mother died of a broken heart. Furious Twitter and Facebook users . heaped insults on Browne following the discover Miss Berry was alive, . calling her a 'grief vampire' and a' hunch-backed harpy,' among other . things. 'I remember . you on Montel Williams telling the family of Amanda Berry she was dead,"" wrote Facebook commenter Lisa Lupas on Browne's Facebook page. Long career: Browne has been a regular on talk shows like The Montel Williams Show and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno (pictured) 'What do you have to say for yourself? You are a fraud! What a horrible horrible thing to say to a family holding on to nothing but hope and faith. Shame on you!' Another commenter Michael Martin wrote: 'Hey Sylvia, Amanda Berry is alive. Think of the torment you put her mother through when you told the poor woman her daughter was dead. 'Then the mother herself died before she could learn the truth. You are evil, evil, evil and ought to be ashamed of yourself.' This is not the first time that Browne, who also has helped the FBI in the past, faced public scrutiny over her predictions. In 2003, the TV psychic incorrectly told the parents of missing 11-year-old boy Shawn Hornebeck that their son was dead, and that his body could be found near 'two jagged boulders,' ABC News reported. Nearly four years later, Shawn was found living with his kidnapper Michael Devlin 60 miles from his home in Missouri. A website was created in 2006 called Stop Sylvia Browne dedicated to documenting the psychic's purported failures.","Medium Sylvia Browne appeared in 2004 on the talk show and told Louwanna Miller: 'She's not alive, honey'

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 06:26 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:28 EST, 17 May 2013 . Energy giants will be forced to compensate customers if they are mis-sold products, under a crackdown on rogue selling. New powers will be handed to the regulator not only to fine firms which dupe consumers, but to force suppliers to reimburse them and provide compensation. It has been hailed as a victory for the consumer following a series of price-fixing scandals by the Big Six energy firms which have left tens of thousands of householders out of pocket. Big energy firms who mis-sell products to customers will have to compensation for the first time . Last month, SSE, the UK’s second largest energy supplier, was fined a record £10.5million by Ofgem for ‘prolonged and extensive’ mis-selling which affected up to 23,000 customers. But while thousands of compensation claims have been lodged, it is unclear how many will be successful and whether they will be paid back in full. Government sources said this new power, to be included in next month’s Energy Bill, would give the regulator the ‘teeth’ they need to force firms to give redress to victims. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which? said: ‘Mis-selling is totally unacceptable whether in energy, banking or any other industry that people rely on. ‘A series of scandals have ruined consumer confidence in energy, and our latest research shows that less than a quarter of people say they trust suppliers. This change can't come a minute too soon for fed up and cash strapped consumers.’ Adam Scorer, policy director at . Consumer Futures said: ‘It’s a victory for the consumer. Mis-selling has . been a stain on the energy market since the introduction of . competition. ‘While the situation has got better, . the recent history casts a long shadow. We fully supports Ofgem getting . greater powers to benefit customers rather than the Exchequer when . issuing fines’. The proposed new law is intended to . radically simplify the energy market, after David Cameron said the . number of different energy plans and tariffs on offer was ‘bewildering’ for consumers. More than eight out of ten customers . pay too much for their energy because they are not aware of the cheapest . tariff, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Consumer groups backed the move to help people with their energy bills . It is expected to force each firm to offer only a handful of different tariffs; make it clear to customers if they could save money on a cheaper plan, and offer easier options for switching such as via smartphones and ‘collective switching’ websites where thousands of people can put pressure on their suppliers to reduce their prices. Millions of people on ‘dead’ tariffs which are no longer available, particularly the vulnerable elderly, will be automatically switched to the best deal for their circumstances to save up to £150 a year. Ofgem currently has the powers to investigate energy firms which it believes to have incorrectly sold products, failed to help vulnerable customers, or acted anti-competitively. If they are found to have breached their licence conditions, they can be fined up to 10 per cent of turnover. But this money simply goes into the Treasury’s coffers unless the firm chooses to compensate their customers. SSE offered £1.5million to repay its customers last month after it was exposed for having lied about the savings households could make by switching from other firms. But while 11,000 people lodged claims for compensation, this would give each victim only £65, when the first 4,400 claims processed by the company found an average customer loss of £100. EDF was last year fined £4.5million after its doorstep salespeople were found to have exaggerated the financial savings customers could make by switching from other providers. After negotiating an agreement though Ofgem, it agreed to pay £3.5million to 70,000 ‘vulnerable’ customers at risk of fuel poverty, and agreed to fund a £1million helpline. But an Ofgem document published afterwards said they were urging ministers to make it a legal obligation to compensate all customers who were mis-sold, to send out a strong message. It stated: ‘Ofgem does not have the power to compel companies who are found in breach of their licence conditions to provide redress, including compensation to customers but it is seeking such powers from government. ‘If granted, these powers would strengthen Ofgem’s ability to take more targeted action against companies who have breached their licences, including directing funds to customers where appropriate.’ Jo Ganly at uswitch said: ‘The regulator wanted this power, so this is great news. It will have full powers you would expect to protect the needs of consumers if this is made law.’ A government source told the Mail: ‘At a time of rising bills and concerns about the cost of living, this is intended to put power back in the hands of the consumer. The Big Six will be made to toe the line, so customers who are ripped off can claim compensation.’","New powers for regulator to force firms to provide recompense .

The Powerball jackpot jumped to $550 million on Thursday — the third largest lottery in history — as dreamers in all but the seven states where the game isn't played snatched up tickets for the minuscule chance at a life on easy street. Thursday's announcement by the Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association means ticket sales have soared since Wednesday night's drawing for an estimated $360 million jackpot, in which no one picked all six numbers correctly. Sales jumped by $260 million in the days before November's biggest Powerball jackpot win in history — a prize of $587.5 million. And Iowa Lottery spokeswoman Mary Neubauer said it's possible that Saturday's could end up eclipsing that amount. Sight to see: The Powerball Jackpot has steadily jumped to $550 million, seen earlier at $475 in California on Thursday, as ticket sales surged following Wednesday's failed win . Lining up: People line up to buy lottery tickets at the Bluebird Liquor store in Hawthorne, California before Saturday's drawing . A $550 million jackpot would be the second largest in Powerball history and the third largest for any lottery. Lottery officials expect jackpot totals of this size to continue to climb in shorter amounts of time, thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012 that increased the odds of winning some kind of prize, but also lowered the possible number combinations to win the Powerball. There's also 'cross-selling' of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets — states being able to sell both Powerball tickets and Mega Millions tickets — that began in January 2010. As a result, large jackpots will continue to surpass all-time jackpot records set years ago, said Neubauer. 'It usually took a handful of months, if not several months, for a jackpot to reach this large amount,' she said. 'Now it's achieving that within a handful of weeks. I think the redesign is achieving exactly what we had wanted it to achieve, which is the bigger, faster-growing jackpot.' Lucky hand? Lilly Sanchez holds up lotto tickets she purchased including a Powerball ticket in Orlando, Florida on Thursday . Making history: The estimated prize of $550 million would be the third largest in lottery history while the second largest for Powerball . Ready to go: Powerball tickets, right, along with other lotto tickets are seen at the ready in Florida on Thursday as all but seven states rush to buy in . The redesign means players don't necessarily have to strike big to get lucky. A $1 increase and new $1 million and $2 million prizes means the odds of winning something have increased. On Wednesday, $1 million prizes were won in 16 states, and $2 million prizes were won in two states. In fact, more than half of the all-time jackpot records have been reached in the last three years. The top two all-time jackpots — $656 million from a Mega Millions jackpot and $587.5 million from a Powerball jackpot — were achieved in 2012. The last major jackpot win came when a New Jersey man won a $338.3 million jackpot on March 23. It is now considered the fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history. Players aren't complaining about the . large sums. Rachel Rand said she just couldn't help herself and bought . several Powerball tickets. Last winner: The last major jackpot win was by Pedro Quezada of New Jersey, pictured, who won a $338.3 million jackpot on March 23 - the believed fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history . 'How can you not play $2?' said the 32-year-old insurance adjustor. 'A $10 investment if you win is pretty good.' Insurance agent Joe Williams, of Middleton, Wis., doesn't necessarily spend more when the prize is high. But his $4 investment in the quick-pick option means he does spend. 'I know rationally it makes no sense,' he said. 'But at the same time, without a ticket, I have zero chance.' Tom Powers, 52, a janitor from Omaha, Neb., bought several tickets Tuesday from a convenience store. He said he would definitely walk away from work if he won the jackpot, but he's not sure how he would spend all the winnings. 'It's really unfathomable the amount of money this is putting out,' Powers said.","Ticket sales are soaring following Wednesday night's failed drawing to find a winner .

Police in Orem say the two sisters, aged 14 and 16, were walking through a Macey's parking lot on Wednesday afternoon when Alexander Navidad-Hernandez drove up asking if they wanted any money. The 27-year-old man allegedly then handed the girls a five-dollar bill with a phone number scribbled across it. He said, ""Call me if you need more money,"" the 14-year-old recalled to KUTV. Locked away: Alexander Navidad-Hernandez, 27, and Javier Santos-Jacobo, 36, (left to right) are charged with enticing a minor and sexual solicitation after allegedly asking two sisters, aged 14 and 16, for sex . 'It scared me a lot,' she said. 'My heart was hurting at first and I was shocked.' Once safely home the girls told their father what happened. Furious, and hoping to capture the man behind the horrific approach, he asked his eldest daughter to call the number back and ask what his exact intentions were. When the man answered, he told her. He wanted sex, the girl claims, but when she suggested a fee of $100 he said it was too high, as well as her second offer of $50. She says he offered her $30. 'I honestly think it’s disgusting that an older guy finds a 14-year-old girl attractive in any way,' the eldest daughter said. Proposition: The young sisters were walking outside this Maceys grocery store on Wednesday afternoon when they say Navidad-Hernandez drove up asking if they wanted some money . The girls' father immediately contacted . the Orem police department who helped stage a sting operation with the . youngest girl calling back the man and telling him that she was indeed . interested. The girls planned to meet him at Orem Junior High School with Navidad-Hernandez allegedly saying he wanted to bring a friend along so the girls could make some extra money. That second man was later identified as 36-year-old Javier Santos-Jacobo. When the girls arrived, with police ready and watching nearby, so did the two suspects who pulled up and parked in the junior high school's parking lot.

Posing happily together for the camera a few weeks ago, this is the family whose lives ended in cold-blooded slaughter in their home. Richard Smith stabbed his wife and two young children on the marital bed before starting a fire that killed him. Detectives are probing the possibility that he had been having an affair and that this was a key factor behind the appalling multiple murders. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Family: Richard Smith, pictured, killed his wife Clair, also pictured and children Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, (centre) at the family home in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. Their bodies were found on Sunday afternoon . Smith, 37, is believed to have killed . his family in the early hours of Saturday after they all attended a . function at the local cricket club. He murdered wife Clair, 36, and 13-month-old Aaron with a single stab wound to the chest. His other son Ben, nine, was also . stabbed once in the chest but died from suffocation, possibly through a . pillow being held to his face. Smith stayed in the house for another 24 hours – even washing his car on Sunday morning – before taking his own life. Tragic: Ben Smith, nine, was pictured in his local paper a month ago dressed up in a Pudsey Bear outift as part of a charity day alongside his classmates at Greenside Primary School in Pudsey, West Yorks . Friends lay flowers and read tributes next to a police cordon at the scene while Det Supt Paul Taylor, of West . Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, right, addresses the media this morning . Members of the public look at the tributes left at the police cordon in Pudsey, Leeds, where the four were found dead on Sunday afternoon . He put a mattress up against the . window of the room in which he had killed his family, blocked the door . and started a fire. He died from smoke inhalation, a post-mortem . examination showed. A neighbour raised the alarm after spotting the blackened bedroom window and phoned Smith’s brother Matthew. They called the police and, accompanied by three officers, broke into the house and found the bodies at 5.30pm on Sunday. Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, . who is leading the investigation, refused to speculate on the motive, . saying: ‘It will all come out in the fullness of time. ‘As we have previously stated we are . not looking for anyone else in connection with this enquiry and our role . is to now establish the facts leading up to the tragic event that has . ended the lives of four people and a seemingly happy family. Distraught: Cheryl Heights (left) and Sara Turnbull bring flowers to lay at the street in Pudsey, Leeds, where the family of four was found . Tributes: The bouquets were laid outside the house which was cordoned off with police tape. The note on flowers is from friends Sara and Dean Turnbull . Family friend Sarah Wilson and an unidentified youth leave after placing flowers near the house . ‘That information is then passed to the coroner, who will make a decision around the circumstances of the deaths.’ He said his thoughts were with family . and friends of the family, adding: ‘I cannot begin to imagine what they . have been through during the last 48 hours.’ Friends said the Smiths appeared to . have had no problems. They moved to their £180,000 house in Pudsey, West . Yorkshire, last May, had no money issues and appeared happy after 13 . years of married life. Investigation: Forensic teams work at the house today after the family was found in a bedroom on Sunday . Cul-de-sac: Police initially sealed off the house fearing a chemical leak . Smith was a designer for a shopfitting firm and his wife worked part-time as an accounts manager. He was also the coach of the local . under-nines football team that Ben played for and the whole family were . at the team’s Christmas party on Friday evening. Police have established there was no . row or incident at the event, attended by 35 adults and 31 children at . the Pudsey St Lawrence cricket ground. The Smiths left by taxi at 11pm – . the last time they were all seen alive. Tragedy: Neighbours described Smith as a 'great guy' who appeared to have had no problems . Tragedy: The bodies of two adults and two boys were found in the property . The fact that Ben’s advent calendar had not been opened on Saturday was another sign as to when the murders happened. Mr Taylor said: ‘We believe something . has happened overnight on Friday into the early hours of Saturday. If . anyone else has any other information that contradicts that we very much . want to hear from them.’ Sealed off: Emergency workers in protective clothing prepare to enter the houseon Sunday night. Officers initially thought the family might have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning . Under watch: An officer guards the property in the aftermath of the grim discovery . The bodies were discovered at a property near the centre of Pudsey on the outskirts of Leeds . He said no note to explain the crime . had been left in the house. Police are already focusing on Smith’s . personal life to establish the motive. Mrs Smith’s parents Alan and Norma Robinson paid tribute to their daughter in a statement. It said: ‘Clair was an exceptional . person, loving and caring to everyone. She was a loving mum, her . children were her life, and everything centred around her family and . home. ‘She was our daughter and our best . pal. We cannot imagine what caused this tragedy.’ The Smiths suffered . the heartbreak of losing a baby four years ago through a miscarriage at . 21 weeks. But their sadness turned to joy when Aaron was born in November last year and they moved to a bigger house as a result. Shelley Robson, 43, was Aaron’s . childminder and had helped look after him since he was a young baby. She . said: ‘My heart has been ripped out by this. They were such a lovely . family. ‘I know Richard and I don’t know what . has happened to make him flip and do that, to be honest I really feel . for him. Something must have gone really wrong.’","Richard Smith stabbed his wife and sons Ben, nine, and Aaron, one .

The Conservatives published draft legislation pledging a straightforward vote on the question: ‘Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?’ It said the referendum would take place by December 31, 2017 – by which point Mr Cameron says he will have attempted to negotiate a looser, trade-based relationship with Brussels if he remains in Downing Street. David Cameron, left, has been forced to deny he is panicking over Europe following days of bickering in the Tory party over Europe in the wake of the election success of UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, right . The Prime Minister, on a visit to the US, said only the Conservatives wanted to give people a say and blamed the Liberal Democrats for blocking an immediate government bill. Instead, the draft legislation will be introduced as a Private Member’s Bill by a Tory backbencher. Mr Cameron’s attempt to draw a line under days of Tory bickering over Europe won the support of arch Eurosceptics, including MPs Douglas Carswell and Zac Goldsmith and Euro MP Daniel Hannan. But others rejected Mr Cameron’s olive branch, saying a Private Member’s Bill supported by the party leadership was ‘second best’ to a government Bill with time set aside in the Commons. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood, meanwhile, demanded an immediate ‘mandate referendum’, giving the Prime Minister more authority to go to Brussels and demand the repatriation of key powers, before the in/out one. The PM wants to negotiate a looser, trade-based relationship with Brussels before a promised referendum . Cameron has won over Eurosceptics such as Zac Goldsmith, left, but John Redwood, right, demanded an immediate 'mandate referendum' Tory MPs are still expected to press . ahead with a vote tonight expressing regret that last week’s Queen’s . Speech, setting out the Government’s legislative programme for the year . ahead, did not include an EU referendum Bill. Mr . Cameron insisted he was ‘profoundly relaxed’ about how Conservative MPs . voted on the amendment, saying anything that underlined the commitment . he made to a referendum earlier this year was welcome. Asked in Boston whether he had panicked in the face of pressure from his MPs, he said: ‘Not at all. If this was a Conservative-only government, we would just get on and legislate. We can’t do that because we are in coalition. But I have always said that anything we can do to strengthen, add credibility to the pledge... we should do.’ Mr Cameron insisted he was leading the debate on Europe rather than being dragged along by his party. ‘The whole reason we are now having this debate is because of the act of leadership I gave,’ he said. ‘When the dust has settled people will . be able to see that there is one party, the Conservative Party, . offering that in/out referendum and two other mainstream parties, the . Liberal Democrats and Labour, who oppose an in/out referendum. ‘It is in the national interest to change Europe and change the relationship with Europe.’ He conceded that some Tories wanted to have a referendum immediately, but added: ‘That’s not my view.’ Senior Tory sources said an initial . assessment of the numbers suggested it was ‘feasible’ that a backbench . Bill on the issue could win a vote in the Commons, depending on the . number of Labour rebels. The six-clause Bill was drawn up by solicitor general Oliver Heald, with input from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, one of the staunchest Eurosceptics in the Cabinet. Pro-Europe Tory Kenneth Clarke said it would be a political and economic 'catastrophe' to leave the EU . Tory chairman Grant Shapps said that the publication of the draft Bill would force other parties to tell voters whether they will offer a referendum. Tory MP Mr Carswell said: ‘I feel I can now say “Yes, thanks, Prime Minister. On matters Europe, that’s what I wanted”.’ MEP Mr Hannan said: ‘David Cameron has done what Eurosceptics wanted.’ Kenneth Clarke, one of the few pro-Europeans in the Cabinet, said: ‘I think we should move on now. The important thing is to make sure we get the right result from any referendum which is held to avoid the catastrophe for the country’s economy and our political standing in the world if we were to be so very, very reckless as to leave the European Union.’","David Cameron revealed referendum question: 'Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?'

Doctors believe that 61-year-old Grahame Giles could have survived if he had been given drugs by Brian Jewers, the paramedic who was treating him. A second inquest into the Mr Giles's death exposed a 'failure in care,' according to Coroner Tony Brown. Brian Jewers (pictured left) refused to administer drugs that could have saved Grahame Giles' life. Mr Giles' widow, Marion (pictured right) said finding out about this three years after her husband's death was 'horrendous' Brian Jewers, . who worked for the North East Ambulance Service, was struck off . following the incident in 2008. However, Mr Giles’ widow Marion, now 66, was only informed about the details of her husband's death . following an investigation by Sky News. Speaking at today's inquest in Alnwick, Northumberland, Mrs Giles said: 'I should have been told what had happened to my husband at the start. I was entitled to know the truth. The second inquest into Grahame Giles' death concluded that Brian Jewers and the Ambulance Service missed an opportunity to provide better care . 'The hardest thing to come to terms with was to hear three years after my husband died that the truth had all been hushed up. 'That was very deceitful. I thought it was horrendous that they could have done that to me. 'I was just getting over his death when I . was told that perhaps he could have lived if this paramedic had done . his job properly. It was an awful shock.' The inquest heard that the failure of . the North East Ambulance Service to tell Mrs Giles about the circumstances of her husband’s death, in March 2008, was due to a breakdown in . communications. It also heard that the risk and claim . department within the trust was not aware of the investigation into . Mr Jewers' actions until three years after the incident. A second inquest into the death was opened after a previous coroner was not made aware of all the facts of the case. Coroner Tony Brown said: 'There was a clear missed opportunity to provide more suitable medical care by the paramedic. 'This failure in care was also a failure in care provided by Brian Jewers’ employers the North East Ambulance Service.' The inquest heard that Mr Jewers was asked to attend a course to give him the relevant training but he declined.

A grieving husband has been accused of assaulting a traffic warden who tried to ticket cars outside his home while he waited for his wife's funeral cortege. Angry relatives confronted the warden as he was allegedly preparing to issue them fines while they waited for the hearse carrying the body of cancer victim Rena Page, 64. Her stunned husband Mac Page, 66, challenged the official who later reported him to the police for assault. Stunned: Matthew Page, 39, with wife Kerrie outside his family's home where a traffic warden tried to issue tickets as they waited for his mother's funeral cortege. His father is accused of assaulting the warden . Four cars were briefly parked on a . single yellow line outside Mr Page's home in Hunstanton, Norfolk, as . the funeral cars moved into position. The family confronted the official who allegedly carried on noting the cars' details. A funeral director is also reported to have tried to intervene. Angry family members admit they challenged the warden but were stunned to later learn he had reported widower Mr Page for assault. Mr Page, a self-employed gardener, said yesterday: 'I can’t describe how I felt really. It was bad enough to bury someone at 64 after 48 years of marriage. This bloke didn’t show any compassion at all. Mourned: Relatives of Rena Page, 64, who died of cancer, have accused the warden of behaving heartlessly . 'If it was the middle of the season and there were lots of cars about, I could at least understand it a little bit, but he was just being a jobsworth. The last three years - watching my wife die of cancer - have been quite horrendous, now we have this to deal with on top. 'What I couldn’t believe is that when we rang to complain, his boss backed him up. How can anyone in authority back somebody like that up? It beggars belief.' Mr Page said he was happy to appear in court to give his version of events. His son Matthew Page, 39, who runs a chip shop, added: 'There was just a total lack of respect - and they wonder why they get a bad name. The worst thing was Mum never liked a fuss. This turned it all into a debacle. I cannot believe someone could be so insensitive.' Funeral director John Lincoln, who was leading the cortege, said: 'I have never known anything like this before. He might lose someone one day and I wonder how he would react if this sort of thing happened to him.' A West Norfolk Council spokesman confirmed discretion exists within its parking rules for occasions such as funerals, but refused to apologise until the outcome of the police investigation into the assault was known. The spokesman said: 'Following the incident referred to, a member of our staff reported an assault and the matter is now with the police. We await the outcome of any subsequent investigations.' The spokesman said no tickets were issued during the incident but that vehicles attending a funeral, 'are not exempt from parking rules.

"By . James Slack and Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:49 EST, 16 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 16 May 2013 . Intervention: Home Secretary Theresa May last week said that police forces must continue to name arrested suspects if it is in the public interest to . Police chiefs are preparing to defy the Prime Minister by imposing a ban on identifying arrested suspects. Despite warnings from David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May, the Association of Chief Police Officers is pressing ahead with plans to impose a policy of almost total secrecy. A draft of its draconian new guidance – due to be approved next week – states: ‘Save  in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances, the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released by police forces to the press or the public.’ It flies in the face of a hugely significant intervention by Mr Cameron on Wednesday, when he said there should be a ‘working assumption’ in favour of identifying crime suspects. He backed Mrs May, who last week said that police should be free to name those who have been arrested if it is in the ‘public interest’. Campaigners say it is vital that officers should not have their hands tied by rules that could prevent victims and witnesses coming forward. In the case of Stuart Hall, a string of  victims contacted the police only after the media reported that the TV presenter had been arrested for indecent assault. But despite the warnings, Acpo are pressing ahead with their guidelines. The phrase in the rules ‘save in exceptional circumstances’ echoes the Leveson report, which called for anonymity in the event of arrests. This is despite Mrs May and Mr Cameron pointing out to officers that, while the issue was raised in the Leveson report, it was not one of the judge’s substantive recommendations. Last night campaigners attacked the plan for secret arrests. Kirsty Hughes, of the Index On . Censorship, said: ‘De facto anonymity for people who have been arrested . would reverse the principle of open justice we have in the UK and could . lead to people being arrested and taken into custody without anyone . knowing about it. ‘Anonymity may be appropriate in certain circumstances, but sweeping powers for secrecy should not be the norm. In cases of suspected rape or abuse, naming people who have been arrested can encourage other witnesses to come forward and help to secure convictions.’ Peter Watt, director of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s helpline, said: ‘Sex offenders frighten children into staying silent and make them feel they are partly responsible for what’s happening. This can leave the victim feeling isolated and unaware there may well be others suffering the same ordeal. ‘When a suspect is named in the public interest – for example when there is a child protection issue or because the police believe there are more victims – it gives others an opportunity to come forward, which helps build a stronger criminal case.’ Last week, Mrs May wrote to police chiefs to insist they must not continue with the practice – which has been adopted by a third of all forces – of refusing to identify suspects even after they had been charged. One force insisted they had adopted the policy in direct response to Leveson. But Mrs May said it risked undermining ‘transparency in the criminal justice system’. She added: ‘I believe there should be a right to anonymity at arrest, but I know that there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named.’ Encouraging for witnesses: In the case of Stuart Hall, who abused a string of young girls, many victims contacted the police only after the media reported that the TV presenter had been arrested for indecent assault . On Wednesday, five days after the letter was first made public, reports on the BBC suggested this meant Mrs May was herself in favour of anonymity except in exceptional circumstances. However, when this was put to the Prime Minister by journalists, he made it clear this was not the case. Mr Cameron said: ‘I know some people want to connect it specifically with Leveson. But actually it’s a long-standing debate about how to get the balance right between making things public, which as Theresa has said should be the working assumption, but also respecting privacy where that is appropriate. ‘It’s a very difficult balance to get right. On the one hand, making public the details of the arrest can help to bring forward evidence and bring forward potential victims. Therefore it is completely in the public interest. Sometimes it is right to respect the privacy of the individual because the publicity around these sorts of arrests can be genuinely life changing. There is no simple answer to this.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘I saw Theresa’s approach in advance and I think it’s the right one.’","New Association of Chief Police Officers guidance will keep arrests secret .

Millions of U.S. children are living with mental health disorders, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC looked at the rates of various mental health conditions among American children for its first comprehensive report on the state of mental health among children aged between 3 and 17. About one in five children of these ages have a mental health disorder, according to the CDC, and the numbers seem to be going up as does the cost of health care associated with the conditions. CDC: One in five children between ages 3-17 have a mental health disorder . 'Millions of children in the U.S. have mental disorders that affect their overall health and present challenges for their loved ones. In addition, the financial costs of childhood mental disorders are at least an estimated $247 billion each year,' Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said in a news release. 'We are working to both increase our understanding of these disorders, and help scale up programs and strategies to promote children's mental health so that our children grow to lead productive, healthy lives.' Childhood mental health disorders include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and Tourette Syndrome. CDC researchers worked alongside other federal health agencies in order to come up with the number of children diagnosed with mental health disorders between 2005 and 2011. Pricey: The costs of childhood mental disorders are at least an estimated $247 billion a year . They found ADHD was the most prevalent disorder affecting nearly 7 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 17. Behavioral or conduct problems followed affecting 3.5 percent of children, then anxiety (3 percent), depression (2 percent), autism (1 percent) and Tourette's (0.2 percent for 6 to 17-year-olds). The CDC in March reported one in 50 U.S. school children have some form of autism. This is significantly higher than the one in 88 estimate put forward by the government last year, . Older adolescents, from ages 12 to 17, were tracked for substance abuse disorders. Prevalent: ADHD is the most prevalent disorder affecting nearly 7 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 17 . The report showed nearly 5 percent of them used an illicit drug within the past year, more than 4 percent said they used alcohol, and almost 3 percent admitted cigarette dependence within the past month. The CDC hopes to better understand the impact of these mental health disorders to inform needs for treatment and intervention strategies. Children with the disorders are also more likely to have chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy than children without mental health problems. The disorders can also last into adulthood, increasing risk for decreased productivity, substance use and injury, and substantial costs both to the individual and the U.S. economy. The CDC also pointed out that suicide, the second-leading cause of death among adolescents between 12 and 17, can result from the interaction of mental health disorders and other factors.","A fifth of all children may have mental disorders - ADHD is the most common .

Forget printing your own photos, now you can print and make your own pinhole camera from a cereal box. An art graduate from Brighton has designed a retro-looking pinhole camera made from cardboard, a paperclip and a soft drinks can. The camera, called Videre, which is Latin for 'to see', takes photos using medium-format film and is put together using folds and glue. Scroll down for video . A Brighton art graduate has designed a pinhole camera out of a cereal box and soft drinks can. Photos are projected onto a strip of medium-format film when a cardboard flap is moved over the pinhole. Inventor Kelly Angood is now selling the design kit so other people can make it too . The design for Angood's cardboard pinhole camera was inspired by some of her favourite retro cameras. The camera doesn't have a lens; instead it has a hole which is covered by a cardboard insert. When the insert is removed, light travels through the hole and projects the photo on a strip of medium-format film . A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens. It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light. When . you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted . image on the film along the opposite side of the box. This technique is similar to how eyes see and process images. The smaller the hole, the sharper the image, yet the dimmer it will appear. A pinhole camera's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card, for example. Designer Kelly Angood is now selling the design so others can print and make their own DIY cameras at home. Angood, 24 from Dalston in east London, came up with idea for the camera when she was a student in Brighton three years ago. She said she knew she'd never be able to afford a medium-format camera so designed a model that she could make herself. It was designed from different elements of Angood's favourite cameras. She said: 'It goes back to the basics of photography and teaches you the fundamentals.' 'It's easy to use and the results are lovely'. She also designed a 35mm version of the camera. She offered the design for this smaller camera for free as a PDF download from her website. But Angood has now set up a Kickstarter campaign so she can ship the cardboard designs, and all the materials needed to make the camera, to customers. Examples of pictures taken using Angood's cardboard pinhole camera. Angood is hoping people who buy her camera will submit their own images to an online gallery . The side view of the Videre pinhole camera. Anyone who pledges to Angood's Kickstarter campaign will get a free PDF download of a smaller pinhole camera design, also by Angood, that can also be printed and recreated from cardboard . The Kickstarter project ends on 18 May 2013. It has already received over £28,000 worth of funding, from more than 670 backers. Once the funding for the project closes, Angood will print the die-cut kit onto thick recycled card. The kit wlll also come with instructions and a spare medium-format spool. Angood will also be producing an instructional video. Photos taken using the camera will then be added to an online gallery, and can be submitted by Videre owners. However, Angood states on her Kickstarter page that the kits won't be delivered until November. In the meantime, Angood has also designed a 35mm version of the camera and anyone who pledges to the fund will get a downloadable PDF of this kit. The film used in both camera designs will need to be processed either in a DIY dark room, or at a photography shop.

The sudden decline baffled bird lovers, with some blaming overfishing of the North Sea or pollution from oil and plastics. Others feared that changing climate could be driving them away. On four of the eight Farne Islands there was a dramatic decrease of up to 50 per cent. In recent years, the signs were that numbers had begun to steadily creep back up.

An astonishing 24 percent of Americans say they moved domestically between cities in the U.S. within the last five years according to a new Gallup poll. The latest figures taken from adults across the country easily names it one of the most mobile in the world while collectively North America had more than any other region. Domestic migrants: Among 381 million adults who migrated within their countries worldwide within the last five years the United States' population was one of the most mobile in the world . Similar geographic contenders for the title by region are Australia and New Zealand which together reported roughly 18 percent of total internal migrants within the same time. On its own New Zealand reported an astounding 26 percent of internal migrants while Finland saw 23 percent and Norway 22 percent. Countries with the lowest mobility trends included China in Developing Asia, which reported less than 5 percent of its population. 'Migration is often associated with the search for better educational opportunities, and across most regions, adults with higher education are more likely to be internal migrants,' Gallup explains. 'Worldwide, those with at least a college education are more than twice as likely (13%) to say they moved internally in the past five years as those with primary education or less (5%).' Numbers: In the following graph capturing and comparing regions of the world, the educated and young are seen more likely to have migrated domestically within the past five years . They argue of there being no evidence of an education effect in regions such as the Commonwealth of Independent States which had six percent of internal migrants. Among age groups, younger adults made up the greatest number of internal migrants which world-wide equated to 381 million adults. Worldwide, 10 percent of adults between 15 and 29 years of age reported moving within their country. After the age of 50 that number was only 5 percent. The study reports having surveyed 236,865 adults in 139 countries with those countries said to represent more than 97 percent of the world's adult population, 'enabling a reliable global estimate,' according to Gallup.","North America saw 24 percent of Americans moving domestically from city to city .

His namesake was a character in The Lord of the Rings, the famous novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. But Gollum the kitten has proved to be a Lord of the Rinse - after surviving a 30-minute cycle in a washing machine. The eight week-old hid in a pile of laundry to escape the noise of owner Lauren Gavin hoovering. Ms Gavin then tipped the load into the washing machine and put it on a full colour wash without spotting her inside. She returned to her living room to hoover and half an hour later opened the washing machine - and Gollum fell unconscious onto the kitchen floor. The 22-year-old picked her up and ran with her to the nearby vets for lifesaving treatment. The tortoiseshell kitten was so cold and had so much fluid around her lungs that it took an hour to raise her temperature. But after being fitted with a drip she eventually regained consciousness and returned home the same night to be reunited with her brother Squidgy. Ms Gavin, of Larkfield, Kent, said: 'I'd been hoovering, and the other cats went upstairs to get away from the noise. 'Gollum went into the kitchen and must have hopped in. I went to pull my washing out and she was just slumped on top of it. 'When I saw her I was devastated. She was meowing so faintly I could barely hear it, and she was hardly breathing. It was just so unexpected. 'I literally just ran into the vets and explained what happened. They whisked her off instantly into the back room. 'We waited and when they came to say she was OK I was so relieved. She is practically back to her normal self. They said she shouldn't jump around but she was jumping around just the same. It took vets an hour to raise Gollum's temperature (pictured with owner Lauren Gavin) after she fell unconscious . Sandhole Veterinary Centre in Snodland, Kent, where staff treated Gollum after she survived 30 minutes in a washing machine . 'I'm so grateful to the vets for saving her life.'

It all happened at the Ocean Mile Inn in Fort Lauderdale when a Toyota Camry smashed into Sarah Ahlstrom's rental. The sight of the car floating in the pool of the motel left people stunned. Scroll down for video... Plunged: Workers pull out a rental car than ended up submerged in a swimming pool after another vehicle ploughed into it . Capturing the moment: CCTV sees the rental car entering the pool area of the motel . On the edge: Ms Ahlstrom's rental car is about to take a dip . Making waves: Seconds after the car is shoved into the pool, waves are still visible from the impact . 'I thought we'd been bombed,' said Ms Ahlstrom. 'I've never heard a noise that loud ever,' she told the Sun Sentinel. She thought about the possibility of a very different outcome had she been closer to the car at the time of the accident. 'Another 10 minutes, I would have been dead,' she said mentioning that she was about to pick up some fluffy slippers that had been left on the car's back seat. The female driver of the Toyota Camry is currently in hospital with life-threatening injuries. Motel guests are glad no one was at the pool when the car plunged inside. 'I feel very grateful, I thank God ... it was a horrible thing,' said motel guest Ilona Dihanyi. Nudged in: The cash occured here where an out-of-control vehicle crashed into a parked rental car pushing it into the swimming pool . Theories: Camera footage appears to show the white car swerving to avoid the black vehicle in the center of the photo. This ultimately led to the accident . The owners of the inn, Fernando Chang and Karelia Freites, were confused at first because they could not see any driver from the car that ended up in the pool. Soon they realised that there had only been one victim in the crash. It's not clear what caused the accident however surveillance cameras show a driver traveling in the wrong direction of the A1A highway. A white vehicle is seen on surveillance video  speeding northbound in the southbound lanes of A1A in Fort Lauderdale. The driver almost hits a black car that was pulling into a parking lot. The car then slammed into a parked car and pushed it into a motel pool. It's thought that the driver in the crash was dodging another car to avoid a collision. The inn owners say after removing the debris and replacing the water, they intend to replace the fence around the pool with something a little stronger.","Car driving up A1A highway swerves to avoid oncoming traffic .

Jessica Clarke, 20, who created the designs with Annie Brown, 18, said: ‘We started off making hoods and rugs for my grandfather’s horses and from there we built up a business. ‘All the designs led up to making the onesie, and as far as we know, we’re the only ones in the world making these products. They have been selling all over the  place and have made our little company, Shwmae Products, international in just a matter of weeks. ‘They’re particularly popular in Australia and America.

The gunman who held hostage 21-year-old Hofstra University student, Andrea Rebello, who later died in the police gun battle has been identified by police as Dalton Smith - a known criminal who was wanted for absconding parole for robbery. Police revealed the identity of Smith, 30, of Hempstead, today and revealed a warrant was put out for his arrest on April 25. He had been found guilty of robbery in the 1st degree and had an extensive criminal background going back to 1999 with multiple convictions for theft and assault. Robbery: Dalton Smith was today identified by police as the man who was carrying out a robbery on a sorority house in Uniondale when Andrea Rebello was shot dead . He also spent time in prison and was convicted again for handling contraband goods while behind bars. He was shot by police on Friday after what appears to be an attempted robbery on Rebello, her twin and their friends. Reports say the man shot Andrea Rebello as she pleaded for her life. The 30-year-old followed the sisters, Jessica and Andrea, Jessica's boyfriend John Kourtessiss and another student called Shannon Thomas back to the girls' California Avenue sorority house from the popular student bar, McHebes, according to the New York Post. The gunman reportedly targeted the students after seeing them spending large amounts of money in the drinking spot to celebrate the end of the school term. Around 2.20am he allegedly peered through the window in his ski mask and knocked on the door before forcing himself in and taking the group hostage. Raiding the home he shouted: 'I saw you at the bar drinking. I know you have more money than this!', according to police sources quoted in the Post report. He made the twins remain but told Thomas to leave and withdraw money from an ATM machine - warning her he would shoot her friends if she tried anything. While away from the home she called 911. As police arrived neighbors said they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life. Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down told the New York Times that she heard shouting. At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times. 'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said. Dehel said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars raced down the street. 'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, 'I think someone just got murdered'. It was awful,' she said. '[Police] drew their weapons and went inside,' neighbor Frank Pugliese, 19 told the Post. “She was pleading for her life. You could tell she was scared. It . was a surreal moment . . . She was pleading — her voice was trembling . and she yelled, ‘No, no!’ ” Victim: Andrea Rebello (right), has been shot dead by a masked intruder during an invasion of the home she shares with her twin sister Jessica (left). The suspect was also shot dead at the scene . Loss: The twins reportedly lived at the home just a block from campus with more of their sorority sisters . Horror: It is unknown at this time whether Rebello's twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while another girl was allowed outside . Smith is believed to have held them on the second floor. Thomas told the 911 dispatcher that he had a silver handgun pointed . at her friend's head in a bedroom, NBC reported. The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau . County police officers reached the home. When they arrived, shots went off. A law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him but this timetable of events was still being verified. 'We . don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a . robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference on Friday. Anthony Kourtessiss said his son was being questioned by police last night and Jessica was 'inconsolable'. 'It’s a terrible situation,' he told the newspaper. '[Jessica] was very upset, inconsolable right now.' Scene: Officers guard the area leading to the white house, background, where the shooting broke out . Scene: She was home with two other girls and a male when the break in took place around 2.30am .

Students . flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many . writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their . best wishes and prayers. A private vigil was held at the Hofstra Student Center last night and it was announced today that her funeral will take place on Wednesday. Rebello's father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside the family's home in Tarrytown, New York, yesterday. 'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused. 'I don't know what to do,' he added. Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'. Andrea was . a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister. 'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog. Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who are close to other members of the Portuguese community in the area. 'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said. Photographs . on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed . hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents . her cooking hobby. Neighbors said their house had a vegetable garden and the twins would sometimes drop off the produce. 'They brought me some vegetables from their garden. They’re very nice people. They’d do anything for you,' Harris Bank told the New York Post. Her funeral will be held at St. Teresa of Avila Church in Sleepy Hollow and will be officiated by the Rev.

Victim: Andrea Rebello, 21, is shown as a senior in her high school yearbook in 2010. She was killed early Friday morning . Neighbors of the Hofstra University sorority girl who was fatally shot during an early morning break-in Friday say they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life at the time of the killing. Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down from Andrea Rebello, the 21-year-old victim, told the New York Times that she heard shouting around 2 a.m. in their California Avenue neighborhood in Long Island. At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times. 'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said. Dehel said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars raced down the street. 'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, ""I think someone just got murdered."" It was awful,' she said. Rebello was at home with three others, . including her twin sister, Jessica, when an armed man wearing a ski . mask forced his way through the front door at 2:20 a.m. The home is just . a block from the campus.

Horror: It is unknown at this time whether Rebello's twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while another girl was allowed outside . The suspect, who was not a student at . the university, headed to the second floor of the home and held the . residents hostage, according to reports. He allowed one of the women to leave the home to withdraw money from an ATM and she called 911, Nassau County Deputy Inspector Kenneth Lack told NBC New York. She . told the 911 dispatcher that the intruder had a silver handgun pointed . at her friend's head in a second-floor bedroom, NBC reported. She added . that there were multiple hostages. The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau . County police officers reached the home. When they arrived, shots went off. Lack said it is not clear who fired, but a law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him. It is unknown at this time whether her twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while the other girl was allowed outside.

A private vigil was held at the Hofstra Student Center last night and it was announced today that her funeral will take place on Wednesday. Rebello's father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside the family's Tarrytown, New York yesterday. 'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused.' 'I don't know what to do,' he added. Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'. Andrea was . a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister. 'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog. Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who are close to other members of the Portuguese community who live in the area. 'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said. Photographs . on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed . hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents . her cooking hobby.

A young British backpacker died after drinking poisonous methanol labelled as gin during a holiday of a lifetime. Cheznye Emmons, 23, was served the deadly spirit while visiting an orangutan sanctuary in the jungle of Indonesia as part of a trip around south-east Asia with boyfriend Joe Cook, 21. The following day, the beautician woke up unable to see and was put through a tortuous journey out of the jungle – travelling by rickshaw and  taxi to reach a hospital five hours away. Terrifying: Cheznye Emmons tragically died after drinking from a bottle labelled 'gin' that later turned out to be filled with deadly methanol . Trip of a lifetime: The 23-year-old had been travelling across south Asia with her boyfriend Joe Cook, 21, and a male friend the couple had met on their travels when they bought the tainted alcohol from a local shop in Indonesia . Doctors put her in an induced coma as . they battled to save her from the effects of methanol poisoning – . blindness, kidney damage and seizures. Mr Cook, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, . who survived the poisoning, broke the news to her parents, Pamela and . Brenton, who flew out to be at her  bedside at the Columbia Asia . Hospital in Medan. But Mr and Mrs Emmons were told there . was nothing doctors could do and their daughter’s life-support was . switched off five days after the poisoning. The methanol had been poured into a . bottle labelled as gin and sold in a local shop in the popular tourist . site of Bukit Lawang in northern Sumatra. Dangers: Methanol is extremely poisonous and is known to cause kidney failure, blindness, seizures and death- as little as 30ml can be deadly for an adult . Family: Miss Emmons called Chez by her friends, is the youngest of four siblings . Difficult: On April 25, Miss Emmons' parents Pamela and Brenton made the heart-breaking decision to turn off her life support after flying out to be with her . Deadly: Within days the beauty therapist, from Great Wakering, Essex, complained of not being able to see and was rushed to the nearest eye clinic . Alcoholic drinks contain pure alcohol, known as ethanol, but not methanol. Methanol is a toxic chemical component that can be used for fuel, as an ingredient in formaldehyde, plastics and paints or as an anti-freeze or solvent. In recent years cheap homemade local alcohol and even apparent international brand name spirits are being contaminated with methanol - a poison you can’t taste or smell. High taxes have pushed up prices of manufactured wine, beer and spirits in the Muslim country encouraging a long-standing practice of stretching spirits with the locally made spirit known as arak – but some immoral suppliers are going further, adulterating those local spirits with the poisonous methanol. In 2009 two Britons were among 25 people to die in Indonesia after drinking palm wine spiked with methanol. Alan Cole, 59, and Rose Johnson, 48, died in separate incidents after consuming traditional arak. Rachel Craig, 22, from Ireland and her boyfriend Rene Puper, 23, who was Dutch, were also among the dead. In June last year Swede Johan Lundin, 28, was poisoned by a mojito laced with methanol. His fiancee, Michaela Pechac, watched in horror as he died. In December an Australian schoolgirl was blinded after drinking a tainted cocktail while on a trip to Bali. An 18-year-old boy was also temporarily blinded during a trip to Bali in November. In February 19 year-old Liam Davies from Perth died a vodka mixer was laced with methanol in Lombok. Miss Emmons’ brother Michael, 33, . said the family were still in shock and struggling to come to terms . with  his sister’s death. They are demanding an investigation. ‘From what we understand, the shop . would have poured the gin out of the original bottle and then replaced . it with methanol,’ he said. ‘It was in the original bottle with the gin . label on it. ‘The shop which sold the alcohol has . been shut down and there’s a police investigation. We just hope it . doesn’t get swept under the carpet like some of these things do.’ The family are desperate to warn young Britons of the dangers of buying alcohol while travelling to remote spots. Miss Emmons’ father, 47, a builder, said: ‘I would not want anyone to go through what we have been through. ‘If we can save the life of  just one . traveller by warning them of the dangers of poisoned alcohol then . something good will have come out of this terrible tragedy. ‘Cheznye was the apple of my eye. She . was my little girl and I am never going to see her again. She was a ray . of sunshine that would light up any room that she walked into.’ Miss Emmons from Great  Wakering, Essex, had two sisters, Bianca, 34, and Measha, 26, who said: . ‘We don’t want this to happen to anyone else and I know Chez wouldn’t have wanted to die in vain.’ High taxes have pushed up the price . of recognised brands of wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia, encouraging . a long-standing practice of stretching drinks with the locally made . brew known as arak. Some suppliers are going further, . adulterating spirits with methanol, which is colourless. Earlier this . year, an Australian teenager died after drinking vodka that had been . mixed with methanol on the Indonesian island of Lombok. And in 2009, 25 people died in Bali after drinking a batch of arak that was tainted with  the spirit. Methanol, which is also called methyl . alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the . production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component. Mr Cook, who had been with Miss Emmons for more than three years, has been left devastated by her death. ‘I feel so lost and empty,’ he said in a message posted on the internet. Death: After falling illl Miss Emmons trekked through the jungle to get help. She was referred to a hospital in Medan, Sumatra, where she was placed in an induced coma and later died . A family friend said the couple had been saving for months for the trip, which he described as a ‘holiday of a lifetime’. They had begun their journey in Thailand and planned to keep travelling ‘for as long as the money lasted’. The couple had danced at ‘Full Moon’ parties in Thailand, scaled cliffs, ridden  elephants, and seen tigers and orangutans. Friends have offered tributes to . Cheznye via a Facebook page dedicated to her memory. Sabrina Craven . said: ‘When I think of you, all I can think of is that million-dollar . smile and infectious laugh. ‘You were taken way too  soon and have left us all with heavy hearts.’ Devastated: Miss Emmons, with brother Michael. He said: 'We're all just in shock. 'We just hope it doesn't get swept under the carpet like some of these things do'","Cheznye Emmons, from Great Wakering, Essex, died in Sumatra in April .

Scroll down for video... When you gotta go: Little Thiago Burgos needed his diaper changing at a Starbucks store but there was no changing table in the restroom . Demeaned: Alex and Ruth Burgos say they felt as though they were spoken to inappropriately by Staff at the Denver Starbucks . War of words: After being told to clean up after their son, Alex Burgos deliberately poured his coffee on the floor and told the store to clean up after him . She says the coffee chain left her with no choice but to do it in the middle of the store.

"By . Cara Lee . PUBLISHED: . 06:17 EST, 16 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:36 EST, 16 May 2013 . The Daily Mail in association with This Morning and Lloyds Pharmacy recently asked readers to nominate special people in the healthcare sector who’ve made a real difference to their life, or to a loved one. After hundreds of votes, some well-known faces have also talked about their very own health heroes. Here, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Trisha Goddard and Liz Dawn talk about the doctors who saved their lives. Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes OBE had a heart attack and a consequent double heart bypass in 2003. His Health Hero is his cardiac surgeon, Professor Gianni Angelini, 60, from Bristol Royal Infirmary. Sir Ranulph says: . Sir Ranulph Fiennes (left) nominated his cardiac surgeon, Professor Gianni Angelini (right) as his Health Hero . After I had a heart attack on an aeroplane at Bristol Airport I was taken by ambulance to Professor Angelini. I was completely out of it and put on a . life support machine because my heart wasn’t working - Professor . Angelini’s on-going attempts to restart my heart went way beyond what . could be expected. In 2003 Sir Ranulph had a heart attack which resulted in him having to have a double heart bypass while on a life support machine . Three days later my heart still wouldn’t tick and he decided to perform a double bypass while I was still on life support. It was only on this, the 13th attempt, that my heart started again, thanks to Professor Angelini sticking with it. Apart from saving my life, he’s a real hero to me because when I then told him that in three months I needed to run seven marathons in seven days in seven continents, instead of doing what most doctors would do - not risk their reputation by allowing it - all he said was keep to 130 heartbeats per minute and do my best. I did and I’m incredibly grateful to him for being that brave. Since then I always call Professor Angelini for his opinion about expeditions I’m planning and he’s supported me on various challenges that could have impacted my heart, including two attempts on Mount Everest. In 2009 he encouraged me to try Everest for a third time again because he knew previously I’d got within 350ft of the summit. That time I did do it and became the first old age pensioner to get there. I feel very comfortable calling Professor Angelini whenever I need his help and I know he’ll make time for me. I’ve heard so many other patients talking about the great things he’s done for the hospital, completely rejuvenating the cardiac wing by raising money and introducing new equipment and techniques. A large number of people in the Bristol area will directly benefit from his efforts.Talk show host Trisha Goddard, 55, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008. Trisha’s Health Hero is Dr Simon Pain, 45, consultant general, breast and endocrine surgeon from Spire Norwich Private Hospital. Trisha says: . Trisha Goddard's Health Hero is Dr Simon Pain who treated her when she had breast cancer . When Simon broke the awful news that I had breast cancer I sobbed for half a second – then I wanted to get on with surgery. The nurses had suggested waiting a few weeks to operate but Simon understood me straightaway and booked me in for first thing the next day. You see, I don’t ‘do ill’ very well and Simon realised that and tailored his approach to me completely around my needs. I’ve suffered from depression in the past and following an extensive fitness regime has always helped to keep it under control. Throughout my chemotherapy and radiotherapy one of my main concerns was the state of my mental health and it was very important to me to continue exercising and working on my talk show. For most people with cancer, the approach is ‘sit down, take it easy’ - there’s not many doctors who go ‘ok, let’s help you work a 40-hour week, run, push weights and do kettlebell training three times a week’. While Simon raised an eyebrow and said he’s never had any patients doing that before, he supported me and gave me practical advice to make it easier for me, rather than be discouraging - which, to me, is going over, above and beyond what he had to do. He designed my treatment around my television production schedule and booked my radiotherapy appointments early in the morning because of work, I didn’t want anyone to see me and I wanted to be able to run to the appointment. I don’t do pity and Simon got that. I’d hear women saying ‘my doctor’s so lovely, he held me while I cried’ – but that would have unscrewed me. During her breast cancer treatment Trisha continued to work a 40-hour week, run, push weights and do kettlebell training three times a week . So Simon didn’t talk ill to me, he talked facts, he talked can do. His wonderful sense of humour and people skills made such a difference when I felt so low. Above all this, he’s a wonderful surgeon and did a fantastic job with my lumpectomy so I didn’t need any reconstruction and left a brilliant scar. I recently had my five-year all-clear with Simon – even now that I’m working in the States, I won’t transfer to anyone else because I want to stay with him. Former Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn, 73, was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2002. Her Health Hero Professor Ashley Woodcock, 61, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. Liz says: . ‘The first time I saw Professor Woodcock was in 2002 and I thought I was dying. I’d been so breathless on the set of Coronation Street so a nurse at Granada arranged for me to see him. He sent me for tests at the Wythenshawe and after the results came back he told me only a third of my lungs were working. I then realised that since 2000, when I used to panic and get breathless, it was due to a shortage of lung function so in fact he saved my life. I didn’t have the right medication before that. Liz Dawn's health hero is Professor Ashley Woodcook at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. He treats her lung disease . I’d been on a blue reliever inhaler for asthma but that’s the problem – there are about three million people in Britain that have got COPD (the collective name for lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease) and the blue inhaler isn’t working because they don’t realise that they’ve got more than asthma. It’s a shame because had I been diagnosed properly before I think I’d be better now. Liz Dawn says that when she first saw Professor Woodcock in 2002 she thought she was dying . But Professor Woodcock gave me the right medication, which helped my breathing and allowed me to stay on Coronation Street for five years after finding out about my lungs. I’ve got four children and six grandchildren, I’ve got a place in Spain - I’ve since had a life other than work which I wouldn’t have had, had I not gone to see him that evening. At first I had difficulty using my inhalers but he took me under his wing when I had problems and showed me how to use them. He’s been incredibly supportive and I always know that I can depend on him. When you’ve got what I’ve got you can have good days and bad. You’re not just cured and if you get cold or run down it can affect your breathing. Knowing that I can rely on him and that he can help me sort it out is very reassuring and I can ring him at any time, whenever I need him and I get through to him straightaway. Professor Woodcock is really to the point and he doesn’t mess around. I take everything he says in - if he says do this or take this, I do it. He also explains things in a way that’s easy to understand. His treatment has been amazing and he’s helped me to live another ten years.’","Sir Ranulphs' Health Hero is cardiac surgeon, Professor Gianni Angelini .

A Muslim convert who plotted to attack soldiers at Wootton Bassett had a daughter shortly before he was sentenced to six years in prison, it was revealed today. Richard Dart's wife gave birth to a baby girl 12 weeks premature, according to his brother Robb Leech, but soon afterwards the child's father was jailed for preparing acts of terrorism. Filmmaker Mr Leech also described how Dart convinced him that he had renounced terror - only to be caught planning to team up with the Taliban and assassinate British spy chiefs. Brothers: Richard Dart, left, with Robb Leech before he converted to Islam and started a terror plot . Threats: Dart posted chilling online videos in which he railed against the West after his conversion . Writing in The Times today, Mr Leech said: 'While he was in custody before the trial, Rich's new wife gave birth to a daughter, 12 weeks early. 'Now healthy with a life full of possibilities ahead of her, she will need a father and someone to guide her through the world. My only hope is that when Rich gets out, his little daughter will be his calling.' Mr Leech previously made a documentary, My Brother the Islamist, about how his stepbrother Dart, 30, went from being a normal Western young man who worked as a BBC security guard to an Islamic radical who wandered the streets of London warning locals they faced 'hellfire'. He spent time with Dart and his fellow jihadists, who incessantly talked about how they longed to go in Afghanistan and fight against the West's troops.

But after his film was broadcast in 2011, Mr Leech believed that Dart - who as a teenager taught him how to smoke and told him which clothes to wear if he wanted to be cool - had turned away from violence. When they met, rather than trying to convert his brother to Islam, Dart would talk about his plan to set up a business selling a special paste for Muslims designed to keep away evil spirits. So when he was arrested in July last year, Mr Leech assumed the police had made a mistake - but eventually he realised that his brother had been deceiving him. In March, Dart pleaded guilty to conspiring with two other Islamists to attack soldiers at Royal Wootton Bassett and target the heads of MI5 and MI6. Mr Leech wrote in The Times that when he saw his brother in the dock at the Old Bailey, he was suddenly seized with 'a profound and ridiculous giggle' as he was overcome with emotion. Catching his brother's eye, he wrote, 'We became naughty kids at the back of the class whose hilarity intensifies as the teacher becomes more angry. 'It was like he was saying: ""Oops, did I not mention any of this?""' When Dart was sentenced last month, he refused to stand in the dock, telling the judge: 'Judgment is only for Allah.' Co-conspirators Jahangir Alom, 26, a former Met police community support officer, and unemployed Imran Mahmood, 22, also received prison sentences over the terror plans.","Robb Leech describes how jihadist brother Richard Dart became father .

A teenager has made a remarkable recovery after two life threatening operations to correct her twisted spine.

An elderly woman became emaciated as a result of neglect while being looked after by carers, a serious case review has revealed. Jill Tambling, who required care for 22 years after suffering a stroke, was found to be starving when she died at the age of 70. Her weight at the time of her death prompted fears that she was neglected by carers. At one point Mrs Tambling was left alone at home, bedridden, and with no way to call for help while her husband was rushed to hospital . The report found that the pensioner was subjected to poor care which left her underweight and covered in bed sores, with scaly skin and matted, falling out hair. The review into her death also revealed that her carers watched TV and talked on their phones while visiting her at her home in Weymouth, Dorset. Despite Mrs Tambling's worryingly low weight being noted in 2007, nothing was done about it until she was moved into a care home five years later. At the time, care managers noted: ‘Her state of personal hygiene is such that we would not have expected to find in a person with such a comprehensive care package.’ Days before she was moved into the care home, Mrs Tambling had been left alone, bedridden and unable to call for help, after ambulance staff rushed her husband to hospital after he also suffered a stroke. Three weeks later a dietician reported she was 'very malnourished and emaciated', adding: ‘Her condition raises concerns of neglect by whoever was caring for her.’ Mrs Tambling's husband, Michael, branded the care 'awful'. He said: ‘I was having to feed her when she didn't want to eat and lift her on and off the commode more than 20 to 30 times a day. ‘I have no qualms with social services, but when the other carers came sometimes they just watched TV or were on their phones, they never helped me feed her or roll her over. Mrs Tambling was found to be seriously underweight, covered in bed sores and with scaly skin and matted hair. She was also 'very malnourished'. At one point she was left alone, bedridden and unable to call for help when her husband was rushed to hospital. Nine agencies, including South Western Ambulance Trust, Dorset County Hospital, Synergy Housing and Dorset County Council, have been criticised by the serious case review into her death. ‘They only came for half an hour in the morning, and then quarter of an hour at teatime and bedtime. ‘During this time she got bed sores, wasn't eating right, her hair was never washed. I felt so isolated and couldn't cope.’ The report found the authorities had . not carried out assessments of Mrs Tambling after she suffered a stroke . in 1990 and that they also failed to carry out assessments after a . second stroke in 2005. It criticised failures in 'effective . multiagency working' and said no effort was made to establish a . relationship with Mrs Tambling. It noted: ‘One of the evident flaws was that a lack of clarity existed even within individual agencies about role and responsibility.’ It highlighted 'individual poor basic practice...despite the involvement of a wide range of professionals' leading up to her death in May 2012. The report listed a 'number of failings' by nine agencies in Dorset including the Clinical Commissioning Group, South Western Ambulance Trust, Dorset County Hospital, Synergy Housing and the local authority. Two members of staff at Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust have been sacked in the wake of the report. Glen Gocoul, Dorset County Council's head of specialist adult services, promised lessons will be learned from the case. He said: ‘In hindsight, staff involved should have challenged those decisions and probed deeper to see if Mrs Tambling was getting the care she should have. ‘When she was moved to a home it was obvious something had gone wrong, she was frail, thin and her body weight was not what it should have been.’ Tim Archer, director of nursing and innovation at Dorset Health Care, added: ‘We are committed to working with partner agencies across Dorset to act on the lessons learnt and prevent this from happening again.’","Jill Tambling, 70, died of a stroke in May last year .

The doctors carried out two ground breaking operations during which they had to break both her legs in three places. Gloria Abeka, from Accra, will spend more than eight months in the UK recovering from the operations to correct her bowed legs, which also involved pinning them with 22 screws. Gloria Abeka, 12, has Blount's disease which caused her legs to bend inwards below the knee meaning she struggled to walk and could not play with her friends . She is now able to sit and stand and she will soon be able to walk and play with friends for the first time. She said the doctors who helped her have changed her life. Gloria suffered a rare bone disease called Blount's and had grown accustomed to pain and disfigurement. The condition - a severe growth disorder which caused both her legs to bend and twist inwards below the knees - left Gloria dependent upon crutches and a wheelchair, unable to play with friends or sit in comfort. Blount's disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone that causes the lower leg to angle inward. It occurs in children and the cause is unknown but it is thought to be due to the effect of weight on growing bone which prevents the inner part of the tibia from developing normally. Gloria met consultant anaesthetist Keith Thomson when he was in West Africa with the charity Mercy Ships - he offered to find a British doctor who could treat her. Images show X-rays of her leg before and after surgery . The condition is progressive and is most common among children of African ancestry. Glora met Basingstoke-based consultant anaesthetist Keith Thomson last August during one of his regular visits to Africa with the charity organisation Mercy Ships, which provides free medical care and treatment to poor people in West Africa. The youngster's plight inspired Mr Thomson to launch a UK-wide email hunt for a surgeon who might be able to help, which led him to Vel Sakthivel, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton Children's Hospital, who specialises in complex knee problems. Gloria and her mother Mercy Yeboah, 54, were flown over to meet Mr Sakthivel last August. Vel Sakthivel, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton Children's Hospital, broke each of her legs in three places and used 22 screws to reshape them. Gloria is pictured with her mother, Mercy Yeboah . He assessed her and agreed to perform two ground breaking operations to extend both shin bones to allow her to stand up straight. ‘I have seen children with this condition to a much smaller degree in the past but the severity really was the worst I have seen so far - an extreme case,’ he said. Mr Sakthivel, and his anaesthetist Andy Wilkins, invited Gloria back to undergo a radical procedure which involved breaking her right leg in three places, known as a triple tibial osteotomy, to correct the distorted shin bone with a graft, three metal plates and 11 screws. Gloria can now stand and sit down with straight legs and will soon be able to run and play with her friends . After spending three months with family and friends in Slough, Berkshire, recuperating and undergoing intensive physiotherapy, Gloria made good progress and returned to Southampton in March for the same procedure on the other leg. Mr Sakthivel said: ‘This sort of extensive surgery is very rarely required in the western world and, to my knowledge, has not been reported in the UK before. It was an extreme case that required something very different if we were to have any hope of success.’ He added: ‘Much credit must also go to Mr Adrian Wilson, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Basingstoke Hospital, and paediatric physiotherapist Bev Pinnick for their help in arranging an excellent and much-needed specialist physiotherapy programme.’ Although still in the process of regaining strength and movement, Gloria is now able to sit and stand with straight legs. ‘I am so, so happy,’ she said. ‘I have spent my whole life with very bowed legs and have never been able to join in games with my friends, feel normal or be without pain. ‘My mother calls my surgeon Mr Sakthivel “the magician” because she says he worked a true miracle on me.’ Gloria, who is hoping to return home with her mother in the next three months, added: ‘I cannot thank him and Dr Thomson enough for what they have done for me - they have changed my life.’","Gloria Abeka has Blount's disease which caused her legs to bend inwards .

Yet rather than being a prehistoric monster from the deep, this incredible head was actually found in Oxfordshire - and belongs to the biggest pike ever found in Britain. The grisly fish carcass was found in the undergrowth next to the River Cherwell by farmer Peter Mone. Skull found by a farmer near the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire is thought to be from a 20-year-old northern pike fish. Angling experts believe it would have weighed a record-breaking 50lbs - the current UK record stands at 46lbs . The pike skull found by the River Cherwell is a foot-long. It has around 700 razor-sharp teeth that are about an inch long. Peter Money, who made the discovery, initially thought it belonged to a dead deer . Money initially thought it was a dead . deer, but when he got closer he realised the foot-long elongated skull . belonged to a enormous pike. Money believes the pike was washed out of the river in a flood. He measured and photographed the skull and showed it to angling expert Andrew Crisp. Crisp has never seen a pike skull bigger than this before, and believes it comes from the biggest pike in the country. The skull is 9ins wide and has around 700 teeth. Some of the teeth are an inch long. It is thought the pike was about 20 years old when it died and would have weighed over 50lbs. A tape measure is shown in this image to demonstrate the length of the foot-long skull. A ten pence piece is also used to see the skull in scale. This image shows the underside of the skull and the pike's spine . The pike's skull was found in undergrowth by the side of the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire. Angling angling expert Andrew Crisp believes that the fish may have washed ashore following a flood. It is thought to be Britain's biggest pike and would have beaten the current record by 4lbs . The current pike record stands at 46lb for a catch from Wykeham Lakes near Scarborough, which was caught in March last year by 20-year-old Andy O'Conner. Peter Money, 32, said: 'I was in the tractor with my boss Charlie Gee and we were checking some of our fences. 'We saw what looked like bones in the . grass and I thought it was a deer or something, so I got out and then . realised it was a pike skull straight away, it was massive. 'I think it must have been swept onto the bank in the floods and died when the water went down. 'I'm not a fisherman but I know when I . have spotted something big and as I live on the river I know what is in . it, and I haven't seen anything like this before. 'I measured it and then took the skull to Andrew. Pike fish have up to 700 teeth including some that point backwards to stop prey from escaping once they have clamped their jaws shut. Pike are able to stay still in the water by moving the last fin rays of the dorsal fins and the breast fins. Before attacking their prey, they bend their body and dart out to the prey using the large surface of tail fin, dorsal fin and anal fin to propel themselves . The northern pike, or esox lucius, is a freshwater game fish. They mainly live in the northern hemisphere. Female pikes are usually larger than males, and the average weight is around 18lbs. The skull discovered by the River Cherwell is thought to have weighed 50lbs . 'I have showed it to a few friends and the ones who know about fishing are quite excited about it because it would have been a huge pike when it was alive.' It is not known how long it was out the water for but its body had been stripped, probably by foxes. Andrew Crisp, secretary for the North Oxford Angling Society, said he had never seen a pike so big before. He said: 'Peter brought the skull around to me and I thought it was amazing. Andy O'Conner currently holds the record for catching the UK's biggest pike. The pike, pictured with Andy, weighed 46lbs. It is not the biggest pike found in the world, though. The heaviest pike was found in Germany in 1986 weighing 55lbs . 'We measured it and it was 1ft long and 9ins across, and what was left of the vertebrae was at least 1ins around. 'I'm no pike expert but this could have weighed at least 40lbs when it was alive, probably more. The record is 46lbs and it could have been as big as that.' Pike fish have up to 700 teeth, some of which point backwards to stop any prey from escaping once they have clamped their jaws shut. The word 'pike' is derived from the French 'pique, meaning 'spear'. The world's biggest pike, weighing 55lb 1oz, was caught in Grefeern, Germany in 1986. Pike have sandpaper-like tongues which they use to turn larger prey around so they can be swallowed head-first. There have been tales of large pike pulling small dogs into the water. In 2004, a boy of 11 needed eight stitches in his hand and three in his foot when he was bitten by a pike in Minnesota. Fossils suggest pike have changed very little in 20 million years. The larger the pike is, the more likely it is to be female. Pike can live for up to 50 years.","Skull thought to be from a 20-year-old pike weighing over 50lbs .

Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, who was arrested earlier this month after claims that he raped one man and sexually assaulted . another between 2009 and 2013, faces further allegations from a third man . A third man has reportedly come forward with claims that he was sexually assaulted by the House of Commons Deputy Speaker. Nigel Evans, 55, was arrested on May 4 after claims that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013 - accusations he has branded ‘completely false’. But he faces renewed pressure after claims emerged that a third man has told police he was also abused by the Deputy Speaker in the House of Commons two years ago. According to the Sunday Times the victim gave a statement to Lancashire constabulary after hearing about the MP's arrest over two other claims of sexual assault. A spokesman for Lancashire constabulary told the newspaper: 'We are speaking to a number of people in connection with this investigation, but as this is an ongoing criminal inquiry we will not be providing any further detail or any comment around any further allegations.' The MP for Ribble Valley read a statement outside his Lancashire home vehemently denying the accusations against him after he was released on bail earlier this month. The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’. Mr Evans, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. He said: ‘The allegations are completely false and I can’t understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week. ‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’ In the days after his arrest, Mr Evans announced that he would step away from the Speaker’s chair for a few days but would return to work the following week. But the Speaker’s office released a statement earlier this week revealing that, ‘while Mr Evans will remain Deputy Speaker, he will not resume chairing duties while police investigations are ongoing’. Meanwhile, Mr Evans has refused to comment on rumours that at least one of the complainants was a House of Commons passholder. He added: ‘I’m very confident that should it come to trial that the full facts will come out and I will be acquitted.’ Public statement: Deputy House speaker Nigel Evans gave a press statement at his home in Pendleton, north west England, after he was released on bail .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:25 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:51 EST, 18 May 2013 . A Michigan mother of two young boys who said she was battling cancer just a few years after a man was convicted of her rape, has been exposed as a total fraud. Sara Ylen, 38, has been charged with fraud, false pretenses and . using a computer to commit a crime after state police found no doctor . who diagnosed the cancer. The charges come as a local man, James Grissom, who spent nearly 10 years in . prison for her rape was released last year, after newly discovered . evidence cast doubt on whether she'd ever been attacked. Fraudster: Sara Ylen (left), 38 has been charged with fraud after appealing for money to fight her cancer after she also claimed she was raped, for which James Grissom (right) served almost 10 years in prison for . Ylen's community, which had come to . admire her as the subject of a newspaper's award-winning 2003 series . about surviving a rape, rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public. Churches sold Super Bowl sub sandwiches and auction items to raise . money. Friends cut her grass, bathed her at her modest home and provided . hot meals. An insurance company paid nearly $100,000 for hospice care. One of her close friends, Carol Connell, spoke of the gift she gave Ylen, in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need. 'It was a little box, a very ornate box, to hold a prayer. She needed God to look over her,' Connell said, recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave Ylen the jewelry. 'Sara was visibly touched.' Connell now can't help but wonder whether Ylen was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw-dropping deceit. 'The fact that she's lived this long is a miracle. But maybe it wasn't a miracle after all. ... I'm just baffled. Is she the biggest con artist in the state of Michigan or the victim?' Connell said. The fraud case isn't Ylen's only concern. In a neighboring county, she is charged with making a false report of rape just last year, even using makeup to create bruises. Ylen (pronounced WHY'-len) and her attorney, Dave Heyboer, have not returned phone messages seeking comment. Elaborate stories: In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a store parking lot more than a year earlier - there was no evidence but a man was convicted . The Associated Press went to a Lexington address listed in court documents, but she no longer lives there. The two cases against Ylen come years after she first emerged in the public eye in the Port Huron area, 60 miles northeast of Detroit. In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a Meijer store parking lot more than a year earlier. There was no surveillance video, physical evidence or witnesses. James Grissom, an off-duty Meijer employee with a past sex-related conviction, was charged after Ylen said her attacker, like Grissom, had a skull tattoo. He was found guilty in 2003 and sentenced to at least 15 years in prison, an enhanced punishment because Ylen said her attacker gave her a sexually transmitted disease. Next, Ylen told her story to the Port Huron Times Herald. She said she wanted people to see her as a 'victor', not a 'victim'. Readers inspired by 'Sara's Story', as the series was titled, started a fund to send her to community college. But it didn't take long for Ylen's story to start unraveling. Authorities learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her parents in Bakersfield, California, just months after the alleged parking lot attack back in Michigan. No charges were filed. 'My daughter likes to have a lot of attention,' her father, Dale Hill, told Bakersfield officers in a 2001 police report that wasn't uncovered until after Grissom's trial. Hill told the AP this week that he hasn't spoken to his daughter in years and didn't know anything about her recent claims. After years of appeals, a judge in 2012 ruled that the police report could have changed the outcome of Grissom's trial and ordered a new one, saying Ylen appeared to have 'concocted incredible stories' in California. Prosecutors dropped the case without a second trial, and Grissom was freed in November. As Grissom's appeals were moving through the courts, Ylen was telling people she had developed cancer from a disease transmitted during the assault. She was back in the newspaper, supported by friends, including a state police sergeant, who believed she was on the verge of death in 2009. 'Job of the Old Testament had nothing on Sara Ylen,' wrote Times Herald columnist Mike Connell, who is married to Carol Connell, referring to a pious man who repeatedly suffered misfortune. Just about a year ago, Ylen was in a wheelchair at a Croswell Wesleyan Church auction and spaghetti dinner that raised $10,800. 'I thought I was doing something good for someone who had cancer. It's like a bad Lifetime movie,' said event organizer Sue Birtles. 'I've heard that some people want their money back. ... I'm working on forgiveness.' Mercy Hospice, which visited Ylen at her home, declined to comment on her care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically 'must be certified' by a patient's doctor before services are provided. Ylen's ex-husband, Jim, declined to comment on the criminal charges against his former wife, but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her tales of woe. The couple were married in 1993, separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011. The marriage 'broke down due to the wife's complex lies and deceit involving fictitious rapes, kidnappings, pregnancies and illnesses – all attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms,' Jim Ylen's attorney, Aaron Cassell, said in a court filing. Sara Ylen told her husband the name of her cancer doctor, but he later learned there was no physician by that name in Michigan, Cassell said. And she wouldn't let him join her at medical appointments, even after driving hundreds of miles to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, Ill. The clinic says Sara Ylen never was a patient there, according to records reviewed by the AP. Psychologist Daniel Kachman evaluated Ylen as part of the divorce case and told the judge: 'Often feeling dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff, she may either withdraw from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of martyr.' Mike Connell, the newspaper columnist, said he regrets not treating his own doubts more seriously. 'Sara is innocent until proven guilty, but if she did pull off an elaborate con, consider what genius it required,' he said in an email. 'She has a brilliant mind.

Benetton has become the latest global retailer to agree to sign a one-of-a-kind pact to improve safety at Bangladesh factories following a building collapse that killed more than 1,100 workers in the country last month. The move, announced by Benetton today, comes after H&M, a trendy Swedish fashion chain that is the largest clothing buyer in Bangladesh, said Monday that it would sign the same five-year legally binding factory safety contract. Within hours, C&A of the Netherlands, British retailers Tesco and Primark, and Spain's Inditex, owner of Zara, followed. The announcements come ahead of a Wednesday deadline imposed by worker rights groups that said they would increase pressure on brands that did not sign the agreement. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Prayers: Army personnel take part in a prayer for victims of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, after rescuers wrapped up their recovery operations today . Tragedy: At least 1,100 people died when the garment factory in Savar, near Dhaka in Bangladesh collapsed but the search for survivors had now been called off . 'We decided to support this agreement so that our group can be at the forefront of contributing to a significant and lasting improvement in working conditions and safety in Bangladesh,' Biaglo Chiarolanza, CEO of Benetton Group SpA, said in a statement. The agreement requires that the companies conduct independent safety inspections, make their reports on factory conditions public and cover the costs for needed repairs. It also calls for them to pay up to $500,000 annually toward the effort, to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make safety upgrades and to allow workers and their unions to have a voice in factory safety. The six companies that agreed to the pact join two other retailers that signed the contract last year: PVH, which makes clothes under the Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod labels, and German retailer Tchibo. The agreement has since been expanded to five years from two. Among the holdouts, Wal-Mart, the second-largest clothing buyer in Bangladesh, said through spokesman Kevin Gardner on Monday that it had nothing to announce. And Gap, which had been close to signing the agreement last year, said late Monday that the pact is 'within reach,' but the company is concerned about the possible legal liability involved. Labor groups applauded the retailers that agreed to the pact. They say the agreement goes a long way toward improving working conditions in Bangladesh's garment industry, which long has been known to be dangerous. Exhausted: Miss Begum was dehydrated and panicked after her ordeal . Trauma: Doctors say she has had trouble sleeping and panic attacks . In safe hands: Miss Begum is recovering at a military hospital . The agreement comes as the working conditions of Bangladesh's garment industry have come under increased scrutiny. Since 2005, at least 1,800 workers have been killed in the Bangladeshi garment industry in factory fires and building collapses, according to research by the advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum. The two latest tragedies in the country's garment industry have raised alarm. The building collapse at Rana Plaza on April 24 was the industry's worst disaster in history. And it came months after a fire in another garment factory in Bangladesh in November killed 112 workers. Following the latest tragedy, Walt Disney Co. announced that it is stopping production of its branded goods in Bangladesh. But most retailers have vowed to stay and promised to work for change. H&M and Wal-Mart both have said they have no plans to leave. Other big chains such as The Children's Place, Mango, J.C. Penney, Gap, Benetton and Sears have said the same. But the pressure has increased for those that stay. Since April's building collapse, Avaaz, a human rights group with 21 million members worldwide, has gotten more than 900,000 signatures on a petition pushing Gap and H&M to commit to the proposal. Survivor: Miss Begum was uninjured save for her hair getting trapped under a boulder . Missed breakfast: The 19-year-old survived on packs of biscuits she had bought as she was late for work . The safety agreement comes two years after a fire and safety proposal drawn up by labor unions was first rejected by many clothing companies as too costly and legally binding. The latest agreement is a revised version of that proposed pact. Forty companies, including Wal-Mart, H&M, and J.C. Penney, met in Germany with labor rights groups, labor unions and nongovernmental organizations days after the building collapse. They discussed how the industry could improve safety conditions in Bangladesh. Only a few companies, including Britain's Primark and Canada's Loblaw Inc., which owns the Joe Fresh clothing line, have acknowledged that suppliers were making clothes for them at the Rana Plaza site and have promised to compensate workers and their families. Loblaw's CEO said suppliers were making clothes for as many as 30 brands and retailers at the site. Benetton labels were found at the site, and the Italian fashion brand acknowledged that one of its suppliers had used one of the factories. The company said that before the collapse, the factory had been removed from its list of approved factories. And in the U.S., university chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops are helping to stage demonstrations against Gap in more than a dozen cities including Seattle, Los Angeles and New York. Joy: The factory worker's rescue was shown live on national television and the crowd cheered as she was released . A woman who was rescued after 17 days . from under the rubble of a collapsed garments factory in Bangladesh has . told how she survived on biscuits and bottles of water. Reshma Begum stunned her country and the world when she was pulled out of the rubble without any serious injuries. Miss Begum, 19, said that on the day of the building’s collapse, she had rushed to work and did not have any breakfast. Instead, . she bought four small packets of biscuits on her way into work. It was a . decision that would save her life – as she then rationed her scarce . supply over the next two weeks. Her rescue – which was shown live on . national television – brought the country’s capital, Dhaka, to a . standstill as people stopped work and gathered around TV sets. Yesterday, . Miss Begum told hospital staff and her rescuers that she lived on the . biscuits and bottles of water for the first 15 days – as she lay . holed-up inside a cavity in the wreckage of the Rana Plaza building in . the Savar area of Dhaka. Destruction: Workers are continuing to clear the rubble at the scene of the building collapse . Bodies: Rescuers have been working to remove corpses which are decomposing quickly in the 30C heat . It . is believed the lifesaving bottles of water reached her after they were . thrown down a hole by rescue workers. The rescuers had been told to . push the bottles down every hole and cavity they stumbled across – in . the hope those trapped underneath would receive them. Miss . Begum – who lived alone in a rented room in Savar – said that when the . eight-storey building collapsed, she was on the third floor. She . managed to run down to the second floor but became trapped in a cavity. The cavity was big enough for her to move about in and there was enough . air to breathe. But her hair had become stuck under a boulder, so she had to pull off strands to set herself free. Recovering . at the Combined Military Hospital in Savar, Miss Begum said: ‘No one . heard me. It was so frightening. I never dreamed I’d see the daylight . again.’ The seamstress now has trouble sleeping at night, and occasionally grips a nurse’s hand in apparent panic attacks. Colonel Azizur Rahman, a military doctor at the hospital, said: ‘We don’t want those memories to haunt her now, so we are not allowing anybody to ask her anything. ‘She is now being provided semi-liquid food.’ It has emerged that Miss Begum’s family learned that she was alive after watching the rescue on TV. Vigil: Relatives continue to wait outside the collapsed building hoping for news of loved ones . Grief: The collapse was the country's worst industrial accident to date . Her mother Zobeida Begum, who is in her 60s, said: ‘I just could not believe it when I saw her alive in  the hospital.’ Her sister Asma said: ‘We got her back when we had just lost all hope of finding her alive.’ They said they had kept a vigil for the seamstress, who is from the rural Dinajpur district, 170 miles north of Dhaka. Doctors said last night that Miss Begum is suffering from dehydration but will make a full recovery. The death toll in the worst industrial accident in the country’s history has now reached 1,100 – and the government is facing criticism for not imposing better checks on buildings run by the garments industry. Miss Begum was filmed by Somoy TV in her hospital bed, as doctors and nurses milled about, giving her saline and checking her condition.","Benetton move comes after H&M and Primark signed five-year promise .

The constant distractions that people now face from emails, texts and social media is ruining our ability to complete tasks as efficiently as we used to and is making us dumber claims a new survey. The study from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania analyzed the impact that juggling modern communications has on someone's brain while their working. Their experiment included 136 subjects, who were asked to read a short passage and then answer questions about it. The constant distractions that people now face from emails, texts and social media is ruining our ability to complete tasks as efficiently as we used to and is making us dumber . The test subjects were divided into three groups called Control, Interrupted and On High Alert, reports yahoo.com. For the first test, the Control group was allowed to complete it without interruption, while the other two groups were told before they started that they ‘might be contacted for further instructions’ at any moment via instant message. During the test both groups were interrupted twice. Then a second test was carried out. This time only the second group was interrupted, while the third group waited for an interruption that never came. The researchers expected the Interrupted and On High Alert groups to make some mistakes during the first test, but were shocked when both groups answered correctly 20 percent less often than members of the Control group. Test results suggest that digital multitasking does have an impact on people's performance at work, but it may be possible for people to train themselves to cope better with distractions . During the second experiment the Interrupted group underperformed the Control group, but closed the gap significantly, down to 14 percent. According to Carnegie Mellon psychologist Eyal Peer this suggests that people who experience an interruption, and expect another, can learn to improve how they deal with it. The surprising finding was that the On High Alert group, those warned of an interruption that never came, improved by a massive 43 percent and even outperformed the Control test takers who had been left alone. Dr. Peer believes this shows that the Interrupted group learned from their experience in the first test and their brains adapted. The subjects in the On High Alert group were able to marshal the extra brain power to prepare themselves to be interrupted and that helped them to focus more on what they were doing. So while the results suggest that digital multitasking does have an impact on people's performance at work, it may be possible for people to train themselves to cope better with distractions, even if they don’t know when they're about to hit.","Tests have shown that people perform worse when interrupted by modern communications such as instant messenger at work .

Abuse: Michelle Knight, pictured, was treated like a 'punching bag' in her years of captivity, according to a family friend of one of the victims . Michelle Knight, the first of three women to be kidnapped off the street who suffered more than a decade of abuse in a Cleveland house of horrors, was subjected to numerous beatings and treated like 'a punching bag,' a family friend of one of the victims has revealed. Miss Knight vanished in August 2002, and was not seen again until earlier this month when she emerged from a dilapidated house on Seymour Avenue with Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus. The owner of the home, 52-year-old Ariel Castro, faces kidnapping and rape charges. He is accused of chaining up all three women in the home and raping them. A family friend of one of the victims told CNN that Michelle was often hit hit with hand weights and other objects and treated like a 'punching bag' for 11 years. Her relatives say that she is deaf in one ear, and may need facial reconstruction surgery. She was released from a hospital on Friday. Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left. Michelle told CNN in a statement: 'I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time.' She told police that her alleged captor repeatedly raped her and caused her to miscarry at least five times over the years by starving her and punching her in the stomach. Police sources told the National Enquirer that Castro had no interest in having children with Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and he believed her to be 'mentally disabled.' Tragic: Michelle Knight was allegedly brutalized by Ariel Castro and beaten so badly that she needs facial reconstruction surgery . The magazine's source added that he was grooming his 6-year-old daughter with Amanda, Joselyn, as another sex slave because the other captives 'were getting to old for him.' The startling claims come after a female police officer has described the moment she rescued Miss Knight, now 32. Barbara Johnson was one of the first Cleveland police officers to rush into Ariel Castro's house on Seymour Avenue after Amanda Berry managed to escape and call 911. When she found Michelle, the woman grabbed her tightly and begged her not to leave her, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. 'Michelle hugged me first, then . clutched me and said, ""Don't let me go"",' Johnson said at an awards . ceremony for the officers involved in the miraculous rescue. 'You can't . really describe how I felt...it rips the heart out of my chest.' The . rescue of Michelle, Amanda and Gina DeJesus a decade after they were . all feared dead has been called the 'Miracle in Cleveland'. Horrific crimes: Ariel Castro, 52, is charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape . Officer Barbara Johnson said Michelle Knight clutched at her and begged her not to let go . For the officers who arrived at Castro's home on May 6, it was also a brush with unimaginable horror. 'When I heard there were people in the house, I ran up to the door, but it was locked from the inside,' Officer Michael Simon recalled. 'So I grabbed the hand rail by the stairs to use as a prying tool...but the other officers kicked the door in. 'Once inside, I felt evil in the house.' Even the veteran officers who are . confronted with human tragedy on a frequent basis could not ignore the . emotional impact of rescuing the three girls from a decade of captivity. 'I've broke down . (crying) a few times on the scene, and in private since then,' Officer . Anthony Espada - the first officer on the scene - admitted. 'Those three . girls are my heroes... after what went through in that house all those . years.' Evil in the house: A 10-foot fence has been erected around Ariel Castro's now-boarded up house on Seymour Avenue . It emerged yesterday that Michelle and Gina DeJesus will require long-term therapy for . injuries such as hearing loss and joint and muscle damage due to the . severe abuse they were subjected for more than a decade. Their injuries were compared to those . suffered by prisoners of war and sources said there were chains coming . from the wall in the basement and dog leashes attached to the ceiling. The women were restrained with them and duct tape in 'stress positions' for long periods that left them with bed sores and other injuries, . according to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. Other reports said that Amanda Berry was saved from the worst of the abuse because she was a favorite of Castro's. Officer Anthony Espada, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, said he has broken down and cried several times since helping to rescue the girls . 'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one . of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight. Amanda, who broke down a door to freedom a week ago with the help of neighbors, then told police of the other women, was photographed . smiling immediately after the dramatic rescue. Berry has a six-year-old . daughter fathered by Castro in captivity. In contrast, DeJesus wore a hooded sweat-shirt covering her head when . she first went home last week, and Knight was hospitalized for days, and . has stayed out of public view. The sources said DeJesus and Knight were gaunt and had closely cropped hair when they were freed. Police had not been looking for Knight when she was found in Castro's house. She disappeared in 2002 at age 21. Her mother concluded she might have run away from home because she was angry about the state taking away her child. Police dropped the case when they couldn't reach her mother.","Michelle Knight vanished in August 2002, and was not seen again until she emerged from Ariel Castro's home earlier this month .

Marks & Spencer customers are unwittingly having money taken from their accounts through contactless payment cards – despite standing a foot from the till. Shoppers say they are being charged on their contactless cards without knowing, simply by standing close to the machines. The problem was spotted only when a handful of eagle-eyed customers realised what was happening. It raises fears that more shoppers could have been charged without their knowledge. Marks & Spencer customers complained that they have been charged twice for one transaction . Paula, from London, told BBC Radio 4’s Money Box programme that when she put her NatWest card into the chip and PIN terminal to pay at an M&S store, it charged her contactless card – which was in her purse in her other hand. A month later she looked at her bank statement and realised she had paid twice. When she returned to the store with the statement,  she was given a refund. Rosemary, from Sussex, told Money Box she was charged on her contactless card – despite trying to pay with her Lloyds chip and PIN one. She said: ‘I put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether I wanted cashback. ‘Before I could answer, the transaction came up as complete and the till issued a receipt, though I hadn’t put in a PIN at that stage. Marks and Spencer say that they have full confidence in the technology and that they know of only five occurrences . ‘I queried it with an assistant  and she looked at the receipt and compared it with my card and realised the numbers didn’t tally.’ Rosemary then discovered the Smile card she had in her purse, which was in her other hand, matched the digits on the receipt. The manager had the transaction repeated to prove what was happening. Rosemary received a full refund on both transactions. Last night M&S, which recently rolled out contactless payment in 644 stores, claimed the incidents were isolated and said it had full confidence in the technology. But the UK Cards Association, which represents debit and credit card companies, said more could be done to help customers and retailers and said it would investigate the errors. A spokesman said: ‘We do think there is a bit more we can do in educating cardholders to tell them not to put their wallet down in this quite narrow field when they pay. ‘There is perhaps more shops can do in terms of cashiers knowing there are two forms of payment.’ M&S said it had been told of only five of these cases. It said: ‘We’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response from customers following the introduction of Contactless, which helps to make payments quicker and more efficient for transactions under £20. ‘Almost 250,000 transactions  a week are now taking place in  our stores on Contactless.’","Shoppers have been charged on their contactless cards without knowing .

A private security company criticised for the way it controls prisons and electronic tagging for criminals is facing substantial fines for causing lengthy delays in court cases. Serco was hauled before a senior judge last week to apologise for ‘embarrassing’  hold-ups in bringing defendants up from the cells that have totalled ten hours. On occasions, judge, jury and witnesses have been left waiting because guards insist on taking a full hour for lunch. Serco has come under fire after security guards made a court wait while they took their lunch break . Serco also blundered by mixing up crucial legal papers and dumping them in bin liners, forcing the court to pay for lawyers to sort them out. Serco was warned it faces being ordered to pay back at least £22,000 in barristers’ fees for wasted court time. Barristers say the firm, which is paid £42 million a year by taxpayers to transport prisoners to court and bring people into the dock in the South East, does not employ enough staff. The judge – who cannot be named because the trial is still ongoing – said: ‘I have never seen anything like what has gone on in this case since I came to the Bar 30 years ago.’ It is the latest in a series of blows to Serco’s reputation.  On Tuesday a report by  HM Inspectorate of Prisons found that Thameside jail in South London, managed by Serco, had been put in ‘lockdown’ because of gang violence between inmates. On Friday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced  an emergency audit of the £107 million annual contract between Serco and G4S to provide electronic tags for offenders,  amid fears the firms may have overcharged the public purse. Mark George QC, who acted in the Oxford grooming trial at the Old Bailey, said ‘It’s just chaos. We can’t have major trials being delayed just because of failings in the contract.’ Serco said: ‘We are committed to delivering a high level of service at the court.’","Senior judge blasts Serco for hold-ups which have totalled ten hours .

The 30-year-old followed the sisters, Jessica and Andrea, Jessica's boyfriend John Kourtessiss and another student called Shannon Thomas back to the girls' California Avenue sorority house from the popular student bar, McHebes, according to the New York Post. The gunman reportedly targeted the students after seeing them spending large amounts of money in the drinking spot to celebrate the end of the school term. Around 2.20am he allegedly peered through the window in his ski mask and knocked on the door before forcing himself in and taking the group hostage. Raiding the home he shouted: 'I saw you at the bar drinking. I know you have more money than this!', according to police sources quoted in the Post report. He made the twins remain but told . Thomas to leave and withdraw money from an ATM machine - warning her he . would shoot her friends if she tried anything. Horror: It is unknown at this time whether Rebello's twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while another girl was allowed outside . While away from the home she called 911. As police arrived neighbors said they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life. Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down told the New York Times that she heard shouting. At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times. 'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said. Dehel . said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear . what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars . raced down the street. 'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, 'I think someone just got murdered'. It was awful,' she said. '[Police] drew their weapons and went inside,' neighbor Frank Pugliese, 19 told the Post. “She was pleading for her life. You could tell she was scared. It . was a surreal moment . . . She was pleading — her voice was trembling . and she yelled, ‘No, no!’ ” Smith is believed to have held them on the second floor. Scene: Officers guard the area leading to the white house, background, where the shooting broke out . Scene: She was home with two other girls and a male when the break in took place around 2.30am . Thomas told the 911 dispatcher that he had a silver handgun pointed . at her friend's head in a bedroom, NBC reported. The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau . County police officers reached the home. When they arrived, shots went off. A law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him but this timetable of events was still being verified. 'We . don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a . robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference on Friday. Anthony Kourtessiss said his son was being questioned by police last night and Jessica was 'inconsolable'. 'It’s a terrible situation,' he told the newspaper. '[Jessica] was very upset, inconsolable right now.' Rebello was a member of the Beta Sigma Phi . sorority and lived with six of her sorority sisters at the home, including her sister. Students . flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many . writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their . best wishes and prayers. Sisters: Jessica and Andrea Rebello, pictured, remained in the home while another girl was allowed out to collect money from an ATM. The girl called police immediately and they arrived minutes later . Popular: Photographs on Facebook show Andrea, a junior at Hofstra, enjoying nights out with friends . Break in: Police said that the masked, armed intruder knocked on the front door before forcing his way inside the home and holding the friends, including Andrea (left), hostage . A private vigil was held at the . Hofstra Student Center last night and it was announced today that her . funeral will take place on Wednesday. Rebello's . father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside . the family's home in Tarrytown, New York, yesterday. 'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused. 'I don't know what to do,' he added. Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'. Andrea was . a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister. 'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog. Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane . said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who . are close to other members of the Portuguese community in the area. 'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said. Distraught: Hofstra University students gather near the house where the girl and an armed intruder were killed . Sadness: The suspect and the girl were both shot after police arrived at the Long Island home . Photographs . on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed . hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents . her cooking hobby. Neighbors said their house had a vegetable garden and the twins would sometimes drop off the produce. 'They brought me some vegetables from their garden. They’re very nice people. They’d do anything for you,' Harris Bank told the New York Post. Her . funeral will be held at St. Teresa of Avila Church in Sleepy Hollow and . will be officiated by the Rev.

Fighting fit: Young soldiers on a training exercise - the recruitment of under 18s for the British Army could be scrapped . A former Defence Minister has called for the British Army to stop recruiting ‘boy soldiers’ – a move that would bring an end to centuries of military tradition. Sir Nick Harvey says letting 16 and 17-year-olds join the Forces is outdated. He claims they are more likely to die or be seriously wounded, and that millions of pounds are wasted due to high drop-out rates. The issue will be discussed in the Commons on Tuesday and could eventually lead to a ban on enlistment of those  under 18. According to military watchdog Forces Watch, of the 22,000 recruits who join up each year, 4,700 are boys and girls under 18 and 80 per cent choose the Army over the RAF or Navy. Lib Dem MP Sir Nick, who was the Armed Forces Minister until last September, described the current recruitment policy as ‘increasingly anachronistic’. He added: ‘If it was stopped, these youngsters would have to look at some other work-based training that might make joining the Army a conscious decision rather than just drifting into it. ‘Those who join the Army aged 16 are more likely to die or be severely wounded in action because they tend to join the infantry, which has much higher death rates than the rest of the Forces.’ The recruitment of boys began in the 18th Century when drummers aged ten were sent to the front line. The age for joining up was raised before the First World War, but by the end of the conflict it was estimated that thousands of youths – some only 15 – had been killed or wounded in action. Following an outcry over the deployment of 17-year-olds to the Gulf War in 1991, and to Kosovo in 1999, the Army amended its rules to ensure that no one under 18 could be sent on operations where there was a possibility of hostilities. However, at least 20 soldiers aged 17 are known to have served in Afghanistan and Iraq due to errors by the Ministry of Defence. 'Outdated': Former defence minister Sir Nick Harvey described the policy of recruiting under 18s as 'increasingly anachronistic' David Gee, of Forces Watch, which is leading demands for a ban on boy soldiers, said: ‘The use of children and adolescents in warfare has a long history but the policy deserves to be evaluated ethically and with regard to the modern standards of care of young people. 'The critical question is whether it can be reasonable to assume that minors are generally able to make informed and responsible choices on a matter with such far-reaching consequences.’ But the mother of 18-year-old William Aldridge – the youngest British soldier to die in Afghanistan – said the current policy should continue. Lucy Aldridge said: ‘When William was 16, I reluctantly gave my consent for him to join the Army. Stopping him would have been pointless – he would have signed up at 18 anyway and he wouldn’t have had all that extra training.’ The Ministry of Defence said: ‘No one under the age of 18 may volunteer to join our Armed Forces without the formal written consent of a parent or guardian. There are currently no plans to revisit the recruitment policy.’ COMMENT by TIM COLLINS, IRAQ WAR COMMANDER . I commanded a platoon of junior soldiers in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, in 1984, some of whom went on to join the Special Forces. Captain David Patton, the first Regimental Sergeant Major of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, was a perfect example of the quality of soldiers who came through from such a young age. He had been recruited at 15 with his twin brother. Junior soldiers are leaders from the start and are trained to be the future elite of their peer group. Those who advocate a ban on recruiting under-18s show a profound ignorance of the situation. Yes, training junior soldiers costs a lot because of the quality of the courses. However, the product is fabulous so the Army is prepared to pay for it. A higher drop-out rate is expected too, but the staff-to-student ratio is high to deliver the care and supervision the youngsters need. It is true that our European allies have ceased to recruit under-18s, but they don’t have armies – they have aggressive camping organisations that have no expeditionary capability. Campaigners have no demonstrable understanding of how the British Army and its regimental system promotes families, and the paternal approach taken towards the training of these boys and girls. They’re not being trained to kill at 16. And any comparison to Al Qaeda’s use of soldiers aged 12 and 13 demonstrates a complete loss of perspective and context. If we stopped recruiting bright 16 and 17-year-olds, we would destroy the opportunities currently afforded to these young people. For some it’s a way out of a disadvantaged background based on their individual merit. Prejudice against the military is at the heart of this campaign, and the net losers will be kids who had a chance to win a sought-after place on a life-enhancing course. Signing up for X Factor is no alternative – their talent lies in leadership. This vital quality, it would seem, has no value in our brave new Britain.","Sir Nick Harvey describes policy is 'increasingly anachronistic'

Errors appearing at the bottom of the screen have included describing Labour leader Ed Miliband as 'Ed Miller Band' and calling the head of the Church of England, 'Arch bitch of Canterbury'. Ofcom highlighted two funny blunders - singer Engelbert Humperdinck was  'engle Bert humper distinct' on ITV's Loose Women and a BBC weather report referred to 'fox patches'. Subtitled: Millions of TV viewers use subtitles like this scene from the BBC soap EastEnders, but now Ofcom is demanding tighter controls by broadcasters to avoid inaccuracies . Mistaken names: Ed Miliband was described in the live caption as 'Ed Miller Band' and the Church of England leader was given the title, Arch bitch of Canterbury' BBC bosses were left red-faced again when a reporter visiting a farm spoke of how the pigs 'love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, like our wellies. The subtitles alongside the report changed the last word to 'willies' and the mistake became an internet sensation when a viewer pictured the screen blunder. During the Queen Mother's funeral, the words 'We'll now have a moment's silence for the Queen Mother' became ""We''ll now have a moment's violence for the Queen Mother'.

Ofcom found that 7.6 million people have used subtitles, including 1.4 million with hearing impairments, according to the Times. Earlier research by the regulator found that viewers with hearing problems watched much more television than those without. Apart from the mistakes, the biggest problems were delays in the appearance of subtitles and freezing of the live captions. Ofcom, who consulted Action on Hearing Loss, the National Association of Deafened People and other bodies, have proposed that broadcasters should report back on the quality of their subtitles, every six months.

Officers cordoned off the road where the device – with a red cylinder, batteries and what looked like Semtex – had been spotted and advised residents to stay indoors. They also diverted pupils who were leaving a nearby school and called for specialist back-up. All very well – until, embarrassingly for the police, it emerged that the bomb scare was of their own making. The bomb that was found laying in Peny-Pound-Road Gwent, it had been dropped by the bomb squad by mistake following an excersice at a council property called The Hill . The . device was, in fact, a dummy bomb that had fallen off the back of a . trailer while being used in a training exercise by specialist search . officers earlier the same day. Yesterday supermarket cashier Dean Cheal, 27, who discovered the device, said it looked like ‘something from a James Bond film’. He added: ‘It’s a bit naughty of the police to be dropping something like that in the middle of the road without realising. ‘I was really shocked when I saw it – it’s not something you see every day. 'There was a red cylinder with wires hanging out of it and what looked like playdough, which I thought was Semtex, with a metal pipe and two batteries attached. ‘I ran up the road because I  thought it looked dodgy. People were scared because we didn’t know what it was.’ The drama unfolded shortly after 2pm on Thursday when Mr Cheal spotted the device in Pen-y-Pound Road, Abergavenny, while cycling home from work. The bomb that was found laying in Peny-Pound-Road Gwent, it had been dropped by the bomb squad by mistake following an excersice at a council property called The Hill . He called police who sent an officer in a patrol car to examine it. ‘He wasn’t sure and said it could be somebody playing a prank,’ Mr Cheal said. ‘But he closed off the road and radioed for his sergeant, who also came to check it out.’ The officers then cordoned off the road with tape and told Mr Cheal the ‘bomb squad were coming’. Pupils . at King Henry VIII comprehensive school were stopped from leaving by . the main entrance and residents of a housing estate were told to stay . indoors. ‘By then it was getting busier because the kids were leaving school,’ Mr Cheal added. ‘They were diverted across playing fields and the school buses were diverted away from the road. ‘But . when some more police arrived in a riot van they just laughed it off. One of the officers went along and picked it up, ripped the police tape . down and said it was a dummy bomb.’ Builder Gareth Evans, 30, said: ‘It . looked exactly like a real bomb you see on the television. I don’t think . anyone could have told at first glance that it was a fake.’ A spokesman for Gwent Police apologised for the blunder. ‘It quickly transpired that the object was a fake device used in a training exercise that was being undertaken by search officers close by,’ she said. ‘There have been lessons learnt as a result of this exercise and we apologise if residents were inconvenienced by the cordon that was in place for just over 30 minutes.’","Police in Abergavenny, Wales, cordoned off road and diverted traffic in bomb scare of their own making .

Lord Feldman, the man allegedly behind calling Tory grassroots supporters 'swivel-eyed loons,' has been a loyal presence at David Cameron's side for thirty years. Yet he never gives interviews, has never stood for elected office, and is virtually unknown outside Westminster. But now, it is the sheer strength and longevity of Cameron's friendship with Lord Feldman which makes the furore so damaging for the Tory leader because it is widely assumed their views are shared. Centuries old: Tennis partners: David Cameron (back row, far right) and Andrew Feldman (back row, 2nd left). The pair first established their rapport as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have remained extremely close since then . The pair first established their rapport . as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have . remained extremely close since then. Profiles of the peer usually describe the 47-year-old as either as 'Mr Cameron's tennis partner' or 'the PM's oldest . political friend' – fuelling critics' claims that the Government is . being run by  a socially elite clique of old 'chums'. The impression is enhanced by photos of them as young men, posing for the college tennis club team . (the pair are circled, left) and standing next to each other at the . summer ball, which they had helped to organise – Lord Feldman was chairman of . the committee, while Mr Cameron booked the entertainment. Critics: Profiles of the peer usually describe him either as 'Mr Cameron's tennis partner' or 'the PM's oldest political friend' – fuelling critics' claims that the Government is being run by  a socially elite clique of old 'chums' So who is who is Lord Feldman of Elstree, and how has he become so close to the seat of power? Born into a well-off family, he went to Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Hertfordshire, where he won a place to study Law at Oxford. It was at Brasenose College, Oxford, that he met Cameron. They organised a college May ball together and discovered they had a mutual love of racquet sports (another similarity shared between tennis-playing Tony Blair and Lord Levy). Lord Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 . Since those college days, the friendship has been cemented, with Mr Cameron describing Lord Feldman as ‘one of my oldest and best friends’. Scandal: Feldman's most serious brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht Queen K . Like Cameron, Lord Feldman got a First in his final exams; then he took a job with management consultants Bain & Co. before, in 1991, being called to the Bar and practising as a commercial barrister at one of the country’s top chambers. His family owns Jayroma, a multinational textile company making ladies’ clothes, and in 1995, aged 29, he joined the firm, drawing a salary of £900,000 in one year alone. It meant he was able to buy the £3million house in Holland Park, West London, where he lives with his wife Gaby and their three children round the corner from David Cameron’s house in Notting Hill. Tory figures describe Lord Feldman as likeable, friendly, extremely bright and unassuming. He skis regularly, enjoys yoga, and owns another house in Andalusia, southern Spain. It was Lord Feldman who not only urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 after the party’s third successive general election defeat, but also masterminded his campaign. Encouragement: Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 . Lord Feldman helped run Mr Cameron’s bid with ruthless efficiency, calling in favours from his network of contacts in the business world and raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process. Through his family clothing firm, Lord Feldman himself donated £10,000 to the successful cause. He was appointed deputy treasurer of the party in 2005, and – ironically given the circumstances today – immediately let it be known that he wanted to end the dependency on major donors. ‘He’s not comfortable with individuals giving large amounts. He wants a wider base of people giving smaller amounts,’ said a party official at the time. But even before the Conservatives got into power, Lord Feldman made the wrong call. In 2007, he was chairman of the Leaders’ Club, a dining group for Tory donors who each gave a minimum £50,000 to party funds each year. They would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron’s office in the Commons and meet senior Tory politicians. But this arrangement was in breach of Parliament’s rules, which do not allow party-political fundraising in the House of Westminster, and Mr Cameron was forced to ‘unreservedly apologise’ after he was rebuked by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer. In 2008, Lord Feldman was appointed chief executive of the Tory Party and was given specific responsibility for attracting party donors. Until now, Lord Feldman's most serious . brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George . Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor . Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht off Corfu when . Mr Osborne was accused of soliciting for a £50,000 donation to the . party – at a time when Feldman had been given responsibility for . 'widening the party's fundraising base'. Donations . from foreign nationals such as Deripaska are illegal and Mr Osborne . insisted neither he nor Lord Feldman had discussed donations with the . Russian, and the storm passed. In . January Lord Feldman said 'I did not know who Mr Deripaska was. I was going . over because I had been invited, and it’s a human weakness I’m afraid . because I was fascinated to see this boat. I had never seen a boat of . that size close up.' Rise: After the Tories entered Government in 2010, Feldman was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year became Baron Feldman of Elstree . After the Tories entered Government . in 2010, he was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year . became Baron Feldman of Elstree. Lord Feldman's . key party roles mean he will have been privy to some of the most . closely guarded secrets of the 'Cameron project' from the outset – no . doubt reinforcing the Prime Minister's feelings of personal loyalty. Lord Feldman's importance to Mr Cameron, . who has publicly described him as 'one of my oldest and best friends', . was emphasised when he was tasked with 'prepping' the PM for his . appearance at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. He played the role of Robert Jay, the counsel for the inquiry, by . peppering Mr Cameron with likely questions about his relationship with . newspaper owners. Colleagues regard the peer as 'virtually . indispensable' to the Prime Minister. 'He is direct, easy-going and has . an extremely sharp business brain,' says one. 'Plus, he is one of the few people around Cameron who can talk to him on the same level. Cameron values that. It would take a minor earthquake to shift him from his side.' In . 2007, Feldman was chairman of the Leaders' Club, a dining group for . Tory donors who each gave a minimum £50,000 to party funds each year - . they would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron's office in the Common . Lord Feldman, one of the Prime Minister's closest friends and political allies, was accused of making the 'swivel-eyed loons' remark to journalists at a London hotel. They reported that an unnamed 'close ally' of the Prime Minister blamed Tory activists for pressuring MPs to take hardline stances on Europe. They said he stated: 'There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the [Tory] associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.' But yesterday afternoon, after crisis talks with Mr Cameron, and amid growing claims on Twitter that the unnamed person was Lord Feldman, the peer issued a statement, saying the allegations against him were 'completely untrue' and he was considering legal action. 'I did not, nor have ever, described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists,' he said. 'On the contrary,  I have found them to be hard-working, committed and reasonable people, the backbone of the party.' Mr Cameron fully backed Lord Feldman. A No 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister supports Lord Feldman's position. It is categorically untrue that anyone in Downing Street made the comments reported in The Times and the Telegraph.' Both The Times and The Daily Telegraph stood by their reports. A source at  News International, which owns The Times, said: 'There is no doubt Feldman used the words loons and swivel-eyed.' A titanic trial of strength between No 10 and the two newspapers now seems inevitable. Defeat for Feldman would force him to resign and could inflict potentially catastrophic damage to Mr Cameron.","Pair first established rapport as students at Brasenose College in mid-1980s .

Suspects are being ‘left dangling’ on police bail for too long, according to one of Britain’s most senior police officers. Andy Trotter, Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, has joined calls for limits on the length of time people are left on bail before they are charged or released. The move follows a spate of high-profile cases in which suspects have had their lives disrupted for  up to two years during criminal investigations. Mr Trotter, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on media issues, told The Mail on Sunday that he wanted a review of procedure. ‘I don’t think anyone can be happy with very long bail. ‘In the past police have released people without bail and that hasn’t stopped us continuing the investigation, particularly if they are unlikely to abscond. 'We have re-arrested them at a later stage when we have had sufficient evidence. That way, they are not left dangling.’ There is no limit on how long police can keep people on bail. Sometimes there are stringent conditions attached, such as residing at a particular address and restrictions on movement. Last night, the civil rights group Liberty joined calls for a review. Its director of policy, Isabella Sankey, said: ‘Bail is a vital tool in the police’s armoury. But with no time limit, lives are put on hold and days disrupted by burdensome bail conditions with no end in sight. ‘A six-month statutory backstop would encourage swift and efficient investigation – and end the uncertainty and fear of having the threat of prosecution hanging over your head indefinitely.’Mr Trotter said his ‘gut reaction’ was that six months would be a suitable time limit. In one of the most high-profile cases, Neil Wallis, the former executive editor of the News of the World who was arrested on suspicion of phone-hacking in 2011, said his life was almost destroyed by the experience of being held on police bail for nearly two years, before being told he would not face any charge. High profile complaint: Neil Wallis, former executive editor of the News of the World, said his life was almost destroyed by being held on police bail for nearly two years . His solicitor, Phil Smith, said Mr Wallis was one of several clients who had been on bail that lasted more than a year. Mr Smith said the overuse of police bail was indicative of ‘lazy’ officers who made arrests before they had properly gathered the evidence. He added: ‘These are not terrorist-type scenarios where you might need to keep people on protracted police bail. It ruins people’s lives and smacks of police inefficiency.’ More than 100 people remain on bail in operations linked to phone-hacking and corruption, many for more than a year. Professor Ed Cape, from the University of the West of England, who is an expert on the subject, said it had become ‘an increasingly oppressive, undocumented and unaccountable power by which the police can restrict the liberties of thousands of innocent people every year’. Statutory backstop: Critics of limitless bail complain that lives are put on hold with no end in sight . He added: ‘The use of police bail powers is in need of urgent reform.’ Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said: ‘It should concern anyone who believes in the rule of law that tens of thousands of people each year are held, sometimes for months on end, in the legal no man’s land of police bail. At the very least its use should be properly recorded and monitored so the police can be held properly to account.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We continue to keep police bail provisions under review to ensure they strike the right balance between protecting an individual’s right to civil liberty and allowing police to carry out thorough criminal investigations.’ By Ken MacDonald, Former Director of Public Prosecutions . Concern: Kenneth Macdonald QC, former Director of Public Prosecutions, should not conduct arrests in secret . Secrecy is one of the greatest curses to afflict British public life. It resides in the belief that some people (those in power) deserve to have information that others (the rest of us) do not. Apparently, we’re not to be trusted, or the world is too complicated for us to understand, or important people in power  will be too scared to tell the  truth to each other if the rest of  us might be listening. But this travesty of public  values has brought us nothing but disguised incompetence, national ignorance and undiscovered  sleaze. Secrecy has afforded few of the benefits that its addicts-in-power claim it will bestow, and the time for the rest of us to put up with being patronised has long since passed. Sometimes secrets can be important. Nations are complex and they need protecting in a dangerous world. We understand that some things have to be hidden from view, where that is genuinely necessary, to protect the vulnerable or to defend our country in dangerous times. Some secrets may be necessary for our own good, but a culture that celebrates concealment is not.  And, increasingly it seems, Britain is returning to a late and unlamented past where hiddenness is a way of life. Naturally we are not alone in our addiction to censorship. Indeed the level of public information available in some European countries makes Britain look like a beacon of free speech and democracy. Brussels, in particular, is notoriously furtive and closed, and it has been that way for 60 or more years. The opacity of the institutions of the European Union, and the unaccountability of its bureaucrats and its powerless parliament, are a disgrace that breeds no confidence in the laws and regulations that rain down upon us from across the Channel. It is precisely this lack of transparency, this strange unknowability, which leads so many people in this country to distrust, even to despise an EU whose birth and purpose were and should remain so noble. Why, they think, should we pledge allegiance to a super-nation that won’t share? And this is the problem with secrecy: it is tight-fisted. It allows no scrutiny, no accountability and, in the end, no justice or fairness – because justice, fairness and secrecy cannot co-exist. They are always in conflict. This is why a deficit in transparency, the sense that things are hidden from the public gaze, brings a collapse in public confidence. People, rightly, don’t trust what isn’t explained and they don’t believe in things that hide away. Why should they? You might think that the British police, above all, would understand this – particularly in a society where, traditionally, they have worked by consent rather than by brute force, and taken care to keep the peace alongside citizens rather than in ugly confrontation against them. But disappointingly, they don’t seem to get it. It is, of course, true that the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) doesn’t really represent the police. Instead, it is an unaccountable club of senior policemen who have tended over the years to serve their own interests. But even so, their recent announcement that, when officers make arrests in the future, the identity of their prisoners will be kept secret from the public, is deeply shocking. This new policy is, it seems, a poorly judged over-reaction to perceived media and police excesses in the past and, in particular, to the strictures of the Leveson Inquiry, which focused on the very worst media misconduct in recent years. There are better means of protecting the public from press misconduct than by imposing a suffocating blanket of concealment – and many ways less damaging to the wider public interest. So if ACPO believes the answer to a multitude of problems in criminal justice is more secrecy, they’re asking the wrong question. It seems unlikely that many members of the public believe that policing suffers from an excess of transparency. If there is a problem in the way that the police serve the public, most Britons would probably say the solution is more, rather than less light. For ACPO not to see this is a bad mistake. Arresting someone is a serious business – a famous judge once described it as the beginning of imprisonment. In a free society, empowering men in uniform to restrain otherwise free citizens, to remove them from their homes, to put them in closed and locked cells – these are significant inroads into liberty, conducted solely at the discretion of the police. This serious exercise of state power should not be conducted in secret. The Law Commission, which advises the Government on law reform, believes that there should be a general presumption that the identities of arrested people should be revealed, subject only to necessary exceptions to protect particularly vulnerable people or the progress of particularly sensitive police enquiries. So far the reaction of the Government to ACPO’s foolish proposal has been singularly unimpressive. Perhaps David Cameron and Theresa May might like to suggest to senior officers that, instead of treating the public like children from whom everything must be kept hidden, they should show a little more trust in the people of the country they are sworn to serve.","Chief Constable Andy Trotter has joined calls to limit police bail .

In the final round, Miss Coyle, a financial analyst from Glasgow, had to name five of the world’s top ten ‘cities with the busiest airports’ in four minutes, as a possible £46,000 jackpot drained away. She quickly got Paris and London, and later Chicago and Beijing too. But other answers, including New York, were rejected, leaving her visibly upset at winning nothing. ‘In the dressing room afterwards I was distraught,’ she said: ‘I just burst into tears. I felt terrible.’ But after their game aired, friends urged them to challenge the decision to reject New York. Host: The couple lost on Davina McCall's teatime quiz show .

A police force which calls crooks 'numpties' on its Facebook page and writes in a jokey manner about crime and criminals on its patch has won a huge following from local residents. Despite criticism that the police force, which is having to cut its budget by £30m by 2016, could spend its time better by catching criminals rather than writing jokes about them, Surrey Police's Tandridge Beat has nearly 1,500 'likes' on its webpage. The police have won a huge following thanks to their casual style and light-hearted posts about their force and its work in Surrey just south of the M25 near Godstone. Surrey Police officers have gained a reputation for joking about criminals as 'numpties' on their Facebook page . Another day, another 'numpty': A post from Tandridge Beat earlier this month mentioned a hapless burglar . Police said this 'numpty' had only cleared a small patch of snow on his car's windscreen in March this year . One post, put up yesterday, reads: 'One of our more well-known numpties thought it would be a good idea to come to Lingfield and not pay for his fuel he needed for the stolen car he was in. 'Thanks to Metropolitan police, him and his friend were stopped and both arrested.' Another post said: 'A numpty has left a calling card at a burglary in Tandridge... he will be enjoying our hospitality soon.  We will keep you updated.' Local residents regularly check the page as much as for the jokes as the crime news. One recent post read: 'They came, they stole, they got caught (all within 12 minutes).  If you can't afford meat, go vegetarian.  Don't nick it!!' Delighted residents replied to the post positively, with one saying 'I saw them being carted off'. There is a strong sense of community on . the page, with one popular post recently reading: 'If the fella being a . bit gobby at the Village on Caterham on the Hill on Sunday spoilt your . day, don't worry, we spoilt his. Community policing: One popular recent post gave an update on a lout who had urinated on a police van . Light-hearted banter: The jokes about local crooks keep coming on Tandridge Beat's Facebook page . 'Charged him with being gobby and also damaging our van (what is it with blokes peeing where they aren't supposed to this week?)' Fans of the Facebook page regularly joke with officers on the page, with one writing: 'Love the word numpties', and other replying to the post about the man stealing petrol with: 'Moral of the story: If you’re stupid enough to steal a car, be smart enough to afford the petrol! Hope I haven’t put any ideas in our local numpties heads!' Tandridge police posted about their use of the word 'numpty, saying that they had checked that the word ‘wasn’t offensive’, and that they liked it. They added: 'Especially after we checked it out properly and it doesn’t cross any ""offensive"" boundaries we have to be careful of.' More than 1,400 people 'like' the Tandridge Beat Facebook page, and say they love the light-hearted tone . Popular community forum: Fans of the site have left messages on it saying the banter is good for police PR . According to the Urban Dictionary, a numpty is someone who ‘demonstrates a lack of knowledge of a particular subject or situation to the amusement of others’. Police also use the Facebook page to post pictures of those breaking the law or not behaving responsibly. In March, officers working for the force posted a photo of a snow-covered car driving along the road with just a tiny hole in the windscreen for the driver to look out of. Their comment below said: 'With the snow falling, be safe and make sure you clear your car properly. Not like this numpty...it is dangerous for both you and for other road users.' Other light-hearted postings include on April 26: 'Team Tandridge 4, Billy Burglar 0. This week 4 burglars have been arrested for 3 separate offences.' And on April 26 one officer stated: 'Just putting the kettle on for another Billy Burglar nicked by Tandridge officers’. The police Facebook page makes fun of local criminals and even those who report crime, as in this page . The officers who administer the police Facebook page even turn their hand to make up poems to deter crooks . It prompted comments from Gaynor Chapman, who wrote ‘Tea? No way. Water and maybe bread’, and Jane Clay who wrote ‘Make sure the water goes cold!’. On May 3, the team posted a ditty after catching a string of men urinating in public, reading: 'If you need a pee, then take it from me, if you do it in the street, an officer on the beat, will say ‘Hey matey’, you will be fined eighty"".' Other postings joke of thieves being ‘slippery customers’ after stealing four barrels of cooking oil and saying that a female shoplifter who stole legs of lamb ‘maybe had a roast dinner every day’. But Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said paying someone to administer the page was a waste of public money. He said: 'When savings have to be found, staff time spent manning social media websites should be cut back. 'It's important that the force is open and accountable to local residents but funny stories on Facebook are not a priority right now. 'Taxpayers want their cash spent on bobbies out on the beat in their communities, not on staff stuck behind computer screens back at HQ.' A source at Surrey Police said the Facebook page was ‘very popular’ - it has around 1,500 'likes' - adding: 'The team in Tandridge are known for their quirky sense of humour, but maybe this will come back to haunt them. Police say they checked the word 'numpty' did not cross any 'offensive' boundaries that govern their web use . 'You can just see some lawyer referring to the page and getting someone off with a charge because they were called a numpty or a Billy Burglar before it comes to court.' Earlier this year Tandridge police were ordered to remove a photo they put on the Facebook page featuring an officer in a wendy house with a caption joking that the toy house was ‘the new extension to Lingfield police station’. Chiefs at Surrey Police, which has to cut its budget by £30m by 2016, told the team to remove the photo and apologised for ‘causing any offence’. A spokesman said at the time: 'Our Neighbourhood Policing Teams use their Facebook pages as a different way to engage with our local communities and will occasionally post pictures that are intended to be light-hearted.' 'The picture was not intended to cause any offence and has now been removed from the site.' Earlier this year Surrey Police had to apologise after posting this picture and joking it was a new police station .","Surrey Police's Tandridge Beat team jokes about villains on their webpage .

Convicted: Football coach Dale Strawbridge sexually assaulted three members of a girls' under 16 team . A young football coach who sexually assaulted three members of a girls’ under 16 team who he treated as ‘his personal harem’, was today spared jail. Dale Strawbridge, 20, contacted the 14-year-old girls after training, using details from club records to set up dates with the young players. He groped one after taking her for a ride in his car, kissed another in a packed dance tent at a music festival and ‘snogged’ a third after taking her on a date to a movie. Strawbridge was cleared of the three most serious charges he faced including allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old inside the club’s locked up changing rooms. The prosecution said he abused his position as coach and treated the girls in his under 16 team as ‘his personal harem'. Strawbridge claimed he was the victim of a whispering campaign which led to untrue rumours spreading like wildfire in the small West Country town where the team was based. Strawbridge, of West Hill, East Devon, denied seven counts of sexual activity with four girls who were all aged 14 at the time of the alleged offences in 2011. He was found guilty of four offences against three of the girls. At Truro Crown Court today, Judge John Neligan  sentenced Strawbridge to a three year community order with supervision. Prosecutor David Sapiecha said: 'These girls were liable to react to flattery and attention. This was a gross abuse of trust. 'There can be no question that he did not know how old they are. It was written on the team sheet. Under 16. 'He knew as a coach he should not have been doing this. The warning signs were there but he drove a coach and horses through the warnings and the rules. Worrying: Dale Strawbridge, 20, went through club records to get the personal details of his players and set up dates with three 14-year-olds, the court was told . 'The motivation was sexual attraction. He treated these girls like they were his personal harem.'

Tragedy: Ashley Dixon, 23, threw himself under his tractor after his girlfriend ended their three-month relationship, an inquest heard . A young father threw himself under his tractor after his girlfriend ended their three-month relationship, an inquest heard. Ashley Dixon, 23, was at work on a farm in Salford, when he texted his former lover Fern Brooks to say: 'I have totally given up, there is no life for me any more.' A short time later, he threw himself under the tractor. His body was found by his manager. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. A jury at Bolton Coroner’s Court heard Mr Dixon, from Salford, fell for Ms Brooks when they started seeing each other last May, shortly after he separated from the mother of his two-year-old daughter. He threatened to throw himself off a bridge when she first broke up with him on June 11, but police helped him down. The couple rekindled their relationship and Mr Dixon sought counselling. Weeks later he told his doctor he had ‘sorted his head out’. But on the morning of his death, August 7, he called his foster mother to say the relationship had ended. Text records revealed a stormy exchange between the pair, with Mr Dixon twice threatening to take his own life. The last text was sent at 1.30pm - an hour before he was found dead. Forensics expert PC Nicholas Avery ruled out that the death was an accident. Boss Mark Upton told the hearing that Mr Dixon was not himself after his break-up in June. He said: 'We were very concerned about him. He texted me on June 12 to say he had threatened to throw himself off a bridge and I knew it was because of his relationship. 'He fell head-over-heels for her but it was rocky. He was very, very capable at his job, and the farm was his life, but after that day he started to slip. He was never on time. We were very worried.' He said Mr Dixon arrived at work . uncharacteristically early and appeared to be in good spirits on the . morning of his death, a week before his 24th birthday. Death: Mr Dixon was at work on a farm near Salford when he died. His body was found by his manager after he failed to answer his mobile phone . They discussed . his work for the day, and at 7.30am he set off to flail the long grass . in a field near Salford. Mr Dixon was last seen by shopworkers on the road at 10.30am. At 2.45pm, Mr Upton became worried that his worker, an expert driver, had not finished mowing the 30-acre field. He said: 'I tried him on his mobile but it didn’t even ring, so I jumped in the van and drove out there. I could just see the tractor was stationary and nobody was in it but the ignition was on. 'I leant in to turn the ignition off and saw Ashley at the back entangled in the machinery. I panicked and called the emergency services. I didn’t know what to do.' Coroner Jennifer Leeming recorded a verdict that Mr Dixon took his own life. Ms Brooks, 23, said: 'Ashley was an amazing person inside and out. He was loving, caring, fun and he had an infectious smile that lit up any room he walked into. Ashley will always hold a special place in my heart. I will love him always and forever.'

A burglar who helped himself to a pack of Jaffa cakes while stealing from an elderly couple's home has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Reece O’Callaghan broke into the property in West Heath Birmingham after smashing a window in July last year. During his time in the house he helped himself to a pasta meal and some Jaffa Cakes before making off with property including three televisions. O’Callaghan was spotted by a neighbour and police arrested him nearby but he denied the offence. However, forensic experts found his finger print on the Jaffa Cake box, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The court heard the elderly couple, aged 78 and 82, returned from holiday to find their house a mess following the burglary. O’Callaghan, of West Heath, who had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and aggravated burglary, was given a sentence of seven-and-a-half years. Judge William Davis QC, said the couple had been left 'devastated' by what the burglar had done and that the elderly woman had been unable to stop crying since the incident. Judge Davis said the couple were still 'mourning' the loss of sentimental items from their home which could not be replaced because they had been unable to afford house insurance. He said that in a separate incident in . December last year the defendant and another young man had 'invaded' the . home of man who had befriended them and who had 'significant health . problems.' Evidence: O'Callaghan, 19, denied the burglary - which took place while the couple were on holiday - but his fingerprint was found on the box of Jaffa Cakes . 'Armed with a knife you used violence against him and you took his property,' said Judge Davis. He said they had carried out a second raid, armed with a screwdriver, and stolen some of the victim’s medication. A 17-year-old, who had admitted aggravated burglary and burglary, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years detention.

Social services are under fire for failing to prevent a 13-month-old boy being killed by his mother's boyfriend - despite desperate warnings from his father in the weeks before his death. Slater Sharkey was repeatedly being abused by Richard Morgan, who lived with his mother Rachel Peacock. When the toddler died in December 2010, he was covered head-to-toe in 25 bruises. Death: Slater Sharkey died aged 13 months when he was beaten by his mother's boyfriend . His father Carl Sharkey had complained to officials that the boy was at risk, but they told him they had 'no concerns' for Slater and refused to investigate his care - later saying they were distracted by strategy meetings. It has also emerged that Peacock took her son to a GP when he was having trouble breathing, but ignored the doctor's advice to visit hospital to treat the bruises on his head. A report has criticised child welfare agencies for failing to act on a series of warning signs, and concluded that Slater was not 'properly safeguarded' in the 24 hours leading up to his death. Although Mr Sharkey contacted both social workers and police, his concerns 'do not appear to have been acted on'. Convicted: The boy's mother Rachel Peacock, left, was sentenced to a community order over his death, while her boyfriend Richard Morgan, right, is serving a seven-and-a-half-year jail term . The report found that as well as poor communication with the victim's father, information about the boy's welfare was recorded inaccurately. 'The child's father, who lived with him for the first ten months of his life, and who then cared for him overnight for the final three months of his short life, was not visible,' it said. 'He had to ring the social worker, rather than the other way around. He expressed concerns to the social worker, police and the HV, but these do not appear to have been acted on.' A spokeswoman for the Durham Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) apologised for the failures and said no one could have predicted Slater's death . Gill Rigg, the author of a serious case review for LSCB, said that on the day of Slater's first birthday in November 2010 concerns had been raised when Peacock contacted medical professionals. Killer: Morgan was convicted of manslaughter despite trying to claim that Slater's death was an accident . She wrote: 'There were sufficient concerns identified on that evening, and on the following day that could and should have triggered a child protection investigation had the totality of the information been considered at a strategy meeting. 'Slater's mother initially said he had stopped breathing but failed to seek help for several hours. 'Slater had a bruise on his forehead. His mother arrived at the GP surgery with no warning, and left before the GP could complete the referral to the hospital. She then failed to attend hospital as directed.' Mrs Rigg said social workers had failed to challenge medical opinions about his injuries, and the meeting with the GP had not been recorded properly. Senior managers claimed they had not carried out a review of Slater's care because 'too many strategy meetings were being held'. But Mrs Rigg said the true explanation was 'more subtle', and a 'misunderstanding' meant senior managers had failed to properly safeguard Slater. Following the review, in which Slater was referred to as 'Child R', Mrs Rigg said the boy's death was 'not predictable' but a 'different course of events' should have occurred in November 2010. Fran Gosling Thomas, chair of Durham LSCB, said the authority 'wishes to offer its sincere condolences to family members who have been very much a part of this review. We thank them for helping us at such a tragic time.' She added: 'The review highlighted errors regarding recording of information, issues around poor communication and a lack of robust assessment and professional curiosity and challenge by a number of agencies. 'There were broader issues in that Child R's father and wider family members were not given the opportunity to contribute to assessments in relation to Child R.' Following a trial at Newcastle Crown Court, Peacock, 31, was found guilty of cruelty and sentenced to a 12-month community order by Mr Justice King. Morgan, who lived with Peacock in Tantobie, County Durham, claimed he had left the baby in the living room and found him collapsed when he returned. He was sentenced to seven and half years in prison for manslaughter after a jury found he had inflicted the fatal injuries.","Slater Sharkey was covered head-to-toe in bruises when he died in 2010 .

In one instance he pretended to be a security guard and conducted a 'search' using his phone. Scroll down for video... In custody: Mylyn Corniche Johnson, 29. After reviewing footage taken by the registered sex offender and contacting 10 victims they could identify, investigators said they are still looking for more than 100 teen girls and women . A woman in the Target store told security that she had spotted Johnson filming up an 'unsuspecting' customer's skirt. He was held by store security until cops arrived. Upon checking his phone, authorities found more than 100 women had been taped by the suspect ranging from teenagers to ladies in their 50s. Detectives say Johnson filmed his victims in charity shops, shopping malls and on Metrolink trains. Discreet: The upskrit footage was taken with a regular cameraphone being held at Johnson's side . Engage: Police say Johnson would talk to his victims in order for him to record more footage . The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department later found more than 3,200 up-skirt videos, which featured more than 100 unidentified women, on Johnson’s iPhone and on an external hard drive at his home. The police say that he had been carrying out the covert filming since last summer, at least. When cops challenged Johnson, he told them he was an entertainment exec or a tattoo artist but authorities knew that he was a registered sex offender. During one incident at a K-Mart Store in Lancaster, California, Johnson detained a woman from shoplifting in the store by pretending he was a security officer. Locations: Most of the footage was taken in places like Target, K-Mart and even on the subway system . Multiple videos: Police say they have only been able to identify ten of the women so far but believe there to be at least 100 in total . He ordered her to expose part of her buttocks under the guise that he was searching her. He captured the entire incident on his cellphone. Johnson faced multiple charges including allegations of false imprisonment, burglary, and unlawful recording of underwear, sheriff's officials said. After reviewing the footage for two months and contacting 10 victims they could identify, investigators said they are still looking for more than 100 teen girls and women. On several occasions, Johnson would also talk to the women he was taping, identifying himself as a tattoo artist, a rap musician, or being with 'Loyal Luck Television.' Anyone who believes they may have been a victim of Johnson was encouraged to contact the sheriff’s Special Victims Bureau at (877) 710-5273 or via email at SpecialVictims@lasd.org.

A spoilt student who faked his own kidnap in a bid to extort his wealthy father out of £614,000 in gold bullion has been jailed for more than three years. Viraj Mashru, 21, staged the kidnap after his father Rajendra grew tired of his son's wastrel lifestyle and cut off his £500-a-week allowance. Mashru worked with accomplices to convice his father he had been abducted and would only be returned in exchange for a $1million bounty - all the while hiding out at a London hotel. Jailed: Mashru has been jailed for more than three years after admitting conspiracy to blackmail . Amit Patel, 26, told the stricken businessman he had kidnapped Kenyan-born Mashru, and that unless the ransom was paid he would be assaulted and his fingers cut off. Mashru also claimed his supposed kidnappers had threatened to rape him, a court heard yesterday. Working with a third accomplice, 31-year-old Marcus Bennett, Patel made a series of calls to Mr Mashru threatening to kill his son, in order to lure him from Kenya to London. But student Mashru, whose extravagant lifestyle had been funded by his father, had been hiding out in a hotel in Wembley, northwest London, fully involved in the fake plot. The plan was constructed after his father, fed-up with Mashru's partying and extravagant spending, had cut off his monthly allowance of £2,000, Southwark Crown Court heard. During the fake kidnap a total of £614,800 worth of gold bullion was demanded, with Mr Mashru instructed to deposit the ransom in a Harrods account. Prosecutor Caroline Haughey said: 'Mr Mashru junior had been living in the UK for some time, in theory continuing his studies. 'His entire existence in the UK was funded by his family in Kenya. However recently the relationship cooled between Mr Mashru and his father to the extent his father, Rajendra, stopped providing him with money. 'Mr Mashru subsequently came up with a plan to deceive his father into paying a significant amount of money. 'In October 2012 Mr Mashru created a scenario whereby there was created an impression he had disappeared, when in fact he had gone to Bristol.' Ransom: Mashru duped his father, who runs a logistics firm based in Mombasa, Kenya (the website is seen above), into believing he had been kidnapped . She added that he later moved to a hotel in Wembley run by Patel, in a bid to avoid being seen by anybody who knew him. On October 23 Rajendra Mashru received a call in Kenya asking if he was Mashru's father and making the ransom demand. Mr Mashru arrived flew to Britain on October 30 and was greeted at the airport by police who he had called and told of the plot. During a series of calls that Mr Mashru received between October 25 and November 1, the businessman . he spoke to his son on one occasion who told him his purported kidnappers had threatened to rape him. The men were caught on November 1, when police intercepted a car they believed belonged to someone involved in the plot, having analysed information collected from mobile phone monitoring. When officers stopped the white Toyota in Rickmansworth they discovered Mashru, Patel and a third man in the vehicle. Mashru initially stuck with his story, but when Patel told officers that the kidnapping was bogus, he admitted that he had been in on the conspiracy. Both men were taken to Belgravia police station where they made full admissions with Mashru expressing relief that he had been caught. Judge Alastair McCreath . Bennett was arrested the following day and search of his home revealed several mobile phones and sim cards that had been used to make the ransom calls.

'Almost every single student in this country would give their eye teeth to be supported as kindly as that. 'But you lived with considerable extravagance and spent that and more and when your father firmly and properly removed your money to teach you the lessons that you had to learn, instead of tempering your expenditure you accrued debt.' He added: 'This was a deeply unpleasant offence, it was cruel exploitation of your father's love for you. 'The effect of it was surely to cause him, to your mother and others close to you and your family elsewhere huge and terrible worry over a significant period of time,' the judge said. He also said that he had reduced Mashru's sentence because his father had written a letter to say that he had been forgiven. Rajendra Mashru runs P N Mashru, a logistics firm based in Mombasa, Kenya. According to its website the firm has more than 300 vehicles and its operation spans across East Africa.

They may have escaped a war-torn country to the safety of a refugee camp, but with no money, food or change of clothes, the families of Syria are now fighting a new battle. Widowed mother-of-eight Samira is one of the hundreds of thousands of . citizens that has fled to Lebanon, but admits that she now feels she . has swapped one cruel reality for another. 'I am losing hope. I want my final days to come,' she explains as she rocks her young son Mohammed in a fruitless attempt to keep him warm. In exile: Mother-of-four Aysha Ahmed weeps as she speaks of the home she left behind in Syria. 'We don't have enough blankets or covers for all of us as there are so many of us here,' she explains . Squalid: Samira's children Ahmed, 19, Mohammed, five, and Sami, seven, sit in the small room in which they live, with their mother and five more relatives . 'Living . here is worse than in Syria, here we have to keep worrying about every . detail,' she explains. With more refugees arriving everyday, the earmarked land is now becoming an overstretched camp of misery with howling winds tearing down tents, snow turning into muddy water and temperatures plummeting into the minuses. Oxfam and its partner agencies distribute blankets and mattresses, as well as heaters and . gas oil to help the new arrivals stay warm during the harsh winter, but they are now desperately appealing for more help as there is not enough funds to reach everyone. Samira has spent eight months in the squalid camp with her five sons - two of her daughters are in Jordan and one daughter stayed in Syria with her husband. Desperate times: Samira holding her son Mohammed and her passport, which is the only link with her past life in Syria . Struggling: Samira's home is made from one wall of breezeblocks and finished with plastic sheeting and cardboard boxes . The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said on Monday that the number of Syrian refugees and individuals awaiting registration is 714,118. This includes 5,417 Syrian refugees registered in North Africa.JORDAN: UNHCR has registered 174,831 individuals but as of Wednesday another 49,224 Syrians had been in contact to be registered, raising the total number to 224,055.TURKEY: 163,161 registered in some 15 camps in Turkey.LEBANON: There are 161,067 registered.

The 45-year-old's husband died 13 years ago, but she says his loss has never felt more marked than in the recent months. 'If he had been alive he could have . helped me a lot but since he is not with us all the pressure is on me to . look after everyone. I wish I had died before my husband so that I . didn’t end up living like this.' She has made an appointment to . register with UN High Commissioner for Refugees, but may have to wait up to three months to register . and start receiving any aid. Her home is made from one wall of breezeblocks and finished with plastic sheeting and cardboard boxes -  she shares with 12 other people. The floor is wet and icy cold, outside snow melts into the ground creating icy mud. As Samira talks she coughs and unconsciously clutches at her chest which is causing her pain. In the last two months, some . hospitals and clinics in Lebanon's Beqaa valley have reported that the . number of refugees being treated for respiratory infections and . pneumonia account for up to 50 per cent of their caseloads; with the . figure 35 per cent in Tripoli, north Lebanon. She says that lack of food is the biggest problem which keeps her awake at night, but dignity prevents her from begging. 'We need bread for the children; we . don’t have any food at all. I plan to try to sell some items to get some . money. Devastating: Many of the refugees have no food, barely any blankets and is living in squalid conditions . Struggle: With the arrival of winter, plummeting temperatures, and in some places deep snow, thousands of families living in self-made shelters in Lebanon are facing an extremely tough few months without heating, blankets or food . Overstretched: Jalil refugee camp is one of the oldest Palestinian camps in Lebanon, from 1948. There were 3.000 people living there before the refugees started to arrive but they estimate a further 3,500 have arrived since last summer . 'My son sold his mobile phone for $14 (£8) so that we could get some . food but that has finished now and now we have no more food.' Worn down by the daily grind, at the moment Samira can only see a bleak future for her and her children. 'I . plan to stay in Lebanon for now, I can’t go back to Syria with my . children whilst there is a war and I don’t have any other solution. I am . losing hope.' Another mother who longs to return to Syria is 29-year-old Aysha Ahmed. 'It’s very difficult living here. I . think it’s about dignity. I would prefer to die than to lose my dignity. This is not a way to live; I would prefer to die in Syria than continue . living in this situation,' she says. She explains the family are struggling in the bitter temperatures because they are short on clothes after fleeing so unexpectedly. 'I only managed to bring a couple of . pieces of clothes for each child, just one small nylon bag with . everything in. Because it was winter and the clothes were heavy it is . all I could manage to carry,' she explains. Aysha longs for the happy and . comfortable life the family enjoyed before the uprising against . President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011. She and her husband saved for 12 . years to build their own house after living with his parents, but the last time they saw their home it . had been reduced to rubble. Harsh conditions: Syrian refugees make their way in flooded water at a temporary refugee camp, in the eastern Lebanese Town of Al-Faour near the border with Syria . Normality: A Syrian refugee removes her laundry from the ground after it fell, at a temporary refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese town of Marj . 'In Syria we didn’t have to deprive . ourselves of anything that we needed. If we wanted something we could . buy it without a second thought. What we spend here in one day used to . last us 3 weeks in Syria. The difference in the economy is too high.' But she says that when darkness comes that is most difficult time for her young family.

But there is finally hope for Syria's displaced citizens - donor countries pledged more than $1.5 billion (£949.5 million) of aid U.N.

In a pointed message for Syria's leader, Mr Ban told a fund-raising conference that President Bashar al-Assad bore primary responsibility to stop his country's suffering after nearly two years of conflict that have cost an estimated 60,000 lives. Mr Ban said the one-day conference had exceeded the target of $1.5 billion in pledges. About $1 billion (£632 million) is earmarked for Syria's neighbours hosting refugees and $500 million for humanitarian aid to Syrians displaced inside the country.

"Selected by the San Diego Chargers on Friday . By . Thomas Durante and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 19:12 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 26 April 2013 . Manti Te'o is headed to San Diego after being chosen early in the second round of the NFL draft by the Chargers on Friday after being passed over by the first round picks. Te'o, who led Notre Dame to the national championship game, was projected as a first-rounder last year but because of the hoax involving his fake girlfriend and his poor performance in a rout at the hands of Alabama dropped his stock. The Fighting Irish All-American linebacker drew a loud roar from the fans when he was finally selected, but he was nowhere in sight having skipped the ceremony and stayed in Hawaii. Completion: Manti T'eo was chosen by the San Diego Chargers on Friday during the second round of the NFL draft . When former Chargers defensive back . Jim Hill was handed the card to make the announcement by Commissioner . Roger Goodell, he was told, 'You're going to get a big cheer when you . announce this pick.' It was more a mix of surprise and . recognition of the most talked-about player in the draft finally finding . a landing spot at No. 38 overall. Unpicked: Te'o, a former Notre Dame linebacker, was not present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay at his home in Hawaii . The Chargers traded up with Arizona to . grab Te'o, whose tabloid-ready story of the woman who supposedly died . during the season - only for the Heisman Trophy runner-up to acknowledge . in January that he had been a victim of a hoax - made for a national . soap opera. Te'o ran a 4.82-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine, slow for a linebacker. He did better at Notre Dame's pro . day, but NFL teams already had plenty of football reasons to doubt his . worthiness as a first-round pick. The regular-season dominance by the . 6-foot-1, 240-pound All-American now seems so long ago. He led one of . the top defenses in the country for an undefeated team. His seven interceptions were more . than any other linebacker in 2012, and he finished second in the Heisman . Trophy voting behind Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel. He was the third linebacker chosen in this draft. The teams believed to have taken the most interest in Te'o - the Chicago Bears (20th pick) and the Minnesota Vikings (23rd pick) - decided to go with and tackle Kyle Long and cornerback Shariff Floyd, respectively. The Vikings had another shot at a first-rounder with the 25th pick, but went with Florida State University cornerback Xavier Rhodes instead. Hyped up: He was expected to be selected during the first round but was passed over by multiple interested parties, perhaps because of a combination of his poor recent performance and his girlfriend hoax scandal . Even before the draft started, . football fans could not resist taking digs at Te'o on social networking . sites like Twitter and Facebook. One . user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption: 'Waiting . with manti teo's gf waiting to see what team will draft him.' Another posted: 'Manti Te'o has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an NFL team.' Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, tugged on America's heartstrings last September as Notre Dame began their push into the BCS championships. Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away. Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS, which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: 'Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.' Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua was made using photos of Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed she had never met nor spoken to Te'o . But it wasn't until a groundbreaking article on Deadspin.com that Lennay was exposed as an elaborate hoax. The scheme was found to be orchestrated by Roanaiah Tuiasosopo, who admitted that he used phony Twitter and Facebook accounts to get Te'o's attention, win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship. In those fake accounts was a picture of a woman, later identified as Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed that she had never met or spoken to Te'o. Te'o claimed that he was a victim, and was not in on the scandal. In an interview with Katie Couric in late January, Te'o said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist. But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax. Deceived: Earlier this week Te'o emotionally . denied he was involved in any sort of cover-up while instead admitting . he believed Lennay Kekua, played by Tuiasosopo, was real . Self-indulging: Tuiasosopo said that he fell . 'deeply, romantically in love' with Te'o though he was playing him for a . fool while pretending to be a woman . Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that 'Lennay' had died of cancer. 'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said. He . replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told . me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I . committed myself to, died on September 12.' Couric also asked Te'o point blank: 'Are you gay?' Cracking a smile, he responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.' In an interview with Dr Phil McGraw, Tuiasosopo admitted that he was gay and fell 'deeply, romantically in love' with the Notre Dame linebacker even though he was deceiving him. Tuiasosopo also confirmed that it was him impersonating 'Lennay,' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high-pitched and feminine. Since the Couric interview, Te'o has mostly stayed out of the limelight, but appeared at the NFL scouting combine in February and was pictured during various workouts.","Manti Te'o passed over in first round of NFL draft at Radio City Music Hall in New York .

Fans and followers of the 31-year-old’s social media feeds immediately began reposting and replying to the candid pic. What a squirt: 31-year-old Mathis posted his pee pic on Instagram and Twitter for all the public to see yesterday and remains unrepentant . ‘This is a good way to get arrested in DC,’ said Instagram user hindsdm.

Karen Culverwell fell for a smooth-talking serial conman who went on to swindle her out of 200,000 pounds . Despite spending a year in jail for duping four women out of their savings, Roy Moyse had not changed his ways. Within months of his release he  was trawling bars and nightclubs  for more lonely, vulnerable women  to fleece. So when he met Karen Culverwell, a divorcee who was about to receive a £245,000 settlement for her broken marriage, she made the perfect target. Pretending to be a successful businessman, the jobless gambling addict wormed his way into Mrs Culverwell’s affections, and soon the couple were living together. Thinking of him as her ‘rock’, she told Moyse all about her lucrative divorce settlement following the sale of the six-bedroom marital home she used to share with her company director ex-husband. Moyse, 45, persuaded her to let him set up an online bank account for her, and help handle her bills. In reality, the only person he helped was himself – to her cash. He swindled her out of £200,000 in two months, including £70,000 in one particularly lucrative week, blowing much of it in betting shops. Mrs Culverwell, 50, a housewife throughout her marriage who had limited computer skills, said: ‘I wish I had looked him up on the internet before I started a relationship with him, but it’s not something you think to do straight away. ‘I wasn’t that good on a computer at the start, I could just about write emails – nowadays I have much more knowledge. ‘Even when he set up my online banking I was reluctant because I didn’t know how to use it, which is why he organised the bills and had access to my accounts.’ She could have discovered the fraudster’s past online in seconds, as his previous crimes had been widely reported. A web search would have shown that Moyse was sentenced to three years in March 2008 for a string of similar scams dating back six years, including conning three women out of tens of thousands of pounds – and that he had even tricked a fourth woman by pretending to be a barrister while awaiting trial. He was released after 12 months. Mother of two Mrs Culverwell only discovered the fraud when she tried to buy a new home and was told by her bank that she had no money left. Every morning she had watched as Moyse walked out the door in a smart suit, thinking he was heading to business meetings. In fact, he had spent his days blowing her money in betting shops. Days after they split up, Moyse (pictured) emailed her a photo of himself stood against a new car, apparently bought with her money . The conman was jailed again for two years this week at Bournemouth Crown Court. Yesterday Mrs Culverwell, of Christchurch, Dorset,  branded him ‘completely heartless and disgusting with no conscience’. ‘You read about this sort of thing happening to other people and your first reaction is to think “what a stupid person”, and “what a fool to believe all that”,’ she said. ‘He was a calculating, professional conman and I don’t believe I had a chance. He has fooled people cleverer than me and lived in a fantasy life full of compulsive lies.’ Mrs Culverwell met Moyse in a bar, where they bonded over their appreciation of soul music. She had separated from her husband Robert amicably after 20 years in 2010. She moved out of the former marital home in June 2011, and shortly afterwards Moyse moved in with her. ‘He would leave the house suited and booted, telling me he was interviewing or having meetings. I had no reason to disbelieve him,’ she said. ‘I had no idea about the gambling. In fact, when I wanted to put a bet on the Grand National he told me he had never put a bet on anything.’ When she confronted him after discovering her account had been drained, Moyse kept lying, claiming he used the money to pay for work-related bills – and that he would reimburse her with a loan. When that never materialised, she contacted police. Moyse had spent Karen's money in betting shops (stock picture) when she believed him to be at work . Moyse was charged with six counts of fraud. Earlier this month he admitted one count relating to unauthorised bank transfers. The others, which involved credit cards, were left on file. Moyse, of Poole, Dorset, admitted swindling Mrs Culverwell out of £150,000, but he is thought to have benefited from more than £200,000 including loans she gave him that were never repaid. Mrs Culverwell, who has had to take a job as a sales manager, said: ‘Some days  I have no idea how I managed to stand up, let alone  work full time and care for  my family. ‘I loved and trusted this man and to think I allowed him to not only be in my life, but my daughters’ lives too, it makes me feel sick. ‘I am determined to make sure that no other woman falls into his trap. He has no right to destroy people’s lives and he has to be stopped once and for all. ‘I found the strength to come forward with the support of my family and friends and I hope other people who may have been affected by him will go to the police.’ Mrs Culverwell has complained to her bank over the irregular transactions, and the matter has since been referred to the financial ombudsman.","Karen Culverwell was a divorcee who was about to receive £245,000 .

He is as famous for his brazen publicity stunts as he is for his multi-million pound business empire. But yesterday, Virgin Atlantic President Richard Branson performed what may have been his most tawdry exploit yet, as he promoted his company’s expansion into Scotland. Stepping off the first Virgin plane at Edinburgh airport from Heathrow, the billionaire businessman lifted up his kilt to the watching crowd to reveal pants bearing the slogan ‘stiff competition.’ Breezy: Sir Richard Branson lifted up his Harris Tweed Kilt in Edinburgh today to promote his new Virgin Atlantic Little Red flights . Self-promotion: Branson flashed his suggestive underwear to a crowd of onlookers including Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon . The crude tongue-in-cheek phrase alluded to Mr Branson’s newly launched domestic service, Little Red, which will now offer Virgin flights between Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and London, in direct competition with British Airways. Never one to shy away from the limelight, Mr Branson – who had a Scottish grandmother and is married to a Glaswegian – stood on an elevated platform on the windy runway and said it was ‘great to be in Edinburgh’ before he exposed his underwear to a crowd which included Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Speaking after the stunt, Mr Branson said he was ‘enjoying wearing a kilt’. No shrinking violet: Branson was hoping to draw attention to Virgin's new domestic services between London Heathrow and Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester . ‘Despite the weather it is nice to have a bit of fresh air and it is very comfortable,’ he added. ‘I’ve got to the age where it is wise to always wear something under my kilt- especially in weather like this.’ This is not the first time the Virgin mogul has resorted to such uncouth publicity stunts. The new Little Red service lauched yesterday will be the first time Virgin Atlantic has operated connecting flights from Scottish destinations, and Mr Branson said he was ‘excited’ to have been given the airport slots that came available after domestic airline British Midlands was forced out of business. ‘We are delighted that we managed to pick up these slots as it means we can offer stiff competition to British Airways,’ said the Virgin executive. Honorary Scotsman: Branson said that he was enjoying wearing his kilt saying it was 'nice to have a bit of fresh air' ‘There are a lot of people from around the world who love to fly to Edinburgh and Aberdeen and now we can finally now compete properly with BA and give people the opportunity to travel up here with Virgin.’ ‘I look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Scotland.’ The expanded Virgin Atlantic service will create 130 new jobs in Scotland, and is expected to generate £75 million in revenue for the Scottish economy. Speaking yesterday, Mr Branson said that . while he was ‘thrilled’ that Virgin had finally been allowed to expand . services to Edinburgh and Aberdeen, he was unhappy that they had been . prevented from operating out of Glasgow. ‘I would love to be flying to Glasgow as . well, but for some bizarre reason the competition authorities, who . bequeathed us these slots, didn’t allow us to have the slots to compete . with British airways out of Glasgow’, added the millionaire businessman. Brazen: Canny businessman Branson took the opportunity to have a dig at competitors British Airways, saying that the 'stiff competition' message was aimed at them . After reporting losses of up to £135 million over the past two years, Mr Branson and Virgin Atlantic’s new Chief Executive, Craig Kreeger, said that the new domestic service was just one part of the company’s plans to push its finances back into the black. And despite his brazen publicity stunt, Mr Branson was insistent that he would remain on neutral ground over the question of Scottish Independence. ‘If Scotland becomes independent they will have an airline that will be delighted to connect them to their neighbouring country and if it stays part of Great Britain, we will be equally delighted to have . Scottish people use our services to take visits down to little old England,’ said Mr Branson.‘Either way, Virgin will stay independent of this particular debate.’","Exhibitionist entrepreneur flashed underwear to promote new airline route .

Volunteers from the Associated Humane Societies have since filed a civil suit seeking ownership of Patrick. The organization first took him to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists. Patrick currently lives with Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, an administrator of the Tinton Falls veterinary facility where the dog was first treated. While the obviously horrific trauma the dog ensured as seen from some of the first pictures revealed inevitably left emotional and physical scarring, those who know Patrick talk only of how loving and trusting he is. Heartbreaking: Patrick was at death's door when he was taken to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists in Tinton Fall, New Jersey and few thought he would survive . Miraculous: A year later, his carer and hospital administrator Patricia Smillie-Scavelli says he gives enormous love and sleeps in bed with her, her husband and their cat . 'He is a tremendous fighter,' said Dr . Thomas Scavelli, the director and founder of the Garden State . Veterinary Specialists, the pet hospital in Tinton Falls where Patrick . has been treated. His . wife, Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, told Irish Central: 'He really gives . love. He climbs into your lap, he would prefer to sit in your lap than . lay on the floor. He also sleeps in our bed at night, along with the . cat.' Though understandably Patrick remains nervous around strangers, reported NBC, a treat or two quickly remedies his fear. 'There are very few animals, or any life form, that could have gone through and survived what he has, and really never looked back,' said Dr Scavelli of his courageous recovery. And few who have simultaneously become so much of a celebrity. Hospital staffers have chronicled his progress on their website . and a Facebook page has garnered fans from around the world. Devoted: Patricia Smillie-Scavelli holds a 1-year-old Patrick in April last year at the hospital where she is an administrator and her husband, Dr Thomas Scavelli is director . He's received hundreds of emails, donations, gifts and letters from those inspired by his tale of survival. The hospital ordered 500 thank-you cards with Patrick's picture to mail . to those who have sent collars, dog shirts, toys, scrapbook pages or dog . blankets embroidered with Patrick's name, and they are fast running out. When Patrick was brought to the hospital after being rescued by officials at the Associated Humane Societies, he was so starved, emaciated and dehydrated he was curled into a ball, unable to walk or stand. His ribcage protruded, he weighed about 20 pounds - roughly 30 pounds less than average - and was covered in sores with parts of skin hanging off him, according to Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, Dr Scavelli's wife and the administrator of the hospital. Peace: Patrick is still nervous around strangers but a treat helps earn his trust . 'Everyone thought that, you bring in . an animal like that, that looks like it's really just a corpse, you put . it to sleep,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said. 'But . of course, he looked up at you with those eyes, and you say: How can . you give up on this dog? How can you, when he's not giving up on life? So, we gave him that second chance, and he has just run with it, and . thrived.' - Vets on their decision to not euthanize Patrick . After weeks of emergency measures that . included a transfusion of three pints of dog blood, a special diet, . medicine and physical therapy, Patrick began to gain weight and eat . solid food. He also started to enjoy taking outdoor walks in the sun and playing with the many toys that well-wishers had sent him. 'This . is not a month of starvation,' Dr Scavelli said soon after his rescue. 'This is a lifetime probably, or at least months and months of neglect, . and to see the way he cares for people and trusts people, that's really . been the most interesting and rewarding thing to see about the canine . spirit.' Kisha Curtis of Newark, is scheduled to . appear in court on charges of neglect and abandonment - fourth-degree . offences for 'tormenting and torturing' an animal by failing to provide . food and water, prosecutors said. Happy holidays! While the Associated Humane Societies are fighting for custody to find Patrick a home, the Scavellis are hoping to be considered as his permanent future owners . Horrifying: When he was first brought in Patrick was starving and had been subjected to months, possibly a life time of horrific abuse . The charges could carry a maximum jail sentence of 18 months and a fine of up to $10,000. She also faces two abandonment charges punishable by up to six months in jail with a $1,000 fine. Authorities said Curtis tied the dog to a railing in her Newark apartment building and left the state for more than a week. A janitor later found the emaciated dog in a trash bin. Curtis has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Her mother told reporters at her daughter's court hearing that the dog had been given to Kisha but she could not take care of it, so she'd tied it up outside hoping somebody else would take it. The Essex County courthouse has also received more than 600 letters and . faxes from around the world expressing concern for the dog and urging . swift and harsh punishment for Curtis. 'In the 17 years we've been here we've never seen this type of response . to an animal,' Patricia Smillie-Scavelli said. 'There's something about . Patrick that has really sparked interest, honestly, from throughout the . entire world.' She hopes to keep and care for Patrick herself.","Kisha Curtis, 29, has denied ever abusing the dog but admits to having put it outside a hallway in 2011 .

'People really enjoy it': Medical student Maggie Rostron, 28, president of the Glasgow University Pole-Dancing Club, rejected claims of 'sexualisation' Writhing semi-naked as they perform their raunchy routines, these young women look like  professional pole-dancers. In fact, they are students at a leading Scots university, where undergraduates as young as 17 are taking part in the ‘sport’. Dozens participated in the show, which was open to the public as well as students, and all paid a £5 entry fee. Organisers say pole-dancing – once seen exclusively as a feature of strip bars – is increasingly popular among female students. About 170 students are now members of a Glasgow University society dedicated to promoting the activity. But last night the disclosure fuelled concern about the growing ‘sexualisation’ of teenage girls and young women on university campuses, while organisers admitted some parents had voiced concern. Mike Judge, of the UK evangelical group Christian Institute, said: ‘This is not what parents would expect their daughters to be doing at university. ‘Those who fought for the right of women to go to university would be appalled by this club. ‘The pornification of our culture is forcing young women to do things many of them later regret.

In another routine, The Roman Empire, nursing students stripped off togas and performed in black and gold pants and cropped tops. The pole-dancing revelations come after a Safer Sex Ball  brought notoriety to Exeter University earlier this month, after footage of two revellers engaged in an intimate act was posted on the internet. Female students in Exeter have also taken explicit images of themselves and uploaded them on to Facebook. Some are naked from the waist up, their modesty barely protected by a bar bearing the words ‘Original Sin’, the name of the London-based events company that organises themed student parties at Exeter nightclubs.

British tennis star Andy Murray will be serving up Michelin-starred meals rather than aces - after buying a luxury hotel near his home town for £1.8million. The 25-year-old is the new owner of Cromlix House Hotel - a Victorian mansion just a few miles from  Dunblane, Perthshire, where he grew up. He intends to renovate the venue - where his brother Jamie got married in 2010 - in time for the Ryder Cup in 2014 which is taking place in nearby Gleneagles. Andy Murray has bought £1.8million Victorian mansion Cromlix House near his home town of Dunblane . Cromlix House sits in 2,000 acres of estate including four fishing lochs and two mineral springs . Andy Murray fought off two rival bidders to land the £1.8million mansion and estate . Ambitious Murray has already enlisted Michelin-starred chef Albert Roux to oversee the restaurant and says the venture will bring another 40 jobs to his local community. Couple: British tennis star Andy Murray with his girlfriend Kim Sears . He said yesterday: ‘I am pleased to have acquired Cromlix House and look forward to securing its future as a successful business. ‘By re-establishing Cromlix as a leading luxury hotel at the heart of the Dunblane community we will be able to attract new visitors to the area, create a number of new jobs and focus on supporting other local businesses. ‘I’m pleased to be able to give something back to the community I grew up in.’ The 14-bedroom Victorian mansion sits in 34 acres of landscaped grounds within a 2,000-acre estate and includes four fishing lochs and two mineral springs. The Olympic gold medallist’s brother Jamie married his Colombian girlfriend Alejandra Gutierrez there in 2010, with Murray as best man. The renovated hotel is now expected to generate significant custom for other Dunblane businesses as it draws a wealthy clientele to the area. Dunblane SNP councillor Graham Houston said: ‘I am delighted that Cromlix House is being brought back into operation as a hotel. 'It was excellent in its day and was an important part of the community, so it will be welcomed back by all those who used to enjoy it for dinners, afternoon tea and weddings. ‘We are all big supporters of Andy and it is lovely that he is bringing some of his success back to the community, so we can all be a part of it.’ One of 14 bedrooms in Andy Murray's new hotel which was built in 1874 . Cromlix House is expected to be reopened in 2014 ahead of the Ryder Cup which is being staged in nearby Gleneagles . The family who previously ran the hotel said they were 'delighted' that it was staying in local hands . The previous owners, the Eden family, who ran the hotel for more than 30 years, said they were delighted that the venue was staying in local hands. Cromlix House, which was built in 1874, has 14 bedroom suites, a chapel, reception hall, two drawing rooms, conservatory, dining room, library and meeting rooms. It shut its doors suddenly on February 16 last year after falling victim to the economic downturn. Norbert Lieder, managing director of Inverlochy Castle Management, who will oversee the hotel, said he was ‘delighted to be working with Andy in this very exciting project.’ He added: ‘I am confident that, with Andy, we can create a very special hotel in his home community. ‘While we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world, we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people.’ Memories: Andy Murray with girlfriend Kim Sears at Cromlix House in 2010 when he acted as best man for the wedding of brother Jamie (right) to his Columbian girlfriend Alejandra Gutierrez (second right) The hotel purchase is not expected to make too much of a dent in the tennis player’s personal fortune. Murray has made more than £14million in career prize money, after adding £1.1million from his first Grand Slam title in New York last year. He has pocketed £6.4million in sponsorship, merchandising and appearance fees over the past 12 months alone. Dunblane Green councillor Mark Ruskell also voiced his support for the venture. He said: ‘The Dunblane area is seeing a real resurgence. ‘Cromlix House is much missed locally and there will no doubt be welcome spin-off opportunities for local businesses to supply weddings and other special events.’","Tennis star buys Victorian mansion near Dunblane, Perthshire .

Missing: Mikaela Lynch, 9, who has the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, has been missing in Northern California since Sunday after her family says she ran from their home naked while playing outside . 'She was an in enclosed yard, there was some sort of distraction, I believe a bee in the yard, the younger brother opened the gate, went inside, and when they came back, the daughter was missing,' Clearlake Police Lt. Tim Celli told ABC. Mikaela, originally from San Francisco, is described as 'severely autistic.' She is non-verbal and doesn't respond to being called. Police were told she often removed her clothes when she was hot. The articles, including her shoes, were found in her family's yard. A diaper the girl was believed to have been wearing was also located near a waterway by canines at least one house away, Celli told the Santa Rosa Democrat, prompting additional fears of drowning. On Monday a neighbor's nearby video surveillance instead caught the girl running up the street and away from the waterway, turning the investigation away from the water - an area initially searched by divers. Vanished: Mikaela's family say she was playing in this vacation home's enclosed backyard when she abruptly took off through an open gate left by her younger brother . Search: Authorities originally feared the girl had run off toward the water surrounding their home, seen circled in red, but thanks to a neighbor's surveillance video believe she ran from it . Authorities say the girl's mother, Bari Lynch, who left in search of her daughter in her truck, unknowingly trailed her daughter's path down the same road only minutes later, but without success.

Payout: Bus driver David Hoggett, 58, has been awarded £60,000 after he was unfairly sacked from Abellio London ltd after developing diabetes . A double decker London bus driver who was unfairly sacked from his job after developing diabetes has been awarded almost £60,000 in damages. Father-of-three David Hoggett was fired to make way for 'cheaper Polish drivers at half the cost', his solicitor claimed after winning the tribunal. The 58-year-old had worked under Abellio London Limited - the firm employed to provide drivers for the famous red buses in the city and parts of Surrey. He claimed sick pay when he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and took several months to respond to Vitamin D medication last summer. But bosses at Abellio sacked him on 'medical grounds of capability'. He then sued the company for unfair dismissal and discrimination on the grounds of his disability, an employment tribunal hearing had been told. Mr Hoggett successfully won his claim and was awarded £10,000 in injury to feelings compensation and two years of his salary, almost £47,000, bringing the total to £56,976.55. Solicitor Alex Monaco, a senior partner in Compromise Agreements Limited, who dealt with the case, said: 'The unfair and discriminatory dismissal of our long-serving client Mr Hoggett would have decreased Abellio's wage bill and enabled them to recruit cheaper drivers from abroad. 'Mr Hoggett was paid £29,000, and if these cheaper drivers were being paid £14,000 or £15,000 it would be a two for one swap effectively. 'How many other people has this affected who have not stood up for their rights?' Bus company Abellio strongly deny Mr Monaco's allegations, which were only made after the case had concluded, that his client was sacked to make way for cheaper foreign drivers. It was reported last month that the operator flew bosses to Poland to recruit 50 new drivers. Bosses at Abellio, a subsidiary of the Dutch state rail operator, claimed it could not find suitable British candidates to work on routes on parts of London. The tribunal hearing held in Croydon, Surrey, was told that Mr Hoggett worked as a driver since May 2004 until he was sacked on July 20, last year. Driver: 58-year-old had worked under Abellio London Limited - the firm employed to provide drivers for the famous red buses in the city and parts of Surrey . He attended a doctor's appointment on March 9, last year, after suffering from what he thought thought was a chest infection. The driver from East Molesey, Surrey, was signed off sick and during that period he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes on April 11. Doctors who helped treat his condition said they considered this to amount to a disability. In his witness statement, Mr Hoggett said he was placed on a course of medication by his doctor to bring the diabetes under control. But after returning to work he suffered a relapse in his condition and was signed off sick again . After meetings with staff manager Jacinta Faley she later advised him that he was being dismissed on medical grounds of capability. Mr Hoggett said: 'I believe that the decision to dismiss me had been taken prior to the meeting on 20-7- 2012,' he said. 'The majority of the meeting seemed to focus on my termination rather than looking at my condition and how long it might take for me to be able to return to work.' He added: 'I would like to point out that my driving licence was never removed or suspended by DVLA. 'They were advised, of course of my condition and subsequently confirmed that my driving privileges remain intact. 'I was getting close to returning to work and was simply waiting for my doctor to confirm this. 'I believe that I was unfairly dismissed by my employer and that the reason for my dismissal related to my disability.' Speaking after the case, Mr Hoggett said: 'I'm glad the case is done and dusted. It has been dealt with I can move on with my life. It was a real burden to cope with and very stressful for me and my family.' A spokesman for Abellio said: 'With regard to the Employment Tribunal on Thursday 2nd May 2013 we were disappointed by the result however, we will abide by the conclusion of the tribunal and wish the claimant all the best for the future.' On the Polish bus driver allegation, he added: 'Our drivers are under a collective bargaining agreement and this is clearly both factually wrong and simply incorrect.'","David Hoggett was fired for 'cheaper Polish drivers' it was claimed .

The father-of-six had also stored photographs of victims in . child sex murder cases including the Soham girls Holly Wells and Jessica .

Worrying: Mark Bridger, left, who is accused of murdering April Jones, right, had viewed and downloaded Facebook photos of the five-year-old in the days before she disappeared, a jury has heard . Hi tech computer expert Mervyn Ray from Dyfed Powys police today told Mold Crown Court: 'The computer was found to contain a series of folders which . amounted to a library of images. 'The folders were arranged in such a . way so that in one part you had pornographic images. 'In one folder . there were pornographic images including images of under age girls. In . another there were images of sexual activity in cartoon format including . images of under age girls. In a third folder there were images of . clothed girls including known individuals.' Mr Ray told the jury that there was also a list of . internet search terms used by Bridger which included 'naked five year . old girls' and  'naked virgin teens.' The jury also heard today that Bridger used a . mobile internet dongle to search Facebook, MSN and Yahoo sites . shortly over two hours before April was seen being driven away in his . Land Rover car from near her home. April, who had cerebral palsy, vanished while playing on her bike near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year. April Jones . Bridger, 47, denies abducting and murdering the schoolgirl in a 'sexually motivated' attack. At around 7.20am on September 22, nine days before April vanished, Mr Ray said Bridger viewed 22 Facebook photos of one of April’s half-sisters, among them were pictures which also showed April. At about 7.30am he looked at nine images of another local girl and three minutes later looked at more pictures of April and a half-sister. Mr Ray told the jury: 'When Mr Bridger is looking at Facebook, the site provides the computer with a brief record.' Several pictures of April’s half-sister, including one with April, were saved to the computer and were shown to the jury. On September 28, three days before April vanished, seven more images of her half-sister were viewed and 25 images of another local young girl. On the day of April’s alleged abduction, Mr Ray said Bridger accessed Facebook on several occasions and viewed 32 images of local girls. Just after midday, the witness said, Bridger also looked an indecent cartoon image which had been saved on to the computer. Grieving: April's parents Paul and Coral Jones are pictured arriving on a previous day of the trial . That afternoon, he sent Facebook messages to three different women inviting them to go 'for a drink', the court heard. Shortly before 5pm, a mobile internet dongle was used with the laptop. The dongle was never recovered, the jury was told, and Mr Ray said it was not possible to establish what was being viewed on the laptop. April was last seen at around 7pm on October 1, playing on a bicycle with her friend near their homes on Machynlleth’s Bryn-Y-Gog estate. Her body has never been found despite the biggest search operation in British policing history. The prosecution say Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker, snatched and murdered the schoolgirl. He says he accidentally killed her when he ran her over and accepts that he must have got rid of her body but cannot remember how he did it because he was drunk. Earlier, the public gallery was cleared as the jury was shown some of the images found on Bridger’s laptop. Mr Ray said there were a total of 100 to 150 indecent images on the computer, 65 of which he considered to be of a 'criminal standard'. He also told the jury that on June 8, police found evidence of internet searches 'naked five year old girls' at 1.15am and, at 1.20am, 'pictures of naked virgin teens'. He said two indecent images were saved onto the laptop at around the same time. The photographs of Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were among a number of images described as 'real life crime'. Also found were pictures of Caroline Dickinson, a British 13-year-old who was murdered in France in July 1996; Jessica Lunsford, a nine-year-old murdered in Florida, the United States, in 2005; and Esra Akyuz, a six-year-old Turkish girl who was murdered in 2001. Bridger, wearing a blue shirt and tie and round glasses, followed today’s proceedings from the dock and occasionally moved towards the glass through which he gave instructions to his solicitor. Crime scene investigator Melanie Barlow was tasked with forensic searches of a wood burning fireplace in the living room at Bridger’s cottage, Mount Pleasant. She said she noticed that areas of the fire had been 'cleaned up'. Horrific: April's body has never been found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police . She said: 'I noted an area of wiping down or cleaning up around the fire which was not consistent with the area as a whole and stood out to me.' She said smears on the glass in the fire were, 'caused by using a cloth or something to wipe down the glass'. Under cross examination by Brendan Kelly QC, defending Bridger, she conceded that written notes mentioning the clean up were only made last Friday - after she looked again at photographs she had taken of the scene.

Convicted: Three youths who stabbed innocent football fan Luke Fitzpatrick, pictured, to death then attacked his father as he tended to his dying son are today facing years in prison . Both were targeted just because they were part of the crowd watching the match at a pub in Dollis Hill, northwest London. Christopher Walters, 23, from Neasden, and Loen Burton, 17, from Mill Hill, all north London, were found guilty of murder and wounding. Abdi Hassan, 17, of Cricklewood, was found guilty of manslaughter and wounding. Judge Rebecca Poulet lifted an anonymity order on the 17-year-olds saying: 'It is difficult to think of a more grave case.' There were angry scenes in the courtroom today after the jury returned their verdicts. Walters, 23, bragged 'life is life innit, 20, 30- years I’ll be out' and demanded to be sentenced straight away as he was convicted. Guilty:  Loen Burton, 17, left, from Mill Hill,  north London, was found guilty of murder and wounding. Hamad Abdullah, 26, right, was found guilty of violent disorder . His remarks prompted angry scenes from the public gallery . with Luke’s aunt shouting: 'What life did you give my nephew that night? 'What have you left us with? They took my beautiful nephew, we have to live with this for the rest of our lives.' Walters . responded by shouting ‘For murder? do you know how many people were . there. Don’t talk s*** blood’ as he was bundled down to the cells by . prison guards. The group was remanded in custody for sentencing on June 7 at the Old Bailey. The father and son had been watching Chelsea win the Champions League final in their local pub, the Ox and Gate, in May last year. Later, the pub was 'stormed' by at least 15 masked and hooded youths. They were armed with knives, sticks, poles, and even a crutch, but . were repelled by the drinkers who threw bar furniture at them before . giving chase. The attackers were looking for a man who had already left the pub in Dollis Hill, north London, to avenge Walters’ loss of face during an earlier incident. In the dock: Mustafa Bereima, left, was found guilty of violent disorder. Rafael Dejesus, 25, right, was found guilty of assisting an offender . Regulars at the pub chased the group . out but as they reached Alder Grove, they turned and attacked Luke . Fitzpatrick who was nearest to them. Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, added: 'His father Bernard was stabbed several times as he was aiding his dying son where he had fallen. 'This . mindless violence led to a terrible and tragic outcome. An innocent . young man lost his life and his father had to witness it.' Mr Fitzpatrick had been stabbed in the abdomen and legs but had not died. Mr . Altman said Walters was responsible for organising the disorder and had . led the group into the pub, uttering threats and brandishing a knife. Earlier in the day, Walters had been involved in a row with the other man in the street. It spread to a corner shop where staff ejected the second man and pulled the shutters down to shelter Walters. Horrific: The father and son had been watching Chelsea win the Champions League final in their local pub, the Ox and Gate, pictured, before they were attacked . Mr . Altman told the trial: 'Walters did not let matters rest there. He set . about exacting his revenge by calling to arms his friends and . associates. 'They stormed the pub. These were acts of cowardice, mob-handed and tooled up, to avenge Walters’ perceived loss of face.' Mr Fitzpatrick’s mother Constance . said in a statement she did not know why the group were allowed to . terrorise the neighbourhood for so long. She said she would never be able to forgive the killers of her 'shy and timid' loving son. Mrs Fitzpatrick said the group of youths were always hanging around a corner shop. She added: 'I feel angry they have been unchecked to roam the streets. 'They have been a violent and constant intimidating presence in this community.' Friend Katy McKeon, 22, who has known him growing up, said: 'Luke was one of the nicest guys around, always looking after people, he . actually cared about people, a really nice, funny guy. 'The amount of flowers that are here just shows how loved he was, this has ruined this community. 'I was there on Saturday and it was like something out of a horror film.' Michael .

The body of an autistic 9-year-old Northern California girl last seen running naked from her family's vacation home has been found, authorities announced. Clearlake police say divers found Mikaela Lynch's body in a muddy creek running near the family's home on Wednesday after the child took off from the yard three days ago after left briefly unattended. Mikaela, who had the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, had been left outside for what authorities said was an 'unknown period of time.' Tragic end: The hunt for Mikaela Lynch, a 9-year-old autistic girl missing from her Northern California home since Sunday, ended tragically on Wednesday with divers discovering her body . Clearlake Police Chief Craig Clausen . said there was no indication of foul play, but offered few other . details, the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa reported. It also wasn't immediately known how long she had been in the water for. 'It's difficult to be standing here saying this,' Clausen said at a news conference. Her family told police that Mikaela was playing with her younger brother on a trampoline around 1pm when she abruptly took off on Sunday while leaving her clothes and shoes behind. Police were told she often removed her clothes when she was hot. Mikaela's disappearance sparked a massive search effort that included hundreds of volunteers and law enforcement officials. After the announcement of her death, volunteers and rescuers cried, the Press Democrat reported. 'We just wanted to find that baby and bring some peace to the family,' said Fred Cox of Clearlake, who was turned away from volunteering after Mikaela was found. On Tuesday Clearlake Police Lt. Tim Celli spoke to  ABC, explaining her ability to slip outside the family's property while momentarily left unattended. Vanished: Mikaela's family say she was playing in this vacation home's enclosed backyard when she abruptly took off through an open gate left by her younger brother . Search: Authorities originally feared the girl had run off toward the water surrounding their home, seen circled in red, but thanks to a neighbor's surveillance video believe she ran from it . 'She was an in enclosed yard, there was . some sort of distraction, I believe a bee in the yard, the younger . brother opened the gate, went inside, and when they came back, the . daughter was missing,' said Celli. Mikaela, originally from San Francisco, was described as 'severely autistic.' She was non-verbal and didn't respond to being called making search efforts monumentally challenging. On Sunday a diaper the girl was believed to have been wearing was located near a waterway by K-9s at least one house away, Celli told the Santa Rosa Democrat. The find prompted additional fears of her drowning. But on Monday a neighbor's video surveillance showed the girl running up the street and away from the waterway, turning the investigation away from the water - an area initially searched by divers. Authorities say the girl's mother, Bari Lynch, who left in search of her daughter in her truck, unknowingly trailed her daughter's path down the same road only minutes later, but without success. Authorities say they do not believe she was abducted. Residents were asked to look high and low for the girl with her whereabouts believed to be anywhere. 'She's very inquisitive and she likes to explore, climb,' Haben Porter, a teacher at Sunset Elementary School who worked with Mikaela told ABC.","Mikaela Lynch, who had the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, had been missing since Sunday afternoon .

Innocent: Andrew Jaipaul, 21, died after being caught up in gang warfare on a London housing estate when he was chased and stabbed 25 times by a mob . An innocent painter and decorator died after he was chased and stabbed 25 times by a large and vicious gang on a housing estate, a court heard today. Andrew Jaipaul was 'savagely attacked' by a mob as he walked home through the Andover estate in Holloway, north London. The 21-year-old was repeatedly stabbed near a children's play area before the gang - which allegedly included a 14-year-old boy - ran off. The Old Bailey was told that the gang was heard shouting 'Busy Block' - a reference to their area of north London - as Mr Jaipaul lay dying on the ground. Eight defendants - the youth, now 15, and . a 17-year-old, neither of whom can be named, Tirrell Ball-Thomas and . Orvill Stirling, both 18, Jojo Mafwa and Allan Kalema, both 19, Tommy . McInerny, 21, and Warren Brooks, 23, all deny murder, conspiracy to . cause GBH and violent disorder. The Old Bailey heard today that Mr Jaipaul became innocently caught up in an escalating war between rival north London gangs. Police had already been alerted by worried callers of a large number of aggressive and threatening youths making their way towards the Estate. CCTV also captured the group making their way to and from the Estate. Zoe Johnson, prosecuting, told the court: 'On June 26, 2011, at about 10.25pm, Andrew Jaipaul, aged 21, was savagely stabbed to death. 'He was walking home through the Andover Estate when he was attacked. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'He found himself the victim of a series of escalating attacks between rival gangs in north London. 'Andrew Jaipaul was minding his own business when, out of nowhere, a large, armed gang came across him, decided to attack him, chased him down and brutally murdered him near a children’s play area. 'Members of the public saw and heard that group move through the area, pursue Andrew Jaipaul, and kill him. As the members of the group left, they were heard to shout “Busy Block”. The court also heard today that the gang had also stabbed . another innocent man just five days earlier.

Mr Ahmed . told them he had nothing to do with gangs and lived on the Andover . Estate but as turned his back the mob stabbed him 12 times causing a . lung to collapse. A helicopter ambulance airlifted him to hospital. In the dock: Jojo Mafwa denies murder following the horrific stabbing in June 2011 . Zoe .

He . was chased and then stabbed several times in the buttocks and had a cut . to the head. He was alter that day discharged from hospital accompanied . by Tommy McInerney - another 'prominent member of “Busy Block.'

"Different vocal traits are associated with size, attractiveness, friendliness . By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 16:52 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 25 April 2013 . Chaps, forget the expensive cologne and witty one-liners, the way to a woman's heart could be as simple as lowering your voice. Scientists have found different vocal traits are instinctively associated with body size, attractiveness and friendliness. They discovered the most desirable male voice for British women is deep, rumbling and breathy, indicating the ideal blend of masculinity, strength, with a hint of tenderness. Which may explain Joey's success with the ladies in the sitcom Friends, with his catchphrase ""How you doin'"" perfectly encapsulating all these characteristics. Charming the ladies could be as simple as lowering your voice, explaining Joey's success with the ladies in the sitcom Friends . While for women wanting to attract a British man, their delivery should be high-pitched and breathy, which signals to the male psyche they are petite and, controversially, open and submissive. 'For women, it is a bit of a sexist prototype. The research suggests that subconsciously, men are more attracted to a female voice that indicates friendliness and submission,' said lead researcher Dr Yi Xu, a reader in speech sciences at UCL. 'Men prefer a voice which projects a small body size, which is higher pitched and breathy. Marilyn Monroe is a good example.' Politicians have long been aware of the impact of their voice. Margaret Thatcher famously underwent vocal training to lower her tone and make her sound more statesmanlike . Margaret Thatcher famously underwent vocal training to lower her tone and make her sound more statesmanlike. According to Dr Xu, breathiness as seen as sultry in women, and tender in men. It is also more common in younger women, which may add to its appeal. 'Even for males, if you want to be attractive to females, it is better to be breathy than aggressive in terms of voice quality. But in pitch, we found it is more attractive to be low, which indicates masculinity,' he said. 'For a man, the perfect combination is both masculinity and tenderness - that was the preferred voice type.' In the animal world, listeners can perceive a caller's body size based on the noise they make. For example, low frequency growls suggest a larger body size, dominance or a potential attack, while higher frequency and pure-tone-like sounds indicate a smaller size, submissiveness and fear. The research, published in journal PLOS ONE, carried out several experiments were both men and women listened to recordings of the opposite speaking a sentence to test vocal attractiveness. The results showed male listeners preferred breathy female voices with high pitch - although not too high - correlating with a petite size, while women preferred to hear low-pitched men that suggested they were larger, stronger specimens. But surprisingly, female listeners also preferred breathy male voices, which signals they prefer the aggressiveness associated with a large body to be somewhat tempered. The study also explains why distinctive voices are also often deemed less appealing. The report concluded: 'These results suggest that what make the voice attractive are mostly properties that enhance characteristics already in the averaged voice of the sex - high pitch ... and breathiness in [the] female voice, and low pitch and long vocal tract in the male voice. 'These findings may therefore explain why averaged voices are more attractive than certain individual voices.'","Most desirable male voice for British women is 'deep, rumbling and breathy'

It was built in a time of innocence, when children were allowed to be children and health and safety officials were nowhere to be seen. These incredible pictures which have been discovered by historians show what is believed to be the world’s first playground swing. It was built 90 years ago and shows children swinging enormous heights off the ground, with no safety surface underneath should they fall. Unique: This picture shows what is believed to be the world's first playground swing at Wicksteed Park in Kettering, Northamptonshire in 1923 . Upside down: This picture alone would no doubt shock health and safety officials up and down the country . Innocent age: The swing has long ropes and no safety surface, which would certainly shock health and safety officials of today . Different: The modern day swings at Wicksteed Park are much lower and have safety surfaces in case the children fall off . The play equipment is believed to have been constructed in 1923 in Wicksteed Park in Kettering, Northamptonshire - the first park of its kind in the UK. Daredevils: With adults watching on, these children are almost upside down on the swings . It was designed by owner Charles Wicksteed, as part of his vision to inspire and encourage play as part of families’ health and well-being. He initially made swings and slides for his park, then went on to manufacture and sell them around the world. The photographs have been released as the park, which combines some of the UK’s oldest theme park rides with the largest free playground in Europe, launches a worldwide appeal to trace the oldest remaining working models of Wicksteed play equipment. Charles Wicksteed said at the time: 'We had a Sunday School treat in the park and put up primitive swings with large poles, tied together at the top with chains. 'Fortunately they were not cleared . away with the other things the day after the treat and I ultimately . found them so popular that instead of pulling them down I added more.' In . his 1928 book, A Plea for Children’s Recreation after School Hours and . after School Age, he proclaimed: 'I have good reason to believe that the . park I have formed has changed the lives for the better, to a greater . or lesser extent of thousands of children. Fun: This play equipment is believed to have been constructed in 1923 in Wicksteed Park. It was the first park of its kind in the UK . Playful: With children standing up and hanging off the edges, today's local councils may be more than a little concerned with this playground. The height children could reach on the swings can be seen by the child in the background . 'I have direct evidence from mothers how whining, pale-faced children, complaining of any food they get, have come back with healthy faces and rosy complexions, ready to eat the house out after a good play in the playground.' The photos, which were discovered as part of a project to archive the history of the park, show girls and boys sitting and even standing on the swings, with people watching from below. In some of the pictures the children are swinging so high it looks as though they are about to turn upside down. Pioneer: This picture shows Charles Wicksteed who built the first children's swings in Kettering . Healthy: The playground was designed by Mr Wicksteed as part of his vision to inspire and encourage play as part of families' health and well-being . New: This image shows the catalogue from 1926 showing the new playground swings . Another photo shows a different type of swing, made from a long plank of wood and capable of squeezing 12 children on. They are seen sitting astride the wooden plank with nothing to stop them slipping off as the swing is pushed into the air. 'These days health and safety legislation would never allow swings like this,' said Oliver Wicksteed, chairman of the Wicksteed Charitable Trust and Charles Wicksteed's great grandson. 'But in the 1920’s if you fell off and tore your trousers you would get a clip round the ear from your dad, not a six-figure pay out. 'People have been making swings for hundreds of years but we believe these are rare photos of the first modern swings to be used in the traditional playground setting that we all know today.' Wicksteed, who was born in 1847 in Leeds, opened Wicksteed Park after the First World War because he wanted to give something back to the town he loved. His park allowed children to play freely and for families to enjoy outdoor life together. The swings were so successful in his playground that he later sold them around the world and they are featured in his play equipment catalogue from January 1926. Modern: Today's swings look somewhat tame compared to those built in the 1920s . The plank swings, which cost £16, are said to be suitable for children under the age of 14, but it states 'we can not guarantee them hooligan proof.' It also adds: 'As there are sometimes a dozen people on at a time, it is built strongly and on good sound mechanical principles throughout.' In a description for a set of six swings the catalogue states: 'By having several sizes, natural selection is encouraged and the bigger boys and girls do not oust the children from the smaller swings and vice versa.' Another swing set is fitted with long dangling trapeze rings and states it provides a 'fine, manly exercise,' and is 'greatly appreciated by youths'. Oliver Wicksteed added: 'We are very proud of Charles Wicksteed and the revolutionary way he changed leisure time forever. 'He helped prompt a healthier lifestyle by providing a wonderful open space and unique play equipment for ordinary, working class people. 'Wicksteed play equipment literally went to the four corners of the earth and we are appealing for people to get in touch, either directly or through Twitter and Facebook to let us know about the Wicksteed equipment they have enjoyed and send us pictures.'","Pictures show children swinging enormous heights off the ground .

Another suggests drugs may be involved, adding: 'It's either completely unrelated or they've all gotten into something.' 'There might be some sort of cover up. Whatever it is, it may be spreading' One of the younger sufferers is seen insisting: 'Seriously, why would we fake this?' The one-hour documentary examines the . various speculated causes of the Tourette's-like tics, as well as the . rising fear that something serious was being covered up. 'There might be some sort of cover up,' one man is heard suggesting. 'Whatever it is, it may be spreading.'

In total 19 patients came forward . with Tourette’s like symptoms, which include . uncontrollable facial and body twitching. The sufferers, some of which are affected to this day, include 14 girls aged between 13 . and 18 and one adult victim, 36-year-old nurse . practitioner Marge Fitzsimmons. The true cause of the illness is still . a mystery, but the documentary explores different possible causes such as infections, . environmental influences, conversion disorder and even Lyme disease. Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich. She has suggested that a chemical . spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls’ school may be the cause. Spasms: 19 teenagers and one adult (pictured) exhibited symptoms of the mystery condition . 'Why would we fake this?' The teenagers are forced to defend themselves as some speculate that attention-seeking is behind the mystery condition . But doctors who have treated or tested . the girls in Le Roy believe they are suffering from conversion . disorder, or the twitching symptoms are possibly related to an . infection. More recently, Facebook and YouTube were being blamed for the mystery illness. Doctors said that symptoms are being . ‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims of the bizarre condition are . uploading videos of themselves onto social networking sites to appeal . for help. They argue that when other people in . the town of LeRoy view the videos, they are unconsciously mimicking what . they see and spreading it around. David Lichter, professor of . neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has treated several of the . patients, told MSNBC: 'It's remarkable to see . how one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts . something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with . known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements. Asking questions: Lori Brownell, 16, posted a video on YouTube showing the Tourette's-like . symptoms . 'This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’ Researchers have also come up with a . string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by . pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or PANS, which is a . kind of OCD linked to strep throat. Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores. Some doctors have also suggested it . could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and . is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another. School scandal: Nineteen LeRoy High School students reported a mysterious outbreak of spasms and seizures . Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of . neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in Buffalo, said: 'When one . has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals . with similar symptoms. 'That's what's going on with these . girls. They are in a segregated small rural town in New York state. They . are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of symptoms takes control.' During an angry meeting with school officials in February 2012, parents asked why the soil around . a natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested . for contamination. 'This could take years! What are you . doing to protect my kid? What are you doing to protect these peoples . kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley. Local hazard: Environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls' school may be the cause . 'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller. Adding to the concern was that the . wells were drilled using the controversial hydraulic fracturing method, . also known as ‘fracking’. Dr Greg Young of the New York State . Department of Health had earlier explained that tests had ruled out . environmental factors as the cause of the disease. He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame.","The town of LeRoy, New York, made headlines early last year when a growing number of teenage girls began developing tics and twitches that closely resembled Tourette’s syndrome .

Two lawyers at the heart of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards should have declared their burgeoning relationship to avoid perceptions of bias, a leading QC said last night. Carine Patry Hoskins, an adviser to Lord Justice Leveson, went on a Greek island holiday with top barrister David Sherborne. But he was representing victims of phone-hacking, including Hugh Grant, while she was contributing to the landmark report on the future of media regulation. The couple later began a relationship but neither told the judge about it and it remained a secret until this week. John Cooper, QC, a leading human rights lawyer, said: ‘I’m not saying they have acted inappropriately but if the situation was pertaining during Leveson it should have been brought to the tribunal’s attention. ‘The perception of bias, even if it is not proven, is considered to be a very serious matter in conventional courts.’ The Bar Council warns barristers it is ‘very unwise’ to start a relationship with opposing counsel during a case because of the risk of clients perceiving ‘a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, and Mr Sherborne, 44, appeared in the High Court hearings into press standards that took place between November 2011 and July last year. Miss Patry Hoskins became an internet sensation after cameras caught her repeatedly looking at Grant during his questioning. In August she and Mr Sherborne – who are now divorcing their spouses – flew to Santorini. But they insist they only discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ and decided against it. Once back in England, Miss Patry Hoskins helped write parts of Lord Justice Leveson’s final report, dealing with the recent relationship between newspapers and politicians. After the report was published in November, Miss Patry Hoskins and  Mr Sherborne began seeing each other. Actor Hugh Grant arrives with David Sherborne to give evidence to the Leveson inquiry .

Thais Portilho-Shrimpton, formerly of Hacked Off who worked with  Mr Sherborne during the inquiry,  said: ‘Given they both had access to information they shouldn’t have been sharing with each other, they perhaps should have told the judge about it. ‘It could have been that Leveson would have thought it was appropriate to replace her.’","Carine Patry Hoskins and Hugh Grant barrister David Sherborne went on Greek holiday .

Arrested: Unemployed town councillor John Larsen's home in Denbigh has been searched by police investigating the series of explosions in North Wales, and has been charged today . A Liberal Democrat councillor arrested over a series of unexplained explosions he had blamed on 'Ali G-style yobs' has appeared in court. Residents in the sleepy Welsh market town of Denbigh had been left terrified by a series of blasts which wrecked cars, broke windows and damaged homes. Today North Wales Police confirmed that John Larsen, 46, was charged with causing an explosion likely to endanger life or damage property. Larsen, who sits on Denbigh Town Council and represents the central ward, appeared at Prestatyn Magistrates’ Court and was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea. James Neary, prosecuting at Prestatyn court, told District Judge Andrew Shaw during a five minute hearing it was 'an extremely serious and unusual charge'. He applied for a remand in custody and said a major police investigation was 'in its infancy.' Defence solicitor Dafydd Roberts said : 'He doesn't accept the allegations against him.' There was no application for bail. Judge Shaw remanded Larsen in custody to appear at Mold crown court next Monday. The district judge said : 'I can't deal with this charge in this court. It needs to be dealt with in the crown court.' Last week officers arrested him and began searching the home he shares with . his art assistant wife, Ffion, 40, and their ten-year-old daughter. There have been 14 home-made devices exploded over the past eight weeks in Denbigh, and forced some residents to move away, while others put their homes up for sale. One couple, John and Shirley Jones, had a lucky escape when ball bearings from a device planted beneath a 4x4 car smashed their window and became lodged in the headboard of their bed. Mrs Jones said: 'It could have been fatal if we'd been in bed. It was horrendous, so frightening. We saw a flash and then heard a boom sound which shook the house.' North Wales Police said the investigation related to 'a series of incidents whereby objects have been ignited'. Inquiry: Police at the scene of one of the explosions from a home-made device in the sleepy market town . Councillor Colin Hughes, who represents the upper ward on the town council, said he was 'absolutely flabbergasted', adding: 'I am shocked. Myself and a number of my colleagues are really rocked to the foundations.' Many assumed that the crude firework-type devices were the work of local yobs and police would soon catch those responsible. Police called in specialist bomb disposal teams and evacuated residents after swooping on the councillor's terraced home. Only last week Mr Larsen had spoken to his local newspaper to denounce the person responsible for the explosions, saying: 'Everyone is jittery, checking their cars. It's driving people round the bend. 'You just don't know when or where it's going to happen next and that's why people are so frightened.' The councillor also spoke at a residents' meeting blaming 'Ali G-style yobs' for the bombs. Fear: Mr Larsen denounced the explosions at a public meeting, blaming Ali G-style yobs . He later posted on his Facebook page: 'Again the yobs have let another one off last night in my back garden or yard. Ffion my wife is fed up to the back teeth with these yobs and is very worried about the house being damaged or set on fire. Someone stop these yobs before someone gets hurt.' The explosions, which all occurred in the early hours, began in March and were focused around a triangle of waste ground near Mr Larsen's home in Denbigh, north Wales. One neighhour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'My partner and I have evacuated our children, aged 20 months and two months, on two nights, taking them to a friend's house round the corner. 'When you have a bomb disposal unit outside your house it's hard not to be concerned.' Fellow town councillor Geraint Lloyd-Williams added: 'Everyone has been really shocked that the police made this arrest. 'I'd be surprised if John was involved, he's not a well man, he walks with a stick after hurting his back a few years ago.' Around 40 people living near Mr Larsen's home were moved to the town hall on Friday evening and on Saturday after the Army bomb squad was called in. Raymond Bartley, Mayor of Denbigh, said the explosions had been 'worrying' and 'extremely traumatic'. Two other men, 23 and 22, have been released on bail.

The disgraced politician appeared contrite during an interview today where he asked New Yorkers to give him a 'second chance', an even clearer signal that he intends to run in the next campaign.

That’s what a powerful new series of public service announcements, funded by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an advocacy group that asks for ‘common-sense’ gun legislation. The PSA examine seemingly harmless banned objects like children’s books, the German candy, and rubber balls – and asks why they are banned in the U.S. while assault weapons are not. Choose one: Nonprofit group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has released a provocative new campaign calling for action . Which is it? This version of 'Little Red Riding Hood' was banned in two California schools because it showed the girl carrying wine in her basket on her way to her grandmother's house . The campaign, called ‘Choose One,’ examine why commonplace things of childhood may be banned while guns and weapons have few restrictions surrounding them. The first of three features two children in a classroom – one holding a Kinder egg, and the other holding an assault rifle. The copy reads: ‘One child is holding something that’s been banned in America to protect them. Guess which one. It continues: ‘We won’t sell Kinder chocolate eggs in the interest of child safety. Why not assault weapons.’ However, AdLand notes that the ban on Kinder eggs was lifted last month. The Kinder Surprise egg, along with other chocolates containing plastic toys inside, such as Nestlé’s Wonderball, had previously been banned in the U.S. because of a possible choking hazard. You're out: Dodgeball was banned at a New Hampshire school, though not across the country like the ad suggests . The next ad shows two young girls in a school library, one holding a semi-automatic rifle and the other, the children’s story ‘Little Red Riding Hood.’ The particular version of the fairy tale, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman, was banned in two California school districts because the protagonist, Little Red, was carrying wine in her basket of gifts to her grandmother. The third and final ad in the series shows two boys in a school gymnasium. The copy reads: ‘We ban the game dodgeball because it’s viewed as being too violent. Why not ban assault weapons?’ The game was actually banned at a school in Windham, New Hampshire, though the ban can hardly be considered nation-wide. Two more PSAs will be launched later this weeks, according to a news release. Mad moms: Women of the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America push the strollers with their children pass the U.S. Capitol today as they attempt to meet with elected officials and demand action on common-sense gun laws . Sad beginnings: The organization was founded by a mother of five who was enraged after 20 children were gunned down at Sandy Hook last December . No more names: Two days ago, on the sixth anniversary of the Virginia Tech shooting, Colin Goddard, who was shot four times, leads a moment of silence for the 32 victims, along with the '3,300 lives lost to gun violence since the Newtown shooting,' outside the Capitol . As AdLand notes, temporary or small-scale choice by a single group or organization does not equate to a federally-mandated ban. The campaign was produced by the GREY Agency in Toronto. Neither the National Rifle Association nor Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment on the adverts. Watts, 42, founded the organization following the December 14 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Shame: The vote was overturned 54 to 46 . The not-for-profit organization now has more than 75 local chapters across the country and tens of thousands of members. Among their goals, the organization’s purpose falls in-line with the goals of President Obama, including banning ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds and requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Yesterday, the Senate voted down a bill that would allow for tougher background checks on semi-automatic weapons, a major victory for gun lobbyists and a sting for parents and those hoping for tighter gun control. President Obama was joined by families of Sandy Hook victims, as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded at a mass shooting in Tucson in 2011. Outrage: President Obama, center, and US Vice President Joe Biden, second left, listen to remarks from Mark Barden, left, whose child was murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary last night after the Senate failed to pass the gun control bill . For shame: Former Democratic Representative from Arizona Gabby Giffords, front left, was present after the bill was shut down and wrote a scathing op-ed in the New York Times today shaming Congress . In a powerful New York Times op-ed piece published today, former Rep. Giffords wrote of the cowardice of some senators who she said allowed themselves to be bullied by special interest groups like the NRA. ‘Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. 'Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died,’ she writes. ‘These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.’ Members from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Thursday held a ‘Stroller Jam’ in front of the Capitol Building in Washington and read the names of each of the 3,300 Americans who have been killed by gun violence since Newtown. Just before noon, the mothers wheeled their children in strollers to the Senate Building to speak with elected officials about the failed gun control bill.","New set of PSAs called 'Choose One' shows two children in each ad - one holding a 'banned' item, and the other, an assault weapon .

Human rights law will be extended to include the right to claim benefits and enjoy a comfortable standard of living courtesy of the taxpayer under plans unveiled last night. A Government panel of experts is considering whether Labour’s Human Rights Act – which is already hugely controversial – should be extended to include so-called ‘socio-economic rights’. This would allow the jobless to take the Government to court if ministers did not provide a minimum standard of living. Earlier this week, a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggested a family of four needed an income of almost £37,000 to have a satisfactory lifestyle. Farce: Human rights law will be extended to include the right to enjoy a comfortable standard of living courtesy of the taxpayer (picture posed by models) The ‘Commission on a Bill of Rights’ was set up by David Cameron to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws. Originally, the Prime Minister had pledged to scrap Labour’s Act and replace it with a UK Bill of Rights, which would stop the system being abused by criminals and those who refuse to work. But, after being forced into a coalition with the Liberal Democrats he had to downgrade his pledge. Instead, he established the commission to decide the best way forward. Yesterday, despite deliberating for 15 months, the panel said it had not decided whether to recommend any change to the Act. But it said that, if it did decide to opt for a Bill of Rights, it wanted to consider suggestions from the public and pro-human rights groups on whether to add on yet more ‘human rights’ which must be respected by Parliament and the courts. Frustration: The Prime Minister set up the commission to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws . Under a section headed ‘Additional Rights?’, it suggests ‘a right to equality’; a ‘right to administrative justice’, which would build on the existing ‘right to a fair trial’; ‘rights for victims’; ‘children’s rights’; ‘socio-economic rights’; and ‘environmental rights’. The last two are likely to be the most contentious. Under ‘socio-economic rights’, it says: ‘Such rights, which are found in a number of bills of rights in other countries, can include rights to adequate healthcare and housing, a right to education, a right to a minimum standard of living, and a range of other social security entitlements.’ On benefits, the panel suggest copying wording from the South African Constitution. This promises a right to ‘social security, including, if they are unable to support themselves and their dependants, appropriate social assistance’. On the environment, the panel suggests that everyone should have the right to live in a world that ‘is not harmful to their health or well-being’ where there is ‘secure ecologically sustainable development and the use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development’. Critics fear this could lead to all building projects being automatically challenged under human rights law – creating a boon for lawyers but stifling economic growth. MPs said they were hugely disappointed with the report, which also suggests the courts having the power to strike down laws made by . Parliament. Currently, judges can rule that a law is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, but must leave it to the politicians to decide what to do next. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The Commission risks being hijacked by the human rights lobby. It is supposed to be looking at how to scale back the rights inflation and compensation culture that has undermined law enforcement, democratic accountability and personal responsibility. Compensation culture: MP Dominic Rabb said the commission risked being hijacked by the human rights lobby . ‘Instead, it has churned out proposals for even more human rights. That would give judges enormous power to set social policy without proper democratic accountability, and cost the taxpayer a fortune.’ Mr Cameron voiced his frustration in May at slow progress on his plans to scrap the Human Rights Act. He blamed delays on the compromises made necessary by being in a coalition, but said he remained determined to press ahead with the change. Sir Leigh Lewis – chairman of the panel, which will make its final recommendations later this year – said: ‘I am pleased that the Commission has published this second Consultation Paper. We want to hear from as many individuals and interested parties as possible.’ A spokesman for the Commission on a Bill of Rights said: 'We have not taken a decision on whether we need a UK Bill of Rights, or what it should contain. 'This consultation is merely seeking further public opinion on the issue and reflects the views we received following the discussion paper we published last year. It does not in any way pre-empt our views or recommendations, which we will provide to the Government for their consideration at the end of the year.'","Experts are considering whether Labour's Human Rights Act should include socio-economic rights .

'Booze buses' that treat drunken revellers by the roadside are being rolled out across the country under NHS plans to cope with the UK's summer of major events. Doctors, the ambulance service and the police are preparing for a potential silly season, due to start with the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations next weekend. The Jubilee is quickly followed by Euro 2012 and then the Olympics and Para Olympics starting in August. All aboard the booze bus: The NHS are rolling out the mobile units across the country in preparation for a summer of major events . Drunk tank: Medics and the police are preparing for a potential silly season, due to start with the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations next weekend . Extra staff will be on duty in A&E departments and in the mobile units stationed near events. St Thomas's hospital, opposite the Houses of Parliament, will be on 'semi internal major incident' alert from Monday, a protocol usually reserved for New Year's Eve. Its close proximity to the West End sees it dealing with a high number of intoxicated people on a regular basis. Dr Beth Christian, an A&E consultant at St Thomas's told The Guardian: 'We increase our staffing levels in A&E, have more nurses working on the wards, and clear our emergency admission beds in preparation. 'Sometimes we open up outpatients and put mattresses down on the floor.' Further south in Portsmouth, paramedics will hand out flip-flops to drunk women who can no longer totter in their high heels. Celebrations: Extra staff will be on duty in A&E departments and in the mobile units stationed near Jubilee events (file picture) A treatment unit, usually run on Friday and Saturday nights by the Project Safe Space multi-agency hub will also be in operation. Staff can treat minor injuries and provide five mattresses for people to sober up on. Dr Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, warned the summer's big events would put 'added pressure' on NHS emergency services which are already stretched. He said: 'The resilience of the system is being tested on a daily basis. The events this summer are added pressure because there will be more people in the country and there will be increased numbers of alcohol cases for departments to deal with. 'Initiatives that safely care for patients suffering from uncomplicated mild intoxication in settings other than the emergency department are helpful.' Worry: Newly appointed England manager Roy Hodgson may be hoping for a win in Euro 2012 but the ambulance service are worried about an increase in drunken revellers during the games . Meanwhile, Brian Hayes, a senior paramedic with the London Ambulance Service, highlighted Euro 2012 as a particular cause for concern. The late afternoon and evening England games in Ukraine and Poland will make it easy for fans to drink while watching, he added. Mr Hayes' service will be deploying its 'booze bus', an ambulance that can ferry up to five intoxicated revellers at a time to a recovery centre in central London. The unit opened for Christmas 2011 and in February began opening on Friday and Saturday nights. Between February and April it treated 259 people. Mr Hayes said the service is 'cost effective' because it stops people from clogging up busy A&E departments. The capital's ambulances dealt with 66,254 alcohol-related incidents in 2011-12; each callout costs the NHS £225. Count down: After the football comes two months of further celebrations with the Olympics and Para Olympics . Alcohol abuse costs the service millions of pounds each year. In a recent audit St Thomas's estimated that for 12 months from late 2010 it dealt with 5,500 alcohol related A&E visits at a cost of between £3m and £4.3m. Dr Christian warned that figure 'is the tip of the iceberg' due to large under reporting of incidents. She added that A&E was 'not set up to be a drunk tank', but 10 emergency beds are usually filled by drunk people. 'This is a very costly way to manage patients,' she said. 'An additional 30-40 patients for an A&E night shift can mean a department that is coping becomes a department that is overwhelmed. The NHS can't afford a £1,000 for every big night.'","NHS plans will begin on Monday ahead of the Queen diamond jubilee celebrations next weekend .

Nicky Lovell pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of 'perfect couple' Ross and Clare Simons in the accident near Bristol three months ago, and faces up to 14 years in prison when he is sentenced next month. His girlfriend Louise Cox, who owns the car he was driving at the time of the crash, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Guilty: Nicky Lovell, left, and Louise Cox, right, have admitted offences connected to a fatal accident in January . Killed: Ross and Clare Simons were knocked off their tandem bicycle in the horrific accident in Bristol . Mr Simons, 34, and his 30-year-old wife were mourned by hundreds of friends who described them as 'two peas in a pod' after their untimely death. The couple had been married for 18 months and were planning to start IVF treatment at the time of their death in Hanham on January 27. They had recently bought the tandem, and were making one of their first trips on it as they cycled to relatives nearby. Lovell, 38, of Oldland Common in Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one of driving while disqualified. Cox, 35, who owns the Citroen Picasso involved in the crash, admitted lying to police when they asked who had been driving her car after Lovell fled the scene. Arrival: Cox outside Bristol Crown Court today, supported by friends before she made her guilty plea . Killer: Lovell, pictured in a sketch from an earlier court appearance, admitted death by dangerous driving . Judge Neil Ford QC adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared for Cox. He told her: 'The fact I am adjourning the case is no indication of the type of sentence you will receive.' Cox was released on police bail, but Lovell has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing. Lovell, . wearing glasses and a baggy T-shirt in court, spoke only to confirm his . name and enter three guilty pleas during the ten-minute hearing. He pleaded guilty to causing the . deaths of Mr and Mrs Simons by driving dangerously on January 27 this . year, and also admitted driving while disqualified on the same date. Cox . spoke only to plead guilty to a charge of perverting the course of . justice on January 27 by giving the police a false name and description . when asked to identify the driver of her vehicle after the collision. The . judge adjourned the case until May 22 and asked for a bigger court room . to accommodate friends and family of Mr and Mrs Simons, as well as . those of the defendants.

Speaking . outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Williams of Avon and . Somerset Police said she hoped the guilty verdicts would provide 'some . comfort' to Mr and Mrs Simons' families. The . officer said: 'On Sunday January 27 of this year, Clare and Ross Simons . needlessly lost their lives following a fatal collision.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 shook central southern Mexico on Tuesday, sending terrified workers and residents running into the streets and damaging an estimated 800 homes. The worst hit area was the town of Iguala, which was close to the epicenter of the quake. Remarkably, there were no reported fatalities and only 9 serious injuries in spite of the fact that the country was rocked by 18 aftershocks in the hours following the massive earthquake. The southern border city of Oaxaca . was significantly closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, and Malia . Obama was staying in the town with a dozen other American students on a . school trip. Scroll down for video . Ruins: Residents stand amid a damaged house in Ometepec after the 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck southwest Mexico, causing residents in the capital several hundred miles away to rush out onto the streets . Rescue workers: A patient in a wheelchair is attended to by a nurse at a makeshift emergency room after being evacuated from a hospital damaged by the disaster . Fleeing danger: Hundreds pour onto the streets after the earthquake hit land . Safe: Malia, seen here with her mother Michelle Obama, is on a school trip in Oaxaca, Mexico which is near the epicenter of Tuesday's earthquake . The president's eldest daughter is safe and out of harm's way, according to a statement from the White House. MailOnline, along with a number of publications, was aware of Malia's trip to Mexico before the earthquake hit, but chose not to publicize it at the request of the White House. Following Tuesday's earthquake, the White House released a statement saying that she 'is safe and was never in danger.' Though they typically request that the privacy of the teenage girl is protected when she is not with her parents or there is no inherent news interest, they decided to break their privacy streak to reassure that the first daughter is fine after the earthquake. Disaster zone: Debris is seen inside a home after a wall collapsed during an earthquake in Mexico City on Tuesday . What remains: A man chips away at the remnants of a wall at his house that was damaged by an earthquake on Tuesday in Ometepec in the Mexican state of Guerrero on Tuesday . Little left: A home was turned to rubble in Ometepec in the Mexican state of Guerrero . The brave: Workers put out a fire after evacuating buildings . Coping: Patients evacuated from a damaged hospital wait for care in a makeshift ER . Medical emergency: Patients evacuated from the hospital lie in beds for rows as nurses attend to them in the outdoors . In more populated areas, like nearby . Oaxaca and Mexico City which is further away, terrified workers fled the . swaying buildings as plaster crashed to the pavement and windows broke. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 'strong, long' tremors reached 7.4 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the quake was 15 miles (25km) east of Ometepec in Guerrero state, near the Pacific . Coast resort of Acapulco. Earthquakes happen frequently in Mexico, and the country has registered 15 above a 7-magnitude since 1973. Help: Paramedics tend to a woman who sustained some kind of injury from the noon 7.4-magnitude earthquake . Helpless: Workers and residents gather at the Angel de la Independencia square after evacuating buildings during the earthquake . Panicked: A terrified woman falls to her knees as office workers run into the streets . Part of the reason why Tuesday's earthquake did not prove more disasterous is because each of the weak buildings that collapsed in the prior 15 earthquakes were rebuilt stronger. Panicked residents screamed in fear as they were evacuated from buildings across the city just after midday. Damage: The quake caused a portion of a bridge to collapse on top of this bus but no word yet if there were any injuries . Lucky: Miraculously, the passengers and driver of the bus that was damaged by the bridge escaped alive . Responding to the scene: Firefighters worked to move the bridge debris . One . Mexico City resident, Imogen Dashwood, told MailOnline: ‘It was very . scary, I was in my apartment and I didn’t know if it was best to try and . run down the stairs to get outside or hide under the table. ‘In . the end I hid under the table but it was probably not the smartest . thing to do as it seems all the offices around here were evacuated to . outside, there are still a lot of people outside now,' the 30-year-old . said. ‘My apartment building in Polanco was . shaking and swaying for about five minutes and kept moving even after . the earthquake had stopped.' Location: The 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Ometepec at 12.02pm local time . Injuries: This woman was being treated by Red Cross representatives following the repercussions felt in Mexico City . Aghast: Shocked city dwellers stared in horror in the roads and traffic ground to a halt in the capital . Telephone lines went down and traffic . ground to halt in the capital just moments after the quake, but there is . still mass confusion throughout the city. Though the magnitude of the earthquake- 7.4 according to the U.S. Geological Survey- was extremely high, there was relatively little severe damage and no known fatalities. One of the main reasons why is that the earthquake struck very deep into the ground. It hit 12.4 miles (20 km) below the surface, which helped to mute the tremor before it got to ground and reverberated among buildings. It also helped that the epicenter was far enough away from major cities. Because it was closest to Oaxaca (the country's 10th biggest state by population) the damage was lessened due to a lack of closely-knit buildings. By comparison, the deadly earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010 was registered as 7.0 on the Richter scale, but was much nearer the capital city and only 8.1 miles (13 km) below ground. ‘The phone lines are now down but the internet seems to still be working,’ Ms Dashwood told MailOnline. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned of the possibility of some local tsunami effects, although it said the inland earthquake would not generate a destructive widespread tsunami. 'I swear I never felt one so strong, I . thought the building was going to collapse,' said Sebastian Herrera, 42, . a businessman from a neighbourhood hit hard in Mexico's devastating . 1985 earthquake, which killed thousands. Groups of women hugged and cried at Mexico City's Angel of Independence monument, where hundreds of people evacuated from office buildings said they never had felt such a strong earthquake. Others typed ferociously on their Blackberries. Samantha Rodriguez, a 37-year old . environmental consultant, was evacuated from the 11th floor on the Angel . Tower office building. 'I thought it was going to pass rapidly but the walls began to thunder and we decided to get out,' she said. Rosa Maria Lopez Velazquez, 62, nearly passed out as she stood outside a mall in the capital. 'I have problems with pressure,' she said. 'I felt I was going to faint.' Children stood terrified as the earthquake hit right near lunchtime, at 12.02 pm local time . Superficial: In spite of the strength of the quake, most of the damage appears to be relatively insignificant . Transport chaos: A driver stands by his car looking up at battered buildings and trying to use his mobile phone network . 'It was very strong, but we didn't see anything fall,' said Irma Ortiz, who runs a guesthouse in Oaxaca, near Guerrero. She said their telephones were down and that the quake had shaken the hotel from side to side. The earthquake began six miles (10km) underground,  and was followed by a 4.8-magnitude aftershock, according to Mexico's national seismological agency. Mexico City's airport was closed for a short time but there was no damage to runways and operations were returning to normal. 'Strong, long tremors': A man walks over debris that was hurled from a building in Mexico City during the quake . Tourist destination: Acapulco in Guerrero state of Mexico, near to where the earthquake first struck . Tremors were felt as far away as Guatemala City.

A mother-of-eight, 30, died suddenly from a cardiac arrest because she drank up to 18 pints of Coke every day for years, a coroner has ruled. Natasha Harris died on February 25, 2010, after her partner Christopher Hodgkinson found her seated on the . toilet, slumped against the wall and gasping for air at their home in Invercargill on New Zealand's south island. An inquest last year revealed that she would drink at least four 2.5litre bottles of the fizzy drink each day, consuming more than twice the recommended daily . caffeine consumption and more than 11 times the recommended sugar . intake. New Zealand coroner David Crerar said today that Ms . Harris would not have died if it wasn’t for her dependence on Coke. 'I . found that, when all of the available evidence is considered, were it . not for the consumption of very large quantities of Coke by Natasha . Harris, it is unlikely that she would have died when she died and how . she died,' reported the Bussleton-Dunsborough Mail. The coroner's report revealed Ms Harris suffered from a myriad of medical conditions, including a racing heart and 'absent teeth', which her family say was caused from Coke consumption. Natasha Marie Harris was said to go 'crazy' if she ran out of the fizzy drink which she guzzled by the bottle. Mr Hodgkinson said she had been unwell leading up to her death and had no energy, but the idea Coca-Cola caused the problem had never crossed their minds. Mr Hodgkinson told the court that she had been unwell up to a year before her death, including vomiting six times a week, but they believed it was caused by the stress of looking after her eight children and gynecological problems. 'She drank at least 10 litres a day,' he said. 'As a family we wouldbuy four 2.5 litres a day, the maximum on special. 'The Coke would be for Natasha to consume over the course of the day. 'The first thing she would do in the morning was have a drink of Coke andthe last thing she would do in the day was have a drink of Coke by her bed.' Police who investigated the death, which happened on February 25, 2010, estimated she consumed, on average, seven litres a day. A spokesman for Coca-Cola said: 'We are disappointed that the Coroner . has chosen to focus on the combination of Ms Harris' excessive . consumption of Coca-Cola, together with other health and lifestyle . factors, as the probable cause of her death' Her partner said she was addicted to Coke and without it she would get moody, irritable and be low . 'I didn't ever think about the Coke. I never considered it would do any harm to a person. It's just a soft drink, just like drinking water. I didn't think a drink's going to kill you,' he said. She had been drinking a lot of Coca-Cola over the past seven or eight years,' he said. Vivien Hodgkinson, Mr Hodgkinson's mother, said she would go 'crazy' if she ran out of the drink. Ms Harris is estimated to have drunk up to 50,000 pints of Coca-Cola before she died . An autopsy showed Miss Harris had a diseased liver.Medical evidence stated that the main finding of death was from a cardiac arrhythmia. Dr Dan Mornin told the court Miss Harris probably had severe hypokalemia, a lack of potassium in the blood, relating to excessive consumption of soft-drink. He said although it was difficult to confirm this from postmortem tests, it was consistent with her symptoms of tiredness and lack of strength and other cases of heavy soft-drink consumers. He added it was likely the vomiting was due to too much caffeine, medically known as caffeine toxicity. Coca-Cola confirmed it had hired a security firm to shadow its staff, after Mr Hodgkinson allegedly made death threats against the company before she died. He rejected claims he had made the threats, but said he held the company responsible for Harris' death. Coca-Cola's New Zealand managing director George Adams said at the time of her death that Hodgkinson's claims were 'patently untrue'. Coca Cola's latest statement said: 'The Coroner acknowledged . that he could not be certain what caused Ms Harris' heart attack. 'Therefore we are disappointed that the Coroner has chosen to focus on . the combination of Ms Harris’ excessive consumption of Coca-Cola, . together with other health and lifestyle factors, as the probable cause . of her death. 'This is contrary to the evidence that showed the experts . could not agree on the most likely cause'.","Natasha Harris drank an estimated 50,000 pints of the fizzy drink .

Instead of celebrating his 20th birthday, the young star will go under the surgeon's knife in Los Angeles on Thursday.

The Wanted's Max George, Nathan Sykes, Tom Parker, Jay McGuiness and Siva Kaneswaran seen filming their new video in Beverly Hills last week . Vocal Cord Haemorrhage results when one of the blood vessels on the surface of the vocal cord ruptures and the soft tissues of the vocal cord fill with blood. It is considered a vocal emergency and is treated with absolute voice rest until the haemorrhage resolves.If left untreated the condition may result in scarring of the vocal folds, which is a condition that is much harder to treat and has permanent effects on voice quality. In cases where a haemorrhage produces a polyp - or blood blister - on the vocal cords that doesn’t go away, the polyp can be removed with microlaryngoscopic surgery. Doctors use a laryngoscope to see the vocal cords, and microscopic instruments are inserted through the mouth. No incisions are made in the skin, and general anesthesia is required for the one-hour procedure.Source: American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery .

The Health Secretary launched his scathing attack on the Royal College of Nursing after it criticised his plans to improve compassion in the NHS. Mr Hunt said the RCN, which attacked a move to make all student nurses spend a year doing menial tasks, had been criticised for being more concerned about their members than patients. He told the RCN to be ‘very careful’ and pointed out that a damning report into Mid Staffs – where up to 1,200 patients died from neglect – said the union had failed to listen to nurses’ warnings of unnecessary suffering. The Francis Report said the RCN had been ‘ineffective’ because it had defended senior ‘bullying’ nurses responsible for appalling care. Attacking Mr Hunt’s proposals for student nurses to work on the wards before starting their degrees, RCN president Andrea Spyropoulos said the ‘stupid’ idea risked taking the profession ‘back a hundred years’. But Mr Hunt said: ‘The Royal College of Nursing have got to be very, very careful. They missed what happened at Mid Staffs. The Francis Report levelled some very serious criticisms. It said that they basically allowed their trade union responsibilities to trump their responsibilities as a royal college to raise professional standards. ‘Before they start criticising the Government for accepting recommendations that are going to improve compassionate care throughout the NHS, they need to answer those very, very serious criticisms.’ The Government wants student nurses to spend a year as healthcare assistants, for washing and feeding elderly patients and assisting them to the toilet. But so far there are no details on how hospitals will be able to supervise them. Yesterday the Prime Minister promised to push ahead with the plans, saying they were ‘absolutely vital’. He . said: ‘It’s going to be controversial, but in the end the sort of . health service we want is not just about making sure we’ve got the facts . and the figures and the money and everything else spent well, it’s... so when our elderly relatives go in there, we know they’re going to get a . really good quality of care.’ At fault: The Royal College of Nursing, whose members took part in the protest against cuts at Staffordshire hospital last week, is partly to blame for the Mid Staffs scandal . The Francis Report warned that the RCN had ‘done little’ to act. One whistleblower, Helene Donnelly, said she tried to raise concerns about the A&E unit only to find the union was defending two senior nurses she said were bullies. She became too afraid to walk to her car after a shift in case she was attacked by colleagues. Ed Miliband’s new health adviser Sir John Oldham came under attack last night after it emerged he has previously dismissed those angry at the Mid Staffs scandal as a ‘lynch mob’. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘Labour is still in denial over its responsibility for Mid Staffs, and this appointment shows they have learned nothing from the tragedy. They have not accepted that their tick-box culture is responsible for the events.’ At the height of the scandal in 2008, RCN general secretary Peter Carter visited Stafford Hospital and praised nursing care as being of ‘exceptionally high standard’. Mr Carter admitted yesterday there were ‘failings on our part’ but said the RCN hadn’t ‘missed Mid Staffs’ adding: ‘We’re not a regulator.’ The Francis Report warned that the scandal could be repeated. Yesterday a survey of more than 8,000 nurses by the RCN found that two-thirds believe neglect could happen at their own hospital. One in four is too scared to raise concerns about patient safety and a further one in four said when they had tried to raise concerns their bosses had done nothing. Forty-six per cent had tried to raise concerns about patient safety in the past six months. Of these, 44 per cent said fears of ‘victimisation’ or ‘reprisal’ would make them think twice about whistleblowing in future. Medical neglect: Ronald Tatchell . A doctor dismissed a grandfather as a ‘drama king’ hours before he died in agony, an inquest heard yesterday. Ronald Tatchell, 66, was recovering after a back operation when his abdomen became swollen and tender. Although Mr Tatchell was in extreme pain, staff failed to diagnose that he was suffering from internal bleeding and he was wrongly given blood thinners. The coroner ruled that father-of-two Mr Tatchell, a retired bailiff, died of medical neglect and a surgeon who reviewed his treatment said he had been the victim of a ‘whole system failure’ by staff at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff. Health chiefs apologised to his family yesterday and promised an investigation. The inquest heard that Mr Tatchell, of Bridgend, South Wales, had been recovering well last October when his condition suddenly deteriorated. Staff nurse Rhian Grapes told the coroner Mr Tatchell couldn’t move his legs and ‘felt something pop’. ‘I told the senior house officer who referred to him as being a drama king,’ she said. Senior house officer Dr Olamide Eso denied the claim. She said. ‘That’s just not how I would speak about my patients.’ The inquest heard that ward manager Sally Lewis became so concerned she went over Dr Eso’s head. He was given blood, but died from shock as a result of the haemorrhage. Surgeon Declan O’Doherty, who carried out a review of the treatment, told the hearing: ‘The whole thing was just dysfunctional. There’s been effectively a whole system failure.’ Cardiff assistant deputy coroner Christopher Woolley ruled that Mr Tatchell died as a result of neglect by hospital staff.","Health Secretary says Royal College of Nursing partly to blame for Mid Staffs .

Writing about the incident on the National Review’s website, Williamson said he recommended the show but thought the audience ‘horrible - talking, using their phones.’ Theater critic Kevin Williamson is unrepentant after he quite literally took the law into his own hands and smashed the cellphone of another patron who refused to stop using it during a performance on Wednesday night . ‘It was bad enough that I seriously considered leaving during the intermission, something I’ve not done before,’ he wrote. The audience at the performance were sitting in groups at small tables and each table was explicitly told that photography and cell phone use was strictly prohibited during the performance. According to Williamson the people seated around him failed to comply with this simple request. ‘The main offenders were two parties of women of a certain age, the sad sort with too much makeup and too-high heels, and insufficient attention span for following a two-hour musical,' he wrote. 'But my date spoke with the theater management during the intermission, and they apologetically assured us that the situation would be remedied.’ Unfortunately the situation didn’t improve after the interval and so Williamson asked the woman sitting to his right to refrain from using her phone to access the internet.

The original 1960s Star Trek TV series is widely credited as reflecting the progressive attitudes of that decade, but a recently unearthed writers' guide has revealed the program wasn't above a bit of casual sexism too as it went in search of all important ratings. The 31-page writers’ guide for the original series offers up a fascinating insight into how early episodes of the iconic series were crafted. The guide, written in 1967, was written to explain creator Gene Roddenberry's vision to TV writers working on prospective scripts for the show, which was then entering its second season. A 31-page writers' guide for the original Star Trek series offers a fascinating insight into how early episodes of the iconic series were crafted . Writers were advised to think of Kirk as 'a space-age Horatio Hornblower, constantly on trial with himself, a strong, complex personality' The guide features revealing insights about the show's key characters and back story to help writers nail the tone and content of a typical episode, reveals Slate.com. For the show's main character Captain Kirk (William Shatner) writers were advised to think of him as ‘a space-age Horatio Hornblower, constantly on trial with himself, a strong, complex personality.’ In a section entitled 'The Crew' writers are told to remember that the crew of the USS Enterprise are 'international in origin, completely multiracial.' The show has been rightly recognized for how progressive it was in representing people of all colors. The guide reveals the casual sexism of the original series in which the role of yeoman must be 'played by a succession of young actresses, always lovely' The writer's guide requests that the role of 'Yeoman' should always be 'played a succession of young actresses, always lovely' Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) was the first African-American woman to hold such an important role in an American television series and when she locked lips with Kirk in one episode it was the first interracial kiss broadcast on network TV. But despite the show's best intentions, some casual sexism was never too far from the screen. Prospective writer were told to always include a 'yeoman' character to be 'played by a succession of young actresses, always lovely.' 'One such character has been well established in the first year, ""YEOMAN JANICE RAND"", played by the lovely Grace Lee Whitney. Whether Yeoman Rand or a new character provided by the writer, this female Yeoman serves Kirk as his combination Executive Secretary-Valet-Military Aide,' says the guide. Progressive: Star Trek famously featured the first interracial kiss ever on American TV between Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) and Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) The show has been rightly recognized for how progressive it was in representing people of all colors . The Yeoman also got to carry a Tricorder, a device which was described as 'the size of a small handbag.' The guide also includes hilarious details such as reminding writers that the crew’s uniforms don’t have pockets, 'when equipment is needed, it is attached to special belts.' Writer are also encouraged to avoid creating planets that might require our heros to don space suits, 'we generally restricted out missions to ""Class M"" planets (approximating Earth conditions).' The notes also reveal how creator Gene Roddenberry was keen to avoid the pitfalls of other space-related shows up to that point by being as fast-paced and action-packed as possible. Low ratings meant Star Trek was canceled in 1969 but TV repeats created a cult classic which has gone on to spawn a major franchise including 12 movies . The guide also includes hilarious details such as reminding writers that the crew's uniforms don't have pockets, 'when equipment is needed, it is attached to special belts' Writers were reminded to 'build your episode on an action-adventure frame-work. We must reach out, hold and entertain a mass audience of some 20,000,000 people or we simply won't say on the air.' In the end low ratings did for the series and it was cancelled after three seasons and 79 episodes in 1969. Thanks to repeated episodes throughout the 70s and 80s, the show famously became a cult classic. It eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, and other products leading up to the second film in the J.J. Abrams reboot 'Star Trek Into Darkness', which hits cinemas this week.

George Osborne is facing a Cabinet revolt over plans to impose tolls on Britain's roads. Senior ministers regard the plans - which the Chancellor wants included in a coalition relaunch document in January - as 'a new pasty tax' that will undermine Tory chances of winning the next election. Ministers and officials have privately voiced concerns that the proposals cannot be made to work and would lead to 'electoral suicide'. The Chancellor's plans could put him at odds with the Prime Minister . The Tories spent years denouncing Labour for waging a 'war on motorists' but Mr Osborne believes getting foreign investors to build new roads and pay for them with tolls will kickstart growth. But his calls for road tolls to be included in January's midterm review are causing widespread irritation among his ministerial colleagues. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has concerns about selling a road tax plan to the public. Allies say he sees the advantages of putting investment on a firm footing but one added: 'He can see the political challenges.' Senior ministers like Michael Gove, Philip Hammond and Theresa May are understood to be concerned that a road toll scheme would upset Middle Britain. One ministerial aide told the Mail: 'This is nuts. 'We slagged off Labour for years for taxing motorists off the roads and now we seem to want to do the same. 'This just doesn't make sense. The problem with the pasty tax and the caravan tax and all that was that the Treasury put revenue-raising before common sense politics. We shouldn't go there again.' The plans could put the Chancellor at odds with Prime Minister David Cameron, who is concerned that slapping tolls on motorways would drive traffic onto minor roads in the countryside. A second senior government source said: 'Cameron only wants it if there are no losers and it's hard to see how you can get to that point. People are concerned about it across the board - ministers, Treasury officials, the lot.' Plans to put tolls on certain lanes - branded Lexus lanes because they would create a two-tier system have already been dismissed as reinforcing the notion that the Tories treat wealthy voters differently from those struggling to make ends meet. Others are concerned that a charging scheme dependent on every driver having every trip they every make recorded on CCTV cameras would lead to claims of a surveillance state. 'I can imagine the fuss people would make about snoopers,' said one source. A Liberal Democrat official said that while the junior coalition partner was not opposed to the plans there is scepticism that a solution can be found. The coalition Mid Term Review is expected to include an intention to examine road pricing but no concrete proposal.","Senior ministers say tax will spell 'electoral suicide' for Tories .

As a young nurse Nina Cordelli has already helped save lives, but nothing that could have prepared her for meeting the women she saved by donating her bone marrow. The surprise – and very emotional meeting - between donor Cordelli and grateful recipient Cathy Nadaud occurred at the Jewish Hospital’s annual Partners in Hope Reunion in Mason, Ohio on May 10. Cordelli joined the National Bone Marrow Donor registry in 2011 when she helped coordinate a drive while in nursing school. Donor Nina Cordelli, left, had an emotional face-to-face meeting earlier this month with Cathy Nadaud, the woman whose life she saved after donating bone marrow . ‘The statistic they gave me was that there was a less than one percent chance I would ever be matched with anybody who needed a transplant,’ said Cordelli, now 23, while being interviewed on stage at the event. But only eight months later, she was discovered to be a near-perfect match for 60-year-old Springdale grandmother and teacher Nadaud, reports Cincinnatti.com. She had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and was told that a bone marrow transplant was her only chance for survival. As Cordelli spoke about her experience, Nadaud sat in the audience and slowly realized that the composed young woman on stage was her savior. By the time Cordelli had finished talking, Nadaud was already making her way to the stage for an emotional meeting with the woman of whom she owed so much. The two women embraced, tears welling up in their eyes and Nadaud told Cordelli that she wasn’t what she had envisioned from their letters.

Applicants must be between 18 and 60, . willing to donate to any patient in need and meet health guidelines. Registration, which is free, involves completing a health history form . and giving a swab of cheek cells. ‘I owe her everything,’ said a tearful Nadaud. ‘I owe her my life, and what more can you owe somebody than your life?’ Naudaud also paid tribute to Cordelli’s thoughtfulness to volunteer at such a young age. Nadaud jokes that at 21 she had been more concerned about going out to bars than helping others in need. ‘You are an angel,’ she said. For Nadaud, Cordelli was her last chance of a cure. She had been diagnosed with leukemia in 2008. Then two weeks before she was due to have surgery her initial transplant fell through and she was forced to undergo four rounds of chemotherapy. By May 2009 she was in remission and then two years later she celebrated a cancer-free milestone, but not long afterwards was told that it had returned. That’s when the registry turned up Cordelli, now a nurse at a Pittsburgh hospital. Just before Thanksgiving 2011, Cordelli underwent a two-hour procedure in which doctors drilled four holes into her hip area and punctured the bone, harvesting a liter of bone marrow. A day later, the bag containing Cordelli’s cells were infused into Nadaud, who prayed the last-chance procedure would work. ‘My daughter-in-law was pregnant with my third grandbaby and I thought, “I want to see that baby,”’ she said. The surprise - and very emotional meeting - between donor Nina Cordelli and grateful recipient Cathy Nadaud occurred at the Jewish Hospital's annual Partners in Hope Reunion in Mason, Ohio on May 10 . Nadaud and Cordelli couldn’t meet until at least a year following the transplant – standard procedure for medical donations. At first they corresponded via anonymous letters, calling each other ‘donor’ and ‘recipient.’ One of Nadaud's letter read: 'Dear donor: Words cannot express the gratitude my family and I feel for you. What an unselfish act from one so young. You have given me a second chance at life and the potential to see my precious grandchildren grow up. ... You are an angel. Sincerely, your Recipient.' Now cancer-free, Nadaud says she’s looking forward to retiring this year and spending time with her three grandchildren and family.","An emotional meeting took place between bone marrow recipient Cathy Naduad and her donor Nina Cordelli .

A high school yearbook has banned the baby bumps of two pregnant teens and says the images would promote teen pregnancy. Deonna Harris says she was pulled aside at White Cloud High School in White Cloud, Michigan when she got the news her photo would have to be re-taken. Harris was shocked. ‘It made me tear up,’ she said. ‘I was trying to hold it back because I didn't want everyone to ask me why I was crying and stuff.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Belly ban: Deonna Harris, left, and Kimberly Haney, right, had photos of them in which their pregnant bellies showed yanked from the school yearbook . The staff member had been ordered not to use a picture they’d already chosen for The Chieftain’s 2013 edition. ‘She said, “We have to retake this picture.” I was kind of  confused and asked what was wrong with it and she was like, '”Well, the yearbook teacher told me you can't have your belly in, it so we have to retake it,”’ Harris told WOOD-TV Wedneday. The original photo showed Harris and some friends, including Kimberly Haney, who is also pregnant, in the bed of a truck outside school. ‘It’s not like I was holding my bell,’ said Haney, ‘I wasn’t promoting it in any way. It was just a full body picture.’ Abstinence only: Superintendent Barry Seabrook of White Cloud, Michigan schools told reporters the photos would violate the school's abstinence-only sex ed policy . But promoting it is exactly what school officials say they were doing. White Cloud schools superintendent Barry Seabrook said Thursday that showing the baby bumps in the year book would amount to a violation of Michigan’s mandate that sex education be abstinence-only. The girls disagreed and say they’re being discriminated against. ‘What's the difference of letting me walk for graduation, letting me walk around the school? It's the same thing,’ said Haney. Shotgun: Kimberly Haney and her boyfriend were voted most likely to get married but the yearbook photo, which shows her boyfriend pretending to propose, was banned by administrators . While Superintendent Seabrook agreed that appearing in school and in the year book seemed like the same thing, he also said he feared a backlash from parents. ‘We're not saying they can't have their photos in the yearbook,’ Seabrook explained. The girls were given the opportunity to reshoot the photos while keeping their pregnancies out of view. They’ve declined to do so. The photo in the truck will not appear in The Chieftain, nor will one of Haney and her boyfriend, who were voted Most Likely to Get Married. Unfair? The girls were invited to reshoot photos that hide their bumps, but declined. They say they're being discriminated against while the superintendent says he mostly feared a backlash from parents .","The White Cloud, Michigan School superintendent says the photos would constitute a violation of the state's abstinence-only sex education policy ."

A brave schoolgirl who was forced to have her foot amputated after she was savagely attacked by her own pet dog has told how she is determined to 'keep smiling' despite her ordeal. Milly-Anne Hemley, 10, was so badly injured when Staffordshire bull terrier Rory turned on her out of the blue that surgeons had to remove her foot and the lower part of her right leg. But determined Milly-Anne, who spent Christmas in hospital following the attack at her home in Northamptonshire and has since been learning to walk on crutches, refuses to feel sorry for herself. 'Everyone calls me a little soldier and everyone says I'm brave - I don't feel brave, I just get on with it and keep smiling,' she said. Family pet Rory grabbed Milly-Anne's leg when she screamed as the dog attempted to bolt out of the house in Long Buckby when the front door was left open. The 10-year-old said the dog latched on to her leg and didn't let go. 'I remember my whole body shaking, I was hugging his back and saying: ""It's only me, Rory,""' she told the Daily Mirror. Milly-Anne's brother eventually managed to his sister away from the dog and shut her in the living room for safety, but not before Rory had attacked again, this time biting the little girl's other leg. She was rushed to hospital where surgeons battled for two hours to save the young girl's damaged limb, but her injuries were too severe and her mother Paula Warren was asked to give her permission to amputate. Ms Warren, 32, was at work at the time of the incident and had left son Braydon, 15, the eldest of her four children, in charge in her absence. Brave: Milly-Anne poses for a family snapshot before she was forced to have her foot and part of her leg amputated .

African slaves first began being imported into Colombia by the Spaniards in the 16th century as labour for their burgeoning empire.

African Colombians continued to face discrimination even after the abolition of slavery in the country in 1851. Communities of former slaves were forced to live in jungle areas in order to protect themselves, while the Colombian state also promoted the 'whitening' of the African population in order to rid them of their distinctive heritage.

Ruling: Property investor Mark Howell, pictured outside London's Civil Appeal Court, has been refused permission to appeal his divorce . It was only a tiff about a woman’s ability to map-read. But property investor Mark Howell’s ten-year marriage appears to have lost its way the day he argued with his wife over her navigational skills. The couple took a wrong turn in France while driving along back-roads to Burgundy on a wine-tasting holiday. Mr Howell stopped the car and clashed with his wife Nalini over her ability to plan the route. And although the disagreement lasted only ‘a matter of moments’, it would later form a plank of Mrs Howell’s successful bid to divorce him. Yesterday Mr Howell lost a costly legal battle against the decision to end the marriage – despite a judge admitting he had similar rows with his own wife. London’s Civil Appeal Court heard that Mr Howell, 60, went on the French trip with Nalini, a 51-year-old company director, two summers ago. Judge Michael Horowitz QC granted the couple a decree nisi in December – and revealed that he and his own wife also argued about map-reading. But Mr Howell, of Kennington, South London, claimed the judge was wrong to accept his wife’s account that the map-reading clash was one of many. He also maintained the marriage had not irretrievably broken down. So yesterday he asked another judge, Lord Justice Thorpe, to overturn the decision and give him the opportunity to breathe life into a marriage he insisted was not dead. Although he admitted  having the row, he denied acting unreasonably and also objected to being ordered to pay his wife’s £20,000 legal bill. He told the court: ‘There was nothing on which the judge could conclude that my wife could not be reasonably expected to live with me. I believe as I stand here that the marriage has not irretrievably broken down. Mr Howell was refused permission to appeal his divorce at a hearing at the Civil Appeal Court, in the Royal Courts of Justice (pictured) ‘She said that there had been lots of . arguments between us, but she never mentioned any arguments to the judge . when asked a direct question, apart from one about map reading on the . way to a wine tasting in France. ‘I conceded that the argument about map reading had happened and the judge said he and his wife argued about map reading.’ Refusing Mr Howell permission to . appeal, however, Lord Justice Thorpe said of the earlier hearing: ‘The . conclusion of the judge was that the marriage had irretrievably broken . down. ‘It is sad, as it seems to me, that . this couple have spent far more energy and wasted far more money than . was ever necessary had there been a more realistic assessment of where . they stood and how to bring their failed marriage to an end.’ Mr Howell’s ex-wife was not at court yesterday and was not represented.","Mark Howell and his wife argued after getting lost on French country roads .

The grandfather who helped his wife and five grandchildren escape . a Tasmanian bushfire by leading them to safety under a jetty returned . to his house to find it completely destroyed, he revealed today. Tim Holmes, 62, built his home himself but was helpless to save it as 'tornadoes of fire' swept through his village of Dunalley. As they became surrounded by flames, his only option was to shepherd his family into the sea, where they sought refuge for nearly three hours before fleeing in a dinghy. Hero: Grandfather Tim Holmes led his wife and grandchildren into the sea as a last resort as he watched the fires destroy the house he had built himself . They were later reunited with the children's mother, who feared they had all perished after hearing they had become trapped in the water. Mr Holmes said: 'It’s all gone, every . last item, but it’s a great sense of relief to think that we lost not . one hair on a child’s head. 'All . the things that we've lost, yeah, there's some precious memories there. But they can be replaced, material things. 'But my . wife and children, not so easily replaced. Yeah, I just feel blessed . that my family's all together.' Speaking after their emotional reunion, the children's mother, Bonnie Walker, said she 'prayed like I . never prayed before' that her family would survive. She had left her children - Charlotte, two, Esther, four, Caleb, six, Liam, nine, and . Matilda, 11 - in the care of her parents on Monday as she had to attend a funeral. My little miracle: Bonnie Walker hugs youngest daughter, Charlotte, two, as she tells of her relief and joy that her family had survived the Tasmanian wildfires by taking refuge in the sea . My prayers were answered: Mrs Walker feared her family had all been killed after hearing they had been cut off by the fires that ripped through the town of Dunalley . Brave: Mrs Walker's children tell how the fire came at them in all directions leaving them trapped in the sea . Together again: Friends and loved ones embrace after the family's miraculous escape from the wildfires . But it was only after leaving the area she realised the marauding wildfires had swept into the village. Mrs Walker drove to the service in the capital Hobart as fire . ravaged the land either side of her and just made it through before the . flames crossed the road and cut her off from her family. Meanwhile, her husband, David, was hiking along Tasmania's southern coastline unaware of the unfolding drama. She told Australia's ABC network: 'We just waited by the phone and received . a message at 3.30pm to say that mum and dad had evacuated, that they . were surrounded by fire, and could we pray. 'So I braced myself to lose my children and my parents.' Mr Holmes told how he and his wife Tammy led their five . grandchildren into the sea as their only hope as he watched the house he had built himself go up in flames. Clinging on for dear life: Grandmother Tammy Holmes (second left) takes refuge under a jetty with her five grandchildren (l-r) two-year-old Charlotte, four-year-old Esther, nine-year-old Liam, eleven-year-old Matilda and six-year-old Caleb Walker. Mr Holmes took the picture as he feared their mother might not see them again . Escaping the flames: The family's pet dog Polly also sought safety on the jetty as the family huddled together in the water . Divine intervention: A building burns near the jetty. The family credits God with their survival from the fire that destroyed around 90 homes in their town of Dunalley as the country was hit with record temperatures . Even there, their . terror was not over as flames licked the wooden jetty they clung to and . they struggled to breathe in the smoke-filled air. With . the oxygen supply quickly running out in the polluted air, Mr Holmes 'rallied against all the odds' to retrieve . the dinghy from the foreshore. The ordeal was photographed by 62-year-old Mr Holmes, who . moved to Australia from Wales, as he feared his daughter my never see her children alive again. The iconic image of them huddling under the jetty has now been seen around the world. Mr Holmes said: 'We saw tornadoes of . fire just coming across towards us and the next thing we knew everything . was on fire, everywhere, all around us. 'By that time I had sent Tammy with the children to go down to the jetty because there was no escape, we couldn't get off.' Bracing themselves: The children prepare to enter the water to take refuge under the jetty as the wildfire rips through their grandparents' home . After . two and half hours in the water, he found a dinghy and ferried the . family to safety. ‘We had water up to our chins and could barely . breathe, it was so toxic,’ he said. Mr Holmes told how he sent his . wife, their grandchildren and pet dog Polly to the nearby sea jetty when . he saw smoke from the looming wildfire rise from a nearby ridge. Despite the arrival of three fire trucks, the 62-year-old realised he could not defend the home he had built himself. 'I looked at the firefighters and said, ""I have to go to Tammy and the kids"",' he told the West Australian. 'For . the next two-and-a-half hours, we huddled under the jetty as the fire . intensified and produced a plume of smoke, ash and debris that left us . with very little oxygen. 'There . were times when we had to move out deeper because it was too hot and . there were times when the jetty itself caught fire. I was able to scoop . some water onto the jetty and put it out.' Thanked God: The children's mother, Bonnie Walker, was unaware of the impending danger when she drove off to attend a funeral and feared her family had been killed when she heard of the devastation . They eventually made their way to safety as the fire burnt itself out. The family credits God with their survival from the fire went on to destroy more than 100 homes in the village. Mrs Walker said: 'I spent a lot of time with good friends and prayed like I've never prayed before and I think those prayers have been answered.'

A healthcare assistant at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital dragged a frail dementia patient around by his pyjamas and called him an ‘animal’, investigators have said. Bonka Kostova allegedly pulled the 73-year-old out of a toilet in a state of undress and told him she ‘hated having to work with people like him’. She will appear before the Nursing and Midwifery Council next week to face charges that her aggression and treatment of the patient, who also has Parkinson’s disease, means she is not fit to practise. Fears: David Cameron has ordered probes into five more trusts following the Mid Staffordshire scandal but expert Brian Jarman believes 21 more could be added to the list . Pressure: Campaigners and members of the 'Cure the NHS' group outside the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre after reading the findings of the Francis Inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust Foundation . Bulgarian-born Kostova is accused of . shouting at him: ‘You are no longer a human being but an animal.’ She . is alleged to have said ‘I hate you’ or words to that effect. An inquiry found up to 1,200 patients . died on casualty wards at Stafford between 2005 and 2009 thanks to an . obsession with Labour targets. The latest incident was in 2010 – one . year after the period covered by the report – suggesting the problems . could be continuing. Last night it emerged that the . Mid-Staffordshire trust, which covers the hospital, was one of 100 who . have still not signed an Alzheimer’s Society pledge to improve dementia . care. Jeremy Hughes, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘The appalling failures at Mid-Staffs affected people with dementia. ‘Despite the Government’s prioritisation of the condition, some hospitals are still failing vulnerable people. 'Lengthy stays in hospital can cause people’s condition to worsen, rather than helping them to get well. ‘Hospitals must act now to improve care for people with dementia. 'Only half of hospitals have made a commitment and we need Stafford Hospital to be one of them to support improvement. 'Every day of inaction threatens more scandals of neglect and inappropriate treatment.’ The latest scandal to emerge is alleged to have happened on July 22 2010, according to the NMC charge sheet. Although she is a registered midwife, . Bulgarian-born Kostova had been employed by the trust as a healthcare . support worker since April 2009. The incident happened when she was on a . night shift on ward six at Stafford Hospital. The sheet reveals that Kostova . continued to be employed at the trust for a further two months. Her case . will be heard on February 12. Analysis suggests more than 4,000 patients a year are dying needlessly in the care of 26 NHS trusts. The study shows the scandal at . Stafford hospital – where 1,200 are thought to have died through neglect . – was not an isolated case. The figure of 26 represents one in . six of the country’s health trusts. David Cameron has responded to the . crisis by ordering probes into five trusts with high mortality rates. But Brian Jarman, a globally-recognised expert on hospital performance, believes 21 more should be added to the list. To come up with that figure, the . professor compared the numbers of patients who would normally be . expected to die at a trust with the number of actual deaths. The ‘normal’ figure is based on admissions and illnesses. His technique – developed in the 1990s – led to the realisation in 2007 that too many patients were dying at Mid Staffordshire. The head of the NHS was facing . growing calls to step down yesterday. The investigator who carried out . the original inquiry into Mid Staffordshire said Sir David Nicholson . should go. Heather Wood, who headed the 2009 . Healthcare Commission probe but has since joined the campaign group Cure . the NHS, said: ‘If this were a private sector organisation that had . failed to such an extent, we would be calling for the boss to take . responsibility. ‘There is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","David Cameron ordered probe into five trusts after Mid Staffordshire scandal .

France's Socialist foreign minister was today forced to deny that he has a secret Swiss bank account aimed at hiding his money from the taxman. Laurent Fabius, a former Prime Minister, was reacting to a report in the left-wing Liberation newspaper that he might be shielding part of his fortune. It follows budget minister Jerome Cahuzac's resignation over a secret Swiss account in which he hid more than half-a-million pounds. More damage: President Francois Hollande's Socialist administration has suffered a fresh blow as his minister of foreign affairs Laurent Fabius was forced to deny he has a secret Swiss bank account to hide his wealth . This is despite being tasked by President Francois Hollande with clamping down on tax evasion. Now, if the Fabius allegations prove true, it could mean the end for Mr Hollande's entire Socialist project, with opponents calling for Parliament to be dissolved and new elections arranged. Mr Fabius said: 'I categorically deny the rumour, relayed by Liberation in its edition of Monday April 8th, attributing a Swiss account. It is not based on any material evidence, and is completely unfounded.' The minister, a high-profile politician who once dated former conservative first lady Carla Bruni, added that he had instructed his solicitor to prevent the 'false and slanderous' information from being spread. On Sunday, it was reported Cahuzac tried to deposit €15million (£12.5million) into a Geneva bank four years ago - a claim he denies. He still faces a trial and prison for the using the Swiss account to hide the half-a-million plus pounds.

Jean-Jacques Augier, the treasurer of Mr Hollande's election campaign in 2012, has also admitted to having shares in two companies registered in the Cayman Islands - a notorious tax haven. Numerous entrepreneurs and celebrities have left France since Mr Hollande came to power last year promising 'exemplary' government and a punitive tax regime. In turn, the Socialists have accused those leaving the country of being unpatriotic and greedy. However now that senior Socialists are being exposed as tax avoiders, Mr Hollande's administration is looking increasingly fragile. Millionaires who have left France since Mr Hollande came to power include Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu who has obtained Russian nationality and put his home in the French capital on the market. Bernard Arnault, the LMVH boss who is France's richest man, has also applied for a Belgium passport.","Laurent Fabius was accused in report by left-wing French daily Liberation .

Search: The Paris home of International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde was today searched by anti-corruption police . The home of International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde was raided by anti-corruption police yesterday. It follows claims that she authorised a £270million payout to a prominent Nicolas Sarkozy supporter when she was French finance minister. It is not known what officers discovered or seized after entering the £1million Paris apartment of the world’s most senior banker. The Court of Justice of the Republic, a tribunal qualified to judge the conduct of government ministers while in office, said Mrs Lagarde, 57, may have abused her position to help a controversial businessman. The case dates back 20 years. Bernard Tapie, former head of Adidas in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by the then state-owned Credit Lyonnais bank when he sold his stake in the sports kit empire in 1993 for around £300million. Within months the bank sold the company for more than twice that amount, which led to Tapie demanding compensation. Mrs Lagarde is said to have allowed the equivalent of £270million in compensation to be awarded to Tapie in 2008 when Mr Sarkozy was French president and she was finance minister. Critics said the settlement was too generous. Mrs Lagarde, whose salary as IMF managing director is £300,000, denies wrongdoing. Claims: The raid relates to claims Miss Lagarde authorised a £270million payout to Bernard Tapie . Dispute: Mr Tapie, the former head of Adidas in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by Credit Lyonnais bank. miss Lagarde ended the dispute by asking a panel of judges to arbitrate .

About 50,000, most of them older people and families with children, waving pink and blue flags massed behind a banner reading: ‘All born of a mum and a dad.’ Although it ended peacefully, riot police had been on standby after a series of violent demonstrations outside the French parliament earlier this month.

Freddie Starr (pictured in 2011) has been arrested for a second time by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal . Comedian Freddie Starr has been arrested for a second time by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. The entertainer, 70, answered bail yesterday and was rearrested over further allegations of sexual offences. His detention came after he was first arrested in November last year over claims he tried to grope a woman when she was 14. Scotland Yard said that a man had been ‘further arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree’. The investigation is the national inquiry sparked after allegations of abuse were made against Jimmy Savile. It has been split into three strands - allegations against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others. Starr was originally arrested under the ‘Savile and others’ strand, but the re-arrest was not linked to Savile. He has denied any wrongdoing. His detention for the second time follows the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford, comedian Jim Davidson and entertainer Rolf Harris. Starr, Travis, Mr Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests. Harris’ lawyers at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis attempted to stop details of his arrest becoming widely known by sending threatening letters to newspapers. But last week he was identified by The Sun as having been arrested by Yewtree officers. Critics say Yewtree, set up in the aftermath of the Savile scandal, has turned into a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’ and police are arresting suspects on flimsy evidence. Freddie Starr was originally arrested under the 'Jimmy Savile and others' strand of Operations Yewtree, but his re-arrest was not linked to Savile (left). Entertainer Rolf Harris (right) was last week identified by The Sun as having been arrested by Yewtree officers . Starr, who was first arrested in November, weeks after the Savile scandal erupted, has complained about his treatment. He was taken into custody near his home in Warwickshire and questioned over claims he tried to grope a woman called Karin Ward when she was 14. Ward, who waived her right to anonymity, claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wandering hands’ with her nearly 40 years ago. He vehemently denied her claims. It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected.

After police raided his home and seized a computer hard-drive, address books, photographs and his iPhone, Starr said: ‘It’s horrible.

Manchester United is not the only Northern dynasty which dominates its field - the University of Manchester is equally triumphant when it comes to quizzes. The institution has won three of the past 11 editions of University Challenge, and tonight it competes in the semi-final of the tournament in a bid to land yet another title. But Manchester's success is not just a fluke - many attribute the university's dominance to its long-serving coach, who is known as the 'Alex Ferguson of the quiz world' in homage to his track record. Stephen Pearson, a former contestant in his own student days, has been training the Manchester whizkids for a decade and a half. Scroll down for video . Guru: Librarian Stephen Pearson, pictured left with a previous year's team, has coached the University of Manchester to three University Challenge wins in seven years . The team will take on Bangor University in the BBC2 quiz hosted by Jeremy Paxman at 8pm today, with the winner facing University College London in next week's final. Manchester is the reigning champion, having won in 2012 as well as 2009 and 2006. In addition, the university was runner-up in 2007 and reached the semi-final in 2005, 2008 and 2010 - an unparalleled record of success on the popular general knowledge show. Mr Pearson, a 47-year-old university librarian, has been the brains behind this spectacular run of form, as he has taken on the responsibility of selecting and coaching the four-man team each year. Successful: This year's Manchester team, pictured, is hoping to take the University Challenge title . 'Some people have called me the Alex Ferguson of the quiz world,' he told the Guardian. 'I don't know about that - I've been doing this for 15 years whereas he's been in the job for at least 25.' When he captained the Manchester team in 1996, he failed to win the competition - but he has been making up for it ever since with a string of victories for his protegés. Mr Pearson's first duty comes in selecting the four men and women who will represent Manchester on University Challenge. He uses a written trivia test to draw up a shortlist of a dozen contenders, then tests their reflexes on the all-important buzzer. Victory: Mr Pearson's success with the show hosted by Jeremy Paxman, left, has seen him compared with Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, right . It is not enought just to pick the four most knowledgeable candidates, as their specialities must be sufficiently broad to cover all the subject areas which may come up in the quiz. Mr Pearson says that he would ideally have a scientist, a geographer, a historian and a literary specialist - and emphasises that they must all get on together. When it comes to coaching, he prefers running practice sessions which replicate the conditions of the show rather than learning compendious bodies of knowledge, such as lists of Nobel laureates. And while University Challenge may seem like something of a distraction from the core purpose of an educational establishment, TV success can in fact boost the institution academically as well. David Brice, 24, an economics student representing Manchester this year, says he picked the university because of its track record in quizzes. He told the Guardian he thought at the time: 'It must be a very good university if they are so good at University Challenge.'","University of Manchester has won three of past seven titles on BBC2 quiz .

Critical: Catrin Pugh, 19, is in hospital after her coach crashed in the French Alps . The father of a British ski instructor . in an artificial coma after a coach crash in the French Alps . says he has been overwhelmed by messages of support. Catrin Pugh is among three Britons critically ill in hospital after their coach turned . ploughed into a mountainside near Alpe d'Huez and exploded. The 19-year-old's father travelled from their home in Wrexham to Grenoble yesterday to be at her bedside. In a statement he said: 'We would like . to thank everyone for their kind wishes and support, particularly . British Foreign Office officials and SkiBound representatives who have . been excellent. 'The hospital are doing all they can . and have been most kind. 'We have been overwhelmed by the good wishes and . support from everybody. 'We would now be very grateful if everyone would respect our privacy at this difficult time.' The distraught father's words came as . French police investigating the bus crash prepared to travel to the UK . to interview officials from the British coach company. The news follows an announcement that . the public prosecutor in Grenoble is to open an investigation into . 'involuntary homicide and injuries' after the driver of the bus died. Aside from Ms Pugh, two other British . nationals remain in a critical condition in hospital and a further 23 of . the 52 passengers were also injured in the horror crash on Tuesday . afternoon. It is understood that the main line of investigation is brake failure. Witnesses have told police that . moments before the smash, driver Maurice Wrightson, 64, from . Northumberland, had frantically tried to warn passengers that there was a . catastrophic problem with the brakes. He bravely tried to steer the 12-ton . bus - which was towing a further three tons of luggage - to safety, . managing to stop it plunging over a cliff. It finally crashed into the side of . the road and the fuel tank at the front of the bus exploded, tearing . through the vehicle, killing Mr Wrightson instantly. A second British woman, aged 23, suffered 80 per cent burns in the crash. The horror smash happened on the last hairpin bend . of a notorious Alpine road – the most famous cycle climb in the world. It rises eight miles to a height of 6100 feet and has 21 switchbacks. The investigating magistrate in . Grenoble, Jean-Yves Coquillat, said: 'It’s probably a matter of braking. Now the question is why and the investigation will be long. It will . take many months.' The bus was a Classic Coaches . chartered service operated by UK coach operator TGM. French police will . interview staff and officials. They will also interview officials at . SkiBound, the British tour operator for whom many of the passengers worked . as ski instructors and holiday representatives. Season worker: Catrin, from Wrexham, north Wales, is pictured during her time at the French ski resort . Fresh details of the crash began to emerge yesterday as survivors painted scenes of desperate panic. Matthew Beauchamp, 19, described . leaping from the coach as it turned into an inferno and then being . airlifted to hospital. He needed 20 stitches to his hand and 14 to his . ankle. 'I'm lucky', he told The Evening . Standard. 'I could have been injured a lot worse. For everyone to get . out alive except for the driver is amazing. Mr Beauchamp, from Downend, Bristol, was returning from six months working in a hotel in the Alps during the ski season. 'The first ten minutes after the crash . were the worst because of not knowing who was accounted for. Everyone . was looking around in panic to see who got out.' His father David, 49, said: 'He told . me that the coach driver was shouting out that the brakes had failed, . giving them time to brace themselves. 'Matthew said the driver almost stood . up to make sure that everyone on the coach had heard, and that he . definitely took the decision to crash into the rock to avoid the coach . crashing through the barrier on the next hairpin bend. 'Flames immediately took hold on impact, Matthew was lucky that he was near the back.'. A crane hoists the frame of the bus which crashed and burned on the road from l'Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps.The driver was killed, and three people were severely injured . It has been revealed the doomed driver of the coach which crashed in the French Alps tried desperately to warn his 50 passengers there was a problem moments before the horror smash . The relief driver and passengers on . Wednesday gave statements to police before boarding a . specially-chartered plane from Grenoble-Isère airport to London Gatwick. The coach crashed shortly after it departed from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez on Tuesday afternoon. Doomed driver Mr Wrightson was praised for his 'remarkable courage' after sacrificing himself to save his 52 passengers. Survivor: Matthew Beauchamp, 19, injured his hand when he escaped the burning coach . Many of the survivors say he tried to . steer the vehicle, weighing 12 tonnes and towing a weight of three . tonnes, to safety after shouting that his brakes had failed. He managed to stop the bus from . plunging into a ravine, instead crashing into the side of cliff, killing . himself as the fuel tank at the front of the bus exploded and flames . tore through the vehicle. Most of the passengers managed to escape via the right rear door. Student Fred Brickell, 18, was the . youngest passenger on the doomed coach, sitting just six seats behind . the driver at the time of impact. He managed to scramble to the back as it crashed and escape through the back window. His father Clive, from Ringmer, East Sussex, said: 'He would want to thank the driver who steered the bus. 'His thoughts would also be with his friends who were injured.' He said his son's possessions, including shoes and mobile phone, perished as the bus burnt out. Mr Bricknell and other survivors were flown back to England on a chartered flight to Gatwick. Frédéric Cuvillier, minister of transport, stressed 'the remarkable courage of the driver'. He said: 'You can’t call it a miracle . because there is one dead and many wounded. But the human toll could . have been much heavier. 'The driver’s courage saved many . lives. All the testimonies of the people we have met have confirmed . this. His attitude and his actions prevented an even worse situation.” The charred remains of the bus were being examined in Vizille. There were no apparent problems with . the vehicle until the straight stretch of road before bend 21 – the last . hairpin bend of the mountain road. The accident happened in the Alpe . d'Huez ski resort - three passengers are understood to be in a serious . condition, while 17 suffered minor injuries . Burnt out: The 51 passengers are understood to be travelling back to the UK after working a ski season for Brighton-based company Skibound which organises trips for schools . Mr Wrightson's employers at UK coach operator TGM also praised his actions. Heath Williams, managing director of TGM, said: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that one of our two drivers on board has died. 'We are offering our full support to . his family and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. He . will be sadly missed by everyone at Classic Coaches. 'A number of passengers have sustained injuries and our thoughts are with them as they recover . 'Early indications are that our driver . tried to take evasive action and that he alerted passengers. We pay . tribute to him for his efforts, and also to our relief driver who helped . people to leave the vehicle.' He said: 'It is too early to say what . caused the accident, however, we have launched a full investigation and . are working closely with the local authorities. Our own safety . specialist is attending the scene to support the investigation.' Holiday attraction: Alpe d'Huez is a ski resort particularly popular with Britons . The accident happened at the foot of the notorious, twisting descent from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez. The bus had left Dover on Monday with two drivers, one of whom was Mr Wrightson. They arrived in the ski resort of . Serre-Chevalier that evening. The following morning 25 passengers, . employees of British tour operator SkiBound, boarded the coach and . headed to Alpe D’Huez. A further 26 passengers boarded the coach and Mr Wrightson, who was now the designated driver, pulled out of Alpe D’Huez at 2pm. London, Birmingham, Manchester and, finally, Newcastle had been the intended stops.","Catrin Pugh, 19, reportedly in a coma following horror crash in French Alps .

Cruel traffickers forced the 28-year-old Panamanian woman to undergo surgery where several bags of the Class A drug were inserted beneath her skin - much like a breast implant. She was stopped earlier this month at Barcelona's El Prat airport, following a flight on Colombia's Avianca airline, after police thought she was 'acting funny'. Removed: The burst bags of cocaine after they were removed from the 28-year-old woman's breasts. She had been forced to carry the drugs by traffickers . During a search, they found a blood soaked bandage covering her chest - which she admitted resulted from the operation to introduce the packets of drugs into her body. She was rushed to a medical centre in the city, where doctors removed 1.8 kilos of cocaine  - worth about £240,000- in a number of sealed bags. A police source told the Vozpópuli news website that her arrest most likely saved her life, as she may not have survived much longer with such quantities of the substance in her body. Caught out: She was stopped earlier this month at Barcelona's El Prat airport, pictured, following a flight on Colombia's Avianca airline, after police thought she was 'acting funny' He said: 'She was in a very bad state when she arrived. She said she was not in any pain but the wounds looked very bad.' It was, he added, the first time officers had ever seen drugs hidden inside the breasts of a woman. It is the second time in recent years that a woman has been caught smuggling in such a way. in 2011, a model was arrested by Italian police trying to smuggle more than £250,000 of cocaine into the country inside breast and buttock implants. The 33-year-old woman, identified only by the initials MFM, was held by officers as she tried to distract them with her plunging neckline and tight-fitting outfit at Rome's Fiumicino airport. But her plan backfired as they were so captivated by her looks they pulled her over for questioning and discovered the drugs when she failed to explain why she had been to South America. The woman had flown to Rome from Sao Paolo in Brazil and a search by female officers revealed the fake breast and buttock implants she was wearing had also been used to hide 5.5lbs of cocaine.","The 28-year-old Panamanian woman stopped at Barcelona's El Prat airport, after police thought she was 'acting funny'

Rip-off charges which can destroy the value of a worker's hard-earned pension should be banned 'without delay', a report from MPs will warn today . Rip-off charges which can destroy the value of a worker’s hard-earned pension should be banned ‘without delay’, a report from MPs will warn today. The ‘consultancy charges’ are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker, rather than the boss, will pick up the bill. The report, from the influential Work and Pensions Committee, warns these charges can be ‘extremely high’ and have ‘the potential to cause serious consumer detriment.’ Dame Anne Begg, the committee’s Labour chairman, said: ‘The plethora of costs and charges that can be applied to pension pots are not only confusing. ‘They can seriously impact on an individual’s retirement income.’ She is ‘particularly concerned’ about consultancy charges, including those paid by current workers as well as workers who have left the company but were members of its pension scheme. Dame Anne said: ‘Neither can be justified. Both should be banned.’ It gives the example of two workers called ‘Mr Smith’ and ‘Miss Snow’ who both contribute the same amount of money into their pension, but Miss Snow pays a lower charge. After 43 years paying into their pension pots, her pension is worth £78,000, but his pension is worth only £63,000 after paying an extra £15,000 in fees. The report warned: ‘We are very concerned by the high level of such charges quoted in some advisers’ literature and the potential for this to reduce significantly the size of scheme members’ pension post, and ultimately their income in retirement.’ Last night, the Department for Work and Pensions said it has already begun an investigation into the controversial issue of consultancy charges. Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, wrote to the Association of British Insurers last year saying he is ‘increasingly concerned’ about them. He warned: ‘They should only be deducted from an individual’s [pension] pot where there is a tangible benefit to that individual.’ The timing is urgent because millions of workers are currently being signed up into a company pension scheme for the first time in their life. 'Consultancy charges' are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker, rather than the boss, will pick up the bill . Under new rules, introduced in October, all workers who do not currently have a company pension are being ‘auto-enrolled’ by their boss into a retirement scheme. A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have been gathering evidence on consultancy charging and will announce a decision in due course.’ One pension expert, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Consultancy charges could just wipe out the whole point of saving. ‘It will put lots of people off. They will get a letter after their first year of saving into a pension and think: ‘Where has all my money gone?’ Dr Ros Altmann, an independent pensions expert and former Number 10 adviser, said workers must be protected from ‘unfair and inappropriate charges.’ She said: ‘At the moment, it is perfectly permissible for unqualified, unregulated advisers to charge auto-enrolled workers for advice that is only given to the employer. ‘Anyone giving advice to the workers themselves would need to be fully qualified and regulated, but because the advice is going to the employer, the regulatory protections are not being applied. ‘That is despite the fact that the workers’ pension fund is paying for the advice that the employer receives. This is clearly wrong and should be banned immediately.’ Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘I am particularly concerned about lower paid, frequent job changers who could see a substantial portion of their retirement savings lost as a result of consultancy charging.’","‘Consultancy charges’ made when boss takes advice on workers' pension .

A British holidaymaker with a mental age of seven has been jailed for four years and four months after he admitted starting a fire in a Spanish hotel. Andrew Dmytruk, 51, from Nottingham, who has suffered from serious mental health problems since contracting meningitis as a baby, started a fire at a complex in Benidorm, on the Costa Blanca, in December 2010, . Mr Dmytruk's lawyer's Marcos Castaner yesterday reached a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors who had been calling for him to be jailed for nine years. During a hearing at the Provincial Court in Alicante Mr Dmytruk, who has been on remand since the incident, agreed to plead guilty if the sentence was reduced to four years and four months. He had been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his widowed mother, Doris O'Brien, at the time of the incident. She says he is innocent and did not start the hotel fire. The three-star Ambassador hotel was evacuated after Dmytruk allegedly set fire to his room. The 10-storey, 200-room hotel filled with black smoke and 13 Brits, mostly pensioners, were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. Doctors said he was fit to stand trial for arson, but Fair Trials International previously said: 'Owing to complications from meningitis that he suffered as a baby, Andrew has the mental age of a young child. 'He has been refusing much of the food . given to him and in March 2012 he attempted suicide, leaving him . increasingly withdrawn and his mother increasingly worried.' The group said Dmytuk has been denied bail largely because he is a foreigner.

A gay couple has sparked outrage for displaying a 'homosexual nativity scene' in their Colombian home. Andrés Vásquez and Felipe Cárdenas have come under fire for their all-male manger - where the baby Jesus has two father Josephs and the Virgin Mary is nowhere to be seen. The country's Catholic Church has labelled the display, in the northern city of Cartagena, as 'sacrilege'. 'Sacrilege': This picture posted by a gay couple of the nativity scene with two Josephs but no Mary has sparked a storm of criticism in Columbia . And thousands of Colombians have taken to social networking sites to slam the pair, with many saying they show 'a lack of respect to God and all Christians'. A Facebook user added: 'As much as I support gay rights, this is just stupid on so many levels. If you are a Catholic you have to accept Jesus' parents were Mary and Joseph.' Political analyst Vásquez and entrepreneur Felipe have been together for four years and were united by a civil union, the closest thing to marriage for homosexuals in Colombia, three months ago. The gay rights activists told the Diario Veloz website that they set up the scene, a picture of which was then posted on Facebook, in the hope that it would help in bringing about reform in the country's gay marriage laws. Controversy: The gay couple posted a picture of their alternative nativity scene rather than the traditional arrangement of Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus (file picture) A bill to legalise gay marriage is currently being looked at by the country's politicians and has passed the first of four debates. But it has been dubbed as 'unconstitutional' by the nation's conservative lawmakers. Vásquez told the website: 'We did it because we believe in Colombia. We have lived in different cities in the world and we prefer to return to our country. 'We are beginning to build [a better country] through our new union.' Earlier this week, the Government announced plans to introduce gay marriage in England and Wales in 2015. But the move has divided the Conservative party and attracted criticism from the Church of England despite assurances that the police has measures to protect religious freedom.","Columbians Andrés Vásquez and Felipe Cárdenas heavily criticised for their all-male manger .

A man who spent £30,000 on dozens of failed hair transplant operations was left so self-conscious he refused to let his girlfriend touch his hair for a full six months after they got together. Despite dating Natalie, 35, regularly, Spencer Stevenson, 37, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, managed to keep his botched attempts at hair transplants a secret. Spencer, who started losing his hair at just 21 avoided telling his future wife that he was spending thousands of pounds on hair transplants - all of which failed to work -  until they were about to move in together. Natalie put her partner's hatred of . having his hair touched down to vanity. 'I didn't want to tell her because I was embarrassed. I was self-conscious and lacked confidence. It was my Achilles heel,' he says. Spencer Stevenson after a successful transplant and (right) with wife Natalie on their wedding day . Spencer, who began to go bald at the age of 21, says the decision to have a hair transplant was a last resort. 'When I started to lose my hair, I attempted to salvage it over the course of several months,' said Spencer. 'I tried everything - wigs, treatments, all lotions and potions, but the hair loss continued. It affected me hugely emotionally.' As a result, Spencer began suffering from mild depression. He felt isolated, . didn't want to go out and constantly wore a hat. He says it was on his mind 'every minute of every day'. Finally Spencer made the decision to try a hair transplant. While he was . travelling through America a glamorous-looking advert for hair restoration . caught his eye and he thought, 'this could be the answer'. He went for it, full of hope, but the results were less than ideal. Not much hair grew back and the hair that did, did not look natural. He now says he felt he had been misled by the salesman. But . lack of knowledge and information at the time meant Spencer went back . to the same surgeon a further three times after the initial poor . outcome. Spencer pictured before his corrective surgery (left) and immediately after a successful hair operation (right) Two years later and £30,000 . poorer and his hairline was in no better state - in fact he needed . corrective surgery to fix what had been done because it looked . unnatural. The . surgery he opted to have done was, at the time, perceived as good and . state of art - there was no Internet around to check what he should . expect and no easily accessible experts to speak to. After . the four procedures of mini and micro grafts hair transplants Spencer . was left with unnatural-looking clumps of hair along hairline. Worse still, Spencer felt he had to face the struggle alone. He had met Natalie when the two were travelling and she had no idea he was suffering from hair loss. But when they were about to buy their first home together, Spencer told her he needed to talk to her about something serious. Natalie . says: 'I had no idea what he we going to tell me and having just put . the deposit down on a house, I was worried he was going to tell me it was . all over or he'd met someone else. 'The first thing he did was reassure me . that he wasn't about to finish with me, then he told me the whole story - . that he'd started losing his hair in his late teens, had undergone lots . of botched operations costing thousands of pounds and was, at the time, . having extensive restorative treatment in New York. 'My . first instinct was relief. It all made sense - Spencer's hatred of me . touching his hair, his frequent trips to New York which he told me were . to see a friend. At the time I had no reason to think he was lying - he . did have a friend in the city and I thought he just liked styling his . hair in a particular way. 'Every time I tried to touch his hair he'd . push my hand away.' Spencer waited until his relationship with Natalie had properly developed before letting her in on his biggest secret. 'Nobody knew. Only my mother and sister knew,' he said. 'But even though it's something very sensitive to me, Natalie needed to know when our relationship started getting a lot more serious and we were getting a lot closer.' Two years after his confession, the couple got engaged. A year later they were married and they now . have a beautiful pair of five-year-old twins, Lily and Alfie. But Natalie says his confession rattled her at first. 'After the initial relief his confession began to hit home, the worry started to settle in,' said Natalie. Spencer waited until his relationship with Natalie had evolved before letting her in on his biggest secret . 'What . damage was this doing to his scalp? How much treatment could he take? If it failed, what would the impact be? And how was this all affecting . him mentally? 'In terms of the money he was spending, it didn't bother me at all', said Natalie. 'Spencer's always worked hard and it . was cash he'd earned. I understood that this was something really . personal to him, and whilst on the outside he exuded confidence, deep . down his self-esteem was really low and restoring his hair would bring . the confidence back. 'I was by his side to support him . during each new round of surgery and thankfully, it all went well. 'Each time . though, my heart did sink and the old fears would come back - about it . failing and harming him physically and mentally. Spencer was self-conscious of the unnatural results . His saviour came in the form of New York surgeon Dr Feller who performed a brilliant procedure to fix his hairline for good. Spencer since launched his website . SpexHair, offering what he says is 'honest, ethical hair loss help from . hair loss treatments to hair transplants'. 'When Spencer had finished his last round of . surgery I was so pleased it was over and amazed at how he looked,' Natalie says. 'Anyone meeting Spencer for the first time would have no idea what he's . been through. I felt delighted for him. 'This is what . Spencer had been searching for, for years. Overnight his self-confidence . and belief in himself improved and he became a different, more . self-assured person. 'We . only started telling friends a couple of years ago. They have been . incredibly supportive, he's had the banter you'd expect from close . mates, but no negativity at all. 'In fact we've found some wanting to . talk to us about the whole process because they're thinking of having . the same treatment. 'I'm . really proud of Spencer and the journey he's been on. 'He's a more . confident and relaxed person now than when we first met and feels . comfortable in his own skin.

Michael Heseltine said poorer countries like India and China are doing far better than Western states because their poverty means they have more to strive for . The economy is stalling because Britons feel too rich to push for growth, Lord Heseltine has suggested. The Tory grandee said the wealthier a country becomes, the less ‘national will’ there is to ensure the economy improves. The peer, who has just returned from a trip to India, said poorer countries like India and China are doing far better than Western states because their poverty means they have more to strive for. And he made the claim that an economic recovery was not ‘essential’ for the future of the UK. The former deputy prime minister’s claims invite accusations of being out of touch at a time when millions are struggling to find work. But, asked in the interview whether it is essential that the economy improves, he said: ‘It’s not essential. It doesn’t need to. It can go on drifting down. ‘There is no God-given rule saying you’ve got to have a well-performing economy. It could be an indifferent economy. ‘It’s a question of whether the national will is there; whether we want it. And the richer you get the less imperative there is. ‘Maybe one of the problems of advanced economies is that people are sufficiently well-off they don’t need to drive themselves any more. ‘All these comparisons with China and India are ridiculous. I’ve just come back from India. You know why they’ve got to drive themselves – they’ve got real problems. ‘While in this country there are people with problems, the vast majority of people have standards which are not comparable with the Third World.’ Asked whether the problem is lack of desire to see growth, he told the Independent newspaper: ‘It could be. I don’t personally subscribe to that view but I don’t discount it as a possible thought. Lord Heseltine said poverty stricken countries like India strive to drive their economy forward because they have 'real problems' ‘I think that there is in the nature of most people a desire to do something and to do it better, and do it to a degree of personal satisfaction.’ Lord Heseltine has just completed a report for the Coalition Government into how to promote growth in the economy.  Last week the Treasury backed most of the recommendations. Deputy prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under John Major, Lord Heseltine is most remembered for his tussles with the previous prime minister Margaret Thatcher. He resigned from her cabinet in 1986 in a disagreement called the ‘Westland affair’ which centred on the fate of the Westland helicopter company. Four years later his challenge to Lady Thatcher’s leadership ended with her resignation. In the early 1980s he helped regenerate Merseyside after the Toxteth riots, and in the early 1990s he was asked by Mr Major to dismantle the hated poll tax.","Former Tory Deputy PM blames a lack of motivation to drive economy .

The London School of Economics student, who wants to remain anonymous, has intensified pressure on the BBC, which is under fire over a Pyongyang documentary shown last night. The student told MailOnline: '[Panorama journalist] John Sweeney was presented to use as a . history professor from a university in Beijing. 'I was wondering why they were filming him so much. It was two days before then end of the trip that I realised he was an undercover journalist.' The claims follow an interview with a student in today's Daily Mail who said she felt exploited and put at risk by the BBC. Meanwhile tensions again heightened on the Korean peninsula, with the North's military warning of 'sledge-hammer blows' in retaliation to protests in the South against leader Kim Jong Un. Undercover: An LSE student has come forward today to reveal that some travellers believed Panorama reporter John Sweeney was a history professor until two days before the end of their trip to North Korea . The student said that the Panorama film crew, whose documentary was broadcast last night, at no point warned the young travellers of the risks they faced travelling with them to the dictatorship. It is claimed that the group were only informed they would be accompanied by a single print journalist, with no indication that the journalist would be travelling undercover. 'We realised things as we went along,' said the student, who has asked MailOnline not to publish any identifying details out of fear of reprisals by the murderous North Korean regime. 'I just know that at the point that I accepted [a place on the trip] I didn't know that the journalist would be undercover.' The latest testimony comes after a young woman yesterday spoke to the Mail to tell how ten students, the youngest just 18, only learned they were 'cover' for the BBC's filming hours before entering North Korea. But the most shocking claims involved the cover story given to Mr Sweeney, who presented the Panorama documentary.

It was believed that his posing as an LSE history professor was a ruse to fool North Korean authorities, but the latest account suggests that many students on the trip actually believed he was a real professor. The BBC today reiterated its denial that students were tricked and released statements from two students on the trip who said they were made completely aware that they would be travelling with an undercover documentary team. Mila Akimova, one of those students, said: 'I can speak for myself that I went on the trip fully aware that if we were discovered we may even be arrested - which is the reason I insisted on using my Russian passport (I also hold an EU country passport) to make the NK visa – a Russian citizen is less likely to be prosecuted. 'Yes, the BBC lied to North Korea - but in my opinion a regime like that deserves to be lied to, and it surprises me that the LSE - after the Gaddafi scandal - is trying to cancel a documentary exposing a dictatorship.' The second student, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that organisers had repeatedly made clear to the group they would be joined by a journalist and that this could pose a risk to them if they were found out. 'To me, it seemed the worst thing possible to happen would be to be expelled from North Korea and not be allowed to re-enter the country,' said the student. 'I decided that to be a risk to be very worth taking in order to experience the uniqueness of North Korea.' The young student's statements come as North Korea today vowed 'sledge-hammer blows' against the South after protests against the regime's leading dynasty, warning that attacks will start 'without notice'. It demanded that South Korean authorities apologise for protests in the capital Seoul where demonstrators had burned a portrait of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The chilling ultimatum came after tensions had eased slightly on the Korean peninsula as the pariah state celebrated the birth of its first leader, Kim Il Sung.

Standing ready: South Korean Army soldiers prepare to fire 105mm howitzers during an exercise in Paju, South Korea, near the border village of Panmunjom, earlier today . In recent days the North has threatened nuclear attacks on the U.S., South Korea and Japan after new sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in February. The shrill threats had gone quiet yesterday as the country marked the 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, raising hopes for an easing of tension in a region that has for weeks seemed on the verge of conflict. But the North's KCNA news agency said today the North Korean army had issued an ultimatum to the South after rallies in the South on Monday at which portraits of North Korea's leaders were burned. 'Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,' KCNA reported, citing military leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as North Korea is officially known. 'The military demonstration of the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces will be powerful sledge-hammer blows at all hostile forces hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership.' Small counter-protests by South Koreans calling for dialogue with the North were also held, South Korean media reported. Day of celebrations: Kim claps with with teachers and cadets from military academies as he enjoys a sports contest between Kim Il-Sung Military University and Kim Il-Sung University of Politics in Pyongyang . Taking a break from brinksmanship: Today's chilling ultimatum came after tensions had eased slightly on the Korean peninsula as the pariah state yesterday celebrated the birth of its first leader, Kim Il Sung . Fun and games: Students from Kim Il-Sung Military University and Kim Il-Sung University of Politics compete in a tug-of-war contest to mark the day of celebration . But all the applause was reserved for 'dear leader': Kim laps up the adulation on the North's national holiday . The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a 'hostile' act. The U.S. had dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers to take part. But in the latest ultimatum the North did not threaten America. Instead it reserved its anger for what it calls South Korea's 'puppet' government. It even mentioned the possibility of dialogue, suggesting that it was not really about to launch war in response to routine protests by at most a few dozen people in Seoul, despite the anger they raised. 'If the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations, they should apologise for all anti-DPRK hostile acts, big and small, and show the compatriots their will to stop all these acts,' said the North's military. Taking threats seriously: South Korean emergency service personnel wearing chemical protective clothing participate in an anti-chemical warfare exercise in Seoul earlier today, as war rhetoric was again stepped up . Grim faced: North Korea has in recent days made threats of nuclear strikes on the U.S., South Korea and Japan after new sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in February . Taking no chances: But a South Korean diplomat today said the latest ultimatum was 'not worth a response' A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman later told a briefing the North Korean ultimatum was not worth a response and South Korea was waiting for the North to make a 'wise decision'. Last week, the South's President Park Geun-hye offered talks but the North rejected the overture as a 'cunning' ploy. Mr Park will meet U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on May 7 to discuss economic and security issues, including 'countering the North Korean threat', the White House said on Monday. Life goes on: Despite the fears of imminent nuclear apocalypse, children pose for souvenir photos near a fountain in downtown Seoul. Analysts say the North's most recent ultimatum ended on a conciliatory note . Tourists pose for souvenir photos: It even mentioned the possibility of dialogue, suggesting that it was not really about to launch war in response to protests by a few dozen people in Seoul, despite the anger they raised . The U.S. has also offered talks with the North, but on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions. That seems unlikely, as North Korea has described its nuclear weapons as a 'treasured sword' and has vowed to never give them up. Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, as he yesterday ended a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution. Mr Kerry had a day earlier appeared to open the door to talking even without steps towards nuclear disarmament by the North . A day earlier Mr Kerry had appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearisation steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary. Region in crisis: Maps and diagrams detail potential effective range and threat represented by several North Korean missile systems, as well as the counter-measures against them possessed by the U.S. and Japan . North Korea has so far conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability. Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions that were expanded after the North exploded an atom bomb in February. The aim of the North's aggression, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson Kim Il-Sung, or to force the U.S. into talks. The U.S. has 28,000 troops in South Korea. A U.S. military helicopter crashed in a region near the border with North Korea on Tuesday with 14 people on board, all of them U.S. soldiers, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the accident, which happened when the helicopter was landing, was being investigated, Yonhap said.","North renews warlike rhetoric after national holiday to mark founder's birth .

The intense hatred between the two main women in the life of Francois Hollande has boiled over in yet another bitter exchange, with one calling the other 'nasty and aggressive'. Segolene Royal, the mother of the French president's four children and a leading Socialist politican in her own right, has always been a fierce critic of his new girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler. Ms Trierweiler, a 48-year-old divorced glossy magazine journalist, caused outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose. Critic: Segolene Royal, the mother of the French president's four children and a leading Socialist politican in her own right, has always been a fierce critic of his new girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler . Ms Royal, 59, has also never forgiven her love rival for conducting an affair with Mr Hollande behind her back. In a TV interview to publish a new book, Ms Hollande was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler. Ms Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you - what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if you want to survive you have to forgive. 'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.' While the apparent attempt to 'forgive' may be welcomed by Ms Trierweiler, the subsequent insult will hurt both her and Mr Hollande. Bitter: Ms Royal, 59, has also never forgiven her love rival for conducting an affair with Mr Hollande behind her back . The infamously hen-pecked head of state has constantly tried to act as a peacemaker between the two women, pleading with them to keep his private life out of the headlines. Ms Trierweiler is currently in Mali on her first solo trip as France's First Lady, as she tries to win some support among the French public. She is widely disliked and mistrusted, not just because of her very colourful private life, but because of her obsession with taking fellow journalists to court. Despite working for Paris Match, a magazine which thrives on writing about the private lives of public figures, and carrying intimate photos of them, she regularly sues anybody who does the same to her and Mr Hollande. Neither the Elysee Palace, nor spokes people for Ms Royal and Ms Trierweiler would comment on their latest spat.

A group of teenage skaters were the unsuspecting witnesses and first on the scene to Friday's commuter train crash that hurt more than 70 people in Connecticut. The boys were enjoying their evening in Bridgeport, trying out new stunts, jumps and skating over ramps when they heard the tremendous sound of the two Metro North commuter trains slamming into one another. The friends happened to be recording as the collision occurred. It is clear from the video they were not prepared to deal with the things they saw. Scroll down for video... Skater boys: The guys were in a nearby skatepark when the drama unfolded . Crash: Dust and debris can be seen in the distance as the boys see the collision happen right before them . Decisions: The boys hesitate if they should proceed further down the tracks as they see the carnage that lays before them . Upon climbing up the embankment to the railroad tracks, the four boys saw a scene of complete chaos in the aftermath of the collision. They were on the scene for a good ten minutes before the emergency services arrived and saw passenger scrambling to get out of the derailed train cars. Debris including glass from broken windows, twisted rails and other bits of sharp metal lay all about them. Through the lens of the skaters camera, commuters could be seen helping one another off the train cars that were no longer sitting on the tracks. Heroism: The video captures acts of bravery as shaken passengers help one another from the stricken train . Snapped: Broken rails and twisted metal can be seen all around . The boys can be heard asking shaken passengers if they're okay, but none of them decide to call 911. Another of the teenagers suggests climbing aboard the train although it is not clear what his intentions might have been. His friend, sensibly, tells him to keep off the train and away from the tracks that might still be electrified. Viewers may be surprised to note that despite the shock clearly intimated by the boys, no real panic or screaming can be heard from people aboard or climbing off the doomed train. Drama: Passengers evacuate the train that is now several feet off the tracks . Disruption: The line between New York and Boston is expected to be subject to delays for several weeks . Eerie: The boys arrive on scene moments after the crash occurred but before the emergency services arrive . One passenger speaks to the lads telling her that the train ride was 'worse than being on a rollercoaster', while another gentleman says the thought he was 'going to die'. The skaters decided to leave once the police showed up but there is no doubt the video captures the eerie scene just moments after the train crashed. 'We were at a skateshop called Rampage across from where the incident happened, and well what we saw is what you'll see,' they commented on their YouTube film.on the YouTube description. Officials investigating the cause of the crash ruled out foul play, and sent a damaged section of railway track for analysis. Confusion: Shocked passengers try and understand what has happened by the side of the tracks . Overwhelmed: The boys are caught up in the drama of everything they're seeing and are clearly in shock too . Evidence: The first footage of the crash could provide some useful clues to NTSB investigators who are attempting to work out what went wrong . It is not clear if the accident was caused by the broken piece of track, or if it was damaged before the crash, said Earl Weener, of the National Transportation Safety Board. He added that the investigation was in its early stages, and refused to speculate on why the train derailed near Bridgeport, at 6.10pm. The National Transportation Safety Board began its investigation on Saturday, which is expected to last for seven to 10 days. The board will examine the trains' brakes and condition, signal information and the performance of the crew. Data recorders from the trains are expected to provide details on the speed of the trains and other information. The railway tracks were damaged in the crash, and trains are suspended between New York and New Haven, Connecticut and with limited service Boston and New Haven.

A New York man accused of hurling homophobic slurs at a gay man on the street before shooting him dead laughed and boasted about the alleged murder to police as he was being handcuffed just minutes afterwards, according to prosecutors. Elliot Morales, 33, has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in the shooting death of Mark Carson, 32, just after midnight on Saturday. The Greenwich Village resident rolled around 'laughing on the ground' and proudly told officers 'yeah, I shot him in the head' as he was arrested five blocks away from where Carson was killed, the Manhattan Criminal Court heard on Sunday. Suspect: Elliot Morales, 33, pictured, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in a Manhattan court on Sunday . Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Morales was ordered held without bail pending another court appearance on Thursday. His attorney, Reginald Sharpe, could not be reached for comment. On Saturday, minutes before opening fire in the lively Village streets, police say Morales followed Carson and his companion and asked them 'Are you afraid? Do you watch the news? Do you know what happened in Sandy Hook?' according to the New York Post. He then asked Carson, 'Do you want to die here,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Police said Morales called Carson a 'f*****' and a 'queer' before shooting him in the cheek in a neighborhood long known as a bedrock of the gay rights movement. Didn't back down: Mark Carson, 32, refused to shy away from his gay identity, even when confronted by a biggot who was harassing him in the street . Morales was soon arrested a few blocks away. He has six previous arrests including . one for attempted murder in 1998, police said. Details of that arrest . weren't immediately clear. He served nine years in city and state . prisons, The Post reported. Saturday's shooting scene is a few . blocks from the Stonewall Inn, the site of 1969 riots that helped give . rise to gay rights when patrons reacted to police harassment. The violence follows a spate of . recent bias attacks on gay men in New York, but this was the first . deadly one. Kelly said police were looking into possible links between . the incidents. The shooting stunned a city where, in . many neighborhoods, same-sex couples now walk freely holding hands. It . also comes at a time when the gay marriage movement is gaining momentum . in many parts of the United States. Twelve states have legalized . same-sex marriage, including New York in 2011. Crime scene: Police say Morales randomly shot Carson on Sixth Avenue, pictured, after having words with him only because Carson was homosexual . Point-blank: Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street . Carson was revealed on Sunday as a . 'courageous' gay man who never hid his sexuality - despite being . subjected to anti-gay slurs for years. Before the gay-bashing assailant . killed the 32-year-old, he asked whether his companion was his . boyfriend. Carson didn't hesitate and told the man yes, according to . reports. Carson and his best friend of 15 years turned to walk away, but Morales followed them, the New York Post reported. After asking him if he wanted to die there, Morales demanded to know: 'Is he your boy?' When Carson responded 'Yes,' Morales allegedly pulled out the pistol and shot Carson once at point-blank range. He was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where he died. 'He was a courageous person,' Michael Bumpars, Carson's brother, told the New York Daily News. 'My brother was a beautiful person... He was our foundation.' 'Courageous': Carson's family said he had been battered with anti-gay slurs before, but always responded 'with grace' Police on Saturday said the attack was motivated by hate. 'This clearly looks to be a hate crime,' Kelly said. Kelly says the gunman was seen urinating on the street outside a bar. He . says the man went into the bar, made anti-gay remarks to the bartender . and showed the bartender that he was wearing a holster with a silver . pistol. Kelly says the gunman then confronted the victim and a companion on the street and asked if they were 'gay wrestlers.' 'There . was no words that would aggravate the situation spoken by the victims . here. They were confronted,' Kelly said. 'They did not know the . perpetrators, no previous relationship.' Carson lived in Brooklyn and managed a frozen yogurt shop in the West Village. He and his partner were going out for the night in Greenwich Village - a popular area for straight and gay revelers alike. In custody: A man was taken into custody within minutes of the shooting West 8th Street and Sixth Avenue . After the shooting, the gunman ran five blocks before cops captured him at West Third Street and MacDougal Street, on the edge of the NYU campus. The busy and well-traveled intersection of 8th Street, Sixth Avenue and Greenwich Avenue is just a few blocks from Washington Square Park. The shooter was crazed and confessed the shooting to cops when he was collared. Detectives are testing his blood to determine he was on drugs at the time. Another two men who were with Morales when he first confronted Carson were questioned by police and released. Openly gay New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime. 'I am horrified to learn that last night, a gay man was murdered in my district after being chased out of a Greenwich Village restaurant and assailed by homophobic slurs,' she said in a statement. West Village: A normally peaceful and progressive part of Manhattan.This is the fourth hate crime incident in two weeks in the city . 'I stand with all New Yorkers in condemning this attack.' This is the fourth such hate crime that targeted a gay man in the last two weeks in Manhattan. 'There was a time in New York City when hate crimes were a common occurrence,' she added. 'There was a time in New York City when two people of the same gender could not walk down the street arm-in-arm without fear of violence and harassment. We refuse to go back to that time. This kind of shocking and senseless violence, so deeply rooted in hate, has no place in a City whose greatest strength will always be its diversity.' On May 10, police said a gay couple was attacked on West 32nd Street and beaten so severely that one of the men needed eye surgery. Days earlier, another gay couple was assaulted by a group of men in the same area near Madison Square Garden.","Elliot Morales, 33, was charged with .

"By . Russell Myers and Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 17:52 EST, 9 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:53 EST, 9 February 2013 . Television adverts teaching children how to cross roads safely have been scrapped for the first time in six decades despite a rise in the number of deaths. Campaigns featuring characters such as Tufty the Squirrel and the Green Cross Code man have helped save thousands of lives. But warnings about the dangers of traffic will become a thing of the past after budget cuts forced the Department for Transport to ditch TV and cinema adverts. Helping hand: Tufty the Squirrel became so popular that a nationwide Tufty Club was formed, which at its height had a staggering two million members . Pressure groups last night called on Ministers to reverse the decision. Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: ‘While road safety must face its share of cuts, road accidents are an enormous financial burden that the country can ill afford. ‘Investing in preventing road casualties makes a significant economic contribution and helps save lives and prevent injuries.’ Dave Prowse, who played the Green Cross Code man for more than a decade, said: ‘We had a fantastic effect on reducing road accident figures and we need the same thing now as the traffic situation is worse than ever.’ 'Stop, look and listen': Green Cross Code man taught pupils to be careful before stepping off the pavement . He pointed out the Government could save money by simply repeating old public information films in which he starred as a white and green-clad superhero who appeared by busy roads to stop children being hit by cars. Shadow Transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘This Government must take responsibility if these cuts mean more children are killed or injured on our roads.’ The first road-safety film was broadcast in 1948 to teach people how to use zebra crossings. Five years later a character called Tufty Fluffytail was introduced by RoSPA to teach children how to cross the road. Later clips featured puppets and were narrated by actor Bernard Cribbins. Sing-a-long: More recent campaigns have feature cartoon hedgehogs singing the Bee Gees' hit Stayin' Alive. Pressure groups last night called on Ministers to reverse the budget cut decision . End of the road: The budget for road-safety publicity was as high as £19m in 2008/09 but was slashed to just £3.9m in 2011/12 for campaigns such as the Tim Burton-style animation called Tales Of The Road . Tufty became so popular that  a nationwide Tufty Club was formed, which at its height had a staggering two million members. In the Seventies, celebrities including footballer Kevin Keegan and the then Doctor Who, Jon Pertwee, were brought in to appeal to older children, while the  Green Cross Code man taught pupils to ‘stop, look and listen’ before stepping off the pavement. More recent campaigns have featured cartoon hedgehogs singing the Bee Gees’ hit Stayin’ Alive and Tim Burton-style animations called Tales Of The Road. Shadow Transport Secretary: Maria Eagle says the Government must take responsibility if the cuts mean more deaths and injuries on the roads . By the mid-Nineties, 260 children were killed on Britain’s roads every year. By 2010, the number had fallen to 55 but in 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, it rose to 60. A Freedom of Information request has shown that the budget for road-safety publicity was as high as £19 million in 2008/09. However, after the Coalition came to power spending was slashed, and in 2011/12 the Department for Transport spent £3.9 million on the issue. This year, the publicity budget for the Think! road-safety campaign is £3.6 million, much of which was spent on a Christmas blitz on drink-drivers. A further £1.3 million is being spent on adverts warning drivers to look out for motorcyclists, while just £78,000 will go on keeping children safe. Neil Greig, of the Institute of Motorists, said the amount was ‘derisory’. ‘If the Government is serious about safety, it must increase these amounts,’ he said. The Department for Transport said Tales Of The Road would continue to be available online alongside some interactive content. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Road deaths are at a record low but we know that one death is one too many, which is why we are focusing our campaigns where they will have the greatest impact. ‘We are working to ensure road-safety messages are reaching children and teenagers in schools as well as providing educational resources to allow these important messages to be incorporated into the curriculum.’","The Department for Transport has cut the budget for TV and cinema adverts .

Ally Swinton, pictured with his ripped clothes, survived a 2,000ft avalanche fall while walking along a ridge towards Mont Blanc . A British climber miraculously cheated death when he was taken by an avalance and hurled more than 2,000 feet down a steep mountain face and over a cliff. Ally Swinton, 23, suffered just minor injuries following the incident, which happened as he walked along a ridge towards Mont Blanc, western Europe’s highest peak. Yesterday, Ally, from Leven in Fife, described how he 'desperately swam and clawed' through the avalanche before being catapulted feet-first down the mountain. A headshot of Ally, taken by himself three minutes after the avalanche to assess his injuries, shows his swollen and bloodied face. Another, an aerial shot from the rescue helicopter, shows the avalanched mountain with Ally’s trail at the top dramatically stopping at the point at which he was thrown down. Speaking from his home in the Chamonix Valley, in the French Alps, he said: 'All I could see was white. I was freefalling in this white room. My mouth was gagged with snow. I spat it out but it just filled up again. I shoved my fingers in my mouth to unplug it. 'I was on this roller-coaster. 'I felt gutted because I knew I was going to die. Completely gutted. I kept shouting: ""No, no, no"" with a few swear words added in. 'This was the way I was going to go. This was my lights out.' Ally, who works as a transfer driver and is also sponsored by clothing brand Rab, was climbing with fellow Britons Ben Tibbetts, 30, a photographer from Hereford, and Londoner Misha Gopaul, 33. They set off from Chamonix at 1am last Tuesday to climb Mont Blanc. The three experienced mountaineers picked a technical route well within their capabilities that involved summitting the 13,294-ft Aiguille de Bionnassay. Ally, who has climbed Mont Blanc five times, said: 'I got to the summit of the Bionnassay before the other two. It was about 12.30pm and there was no point in hanging around. I was tired and the winds had picked up. They were only just behind but out of sight around the ridge. Ally took this picture of himself three minutes after the avalanche to assess his injuries . 'I put my hood up and kept going. I could see Mont Blanc in the distance. I was just plodding along the ridge, locked in my own wee world, when silently and unexpectedly I fell on my left side. I couldn’t grasp what was happening.' The whole mountain started cracking into a huge jigsaw of snow blocks. The avalanche was 500 feet wide. He said: 'I tried so hard to claw at the snow. I was swimming for my life. I was doing a kind of front-crawl, desperately trying to swim my way to the top of the slope that was going with me. 'All I could see was white. I was . freefalling in this white room. My mouth was gagged with snow. I spat it . out but it just filled up again' - Ally Swinton . 'I was completely desperate. Your mind is telling you that is it, but you just physically keep trying. The top was only a metre away and I gained some ground but it was too late. 'I was desperately trying to get over the slab that was going with me. I tried and tried but I was well and truly engrossed in the avalanche. 'After these few seconds I knew I was going down.' The south face of the Bionnassay has a rock ridge running horizontally across it. Ally believes his life may have been saved by the fact that he was catapulted over the steepest and smallest section of this cliff. To the left and the right there are expansive rocks. He said: 'By now I was in the avalanche feet-first, facing outwards. I was traveling at quite a speed. 'I remember going over the rock ridge because I was in free-fall. It was like being on a roller-coaster going down. This picture shows the final footsteps Ally took along the ridge before he was taken by the avalanche . Ally (right) was climbing with fellow Britons Ben Tibbetts (left), 30, and Misha Gopaul (centre), 33 . 'It felt like I was a while in the air before hitting something. 'I was thinking: ""This is really it. I am going off a cliff. I am going to die.""' The vertical drop off the ridge was about 200 feet. When he landed he was hurled with the avalanche debris a further 1,500 feet. Suddenly he came to a halt. He was sat bolt upright on the avalanche debris which was about three feet deep. Blood was dripping on the snow from his . face. His camera was undamaged and he took a photograph of his face to . assess his facial injuries. The three experienced mountaineers set off from Chamonix at 1am last Tuesday to climb Mont Blanc (pictured) He said: 'I had cut my nose and my mouth was a bit swollen. My left leg hurt but I knew it wasn’t broken. And that was about it, apart from a few other cuts.' He managed to hobble across the slope, . praying for a signal on his phone, when suddenly 20 minutes later he saw . a red dot near the summit of Bionnassay. It was Ben’s jacket. He could . very faintly hear his friends shouting. He then heard a helicopter. Ally has described how he 'desperately swam and clawed' through the avalanche before being catapulted feet-first down the mountain . His friends had called rescuers some 10 minutes earlier to report their missing friend. They had been following Ally’s tracks leading to the summit of the Bionnassay when suddenly they stopped. Ben said: 'I was walking in the tracks Ally had made and suddenly they stopped dead. I saw there had been an avalanche and did not believe it was survivable. 'I screamed at Misha to call mountain rescue. We told them there had been an avalanche and there was no sign of our friend. It’s really not describable how we felt. 'And then to see this unmistakable speck hobbling around down in the distance a good 25 minutes later was the most wonderful feeling. He was alive and mobile. 'When we were in the rescue helicopter I managed to take a picture of the ridge. It shows how Ali’s trail suddenly stops and the crown of the avalanche.' The trio were airlifted off the mountain and Ally underwent a number of tests in hospital in Aosta, Italy. But he was pronounced fit enough to be discharged later that night. He said: 'It was a very unlucky incident that happened to a very lucky boy. There had been no tell-tale signs. Nothing felt different. Nothing felt strange or unsafe. 'One day I will redo this route but there’s no intention to do it anytime soon.'","Ally Swinton suffered just minor injuries after falling down mountain face .

United Airlines is getting its 787 Dreamliners back in the air after the state-of-the-art aircraft was kept from flying because of a flaw in its lithium batteries. The planes were grounded for four months by the Federal Aviation Authority because of smoldering batteries on 787s owned by other airlines, the first time since 1979 that every plane of a particular type was ordered to stay out of the air for safety reasons . The incidents included an emergency landing of one plane, and a fire on another. A Qatar Airways Boeing 787 Dreamliner in flight. The model was grounded by American authorities because of safety concerns over its battery . The malfunctions never caused any serious injuries but the January grounding embarrassed Boeing, which makes the 787, and disrupted schedules at the eight airlines that were flying the planes. The company had delivered 50 of the planes worldwide.The grounding forced United to delay planned international flights and hurt its first-quarter earnings by $11million. Others, including Japan Airlines and South America's LATAM Airlines Group, also said profits were reduced. LATAM said it still had to make payments on the plane and pay for crews and maintenance. It expects to resume flying soon. United's first 787 flight is scheduled for 11am EDT today and will fly from Houston to Chicago. Fears: The burned auxiliary power unit battery from a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 that caught fire at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts . Passengers didn't appear to be too worried, according to United spokeswoman Christen David. 'We saw strong demand for the flight from the first weekend it opened for sale,' he said. United is planning to use 787s on shorter domestic flights before resuming international flights on June 10 with new Denver-to-Tokyo service as well as temporary Houston-to-London flights. It's adding flights to Tokyo, Shanghai, and Lagos, Nigeria, in August. Those long international flights are the main reason the 787 exists. Its medium size and fuel efficiency are a good fit for long routes. Starting with shorter domestic flights 'will give us a period to ramp up full 787 operations,' David said.

United was the first U.S. airline to get the 787 and now has six. United has said it expects to have four fixed by Monday, with the other two getting their batteries modified in coming days. The 787 uses more electricity than any other jet and it makes more use of lithium-ion batteries because it needs to be able to provide power for things like flight controls and a backup generator when its engines are shut down. Each 787 has two of the batteries. Boeing never did figure out the cause of the battery incidents because of the fire damage. Instead, it redesigned the battery and its charger. The idea was to eliminate all of the possible causes, 787 chief engineer Mike Sinnett said in an online chat on Thursday where he and a Boeing test pilot took questions about the plane. The changes include more heat insulation between each cell and charging the battery to a lower maximum voltage.","First flights since January will take place at 11pm EDT .

A leading campaigner against child abuse says she blames herself for her teenage son's suicide, because she 'couldn't win' against school bullies. Ayden Olsen, 14, was found dead at his family home on Thursday morning. His heartbroken mother Shy Keenan, who campaigns for tougher controls on paedophiles alongside Sara Payne, claims her 'beautiful, kind-hearted' boy was 'bullied to death'. Shy Keenan told a Sunday newspaper that she 'couldn't win' against Ayden's bullies . Today, Miss Keenan said she feels that she was unable to keep her son alive in the face of bullying at school. She told the Sun on Sunday newspaper: 'I think that's why Ayden did it. I was a champion in his eyes and he thought, ""If you can't make it stop, then no one can"".' Ayden was a pupil at Philip Morant School in Colchester, which his twin brother Jarrad also attends. Miss Keenan said Ayden had been bullied since he was 11, shortly after starting at the school. He was accused of assaulting a girl, but despite being cleared by police and social services, bullies continued to taunt him. Miss Keenan told the newspaper that bullies called Ayden, whose father is Japanese-American, 'Asian Ugly' and he would pluck his eyebrows and beg her to let him have cosmetic surgery on his eyes to look less slanted. She said: 'Ayden said the bullies, a gang of about six or seven, would attack him in ""blind spots"" where the CCTV cameras and teachers couldn't see. They would beat him, kick him, even throw flour bombs at him. Ayden would hide the bruises from us, but he couldn't hide his sadness.' More recently, he was taunted after telling a friend he thought he might be gay and had a crush on another pupil. Despite everything, Ayden wanted to stay at Philip Morant to be with his friends and was about to choose his GCSE subjects. He had begun to self-harm and took an overdose in October, but told his father what he had done. Shy Keenan is devastated after her 14-year-old son Ayden Olson was found dead at their Colchester home . A doctor said Ayden would be referred to a psychologist but also told his parents that there was 'virtually nothing' for teenagers like him. On Wednesday evening, Ayden told his mother that he loved her and went to bed about 9.30pm. The next morning, Miss Keenan's husband Tim found Ayden dead in his bedroom. She attemped CPR, but it was too late. She said: 'He was just lying there, his lips blue, blood coming out of his mouth.' 'Then I sat there hugging him and rocking him like I did when he was a baby. I kept thinking, ""If I scream loud enough, I can scream it away"". I cannot bear to think that I will never laugh with him again, never kiss him, never see him.' Miss Keenan revealed the news of her son's death on Twitter on Thursday, writing: ‘Shy and Tim’s beloved son Ayden died today age 14 – no further update at this time...’ A picture of Ayden, with his . name and dates of birth and death, was used as a backdrop to her profile on the social networking site . with the words ‘bullied to death’ written under each photograph. Along with the many messages of . condolence she received, Miss Keenan also posted links to the website of . the charity Bullying UK.

Authorities in hazardous materials suits searched a downtown Spokane, Washington apartment on Saturday while investigating the recent discovery of a pair of letters containing the deadly poison ricin. Few details have been released in the case, and no arrests have been made. Federal investigators have been searching for the person who sent the letters, which were postmarked on Tuesday in Spokane. The letters were addressed to the downtown post office and the adjacent federal building, but authorities have not released a potential motive. They also have not said whether the letters targeted anyone in particular. Investigation: Authorities say a pair of letters containing the deadly poison ricin were sent to this Spokane, Washington post office as well as an adjacent federal building . Ricin is a highly toxic substance made from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms, the size of the head of a pin, can kill an adult if inhaled or ingested. There have been no reports of illness connected to the letters. FBI agents, Spokane police and U.S. Postal Service inspectors descended on the three-story apartment building Saturday morning and the investigation continued into the afternoon. FBI spokeswoman Ayn Sandalo Dietrich would not say whether agents were questioning anyone in connection with the case. 'We are not actively looking for a subject,' Sandalo Dietrich said. 'We are not asking the public's help in bringing someone in.' Despite the hazmat suits, officials said apartment residents were not at risk, and people were seen coming in and out of the brick building in the city's historic Browne's Addition neighborhood. Toxic concoction: Castor beans are used to produce ricin with as little as 500 micrograms of the end product, the size of the head of a pin, able to kill an adult if inhaled or ingested . 'There's no public risk,' Sandalo Dietrich said. Sandalo Dietrich would not say specifically why the FBI was searching the apartment. 'Information we developed led us to believe this was a productive spot to search,' she said. Two letters containing the substance were intercepted at the downtown Spokane post office Tuesday. Previous search: Suited federal officials are seen in the foreground in Corinth, Mississippi during an April search of the deadly toxin after after it was wrongly linked to an Elvis impersonator there . The Postal Service has received no other reports of similar letters, said Jeremy Leder of the Postal Inspection Service on Saturday. In a statement following the discovery, the Postal Service said the 'crude form of the ricin suggests that it does not present a health risk to U.S. Postal Service personnel or to others who may have come in contact with the letter.' The Spokane investigation comes a month after letters containing ricin were addressed to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator and a Mississippi judge. A Mississippi man has been arrested in that case.","Letters believed to have been sent from downtown Spokane apartment building .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:12 EST, 18 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:20 EST, 18 May 2013 . Newly published research suggests that one of the main reasons people enjoy smoking marijuana is because it helps them combat intense feelings of social exclusion. Rather than simply getting high for the heck of it, a research team led by University of Kentucky psychologist Timothy Deckman has found  that cannabis relieves not only physical pain but also emotional pain. As their starting point, Deckman and his team used two recent pieces of research. One that found the pain of social exclusion is more intense than previously thought, and another that revealed physical and emotional pain travel similar pathways in the brain. New research has found that cannabis relieves not only physical pain but also emotional pain . This second piece of research was uncovered after tests found the pain killer Tylenol had helped reduce the pain of social rejection and existential angst in test studies. Since marijuana works through similar brain receptors, Deckman's researchers wondered whether pot could similarly soften the pain of exclusion, reports Pacific Standard. One experiment that helped prove their theory involved surveying more than 5,000 Americans about their level of loneliness, their marijuana usage (if any), and assessed their mental health and feelings of self-worth. Unsurprisingly the researchers found a relationship between loneliness and feelings of self-worth, but that it was significantly weaker for those people that regularly smoked pot. Tests found that people who regularly smoked pot didn't suffer as much from feelings of social exclusion as those who didn't smoke or did so only very rarely . ‘Marijuana use buffered the lonely from both negative self-worth and poor mental health,’ the researchers wrote in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal. Another experiment found people who were experiencing social pain were less likely to have suffered a major depression in the past year if they were regular pot smokers. A third experiment was based around the Cyberball computer game, half the participants in the three-person game received the ball twice early on, and then never again during for the remainder. Afterwards they were asked to react to a series of statements designed to assess whether their need for self-esteem and belonging felt threatened using statements such as, 'I had the feeling that the other players did not like me.' Smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem and social awkwardness, but the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that . The results found that those who frequently smoked marijuana felt less threatened than the others. Deckman and his colleagues have concluded that these studies show 'marijuana use consistently buffered people from the negative consequences associated with loneliness and social exclusion'. They also warned that while marijuana isn't an adequate cure to solving these problems. 'Humans have a fundamental need to belong,' the researchers noted. 'Hurt feelings motivate us to fix our relationships and re-establish social connection.' So while smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem and social awkwardness, the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that.",Tests by researchers at the University of Kentucky found cannabis can act as a buffer against feelings of  negative self-worth and poor mental health .
"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 13:19 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:08 EST, 20 May 2013 . Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla died in prison aged 87 . Former Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla died in his sleep while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity aged 87. Videla took power over Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands of his fellow citizens in a dirty war to eliminate people considered to be subversives. Federal Prison Service Director Victor Hortel said Videla died in the Marcos Paz prison. He was found lifeless in his bed and declared dead at 8:25 a.m.. Videla ran one of the bloodiest military governments during South America's era of dictatorships, and later sought to take full responsibility for kidnappings, tortures, deaths and disappearances when he was tried again and again for these crimes in recent years. He said he knew about everything that happened under his rule because 'I was on top of everyone.' Videla had a low profile before the March 24, 1976, coup, but quickly became the architect of a repressive system that killed about 9,000 people according to official accounts. Human rights activists believe the real number was as high as 30,000. In 2003, during the presidency of . Nestor Kirchner, the Supreme Court nullified the amnesty laws, and a new . era of human rights investigations began, finally reaching the trial . stage in the last few years. In 2010, Videla was condemned to life in . prison for killing 31 political dissidents, and was ordered to serve the . time in common prison. The baby thefts conviction, with its . 50-year sentence, was handed down in 2012. All of the crimes involved in . both convictions were considered crimes against humanity under . Argentine law. Videla ultimately served only five . years in prison after his right to serve his time at home because of his . advanced age was revoked in 2008. Videla died while standing trial in a . case focused on kidnappings and killings related to Operation Condor. This 'dirty war' introduced two frightening terms to the global lexicon of terror: 'disappeareds' - people kidnapped and never seen nor heard from again - and 'death flights,' in which political prisoners were thrown, drugged but alive, from navy planes into the sea. Argentine dictator Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla with Former Paraguayan dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in 1977 . Complaints from families looking for missing loved ones were later heard internationally, and suggested that the regime many Argentines initially welcomed as an antidote to political violence and economic chaos was much bloodier than first thought. 'The disappeareds aren't there, they don't exist,' Videla told a news conference defensively in 1977. Videla's dictatorship also stood out from others in Latin America for its policy of holding pregnant prisoners until they gave birth, and then killing the women while arranging for illegal adoptions of their babies, usually by military or police families. This happened hundreds of times, and the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo rights group has relentlessly sought to reunite these children, now in their 30s, with their biological families. Last year, Videla was convicted and sentenced again, to a 50-year-term, for the thefts of these babies. Adolfo Perez Esquivel, who spent 28 months in prison during the dictatorship and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work documenting Videla's crimes, said the general's death should not be cause for celebration, and urged Argentina's justice system to keep investigating the dirty war era. Videla was among 46 officials of the former regime being sought for extradition by Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon to face trial for crimes against humanity . 'The death of Videla should not bring joy to anyone. We need to keep working for a better society, more just, more humane, so that all this horror doesn't ever happen, never again,' Esquivel said in an interview with Radio Once Diez. Neither does Videla's death end an era, Esquivel said: 'It goes beyond Videla, it's a political system that they implemented throughout the country and in Latin America.' Videla's regime, known as the 'Process of National Reorganization,' fought against armed leftist guerrillas, but these movements were already weakened and nearly destroyed at the time of the coup. The junta soon pursued political opponents, union members, student activists and social workers, rousting people from their homes and torturing them in clandestine detention centers. The process soon spread internationally as the junta joined Operation Condor, an effort launched by Chile's dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet to make sure the countries of South American's southern cone provided no refuge to each other's leftist enemies. 'Paraguay's dictator Alfredo Stroessner joined the pact, as did the leaders of Bolivia, Brasil, and Uruguay. Secret documents released decades later showed that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was kept well informed. Videla told journalists Maria Seone and Vicente Muleiro, authors of his 2001 biography 'The Dictator,' that the three essential elements of his state-sponsored terror campaign were clandestine detention centers, torture to obtain information and the subsequent disappearance of the prisoners, so that they ""don't have identity,"" and are ""neither alive nor dead."" Videla's junta closed Congress, banned political parties, intervened in unions and universities, and imposed an iron censorship over the media. The military leaders engineered a joint venture with the owners of the newspapers La Nacion and Clarin to control newsprint and thus ensure sympathetic coverage. The high point of Videla's regime came in 1978, when Argentina hosted soccer's World Cup. Just blocks from the River Plate stadium where Diego Maradona's goals made Argentina the champion, detainees were being tortured inside the Navy Mechanics School, a leafy campus where thousands were taken, never to be seen again. Argentinian former dictator Jorge Rafael Videla (L) and Reynaldo Bignone (2L), last President of the dictatorship, attending a judgment against them in Buenos Aires . Videla retired in 1981 and handed leadership to a succession of other generals. By then the government was already weakened, pressured by persistent inflation, a sluggish economy and explosive growth in foreign debts after nationalizing the debts of leading private corporations. The dictators then launched an ill-advised war against Britain for the Falkland Islands, which Argentina claims as the Malvinas and considers part of its territory. That military defeat hastened the return of democracy on Dec. 12, 1983. With constitutional rule restored, then-President Raul Alfonsin created a truth commission to investigate the dictatorship's crimes, and its report, titled ""Never Again,"" served as the basis for a historic trial of the dictators, which ended with Videla's first life sentence in 1985. Alfonsin's government also passed amnesty laws designed to put an end to human rights trials for everyone other than the junta leaders, and his successor, President Carlos Menem, then pardoned Videla in 1990. Videla was free until 1998, when a judge charged him in the baby thefts. He spent a month in prison before asserting the right that Argentines over 70 have to house arrest pending trial. Videla came from a long line of military officers dating back to Argentina's war of independence from Spain. He was born on August 2, 1925, in Mercedes, a town in Buenos Aires province. His father, Lt. Col. Rafael Videla, participated in an earlier coup that toppled President Hipolito Yrigoyen in 1930. Following family tradition, he went to Argentina's military college, became a general in 1971 and was designated commander of the army in 1976. He married Alicia Raquel Hartridge in 1948 and had seven children.","Videla took power over Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta .

An illegal file-sharer has been fined a record $1.5million for pirating ten gay porn films online. Kywan Fisher must pay damages of $150,000 per film to adult entertainment company Flava Works, a federal court in Illinois ruled this week. The fine is thought to be the largest ever awarded in a file-sharing case, in part because Mr Fisher failed to show up in court or offer a defence. Fine: Kywan Fisher must pay damages of $1.5million to adult entertainment company Flava Works for illegally sharing ten gay porn films online (file picture) He shared each film online for others to download using BitTorrent, Flava told the hearing. The leaks were traced back to his computer using an individual encryption code inserted in the DVDs he originally bought as pay-per-view items directly from Flava. After Mr Fisher shared the films, they were downloaded or viewed 3,449 times. He was found to have violated the terms of Flava's pay-per-view service and then displayed 'wilful copyright infringement' by sharing the films. Mr Fisher was one of 15 people that Flava took legal action against for pirating its movies, reports the BBC. However, his case was the only one to reach court after the others were dropped for lack of evidence. It is unclear whether he will appeal the ruling or can afford to pay the fine. A study published in September found that people who use file-sharing programs to download films and music from the Internet are likely to have had their computer's virtual address logged. Computer scientists at the University of Birmingham monitored what is perhaps the largest file sharing site, The Pirate Bay, over the last three years. The team discovered that the most popular files on the site, often illegal copies of hit TV shows or films, were monitored by, on average, three secretive parties - including copyright enforcement agencies, security companies and even government research labs. The monitors are believed to be logging the IP address of the user - potentially identifying where the file is downloaded to. However, for anyone now worried about a knock at the door, the researchers say it is unlikely the evidence gathered would be sufficient to lead to court proceedings. When a user chooses to download a file, the users join a 'swarm' of other users who are either downloading the file, of have successfully received it. But by downloading a file, the user's IP address is available to other members of the swarm, and the Birmingham University team found monitors actively grabbing this information.","Kywan Fisher must pay damages of $150,000 per film to adult entertainment company Flava Works ."

They said it wouldn’t last. After all, she was an heiress brought up in the lap of luxury and he was a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. But Millie Mackintosh and Professor Green are clearly determined to prove the doomsayers wrong. After a 15-month romance, they have announced their engagement. Miss Mackintosh, 23, whose family are behind the Quality Street confectionery empire, is to marry Stephen Manderson, the 29-year-old rap star best known as Professor Green. While Manderson grew up on a tough East London council estate and is a former drug dealer, his glamorous fiancée was brought up in a £1.4million townhouse in Bath. She now stars in the E4 reality television series, Made in Chelsea. The couple began dating in December 2011, after he saw her picture on the cover of men’s magazine FHM and asked his publicist to put him in touch. Their relationship was dismissed from the start, with many suggesting it was little more than a publicity stunt. However, Miss Mackintosh has told how her parents Nigel and Georgina have been surprisingly supportive. ‘They thought he seemed kind and a great guy. They’re very accepting parents and they’re happy as long as I’m happy,’ she said. Manderson has admitted: ‘Millie and I are from different places.’ But he added: ‘It doesn’t make that much difference to us. If the difference was race or we were a gay couple, they probably wouldn’t be as quick to point the difference out. But because it’s class, it’s fair game. ‘That’s still prejudice. You’re effectively calling me a commoner – which I am, common as muck. But I’m doing all right for myself, and I’m well-mannered, I’m courteous.’ Sparkler: Millie Mackintosh put a picture of her engagement ting on Instagram following Professor Green's proposal .

Last year was a big year for Michelle Palmer – not least because she gave birth to her second child – and she captured it all on camera to treasure the memories forever. But the 300 photos were lost forever when the memory card they were saved on blew away into the sand during a trip to the beach. Or so she thought. A year later, seven-year-old Jake Holdaway was building sandcastles on the very same beach, when he came across the treasured card. Treasure: Seven year old Jake Holdaway, managed to find a memory card on the beach at West Wittering as he walked with his dad . Arriving home, his father Wesley loaded it on to the family computer and up popped 270 pictures and some video footage. Mr Holdaway, 35, a plumber, then embarked on an extraordinary hunt for the family in the pictures. First, he posted a couple of the pictures on social networking sites, asking friends if they could help him track the family down. He said: ‘I had no luck so I began to zoom in on the photos and listen to the videos to see if anything could tell me who they were. ‘I noticed the little girl had a tag on her leg when she was born so I zoomed in and it said “daughter of Michelle Palmer”. ‘I spent hours trailing through all of the Michelle Palmers on Facebook but nothing matched. Found: Michelle Palmer thought that this photo of her with her daughter Amber when she was born was lost . ‘It got on my nerves so I carried on looking through and saw the little boy in the photos had a school jumper on.’ At that point Mr Holdoway, who lives in Banstead, Surrey with his wife and two children, rang the Brighton school on the jumper and told the receptionist about his search. ‘She told me to send her a picture of the child and to find out who it is. Then she said “Out of interest, what is the mother’s name?” I told her and she said “Oh my god that’s my next door neighbour”. ‘Next thing I knew I got a call from Michelle who was over the moon and I sent her the pictures in the post.’ Jake, who found the memory card, said: ‘I was just digging and kicking . the sand around.

There were also videos of her son Jacob, 6, and Amber, now 21 months, visiting Father Christmas and videos of Amber making her first cooing noises. One of the most treasured memories was a video of Amber with Miss Palmer’s grandmother Jackie Meacock who hit the headlines when she ended her own life in a Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. Miss Palmer said: ‘It was a very special video of my nan as she died in September last year. She is filmed holding Amber in her flat and having a conversation.’ She said she received a call from the receptionist at Jacob’s school on a Monday a few weeks ago when he was off sick.

Greece has threatened to hit Germany with a bill for tens of billions of pounds in outstanding reparations for Nazi war crimes during the Second World War. The move is an indication of growing outrage in Athens at the strictures being placed on the Greek economy by EU paymasters led by Germany.

A British skier plunged hundreds of his feet to his death while trying to reach shelter on Mont Blanc via an icy ridge blasted by freezing winds, it emerged today. The man, who has not been named, found himself trapped on the Aiguille du Midi peak, which is usually reached by the highest cable car in the world. It had stopped working on Saturday night, so the man and a companion tried to find shelter on the mountain, which rises to 12,460 ft (3,842 metres) in altitude above the resort of Chamonix. A British skier has died after he found himself trapped on the Aiguille du Midi peak (pictured), the starting point for the Vallee Blanche . But as they clambered across a ridge to reach the cable station the skier lost his footing and plunged to his death. The second skier survived, and was able to alert the emergency services by mobile phone. He said they had set off earlier in the day to ski the Vallee Blanche, a popular itinerary along the glacial valley at the heart of the Mont Blanc range, but they were forced to change their plans because of the deteriorating weather. He plummeted to his death at around 9pm following a long climb back up towards the ski lift. Mountain rescue teams have yet to recover his body. Captain Patrice Ribes, of the Chamonix mountain rescue force, said the skier could have fallen up to 1,000 metres. He said the two men - who met on the internet to arrange the excursion - would have faced driving winds of up to 100km per hour and heavy snow as they clambered back up the mountain last night. The man, who has not been named, found himself trapped on the Aiguille du Midi peak, the start of the Vallee Blanche above the resort of Chamonix . 'They set off earlier in the day together but then the weather turned bad,' Cpt Ribes said. 'There was a storm and so they decided to turn around and walk back to the cable car. 'They left their skies on the mountain and started to climb. The British man fell from the north face at around 9pm. 'He would have been exhausted from the climb. The winds were very high and the visibility poor. 'We do not know exactly how he fell. We have not found his body.' The man was caught out as he descended the Vallee Blanche, a popular itinerary along the glacial valley at the heart of the Mont Blanc range . A number of climbers and skiers were caught out by high winds last week. On Saturday rescuers found a 21-year-old Frenchwoman who disappeared last Tuesday, suffering from hypothermia in the Mont Blanc range. The Vallee Blanche route starts at the top of the Aiguille du Midi, at an altitude of around 3,800 metres. One of the most dangerous points on the descent comes near the summit where the ground drops away several hundred metres from a narrow ridge. According to local reports, the two skiers were attempting to cross this ridge when the British man fell to his death. His companion made it back to the cable car safely. Cpt Ribes said the Vallee Blanche was a popular route for competent skiers. But he said winds at high altitude could reach speeds which made conditions dangerous for skiing. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in France and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.'","The man found himself trapped on Aiguille du Midi peak .

"By . Michael Zennie and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:05 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 8 April 2013 . Airline complaints surged 20percent last year as grumpy airline passengers complained about being squeezed into smaller seats and flights that are becoming even more packed. An independent review of airlines by researchers at Wichita State and Purdue universities found that United offered the worst service to passengers of all U.S. carriers. Virgin America had the happiest fliers in 2012, according to the Airline Quality Rating, which measures Department of Transportation figures for on-time rates, overbooking, mishandled bags and consumer complaints. Still, researchers found that, overall, airlines appear to be doing a better job, recording fewer late flights, fewer over-bookings and fewer mishandled bags. Cramped: Passengers are complaining more as airlines make seats smaller and pack more passengers onto flights in an effort to maximize profits . But, that doesn't mean passengers are are less grumpy. 'The way airlines have taken 130-seat airplanes and expanded them to 150 seats to squeeze out more revenue I think is finally catching up with them,' said Dean Headley, a business professor at Wichita State University who has co-written the annual report for 23 years. 'People are saying, ""Look, I don't fit here. Do something about this."" At some point airlines can't keep shrinking seats to put more people into the same tube,' he said. For the first time since 2007, the overall airline industry rating dropped from the previous year. Fliers lodged more than 11,400 formal complaints last year, compared to 9,400 in 2011. United had the highest rate of complaints - with 4.24 for every 100,00 passengers. That rate is nearly two and a half times higher than the next-most-complained-about airline, American. Worst: United Airlines had the worst airline quality rating in the country, including the most complaints in 2012 . Best: The relatively-new Virgin America offered the best service, according to Department of Transportation statistics analyzed by researchers . The Airline Quality Report, produced each year by researchers at Wichita State and Purdue universities ranks the nation's airlines based on Department of Transportation statistics. The report takes into account on-time rate, mishandled baggage reports, over-booking and complaints filed. The industry average rating got worse this year for the first time since 2007. (Ranking is from best rating to worst) 'They're just fed up. They’re fed up . to the point that they are willing to make complaints to the Department . of Transportation,' Purdue University Professor Brent Bowen, the . co-author of the report, told MailOnline. 'They try complaining to the airlines, but the airlines don’t care, they’re not responsive and they don’t change.' Professor Bowen said United fared so poorly because 2012 was the first year United and Continental were operating as an integrated airline after their 2010 merger. Consumer satisfaction usually declines dramatically after a merger. 'When you take two mediocre airlines and you put them together, you get one bad one,' Bowen said of the merger. He noted that Delta - rated the best of the major air carriers this year - has only just recovered after its 2008 merger with Northwest. The dependency was smaller when it came to being on time. Hawaiian Airlines performed best at sticking to time schedules in 2012, while Skywest Inc's ExpressJet and AMR Corp's American Airlines were the worst, according to the study. Hawaiian, owned by Hawaiian Holdings Inc, had the best on-time performance last year, at 93.4 percent. The two worst performers were at 76.9 percent. Customer complaints per 100,000 passengers increased from 1.19 in 2011 to 1.43 in 2012, according to the study, a joint project funded as part of faculty research activities at Wichita State and Purdue universities. The industry is even looking at ways . to make today's smaller-than-a-broom closet toilets more compact in the . hope of squeezing a few more seats onto planes. 'I . can't imagine the uproar that making toilets smaller might generate,' Headley said, especially given that passengers increasingly weigh more . than they use to. Nevertheless, 'will it keep them from flying? I doubt . it would.' In recent years, some airlines have shifted to larger planes that can carry more people, but that hasn't been enough to make up for an overall reduction in flights. Punctual: Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time rating in 2012, with 93.4percent of flights sticking to schedule . The rate at which passengers with tickets were denied seats because planes were full rose to 0.97 denials per 10,000 passengers last year, compared with 0.78 in 2011. It used to be in cases of overbookings that airlines usually could find a passenger who would volunteer to give up a seat in exchange for cash, a free ticket or some other compensation with the expectation of catching another flight later that day or the next morning. Not anymore. 'Since flights are so full, there are no seats on those next flights. So people say, ""No, not for $500, not for $1,000,""' said airline industry analyst Robert W. Mann Jr. Regional carrier SkyWest had the highest involuntary denied boardings rate last year, 2.32 per 10,000 passengers. But not every airline overbooks flights in an effort to keep seats full. JetBlue and Virgin America were the industry leaders in avoiding denied boardings, with rates of 0.01 and 0.07, respectively. United Airlines had the highest consumer complaint rate of the 14 airlines included in the report, with 4.24 complaints per 100,000 passengers. That was nearly double the airline's complaint rate the previous year. Southwest had the lowest rate, at 0.25. Consumer complaints were significantly higher in the peak summer travel months of June, July and August when planes are especially crowded. 'As airplanes get fuller, complaints get higher because people just don't like to be sardines,' Mann said. Word of warning: American Airlines is poised to merge with US Airways and the new airline is in danger of losing its customer satisfaction - if other airline mergers is any guide, researchers say . The complaints are regarded as indicators of a larger problem because many passengers may not realize they can file complaints with Transportation Department, which regulates airlines. At the same time complaints were increasing, airlines were doing a better job of getting passengers to their destinations on time. The industry average for on-time arrival rate was 81.8 percent of flights, compared with 80 percent in 2011. Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time performance record, 93.4 percent in 2012. ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst records with only 76.9 percent of their planes arriving on time last year. The industry's on-time performance has improved in recent years, partly due to airlines' decision to cut back on the number of flights. 'We've shown over the 20 years of doing this that whenever the system isn't taxed as much - fewer flights, fewer people, less bags - it performs better. It's when it reaches a critical mass that it starts to fracture,' Headley said. The industry's shift to charging for fees for extra bags, or sometimes charging fees for any bags, has significantly reduced the rate of lost or mishandled bags. Passengers are checking fewer bags than before, and carrying more bags onto planes when permitted. The industry's mishandled bag rate peaked in 2007 at 7.01 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers. It was 3.07 in 2012, down from 3.35 bags the previous year. The report's ratings are based on statistics kept by the department for airlines that carry at least 1 percent of the passengers who flew domestically last year. The airlines covered in the report are Air Tran, Alaska, American, American Eagle, Delta, ExpressJet, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, SkyWest, Southwest, United, US Airways and Virgin America. The research is sponsored by Purdue University in Indiana, and by Wichita State University in Kansas.","United Airlines had the most customer complaints and the lowest ranking in the independent Airline Quality Rating .

"By . Russell Myers and George Arbuthnott . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 27 August 2011 . Red traffic lights will automatically turn green to speed chauffeur-driven dignitaries along special VIP lanes to the London Olympics, while millions of ordinary motorists face gridlock during the Games. High-tech sensors have been buried in lanes that will be used by VIPs to ensure they cannot be held up by traffic lights, congestion or even people crossing the road. Experts have warned that the express routes – even more exclusive than the ZIL lanes used by the Politburo in Soviet Moscow – will bring chaos to London's roads as thousands of spectators, commuters, taxis and commercial vehicles are forced off the main roadway into clogged bus lanes. Wishful thinking: A TfL computer mock-up of how London's Embankment might look with its Olympic lane in place. Right, a typical gridlocked scene from the same road, with traffic clogging lanes in both directions . The Olympic route network . International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge, scandal-hit FIFA chief Sepp Blatter and executives from sponsors Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Visa are among those who will be whisked effortlessly across London. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has discovered that every individual journey taken by Games VIPs will be tracked by computer, allowing engineers to change lights to green if they are in danger of being delayed. Inevitably, other road-users will find the lights turning red against them. Our investigation also found: . Under the terms of London's winning Olympic bid, organisers are expected to provide highly subsidised accommodation to the IOC, international sports federations including FIFA and world athletics body the IAAF and Games sponsors in opulent Park Lane hotels. Organisers are also required to transport 82,000 people dubbed members of the 'Olympic Family' from the hotels to the main event locations in Stratford, East London, in 25 minutes. Olympic VIP cars will not be allowed to exceed speed limits. Clear road ahead: FIFA president Sepp Blatter and partner Ilona Boguska. They will benefit from the preferential VIP treatment . As a result, Transport for London (TfL) and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) received millions of pounds of Government cash to make unprecedented modifications to London's roads to meet the target times and ensure no VIP would be caught up in everyday traffic. However, it is feared that the measures will result in thousands of ordinary people sitting in single-lane jams as Olympic vehicles speed past them using the exclusive Games Lanes. Last night Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said: 'What we are going to see on the streets of London, I fear, is something akin to a Third World nation, with limousines and BMWs being whisked through the traffic carrying hordes of self-appointed VIPs who have placed a raft of drastic and draconian conditions on us to be able to host the Games, while making life pretty unbearable for thousands of everyday Londoners. 'A great fanfare was made when we were all promised that London 2012 would be the most inclusive Games in history which would enrich the city. 'In reality, thousands of IOC members and a host of big-money sponsors and their entourage will be turning up in town expecting to be waited on hand and foot at the expense of everyone else.' London transport chiefs have developed a computer programme called the ONE model that allows analysts to input travel itineraries into a traffic management system which then automatically changes lights to green as dignitaries pass along the route. If the road remains clear, the signalling system will favour the Games Lane traffic, enabling the VIPs and dignitaries to arrive from their Park Lane hotels to the Olympic Stadium in the time agreed by the London 2012 bidding team and the IOC. However, if there is congestion along the route, TfL's specialised SCOOT system – which was dramatically improved using £12million of public money – can alter traffic signals in the immediate and surrounding areas to further favour the VIP cars. The SCOOT system uses pressure sensors built into the road to monitor the volume of traffic on specific busy London routes. The sensors send information to traffic signals placed just yards away to decide the timings between light changes depending on congestion. Staff monitoring the delegates' car fleet on computer screens in their Canary Wharf base can take the further step of instructing a team of 30 TfL engineers in South London to manually change lights along the Games Lane to green if the convoy is in danger of not arriving on time, giving the VIPs priority over other motorists. Olympics organisers have also admitted that heads of state will be able to bypass traffic and access the exclusive roads on the advice of security services. The 30-mile Games Lanes in London are part of a wider road map called the Olympic Route Network (ORN) linking Games venues and the surrounding areas. The total network covers 109 miles of roads as some venues are outside London. Major traffic restrictions will be enforced along the whole route between 6am and midnight during the 30 days of Olympic and Paralympic events. Rings road: The BMW courtesy cars provided for VIPs will glide along thanks to the signs denoting lanes for Olympic officials only . Organisers are still deciding whether to enforce the restrictions during a 15-day break between the Olympic and Paralympics – August 12 to 29 – even though very few dignitaries will be in London. These will include bans on parking and right turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings and phasing of traffic lights. Some roads, including Constitution Hill and Birdcage Walk, surrounding Buckingham Palace will be completely closed to the public – providing sole access to the VIP vehicles and further disrupting journeys for ordinary motorists who will be forced to take alternative routes. There will also be temporary ZIL lanes when Olympic events are taking place outside London. These will operate on the M4, M11, M3, M27 and A13. The measures, which have cost £25million to implement, are solely aimed at speeding up Games traffic. But safety concerns have been raised over the removal of pedestrian crossings. John Biggs, London Assembly Member for City and East, said: 'On some parts of the ORN it will not only be pretty horrendous for travellers, but some pedestrian crossings and right-hand turns which will be abolished previously had fatalities on them, which is a great cause for concern. 'We've spent a lot of time down the years putting in extra crossings and trying to reduce the impact of the traffic, and I think we need to be careful that we are not abandoning safety issues just to mollycoddle the Olympics bigwigs.' Opposition: Steve McNamara, left, spokesman for the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, said his members could take disruptive action. John Biggs, right, said the plans for VIP lanes would be 'horrendous' for travellers . Meanwhile the plan has led to a threat from London taxi drivers to hijack Olympic routes and bring the capital to a standstill in protest. They claim route restrictions will double journey times to some of the most popular shopping and tourist destinations. Steve McNamara, spokesman for the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said: 'Our members are extremely angry about the current plans and we can't rule out any disruptive action during the Games. 'Three years ago we did a demonstration in Trafalgar Square which brought the city to a standstill. 'All we want is somebody to see common sense and allow us to turn off the roads because at the moment we could be doubling our journey times as we aren't being permitted to turn right across these Games Lanes.' The traffic plans come as a result of a 'Host City Contract' comprising a series of legally binding requirements drawn up in 2005 between the IOC and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG). It stipulates that 82,000 'Olympic Family' members – made up of athletes, officials and VIP guests – should be transported to event venues in times far faster than existing journey durations. Luxury: A restaurant at the London Hilton on Park Lane, where dignitaries will be staying in heavily subsidised rooms .

It will include a top-of-the-range BMW 520d which has a top . speed of 144mph and reaches 0-60mph in 8.2 seconds. Legendary rock band The Who are set to be the headline act for the closing ceremony of next year's London Olympics. Founder members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend have agreed to a request to perform but sources close to the band said details of the deal still had to be 'thrashed out'. The Who are famed for their energetic performances – and their appearance at the Olympics will guarantee them a global audience of several billion. The band was formed in 1964 by lead singer Daltrey, guitarist Townshend, bass player John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. Along with their musical success – they have sold about 100 million records – they also became known for their excessive lifestyle and drug-fuelled debauchery. Charismatic drummer Moon died aged 32 in 1978 after overdosing on prescription pills. Entwistle died aged 57 in 2002. Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who, and in 2006 released the album Endless Wire. It . has also been rumoured that the German car-maker's Series 7 limousines, . worth £60,000, may be used because they can be upgraded with . anti-missile warning systems, armour plating, bulletproof glass and . sealed passenger areas to resist gas attacks. The VIPs' Park Lane hotels are expected to include the five-star Intercontinental, Four Seasons, Metropolitan and the London Hilton Park Lane – where FIFA Committee members are believed to be staying. Meanwhile, athletes will be allowed to travel along the Games Lanes, but only by bus or bicycle as they are excluded from using the luxury BMW saloon cars given to IOC chiefs and sponsors. The athletes will have access to 400 BMW Pedelec electrically-assisted bicycles. Competitors will make up just one-fifth of the total number of people accredited to use the Games Lanes, with most athletes expected to be staying on the Olympic Park. Other vehicles in the fleet are 200 electric cars, including Mini Es and BMW 1 Series Active Es and R1200RT, R1200GS and F650GS BMW motorcycles. Hybrid cars may also be in operation. The car fleet will be stored in Hyde Park next to Park Lane and at East London's Excel Centre.
