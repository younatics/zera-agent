"A young married couple have died within hours of each other after the husband mysteriously collapsed and passed away before his cancer-stricken wife succumbed to her disease. Neil Carruthers, 34, was caring for his wife, Tina Nedelcu Carruthers, 29, who was suffering from a brain tumor, when he collapsed as he left her bedroom in Stoneham, Massachusetts on August 11. His mother Rosanne, a nurse, desperately tried to revive him but neither she nor emergency responders could save him and he died in Winchester Hospital. The sudden death of the active man has left relatives and doctors baffled. He had attended a physical with a doctor just days prior and nothing seemed amiss. Heartbreaking: Neil and Tina Carruthers, pictured together at their wedding in 2010, died just 46 hours apart last August . An autopsy is being carried out on his body to determine his cause of death. That night, his mother broke the news to Tina - who had lost her ability to speak - and she appeared to understand, Rosanne told the Boston Globe. 'When I came home, . I went in and I held her hand and I told her, ""Tina, he didn't make it, . he's going to have to be there waiting for you,"" and tears ran right . down her cheeks,' Rosanne said. Just 46 hours later, Tina passed away while in hospice care. Fighter: Tina, pictured wearing a wig, was diagnosed with a brain tumor just nine months after they married in 2010 . Tina, who grew up in Romania before moving to the U.S. aged seven, was first diagnosed with a brain tumor after she began suffering seizures out of high school. She underwent surgery in 2006 which left her temporarily paralyzed and she had to learn how to talk and walk again. Neil Carruthers' mother . But after the operation, she was deemed cancer free - and soon after, she met Neil on a Christian Adventist dating website, where they bonded over their faith. The couple married on September 5, 2010 in Lawrenceville, Georgia - near to Tina's home - and even though he knew his wife's illness might return, he remained devoted to her and her care. 'He told me, ""Mom, whatever time we have I want to spend with her"",' Rosanne told the Globe. Nine months after their wedding, the cancer did indeed return and this time it could not be beaten. In love: The couple had met on a Christian dating website and soon started a relationship . Together: Neil had left his job to care for his wife full time - and they died just 46 hours apart from each other . But 'he never, never gave up,' his mother said. 'When she lost her speech, I would have been so frustrated. He'd . say, ""Mom, she can tell me so much with her eyes... She . can tell me more than most people can tell me with words"".' The couple moved in with Neil's parents in Stoneham and he gave up his job at Winchester Hospital so that he could care for her full time. He enjoyed reading her Bible passages, his mother said. 'I know he was helping to prepare her,' Rosanne said. 'But for me as a mother, as a Christian, it was as if she was preparing him as well.' The couple will be remembered at a joint funeral in Stoneham on Saturday. 'God knew they were going to go at the same time,' Rosanne said.","Neil Carruthers died just 46 hours before his wife Tina in August .

"Pets doing silly things and even Taylor Swift's latest video may generate millions of views, but it's a video that shows a woman removing toys out of packaged that is the internet's top earner. According to a video analytics platform called OpenSlate, the highest YouTube earner of 2014 made nearly $5 million just by opening Disney toy packages. The DC Toys Collector YouTube channel features a woman removing the toys and then putting them together. Like christmas every day: Mysterious toy-unboxer DC Toys Collector was the most popular YouTube channel in October with 400m views a month . Another gift: The channel features a young woman in intricately painted nails removing the toys from their packaging and then assembling them . The channel features over 1,600 videos and gets 380 million views a month. Its most-played video is Play-Doh Sparkle Disney Princesses. The video has been viewed more than 172 million times since it was posted in July. Unboxing is a relatively new genre of YouTube videos, and DC Toys Collector  struck while the iron was hot. Unboxing videos show off the features of a product, most often a piece of technology. Essentially the videos are a virtual tour of a product in which you're interested. Here, the user unboxes everything from Disney princesses, to tubs of Play-Doh, to Lego sets. Toy unboxing usually shows the narrator assembling a toy for the viewer. Playtime: The channel has about one new video a day. DC Collector is part of a new, highly lucrative genre of online videos called 'unboxing' Unreal: The one-woman toy-reviewing YouTuber called DC Toys Collector is making more money than most CEOs . Only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen. Despite the channel's massive, sweeping, and somewhat perplexing popularity, no one — neither the toddlers who watch it along with their parents, nor executives at YouTube seem to know who is behind it. Children love the videos. One uploaded to DC Toys Collector's channel on Friday called Teletubbies Stacking Cups Surprise Eggs Play-Doh already has 200,000 views. All her videos start the same way with the toy being introduced. The woman then goes on to open and 'play' with the children's toy pointing out various 'adorable' features. Dane Golden, who works in the YouTube channel ecosystem as the VP of marketing at Octoly has followed Disney Collector for some time. 'What I believe to be true is that kids are loving this because the woman never shows her face,' Golden said to BuzzFeed. 'You never see anything but her well-manicured hands. She has a very comforting voice. It's just like playing with other kids playing toys. I think she disappears in the mind of the children.' So simple: The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses, to tubs of Play-Doh, to Lego sets .

"Ricard: 'Meditation is not just blissing out under a mango tree but it completely changes your brain' A French genetic scientist may seem like an unusual person to hold the title - but Matthieu Ricard is the world's happiest man, according to researchers. The 66-year-old turned his back on Parisian intellectual life 40 years ago and moved to India to study Buddhism. He is now a close confidante of the Dalai Lama and respected western scholar of religion. Now it seems daily meditation has had other benefits - enhancing Mr Ricard's capacity for joy. Neuroscientist Richard Davidson wired up the monk's skull with 256 sensors at the University of Wisconsin as part of research on hundreds of advanced practitioners of . meditation. The scans showed that when meditating on . compassion, Ricard's brain produces a level of gamma waves - those . linked to consciousness, attention, learning and memory - 'never . reported before in the neuroscience literature', Davidson said. The scans also showed excessive activity . in his brain's left prefrontal cortex compared to its right . counterpart, giving him an abnormally large capacity for happiness and a . reduced propensity towards negativity, researchers believe. Research into the phenomenon, known as . ""neuroplasticity"", is in its infancy and Ricard has been at the . forefront of ground-breaking experiments along with other leading . scientists across the world. 'We have been looking for 12 years at . the effect of short and long-term mind-training through meditation on . attention, on compassion, on emotional balance,' he said. 'We've found remarkable results with . long-term practitioners who did 50,000 rounds of meditation, but also . with three weeks of 20 minutes a day, which of course is more applicable . to our modern times.' Scroll down for video . Andy Francis (left) and associate scientist and Antoine Lutz (right) outfit Matthieu Ricard with a net of 128 sensors . A computer monitor displays graphic renderings of Matthieu Ricard's brain during an MRI test at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . He added to AFP: 'It's a wonderful area of research . because it shows that meditation is not just blissing out under a mango . tree but it completely changes your brain and therefore changes what you . are.' He believes meditation can alter the brain and improve people's happiness in the same way that lifting weights puts on muscle. The son of philosopher . Jean-Francois Revel and abstract watercolour painter Yahne Le Toumelin, . became something of a celebrity after writing 'The Monk And The . Philosopher' with his father. This was a dialogue on the meaning of . life. He followed up with a practical guide in 2011 called 'The Art Of Meditation' making the case for why others should follow the same path. The Art of Meditation is published by Atlantic Books . Mattieu Ricard has spoken about The Art of Meditation in a video hosted by the charity RSA. Here are some hints and tips... Mr Ricard has undergone a battery of tests, including an MRI (left) to reveal how his 'enlightened' mind works . A computer monitor displays data being recorded during an EEG test conducted with Mr Ricard . Matthieu Ricard is a close confidante of the Dalai Lama . Ricard said: 'That was the end of my quiet time because it was a bestseller. Suddenly I was projected into the western world. Then I did more dialogues with scientists and the whole thing started to spin off out of control. 'I got really involved in science research and the science of meditation.' A prominent monk in Kathmandu's Shechen Monastery, Ricard divides his year between isolated meditation, scientific research and accompanying the Dalai Lama as his adviser on trips to French-speaking countries and science conferences. He addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos at the height of the financial crisis in 2009 to tell gathered heads of state and business leaders it was time to give up greed in favour of ""enlightened altruism"". He was awarded the French National Order of Merit for his work in preserving Himalayan culture but it is his work on the science of happiness which perhaps defines him best.Ricard sees living a good life, and showing compassion, not as a religious edict revealed from on high, but as a practical route to happiness. 'Try sincerely to check, to investigate,' he said. 'That's what Buddhism has been trying to unravel - the mechanism of happiness and suffering. It is a science of the mind.'

"Imagine if all the secessionist movements in the history of the United States were successful. Imagine if all the proposals put forward for states to withdraw from the union of the Unites States actually went ahead, how would America look today? Those questions have been answered by a map that predicts the alternate universe of the USA based on all the threats or aspirations to secede from the United States. The map, created by Mansfield University geogapher professor Andrew Shears, breaks the country up into 124 states. The west and middle America: Take a look at some of the proposals for new states that have popped up over the years. California would be split into five states. Texas would become five, as well . The west and middle America: Take a look at some of the proposals for new states that have popped up over the years. California would be split into five states. Texas would become five, as well . The East: New York City and Long Island would be their own states, separate from Upstate New York, which would be called 'Empire.' Florida is split into three states and the Mississippi and Alabama Gulf Coast becomes 'West Florida' While some are almost laughable - such as Red Wisconsin and Blue Wisconsin, and Little Egypt - others make perfect sense, such as splitting Florida into north and south to protect Miami from the rest of the state. Currently there's an attempt to create the State of Jefferson in north California and south Oregon. A ballot initiative will decide whether it goes ahead in 2014. Earlier this year, a handful of counties in Colorado tried to secede from the rest of the state. Professor Shears said he came with the idea came from the serious possibilities at how different America could look and be today. Now that's more like it: The 50 united states of America look simple compared to Shears' map . 'Most of my life, I've daydreamed about history — not so much the incredible depth of historical events that have already occurred, good thinking as that might be,' he told The Washington Post. 'No, I've constantly fictionalized history by changing the outcome of one event here and there and exploring the possibilities of what would have come next. 'Sometimes I come up with some utterly ridiculous progressions on these alternate timelines of whole new worlds based on relatively minor changes.' Perhaps the most well-known secessionist movement was the State of Franklin, which existed for four and a half years before collapsing in 1789 and being re-admitted to North Carolina after it failed to support itself economically.","Mansfield University professor Andrew Shears has developed a map showing how the USA would look if the secessionist movements throughout history would have been successful .

"President Barack Obama brought the infamous shooting of Michael Brown, a Ferguson, Missouri teen, into his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, citing it as evidence that the U.S. has 'our own racial and ethnic tensions' that compare to the sectarian genocide and ethnic cleansing plaguing the Middle East.' His remarks focused mostly on armed clashes in Ukraine and on a vicious jihad in Iraq and Syria where a terror group has beheaded journalists for a global Internet audience, where hundreds of thousands have died, and where millions have fled as refugees. 'I realize that America's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals; that America has plenty of problems within our own borders,' he told representatives of 193 countries gathered in New York City. 'This is true.' 'We have our own racial and ethnic tensions': Obama brought the August shooting in Ferguson, MIssouri into his speech condemning ISIS terrorists for a genocidal march across parts of Syria and Iraq . WILD: The murderous Islamist terror group ISIS has mass-slaughtered fellow Muslims for the crime of belonging to the wrong religious sect . MILD: Michael Brown's police-shooting death followed his participation in a convenience-story robbery, but civil rights protesters descended on the town of Ferguson, Missouri to demand the cop's prosecution . 'In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.' Michael Brown, a black teen who had just committed a strong-arm robbery, was shot multiple times and killed on August 9 by a white police officer, following a physical altercation. The case brought American racial animus out from its periodic hibernation. Agitators from as far away as California and Maine descended on the St. Louis suburb for marches, looting and more than a week of nightly riots. Attorney General Eric Holder personally visited Ferguson and hinted that the federal government could pursue a criminal case against the officer under federal civil rights laws, even if a Missouri Grand Jury decides no to indict him. Reaction to Obama's inclusion of the Ferguson episode in a speech about global terrorism and military invasions was swift but mostly confined to social media. Online critics complained that a moral equivalence between Ferguson and Erbil is unfair because – among many reasons – it allows dictators and terror ringleaders to dismiss their mass killings as comparable to a police action gone awry. 'It suggests they are morally equal,' former longtime American UN-mission spokesman Richard Grenell tweeted. The worst of it: Looters descended on a convenience store during the riots that followed the Michael Brown shooting in August; no one was killed . Reaction online was immediate and overwhelmingly opposed to comparing Missouri with Syria or Iraq . A former spokesman for the US mission to the United Nations vented his disgust on Twitter . Washington Post chief White House correspondent Scott Wilson, however, had words of praise. The Ferguson reference, he tweeted, was 'Obama at his best – a view of American exceptionalism that demands work, politics [and] change to make [the] country better.' Few on Capitol Hill were willing to engage on the subject on Wednesday. Spokespersons for eight members of Congress, including four Republicans and three Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus, declined to comment on the record. Only one House Republican official, who insisted on anonymity, was willing to speak to MailOnline. He said the president was 'tone deaf to the Nth power' for suggesting 'the America's race squabbles are in the same universe as the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East.' 'If it weren't so outrageous,' he said, 'it would be outright hilarious.' This Washington Post correspondent swam against the current, insisting that Obama made a smart move . Moral equivalency? One congressional staffer said 'if it weren't so outrageous, it would be outright hilarious' The others chose not to weigh in despite the language in which Obama couched his comparison of a lone policeman's controversial decision with the systematic execution of countless Muslims by other Muslims. 'We welcome the scrutiny of the world, he insisted, 'because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems and make our union more perfect.' America is not the same as it was 100 years ago, 50 years ago, or even a decade ago,' Obama insisted, because the U.S. carves out 'a place for people of every race and religion.'","US president spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, castigating the ISIS terror group's 'network of death'

"Melissa Harris-Perry has been forced to apologize Tuesday, two days after her MSNBC political commentary show turned Mitt Romney's adopted black grandson into the butt of a political joke. Harris-Perry stirred the pot on the segment Sunday by displaying a giant photo of Mitt Romney's extended family Christmas photo to a panel of liberal pundits and comedians. 'It really sums up the diversity of the Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black person,' joked Dean Obeidallah, just one of the uncouth digs the group made at the expense of Kieran Romney. Scroll down for video . Outrage: A panel on MSNBC show Melissa Harris-Perry enraged some viewers Sunday with a segment that made Mitt Romney's black adopted grandson the butt of a joke . 'Poor judgment': Harris-Perry apologized for asking guests to comment on the Romney family portrait . Harris-Perry is herself African-American and her show often focuses on black issues. The seemingly light-hearted segment presented photos and asked panelists to 'caption' them them jokes and commentary. 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same,' said actress Pia Glenn. For her part, Harris-Perry did not directly ridicule the baby but did quip that she looked forward to a 2040 'wedding between Kieran Romney and North West.' On Tuesday, Sarah Palin called the joke 'despicable' and said MSNBC should be ashamed of itself for allowing the segment to go to air. 'Leftist media hounds are not . expressing an opinion with this attack; they are expressing a prejudice . that would never be accepted if it came from anyone else but the . lib[eral] media,' Palin wrote on her Facebook page in a post . accompanying the photo of the Romney family. 'This latest attack from the Left is despicable.' She added: 'You really need a conscience, yellow journalists. May your 2014 New Year's Resolution be to find one.' 'It really sums up the diversity of the Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black person,' joked comedian Dean Obeidallah (left) ¿One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn¿t the same,¿ quipped actress Pia Glenn (far left) While Harris-Perry is black, as are many of her guests, the segment has outraged many conservatives who say the comments unfairly attacked the baby and were wholly inappropriate . The host also called the baby, who was adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben and his wife in September, 'gorgeous.' Other conservatives immediately swarmed to social media, furious over the insensitive segment. 'MSNBC has become a club where the smug go to exchange hateful opinions and reassure each other it's acceptable,' tweeted Romney 2012 senior adviser Stuart Stevens. 'Wildly inappropriate incident. Viewers and the Romney family deserve better,' tweeted one-term Massachusetts senator and ladies magazine centerfold Scott Brown. Kieran, pictured with his mother Andelyne, has been adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben . Shortly thereafter, Glenn—who is herself a woman of color— apologized. 'Adoptive parents giving a child of ANY ethnicity a loving home, I apologize. I absolutely did not intend to harm you but it seems that I have,' she tweeted. On Tuesday, in a series of tweets, Melissa Harris-Perry apologized to the Romney family. 'I am sorry. Without reservation or qualification. I apologize to the Romney family,' she tweeted, with the hastag #MHPapology. 'I work by guiding principle that those who offend do not have the right to tell those they hurt that they r wrong for hurting. 'Therefore, while I meant no offense, I want to immediately apologize to the Romney family for hurting them.' She added that as a black child born into large white Mormon family 'I feel familiarity w/ Romney family pic & never meant to suggest otherwise.' 'I apologize to all families built on loving transracial adoptions who feel I degraded their lives or choices,' she concluded.' Comedian Dean Obeidallah sought to defend himself in an article on the Daily Beast. He said he had received scores of nasty tweets from people calling him a 'baby-bullying bigot.' 'You may think (my joke was) funny, unfunny, cliché, idiotic, etc. Comedy is subjective,' he wrote. 'But say what you will about my quip, I didn't criticize the Romney family for adopting the baby nor did I mock baby Kieran in any way. Nor would I. 'My joke was about the lack of racial diversity we see at the Republican National Convention—a topic lampooned for years by comedians.' The baby boy became the center of a different sort of controversy after revelations that his name means 'little and black' in Gaelic made headlines in September.","Host Melissa Harris-Perry led guests in a segment that ridiculed a photo of the extensive Romney family and its single black member, a baby .

"A GP has made a passionate attack on the sickness benefits culture by using Professor Stephen Hawking as an example of someone not held back by disability. Dr Phil Peverely was so incensed by the thousands of patients ‘hell-bent’ on trying to prove they are ill just to claim benefits that he considered displaying a poster of the physicist with the caption: ‘This bloke is not on the sick.’ He described how entire surgeries are filled with the ‘disgruntled unworking well’ who are ‘full of indignation at being considered reasonably healthy’. Sign: Professor Stephen Hawking suffers from motor neuron disease, but is one of the most celebrated theoretical physicists in the world . The doctor, who practises in . Sunderland, said it was absurd how he was being asked to spend so much . time trying to prove patients were ill when he was meant to be making . them better. ‘We are, as a profession, dedicated . to making our patients as healthy as possible, and yet a proportion of . punters are hell-bent on trying to prove they’re really ill, and need us . to confirm it,’ he said in a column for the doctors’ magazine Pulse. ‘The fact is, nearly everyone is . capable of some kind of work. I had considered, at one point, putting up . a portrait of Professor Stephen Hawking in my consulting room with a . caption that said, “This bloke is not on the sick.” ’ Professor Hawking has motor neurone . disease, which has left him almost entirely paralysed and only able to . communicate through a speech-generating device. Criticism: GPs should not be responsible for signing people off as too ill to work, argues Dr Phil Peverley (file picture) Despite his . disabilities, he is one of the most eminent scientists in the world and . has won numerous awards for his research. Dr Peverely said GPs were ‘wasting far too much time’ assessing whether patients were well enough to work. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has argued many people on sickness benefits are capable of work . ‘The dilemma of constantly dealing . with requests to confirm illnesses that I have already sorted out is . wasting far too much time and muddying the doctor-patient relationship,’ he wrote. Government figures published earlier . this year showed that only one in eight people on sickness benefits was . really too ill to work. Yet polls have shown that three . quarters of GPs feel obliged to issue the sick notes to patients even if . there is no medical need. Dr Peverely, who has been a GP for 26 . years, said being deemed ‘fit to work’ didn’t mean that patients had to . be available for a strenuous job. ‘Being found fit for some kind of . employment by Atos [the firm that oversees the assessments] does not . mean you’re necessarily capable of being an FBI agent or a lumberjack,’ he wrote. ‘However, you might be able to work at a desk on a telephone, or hold a lollipop on a zebra crossing. ‘And we all know, without any shadow . of a doubt, that any form of regular employment is not only financially . beneficial but also leads to less depression, greater social contact, . increased well-being, a decreasing tendency to addiction and social . deprivation, and an increased likelihood of being in a stable . relationship.’ In May a poll of 4,000 family doctors . by the Department for Work and Pensions found that three quarters felt . obliged to issue sick notes, which allow patients to claim benefits, . even though they were not strictly ill. Many doctors admitted they did not . know enough about the system and were compelled to sign patients off if . they had emotional problems.","Dr Phil Peverley urges ministers to strip GPs of role in signing sick notes .

Shocking: Bo Mounsombath, 33, allegedly jumped in her car when she was being given a parking citation, though she claims she thought the meter maid was trying to sexually harass her . It took a moment before Yates realized there was a man clinging to the hood of the speeding vehicle. Yates told Hoodline that she caught up with the car a few blocks later and snapped the photo.

San Francisco police say Mounsombath was trying to flee a parking ticket when she sped at an officer and hit a motorcyclist while Mounsombath claims she bolted because she believed the man was posing as a parking attendant to solicit sexual favors. Mounsombath told KRON 4 the officer said she could 'do things instead of getting a parking citation which led me to believe he was posing as a meter maid.' Distraught, she climbed into the car to get away and the officer jumped on the hood. Mounsombath says she stopped several times. 'At one point the cars were stopped at the light and she actually hopped out,' Yates confirmed, saying that at least once the officer had a chance to get off. Video courtesy of KRON 4 .

SFPD spokesperson Officer Albie Esparza confirmed that a parking attendant was involved in the altercation, saying he was issuing a citation when Mounsombath got in the car and sped at the officer.

Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment . Pictures which V. Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City were released yesterday by MailOnline . The images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face. In . one photograph, taken after Sunday's alleged assault outside the . Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a . huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin.

Denial: Dominick Diorio's attorney denied the charges on behalf of his client after a brief court appearance on Wednesday, pictured . Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible. Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment. He was initially changed with assault and a hate crime but these charges were reduced to assault in the hearing. Diorio's attorney, David Scott Smith, told The New York Post that he is pleased the hate crime charges have been dropped. 'I’d like to commend the District Attorney’s Office for deciding not to prosecute my client for a hate crime and to consent to his release without bail,' said Smith. 'I’m confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, that Miss Stiviano’s allegations will likewise begin to fail and at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed as well.' Diorio, who was reportedly celebrating his 40th birthday before the alleged run-in with Stiviano, appeared to have a small amount of bruising on his face. He allegedly told investigators he just 'slipped and fell' after a woman threw a phone at him. However, Stiviano offers an alternative explanation for his injuries. She claims he and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse at her during a random attack on Sunday evening. She claims their slurs included the N-word. Watch Video Here: .

'The defendant and another unapprehended individual followed her down the street while repeatedly calling her a ‘[n-word] bitch’ and a ‘whore,’ according to Stiviano's criminal complaint. 'The defendant reached through an open taxi window and struck her in the face with his closed fist.' According to Stiviano, Diorio and his friend spat at her before screaming racial obscenities at her. ’Yeah, I’ll f*****g hit a girl. I’ll hit you, you n****r b***h,’ the DA quoted Diorio as saying according to The New York Post. Donald Sterling pictured out shopping yesterday at the Grove in Hollywood, California . Shelly Sterling, wife to former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, stepped out for dinner at celebrity hotspot Craig's in west Hollywood last night . Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report on Sunday, officers had not been investigating the fight. But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police. He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday. Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock.

Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball. He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month. However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

"President Barack Obama has acted so unlawfully that he 'probably' wouldn't survive an impeachment vote in the House of Representatives, Republican Rep. Lou Barletta told a radio host on Monday. 'He’s just absolutely ignoring the Constitution, and ignoring the laws . and ignoring the checks and balances,' the Pennsylvania lawmaker told News Radio 910 WSBA personality Gary Sutton yesterday. 'The problem is, what . do you do?' Barletta continued. 'For those that say impeach him for breaking the laws or . bypassing the laws — could that pass in the House? It probably could.' Rep. Lou Barletta, pictured here in 2011, told a radio host yesterday that President Barack Obama 'probably' wouldn't survive an impeachment vote in the House of Representatives . 'Is . the majority of the American people in favor of impeaching the . president? I’m not sure about that.' 'I don't think so,' the Pennsylvania radio host can be heard telling Barletta in audio of their conversation captured by Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczyinski. Barletta made the comments during a discussion on illegal immigration after Sutton argued that the president wasn't 'faithfully executing the laws of this country.' 'Well we have a president that has taken this to a new level,' Barletta said of Obama's actions before explaining how he thinks impeachment proceeding would hypothetically play out in the House. After the interview Democratic National Committee spokesman Ian Sams told a Pennsylvania newspaper that 'while Republicans are confident a political vote as outrageous and ill-founded as this could pass, let’s not forget all the commonsense initiatives they refuse to even bring up for a vote.' The GOP ought to be focusing its efforts on passing legislation that would reform the country's immigration system, raise the minimum wage and make equal pay for women a legal requirement, Sams told the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader in an email. 'Republicans in the House are clearly committed to . playing politics and relying on outrageous rhetoric instead of doing the . job they were elected to do – standing up for the interests of the . American people,' he wrote. In the same article Barletta’s communications director, Tim Murtaugh, is quoted as saying his boss was not 'advocating or proposing' that the House impeach Obama. The congressman was merely relating one proposed way Congress could stop the president's 'consistent disregard for the law,' Murtaugh said. His 'full answer is this: . ‘Could that pass the House? Probably. Would the Senate ever convict? Certainly not.' 'There’s not the will nationally to remove the president, . so would it be wise to pursue that? Or would it be harmful to the . country? Surely the latter,' Murtaugh said. 'He's just absolutely ignoring the Constitution, and ignoring the laws and ignoring the checks and balances,' Barletta said of the president, who is pictured here in Pittsburgh this morning . In the radio interview on News Radio 910 WSBA, Barletta also cast aspersions on politicians who are perceived as abandoning their constituents. The embarrassing blow former House Majority Leader and Virginia Congressman Eric Cantor suffered last week when he lost his primary election would be the fate of other elected leaders across the country if they don't shape up, Barletta predicted. 'If they don't feel that you're . standing up for them, then they're gonna throw you out, and they're . gonna throw somebody else in,' Barletta said. Cantor became the first sitting House Majority Leader to get kicked out of office since the position was created when he lost the Republican primary for his congressional seat a week ago today to a political novice he trounced in spending. Conservatives in Cantor's state denounced the seven-term representative after the election as being a power-hungry jet setter who had lost touch with the needs of his district. 'There's a big message . here that people in Washington better pay close attention to,' Barletta said.","Republican Rep.

"If someone says she's over the hill they must be referring to Edythe Kirchmaier's accelerating car, as the young-at-heart 105-year-old has just passed her driving test. The great-grandmother of 17 from Santa Barbara, who also holds the record for being the oldest person on Facebook, is not slowing down despite her advancing years. She has been officially declared the oldest driver in California after passing her test to renew her license on Wednesday - which she described as a 'snap'. Putting her foot down: Determined Edythe Kirchmaier refuses to give up driving despite her age. The 105-year-old renewed her license the day after her birthday on Wednesday keeping it valid until 2017 . A long journey: Edythe Kirchmaier started driving in a Model A Ford . Coupe, pictured, and now drives a Dodge Caravan, below. The Santa Barbara . great-grandmother said: 'I couldn't imagine myself without a car' Modern woman: As well as being one of the country's oldest drivers Edythe Kirchmaier also holds the record as the oldest member of Facebook . Speaking on the Ellen DeGeneres show, to mark her 105th birthday on Tuesday, she said: 'I'm the oldest living driver in California and maybe the United States. I do have a secret - but if I tell it it won't be a secret.' Mrs Kirchmaier has competition in the oldest driver stakes. Verna Traux from Parksberg, Iowa, was declared the world's oldest driver at 105 in 2010 and drove until her death the following year. But national record or not, one thing that is for sure is that Mrs Kirchmaier must have one of the best safety records for operating a vehicle. The charity volunteer, who started driving back in 1927 in a Model A Ford Coupe, has never been in an accident or so much as received a parking ticket in her 86 years behind the wheel. The roads, let alone petrol prices, may have changed a lot but there was no way she was going to give up her independence. Keep positive: Edythe Kirchmaier, left, said the secret to her record breaking life was to remain upbeat, happy and laid back. She loves her 'wonderful family' right . Happy marriage: Edythe Kirchmaier was married to her husband Joseph for 70 years before he died in 2008 at the age of 1998. The couple has two children, 6 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren . 'When I learned to drive, there were no rules of the road,' she told Fox News. 'The roads were narrow and there were no signs saying 55 mph or anything like that.' 'I think I’m a pretty good driver. I feel safe about getting my driver's license renewed because I’ve never had an accident.' 'I just couldn't imagine myself without a car. It just didn't feel very good.' Mrs Kirchmaier moved to California with her husband Joseph. They were married for 70 years until he died in 2008 at the age of 98. She still volunteers for Direct Relief International, a charity she has given her time to for 40 years. Mrs Kirchmaier now drives a 1997 Dodge Caravan and her license is valid until 2017. Coming close to revealing the reason for her healthy age she said she had always been positive. 'I've always been very happy,' she told the Ellen show. 'I had a happy marriage and have a wonderful family. I stay positive. If something happens and I can't do anything about it - I don't worry about it.'","Edythe Kirchmaier becomes California's oldest driver by renewing her license the day after her 105th birthday .

"A baby with two heads has been born to a woman in India after she was too poor to have an ultrasound during her pregnancy. Urmila Sharma, 28, gave birth to conjoined twins at Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital in Sonipat, Haryana, in northern India, yesterday morning. The baby, born via C-section and weighing 7lbs 7oz, has two heads, two necks and two spines but only one body. Scroll down for video . Dr Malik said: 'So far they are doing remarkably well. It is a gift that they have come this far' The baby girl, yet to be named, is under close observation in the neonatal intensive care unit, though doctors fear her chances of survival are slim. Dr Shikha Malik delivered the baby and said: ‘The parents are very distressed and we are helping the family the best we can.’ Urmila and her husband Subhash, 32, who have one other daughter, were too poor to have an ultrasound during the pregnancy so complications had gone unnoticed. Dr Malik added: ‘We only came to know . she was carrying conjoined twins after an ultrasound two weeks ago but . it was too late to do anything by then. Fears: The baby's mother gave birth to conjoined twins in Haryana, northern India, last week and doctors initially feared their chances of survival were slim . Wait: The baby girl, yet to be named, is under close observation in the neonatal intensive care unit . ‘Now the baby is born we will do our best to save her and we hope to operate once her condition is more stable.’ Conjoined twins who share a single body have dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment. Because they share the same body, it is not possible to separate dicephalic parapagus twins.","Child was born yesterday in northern India via C-section weighing  7lbs 7oz .

"A budget-conscious mother has won the £5.8million lottery jackpot - but she was too worried about money to call the hotline in order to claim her winnings. Tracy Tyler was only persuaded to ring up Camelot after her partner promised to foot the bill for the phone call. Nearly a week after their massive win, the couple have not yet spent a penny of the jackpot - apart from buying a round of drinks and taking their children to the local swimming pool. Scroll down for video . Winners: Adam Young and Tracy Tyler have won £5.8million on the lottery after scooping Saturday's jackpot . Mother-of-two Ms Tyler, 37, has been struggling for money ever since her partner Adam Young was made redundant from his job in a warehouse two months ago. The couple, from Epping in Essex, have learned to live on a budget, and have never been able to buy their own home. 'When he lost his job the bills were getting a bit tight. We had done OK so far but it was getting worse,' Ms Tyler said. 'We had managed to make enough phone calls and juggle things around. I was quite good at juggling after years of practice. 'Occasionally I had to ask my mum to help me though.' Joy: But the mother of two was initially reluctant to ring up the Camelot winners' hotline . On Saturday, she learned that her numbers matched the winning ones in the Lotto draw - but was reluctant to ring the winners' hotline to claim her £5,819,806 fortune. 'The lottery was an 0845 number and I was a bit worried that would cost me money,' Ms Tyler said. 'But he said he would pay for it so I said all right. I don't like to waste money, I'm very cautious.' 0845 numbers cost just 2p a minute to phone from a landline under BT's default calling plan. The delighted mother toasted her win with 'a large vodka and coke', and took her children for a swim the next day. Spending: The couple plan to buy a Range Rover and invest in owning their own home for the first time . She plans to buy a new Range Rover in place of Mr Young's battered Citroen Saxo, and will also go on his first ever trip abroad. Mr Young, 30, who has previously spent several hours a day looking for a job, said that he was acutely aware of how much the couple's life had changed - but added that he might go back to work anyway. 'This time last week, we certainly weren't sitting by a pool in the sun,' he said from a hotel in Essex. 'I was online looking for jobs. I worked in a warehouse, I had been there for eight years. 'I spent a couple of hours every day applying for jobs, sending my CV off. A few were planning to get back to me this week, so we will see what happens. 'I could yet be offered a job so I would have to make the decision whether or not to take it, or take a sabbatical or something.' Happy: The pair had been struggling ever since Mr Young lost his job working in a warehouse . The couple said they have yet to check whether their winnings have been paid in to the bank, but plan to spend some money on buying their own home. They also hope to get advice from Camelot on how to deal with such a huge jackpot. Ms Tyler, who is continuing to play the lottery, added: 'If there was one more person in front of me in the queue when I bought my ticket, it could have been completely different. 'We have been very lucky.'","Tracy Tyler, 37, had been struggling since partner Adam Young lost his job .

"Sitting in front of a computer all day can make you feel lazy, affect your posture and even cause long-term health damage. But if you can’t afford a treadmill desk, the next best thing is to build your very own human hamster wheel. The wheel is made of plywood, skate wheels and a pint of glue and can be fitted over an existing desk -  but you may need to get permission from your boss to use it. Scroll down for video . The Hamster Wheel Standing Desk was designed by California-based art graduate Robb Godshaw (pictured). Each wheel (pictured) consists of plywood, skate wheels and a pint of glue and is 61cm (24 inches) wide, and has a two-metre (80-inch) diameter. It was designed to make office workers less sedentary . California-based art graduate Robb Godshaw designed the wheel to make office workers less sedentary. ‘You are not reaching your current productivity potential,’ explained Mr Godshaw. TrekDesk is a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work. The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. It costs $499 (£300), is designed to fit over any treadmill and features a manuscript holder. ‘Rise up, sedentary sentients, and unleash that untapped potential within by marching endlessly towards a brilliant future of focused work. ‘Step forward into a world of infinite potential, bounded only by the smooth arcs of a wheel. Step forward into the Hamster Wheel Standing Desk that will usher in a new era of unprecedented productivity.’ Mr Godshaw has added step-by-step DIY instructions to design site Instructables so other people can build their own version of his wheel. According to the project files, the wheel was designed using Autodesk Inventor and it took Mr Godshaw and his friends 24 hours to build. A timelapse video on the site shows the 61cm (24-inch) wide, two-metre (80-inch) diameter wheel being built. To create the wheel at home, builders will need four sheets of plywood, four skate wheels, two pipes, 240 wood screws, and a pint of glue. Mr Godshaw has added step-by-step DIY instructions (pictured) to design site Instructables so that other people can build their own version of his wheel. According to the project files, the wheel was designed using Autodesk Inventor and it took Mr Godshaw and his friends 24 hours to build . Mr Godshaw said he considered adding brakes to the wheel, but decided against it 'to really force the productivity out of the desk user.' The use of the skateboard wheels means the design has a more fluid rotation, without the need for an axle. 'We already had a standing desk that fit through the wheel, so it was just a matter of avoiding interference and leaving enough room for a human,' continued Mr Godshaw. Mr Goddshaw claims the wheel can also be used as a ‘wheel of death’ or ‘an uncomfortable bench.’ Mr Godshaw said he considered adding brakes to the wheel, but decided against it 'to really force the productivity out of the desk user.'

"The Church of England will provide no more resistance to gay marriage among churchgoers, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, revealed last night . The Church of England will provide no more resistance to gay marriage among churchgoers, the Archbishop of Canterbury revealed last night. Gay marriage becomes legal tomorrow and thousands of ceremonies are planned across the country from one minute past midnight onwards. Changing the law has caused bitter divisions within the church. Last month, bishops attempted to ban clergy from marrying same-sex partners, provoking a backlash among Christian supporters of the change. However, in a shift in tone, Archbishop Justin Welby tells the Guardian today: ‘I think the Church has reacted by fully accepting that it’s the law, and should react on Saturday by continuing to demonstrate in word and action, the love of Christ for every human being.’ In defiance of the bishops, at least seven clergy couples were already planning to marry their partners, and some clergy are offering to bless same-sex marriages. Globally, the Anglican Church remains deeply split on the issue and Archbishop Welby is trying to prevent the divide from spreading to the UK. Some conservative evangelical congregations are threatening to leave the Church of England if it compromises its opposition to gay sex by blessing civil partnerships. Archbishop Welby hopes to tactfully approach the problem via a series of ‘structured conversations’ between opponents and supporters of the move. The Reverend Andrew Cain, from north London, has also announced his intention to marry his partner.

"One of the two teenage hikers rescued last month after a five-day search of a Californian national park has been charged with felony methamphetamine possession. Authorities found the drug in the vehicle belonging to 19-year-old Nicolas Cendoya while responding to his and 18-year-old Kyndall Jack's  disappearance. The teenagers called investigators from Holy Jim Canyon on Easter Sunday, saying they were lost and their cellphone was dying. From hero to zero? Kyndall Jack called Nicolas Cendoya, pictured, her hero after their dramatic rescue last month but now he's been charged with meth possession . Cendoya was discovered three days later, dehydrated and delirious. Jack was found the next day, hypothermic and confused. Both recalled little from their ordeal, beyond hallucinations. Jack said that she had wild thoughts her . parents had been sentenced to prison time, a python was eating her and . that Cendoya, 19, had told her he was having visions of a tiger. The search to find them required 1,900 man-hours and cost taxpayers an estimated $160,000. A deputy was injured while trying to rescue Cendoya. He faces up to three years in jail if convicted, reports The Orange County Register. Jack was rescued shoeless and clinging . to a mountain ledge on April 4 having suffered frostbite and cuts and . bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her. Kyndall Jack, one of two hikers lost for nearly a week in the Cleveland National Forest last month, revealed that they suffered from hallucinations during their ordeal . 'I don't remember drinking anything,' said Jack to ABC News. 'I know I ate dirt. I tried to eat some dirt and rocks. I came to the hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that's all I remember.' Describing her hallucinations, Jack said that the wilderness got to her, making her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion. 'My parents were in jail half the time, in my mind, and I was searching for my little sister, so that's all I remember,' said Jack. 'I was being eaten by a python. Like Nick saw a tiger, I was being eaten by a python half the time.' Jack and Cendoya began their fateful . trek on Easter Sunday in Trabuco Canyon in Southern Californian on what . was their first date. Kyndall Jack, told reporters that starvation and dehydration led to her eating dirt and hallucinating that she was being attacked by a snake . Kyndall Jack is transported by wheelchair and flanked by hospital staff, security and her parents for a press conference outside UCI Medical Center in Orange, California last month . It was while at the top of a mountain that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they had exhausted the water supply. 'We wanted to touch the clouds,' said Jack. 'That's why we went up there. We wanted to be in the clouds at the top.' And in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded, Cendoya sounds incoherent. 'We have fire I mean,' Cendoya told the 911 operator according to ABC News. 'I mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up. I don't know.' The 911 operator can be heard to struggle with Cendoya as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost. 'Stop for one second. What is the address?' Cendoya can be overheard saying to Jack. 'I don't know,' she replies. Relief: Nicolas Cendoya, center, hugs his brother, left, and mother, right, after he was released from Mission Hospital . Jack told reporters that the battery on Cendoya's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the signal - and that is when they began to panic. 'I said just hold onto me. Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said Sunday after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.' Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived. Cendoya was found barefoot, shirtless and disorientated and Jack was found the next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat. Following confusion over their accounts of how they became lost and separated, Cendoya said he was worried Kyndall Jack, 18, would blame him for what happened. He said he had been told not to contact her and was concerned when she hadn't got in touch, but then she sent him a Facebook message insisting his words of encouragement when they got lost were 'what kept me going' and that she loved him and missed him. Drama in the wild: Kyndall Jack, 18, is airlifted to safety by Los Angeles County Search and Rescue after being missing for five days in rugged country near Rancho Santa Margarita, California . Risky adventure: Kyndall Jack's father said his daughter called him to say that she is going on a hike, which was unusual for her . 'I heard a lot of really mean things . that were being said about me... and when she was saved I hadn't heard . from her and everyone was telling me not to call,' Cendoya told . reporters outside Mission Viejo hospital. 'But then I get a (Facebook) post from Kyndall.' Then he read out the heartfelt message. 'Hi Nick, all I think about is you. It's hard to make sense of it all and everything that has happened,' she wrote, before explaining how when she was rescued, she wasn't even aware that she had been hiking with him. 'Then I remember you telling me to calm down and that you were going to get me out of there and that's what kept me going,' she went on. 'Thank you so much and I love you and miss you more than words can describe. You are my hero Nicolas.' Cendoya also described how he spent much of the ordeal in a dream-like state and even thought the search helicopters flying above him were hallucinations. 'The last thing I could tell you was going into a lucid dream,' he said. 'I can't even tell you when I woke up. I was in lucid dreams and hallucinations for days.' He said that while he was wandering in the arid surrounds, he reflected on what he considered recent selfish behaviors, like focusing too much on himself and not enough on his family. 'So that's why when all this happened, I didn't cry, I didn't fear it. I just embraced everything. I said, ""This is what I deserve,""' Cendoya said. 'I just knew I would get through it. I knew this wasn't my time to die. I knew that I needed this, to become the person that I'm supposed to be.' The two teen hikers were just a couple of miles from a shopping mall, and were able to make out the Los Angeles skyline and hear the rumbles of downtown traffic from where they wandered off trail. And although the sprawling expanse of Southern California suburbia is clearly visible from the forest's ridgelines, in the canyon where they were trapped the brush was so thick they couldn't find a road that was just 500 feet away.","Nicolas Cendoya, 19, and Kyndall Jack, 18, were rescued last month after five days lost in a national park .

"A nine-year-old boy got through airport security and onto a plane without a ticket, it emerged last night. Security officials at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport screened the boy, whose exploits echo the Leonardo DiCaprio film Catch Me If You Can, at the airport shortly after 10.30am on Thursday. But the unidentified child from Minneapolis, Minnesota, slipped through a security checkpoint and then boarded Delta Air Lines Flight 1651 - which left for Las Vegas, Nevada, at 11.15am.

'He had to pass three levels of security,' said Terry Trippler, an air travel expert with ThePlaneRules.com, to the TV station. 'He had to pass three levels of security. You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment' Terry Trippler, air travel expert . 'You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment.' Mr Tippler said that security introduced after 9/11 obviously still has major flaws. 'While we are safer in the air, this proves there are still gaping holes,' he added. According to a surveillance video, . at 10.37am, the unaccompanied boy arrived at the airport on a . southbound light-rail car, the New York Daily News reported. The . boy was then screened at Terminal 1 and granted access to its nine . airlines despite appearing to have never produced a required ticket. Destination: Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, with the 'Strip' in the background. The nine-year-old flew here from Minneapolis without a ticket . In . an apparently well-thought out plan that has similarities to the Steve . Spielberg-directed movie, at one point the boy is believed to have . blended in with another family traveling through the airport to evade . detection. 'Fortunately, the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child's safety, so the story does have a good ending' Patrick Hogan, Metropolitan Airports Commission . The boy's parents told Minneapolis Police they 'hadn’t seen much of him today' when officers arrived at the missing child's residence on Thursday after he was reported having run away, according to CBS Minneapolis. Catch Me If You Can was based on the . real-life exploits of Frank Abagnale, a teenage con-artist who, among . many other scams, traveled the world posing as a Pan Am pilot. 'The . fact that the child's actions weren't detected until he was in flight . is concerning,' said Mr Hogan, who added that producing identification . for children is not a requirement of travel. 'More . than 33million people travel through Minneapolis-St. Paul International . Airport every year and I don't know of another instance in my 13 years . at the airport in which anything similar has happened. Comparison: Leonardo DiCaprio (centre) starred in Catch Me If You Can, a film based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, who posed as a Pan Am pilot. The movie echoes the Minneapolis runaway who flew to Las Vegas . 'Fortunately, the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child's safety, so the story does have a good ending,' Mr Hogan said. 'If it hadn't been for alert airline employees on our end, he probably never would have been discovered' Bill Cassell, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police . Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokesman Bill Cassell told ABC News the boy was 'more worldly than most nine-year-old kids.' 'He was able to get onto an airline where he didn't have a ticket and made it five states across the U.S.,' Mr Cassell said. 'If it hadn't been for alert airline employees on our end, he probably never would have been discovered.' The station reported that Las Vegas police, Hennepin County authorities and the boy's parents were working together. A statement on the TSA's website said that the federal funding shutdown meant no information on the incident would be immediately available online.","Boy took Delta flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on Thursday morning .

"It was a packed house at an Oklahoma City funeral on Thursday as a beloved canine officer slain in the line of duty was given a full police ceremony. Officer handlers and their canine partners from around the state packed in to honor Kye, who stabbed by a suspect Sunday night before dying of a heart attack during emergency surgery on Sunday. 'We greatly appreciate the sentiments, well-wishing, and prayers everyone is expressing – our website took over 2 million hits,' Captain Dexter Nelson of the Oklahoma City Police Department told KOCO. Revered dog: Oklahoma City police officer Ryan Stark leans over the casket of his canine partner, K-9 Kye, following full police funeral services for the dog on Thursday . Stark accepts the flag from the casket of his canine partner Kye. Stark shot suspect Mark Salazar, 22, to death after he stabbed the canine--which led to the dog's death . Kye, a 3-year-old German Shepherd, died in surgery Monday after he was stabbed by a suspect . The 3-year-old German Shepherd's sad end began when his handler released him to help apprehend suspect Mark Salazar, 22. The Texas man, who was in Oklahoma City for unknown reasons, was seen stealing a car by police before he led them, including Kye's handler Sergeant Ryan Stark, on a high speed chase. After the car was brought to a halt, Salazar ran. Stark released Kye and the dog was stabbed several times when he overtook Salazar. Stark then shot Salazar to death. The police dog was taken to a veterinarian for emergency surgery, Nelson said. Stark is on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. The suspect is thought to have skipped out on an unpaid bar tab and then stolen a car, police said. While many believe otherwise, a police dog is not legally the same as a human partner. 'The canine, from the officer's standpoint, is considered an officer, but from a legal standpoint he's not. He's a tool or a weapon used by the officer,'  Nelson told KFOR. Captain Dexter said an officer isn't allowed to shoot solely in response to an attack on a dog. He says officers can use lethal force when close to a person with a knife. Sad: It was a packed house for Kye's Oklahoma City funeral. Sergeant Stark is on paid administrative leave pending an investigation because it is not legal to shoot to protect a canine .

"Possible presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health issues have been kept secret for fears they will ruin her eligibility to become president, it has been claimed. The remarkable claim comes in a new book written by journalist Ed Klein which details the rocky relationship between the Obama and the Clinton families. The excerpt on her health includes a claim from a cardiac specialist familiar with Clinton's condition as saying her clotting in the brain could have developed into a stroke. Hillary Clinton pictured yesterday signing copies of her new book 'Hard Choices'. Her book has been released right as another book by Ed Klein claims her serious health issues have been kept secret . In further excerpts of the book reported by Drudge Report, the author claims Hillary Clinton's health problems, which have included the blood clot between her skull and brain, were revealed in a trip to hospital after she fainted. He wrote she had a track record of fainting and a tendency to form blood clots. 'She also suffered from a thyroid condition, which was common among women of her age, and her fainting spells indicated there was an underlying heart problem as well. 'A cardiac stress test indicated that her heart rhythm and heart valves were not normal. The author added: 'She had managed to keep her medical history secret out of fear that, should it become public, it would disqualify her from becoming president.' It is claimed Clinton, pictured left doing publicity for her own new book, has a tendency to develop blood clots . It made headlines worldwide when Clinton fainted and was concussed in an accident it was claimed occurred at her home in 2012. Her health has also become a talking point in recent weeks as speculation continues over whether she will run for the 2016 presidency. In defending his wife last month, former President Bill Clinton said it took his wife 'six months of very serious work' to get over her concussion induced health issues but she is fine now. However, Clinton's statement inadvertently raised more questions about her health than it did to put a lid on the story. GOP strategist Karl Rove recently called . for Clinton to publicly release her medical records, although he shied . away from questioning her health. Meanwhile, Klein's book 'Blood Feud' has meticulously detailed the animosity between the Obamas and the Clintons - the two power couples of the Democrat Party. Dating back to then Senator Obama's defeat of Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination they believed was theirs, Bill has never forgiven Obama for allegations he made during that bitter campaign. 'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' said Bill Clinton to a friend after Obama suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to Klein's book, excerpts of which appear in The New York Post. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton arriving for the East Asia Summit together in Nusa Dua, Bali, in 2011 . According to an account of Klein's explosive allegations in The New York Post, Michelle Obama would sit in the evenings with her trusted adviser, Valerie Jarrett to gossip about Hillary over a bottle of Chardonnay. They nicknamed Hillary the 'Hildebeest', in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the Serengeti. In the run up to the 2012 election, President Obama's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure-touch of Bill Clinton if he wanted to secure a second term. Loathe to do this, President Obama . finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in . September 2011, to ask for his help. Controversial: Edward Klein's new book lays bare the anger and hatred at the heart of the relationship between the Clintons and the Obamas . 'I’m not going to enjoy this,' Bill told Hillary according to Klein. 'I’ve had two successors since I left the White House — Bush and Obama — and I’ve heard more from Bush, asking for my advice, than I’ve heard from Obama. I have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever,' Clinton said. 'Sometimes we just stare at each other. It’s pretty damn awkward. Now we both have favors to ask each other, and it’s going to be very unpleasant. But I’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side.' The golf game was petty, tetchy and not without incident. President Clinton . immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding Obama that he . presided over an economic golden age, while Obama was struggling to . affect any change during the Great Recession. Hammering . home his point, Bill Clinton told President Obama that obviously he and Hillary . would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be 'the . most qualified, most experienced candidate, perhaps in history.' This rankled with President Obama, acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the White House. 'And . so Bill continued to talk about Hillary’s qualifications . . . and the . coming campaign in 2016,' writes Klein as featured in The New York Post. Deal: According to Edward Klein, Bill Clinton agreed to fully campaign for Barack Obama on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016 . 'But . Barack didn’t bite. He changed the subject several times. Then . suddenly, Barack said something that took Bill by complete surprise. He . said, ‘You know, Michelle would make a great presidential candidate, . too.’ 'Bill was speechless. Was Barack comparing Michelle’s qualifications to Hillary’s? 'Bill . said that if he hadn’t been on a mission to strike a deal with Barack, . he might have stormed off the golf course then and there.' A deal was struck nonetheless and Bill delivered a barnstorming speech to the Democratic National Convention, which threatened to upstage the president himself.","New book 'Blood Feud' alleges Hillary Clinton has serious health issues kept secret due to concerns they may affect any presidency bid .

The brave teen made the announcement on his social media two weeks ago and his singer father, who has been silent on the issue, finally addressed the revelation this week  saying: 'You don't really wanna open it up by saying that my daughter is becoming my son.' During an interview on a Chicago radio station the R&B singer seemed to imply that Jay’s . coming out had been a falsely reported rumour – despite the fact he announced the news in a blog post via his Ask.FM account. R. Kelly has finally spoken out about his 14-year-old child Jaya announcing he is now transgender and has changed his name to Jay . During an interview on a Chicago radio station the R&B singer seemed to imply that Jay's coming out had been a falsely reported rumour - despite the fact he'd come out personally in a blog post via his Ask.FM account . When questioned about the news the 47-year-old singer told Chicago's WCGI interviewer: 'You don't really wanna open it up by saying my daughter is becoming my son,' 'Because if that were true..' The interviewer interrupted and explained that she is quoting blogs to which R. Kelly replied: 'Don't even give the blogs that kind of credit. You know what I'm saying? Real talk.' 'But as far as that is concerned,' he continued. 'Always believe what you see with your own eyes that is. Always believe what you see. That is the best way to go about this business. Proud: Jay Kelly, whose father is singer R. Kelly, has revealed that he is female-to-male transgender and living as a boy. He said that he is not close to his father and they have not spoken about his announcement . 'And I've heard a lot of things about a lot of people and it was never true.' 'You gotta know there's a back story. There's a background. That's why you can't judge nobody.' Kelly . then diverted the subject to talking about his divorce and selling his home saying: 'You save money so your kids can go to college - no matter what . they are or who they are. They're your kids, you gotta support them.' 'I have three lovely, lovely kids that I am in love with and that's in love with me.' Earlier . this month Jaya, the youngest of the singer's three children with his . ex-wife Andrea Kelly revealed that his singer dad has yet to speak to . him since the . revelation. Responding to questions on his Ask.fm profile, . Jay explained that although he was born biologically female, he has . identified as a male since he was '6 or 7' and that his mother has known . for a year. His mom who is . the star of reality series 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his . transition and has proudly shared pictures of them together online. 'My mom was like, ""Baby, you know I love you if you were bi, gay, lesbian, you name it and I would still love you so much"",' he wrote. 'She was very proud of me, I was like, ""Thank you mom for accepting the fact that I'm a transgender"".' 'And same with my sister, she told me that she was proud of me, and respects me by calling me handsome and calling me her little brother now, and I love her for that, so you know it was great for me.' He added that he is eager to undergo the gender realignment operations but that he knows he'll have to wait for several years. Support: His mom, Andrea Kelly, who stars on 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his announcement . Loved: Jay, right, said that his older sister Joann, left, has also told him that she is proud of him . 'I believe I am a boy and want surgery, and the medication to help me (be) who I was supposed to be,' he wrote. From a very young age he knew he did not want to be a girl, wear dresses, grow his hair long or have breasts or female sexual organs, he explained on Ask.fm. Aged 11, 'I would look up like boy . changes to girl, and girl changes to boy, and im like wow, theres people . who feel EXACTLY the way i feel and then i knew like thats what transgender is,' he wrote. He added that he was about six when he knew he was attracted to girls - but he has no plans to date any just yet, adding: 'I've got a lot on my plate right now.' Silence: R. Kelly, who divorced Jay's mother in 2009, has not spoken to him about his announcement . Jay revealed on Ask.fm that he and his sister are not close to the singer, even though their older brother is. He added: 'I absolutely love my mother... and yea my dad has not reached out.' R. Kelly divorced Jay's mother, who had been his former backup dancer, in 2009 after almost 13 years of marriage. One of the best-selling and highest-earning recording artists of all time with hits like 'I Believe I Can Fly' and the ongoing operatic saga of 'Trapped in the Closet,' Kelly has exhibited signs of financial woes in recent years. In February it was reported he had allegedly fallen behind on child support payments. The . Ignition hitmaker was accused in court papers filed by his-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support . he owes. Last year he fell more than $100,000 behind in payments but managed to pay the debt off. Kelly previously has owed millions in unpaid taxes and even had to auction off one of his homes.

"They say if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen - and that's exactly what happened to one hapless cook who had to be rushed off to hospital after tasting a hot chilli sauce at his restaurant. Arif Ali, 26, suffered a severe reaction as he tried out the concoction, which had been prepared for a Man v Food-style hot wings challenge at Jimmy's restaurant, in London's O2 arena. The sauce contained Naga Jolokia chillis, which measure 250,000 on the Scoville scale of chilli strength - far hotter than pepper spray and so potent that they should only be handled using latex gloves. Hot staff: Jimmy's restaurant in the O2 arena had planned to offer the ultimate flaming hot chicken wings to its customers . According to one onlooker, Mr Ali happily tasted the food as customers cheered him on, but he began sweating. After drinking some milk, he carried on eating two more of the flaming hot chicken wings. 'But then he started gasping. The sweat was pouring off him and he collapsed at the table,' the witness told The Daily Star. 'He was then carried off by a few staff into a car and rushed to hospital. One minute he was fine - the next he passed out and was in real trouble.' Staff drove him to Hillingdon hospital, where he was treated and later discharged, but Mr Ali spent the next week suffering severe stomach cramps and diarrhea. The restaurant had wanted to challenge the boldest among customers with its fiery sauce, in the style of television series, Man v Food, where enthusiast Adam Richman takes on a range of extreme eating challenges. Fiery red: The Naga Jolokia chilli measures 250,000 on the Scoville scale . But the sauce has now been shelved. Restaurant manager Salim Khan said: 'We have now decided in the interests of customer safety not to put this particular item on our menu.'

"A teenage girl has killed herself after bullies punched her, forced her into lockers and stuffed her in trashcans, her devastated family has said. Elizabeth Nicole Evans, 16, was found dead at her family home in Gloucester, Virginia last week after she endured relentless bullying at the hands of fellow high school students, her father said. Michael Evans said he was aware of the torment she suffered at Goucester County High School, where she was in the 11th grade, but had no idea just how much she was hurting. Photographs on her Facebook page show an apparently vivacious teenager who loved wearing brightly-colored clothing and spending time with friends. Her family has not revealed how she died. Loss: Elizabeth Nicole Evans, 16, killed herself last week after years of bullying at school, her father said . 'She was very good at hiding things,' her friend Taylor Hall told WAVY. 'She was hurt, but she didn't show it.' Mr Evans, who is mourning the loss of his only daughter with his wife Samantha and their son Joseph, said the teasing had gone on for years. 'My daughter has been punched, my daughter . has been put in lockers, she has been stuffed in trash cans and she was . tripped going down the hallway,' he said. 'What disgusts me is that my daughter . looked at everybody the same. She saw the beauty in all of . them. They didn't treat her that way.'

Missed: Friends said she was very good at hiding her pain and had no idea just how much she was hurting . He said he had approached staff at the high school but nothing improved for his daughter. 'They could have stepped up,' Evans said. 'They could have done something.'

Mr Evans said that he hopes the tragic passing of his daughter can be a lesson to other teenagers who are struggling at school. He said there will always be someone to listen.

"Yvonne Gibney (pictured) found out her husband of 17 years had secretly married another woman via Facebook . Like all married couples, Yvonne and Maurice Gibney had their ups and downs. She had read rumours about his possible infidelity on Facebook, but remained confident it was just gossip and that he wasn’t cheating on her while he worked away in Oman. That is until she discovered pictures of the father of two getting married to another woman on a beach in the Arab state. Unknown to Mrs Gibney, 55, the oil contractor had been living a double life with teacher Suzanne Prudhoe, 46. It later transpired the couple had been an item for at least 18 months before their £45,000 beach ceremony at the British Embassy in March last year. Furious at his betrayal, Mrs Gibney, a nurse, turned detective and discovered her husband had even lied to his own mother, who walked him down the aisle, and step-daughter, who was a bridesmaid, to convince them he was already divorced. Yesterday Mrs Gibney spoke of the ‘pain and hurt’ she had suffered as her ex, who earns £85,000 a year tax free, walked away from court after admitting bigamy. Instead of sending him to jail a judge gave him a six month sentence, suspended for two years. ‘At the time of the bigamous wedding we had been married 17 years,’ she said. ‘I believed in our marriage and shared values, trust, love and respect for each other, a sense of morality. ‘I loved him unconditionally and believed that love was reciprocated. I simply don’t have the words to effectively convey the pain and hurt and sense of betrayal.’ Wirral Magistrates’ Court heard that Mrs Gibney discovered her husband’s terrible secret in February last year. After spotting comments on Facebook, she was astonished when she clicked through to Miss Prudhoe’s profile and discovered photographs of her husband, 49, dressed in a cream linen suit, kissing and gazing into the eyes of his new bride. She was dressed in an elegant embroidered white dress and carrying a bouquet of white roses. Other pictures showed the couple exchanging vows under a white gazebo on a sandy beach, a tiered wedding cake and place settings, which simply said: ‘The groom Maurice’ and ‘The bride Suzanne March 2013.’ Mrs Gibney, 55, had been married to globe-trotting oil contractor Maurice Gibney for 17 years.  She found online photographs of Mr Gibney (pictured), 49, dressed in a wedding suit and cuddling teacher Suzanne Prudhoe . Mrs Gibney told the court she had been in daily contact with her husband – who she met while working in Nigeria nearly 20 years ago – in the lead up to the illegal marriage. She said they had exchanged 11 emails on mundane domestic matters, such as new bed linen, the day before. Photographs showed a grinning Gibney kissing Miss Prudhoe (pictured) who was sporting a white wedding dress . When she tried to contact him on the big day, he told her he was ‘unwell’ but later claimed to have been out cycling. ‘I had no knowledge of Suzanne Prudhoe’s existence or relationship with my husband,’ Mrs Gibney said. The court heard that Gibney’s mother, Gina, 76, and other relatives had also been duped into believing he was already divorced. Mrs Gibney subsequently discovered the affair had been going on for at least 18 months. At Christmas in 2011 she flew to Oman to see her husband but he claimed to be away on business. It turned out he had flown back to the UK to spend time with Miss Prudhoe at her home in Stourbridge, West Midlands. The following year he promised he would spend Christmas at the couple’s £500,000 detached home, in Wirral, but pulled out at the last minute because he was ‘depressed’. Mrs Gibney said she later found out he had been with Miss Prudhoe. Gibney had claimed that he thought he could marry because he had begun divorce proceedings with his first wife. Sentencing him, District Judge Michael Abelson told him: ‘You initiated into a bigamous marriage, you knew precisely what you were doing at the time you did it, there was no hiding it.’ The Gibneys have since divorced. The parents of Miss Prudhoe last night said the family did not wish to comment.

"Baroness Thatcher died peacefully while sitting up in bed at the world-famous Ritz and reading a book, it emerged last night. The 87-year-old former prime minister suffered a stroke at 11.28am on Monday while reading in a top suite at the five-star Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying since Christmas. Her body was removed from the hotel, where suites cost up to £3,660 a night, by private ambulance almost 13 hours later at 12.20am yesterday, and her funeral was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Then, at Christmas, she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question. So she moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future. She never left. Her two carers took it in turns to stay with her and the same group of friends who took it in turns to see her at her Belgravia home were put on a rota at the Ritz.

Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to give a statement to the Commons, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband. There will also be time for backbench MPs to make their own tributes to her. As Lady Thatcher’s health deteriorated, the issue of whether she should be granted a state funeral - as Churchill was - grew increasingly controversial. However, it has emerged that she rejected the idea herself, and also insisted she did not want her body to lie in state or money to be spent on a fly-past. Instead, the streets will be cleared for a procession from Westminster to St Paul’s, where there will be a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the world.

Jordanian MP Khalil Attieh wrote on his Facebook page that Judge Rahman, who had headed the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal during Saddam's trial, had been arrested and sentenced to death. 'Iraqi revolutionaries arrested him and sentenced him to death in retaliation for the death of the martyr Saddam Hussein,' he said, according to Al-Mesyroon. Attieh also said that Judge Rahman had unsuccessfully attempted to escape from Baghdad disguised in a dancer's costume. The Facebook page for Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Saddam's former deputy who has emerged as a key figure among the Sunni militants, also posted that the rebels had been able to arrest Judge Rahman. Judge Rahmann, who was born in the Kurdish town of Halabja, took over midway through the trial in January 2006 after previous judge Rizgar Amin was criticised for being too lenient in his dealings with Hussein and his co-defendants. The father of three had graduated from Baghdad University's law school in 1963 and worked as a lawyer before he was appointed as the chief judge of the Kurdistan Appeals Court in 1996. On trial: The former Iraqi president gives his account to Judge Rahman during his trial in 2006 . He oversaw Saddam's trial for crimes against humanity over the killing of 148 people in the town of Dujail following an assassination attempt in 1982, and sentenced him to death by hanging following the guilty verdict. Judge Rahman had faced claims . that he was biased as his home town had been the subject of a poison gas . attack in 1988, allegedly ordered by Hussein. A number of Judge Rahman's relatives . were among the 5,000 people killed in the attack, and during the 1980s . he was also reportedly detained and tortured by Saddam's security . agents. The judge later criticised the way the execution was carried out in December 2006, saying in 2008 that it should not have been carried out in public and branding it 'uncivilised and backward'. The hanging had taken place as Sunni Muslims were celebrating the religious festival Eid al-Adha, and a video of the execution showed the former leader being taunted by members of the Shi'ite group. In March 2007 it was reported that Judge Rahman had applied for asylum in Britain after travelling to the UK with his family on a tourist visa, claiming he feared for his life. He never commented on the claims, which were denied by the Iraqi High Criminal Court Tribunal which said he had merely been in the UK for a holiday.","Raouf Abdul Rahman sentenced the dictator to death by hanging in 2006 .

"Pascal Husting, Greenpeace International’s programme director, has been flying 250 miles between Luxembourg and Amsterdam at the charity’s expense since 2012. Each trip costs Greenpeace £200 and would generate 142kg of carbon dioxide emissions, according to airline KLM. Scroll down for video . Pascal Husting, Greenpeace International's programme director, has been flying 250 miles between Luxembourg and Amsterdam at the charity's expense since 2012 . Over two years this would amount to 7.4 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions - the equivalent of consuming 17 barrels of oil, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. But Mr Husting defended the arrangement and said he would rather not take the journey but it was necessary because the alternative is a twelve hour round trip by train. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I spend half my life on Skype and video conference calls. ‘But as a senior manager, the people who work in my team sometimes need to meet me in the flesh, that’s why I’ve been going to Amsterdam twice a month while my team was being restructured.’ He said that from September he would switch to making the trip once a month by train due to ‘the work of restructuring my team coming to an end, and with my kids a little older’. Mr Husting’s travel arrangements were revealed just days after Greenpeace was forced to apologise for losing £3million of public donations in an unauthorised currency dealing. The head of Greenpeace in the UK yesterday denied that funding Mr Husting’s commute showed a lack of integrity. John Sauve, head of Greenpeace in the UK, yesterday denied that funding Mr Husting's commute showed a lack of integrity . In a statement online John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: ‘As for Pascal’s air travel. Well it’s a really tough one. Was it the right decision to allow him to use air travel to try to balance his job with the needs of his family for a while? ‘What kind of compromises do you make in your efforts to try to make the world a better place? ‘I think there is a line there. Honesty and integrity to the values that are at the heart of the good you’re trying to do in the world cannot be allowed to slip away. For what it’s worth, I don’t think we’ve crossed that line here at Greenpeace.’ But Greenpeace members were outraged by the senior executive’s commuting habits and called Mr Pascal a ‘hypocrite’. Greenpeace volunteer of 30 years, Richard Lancaster, said: ‘I have to say I’m deeply troubled by these revelations - I had hoped and assumed Greenpeace was better than this. ‘I volunteer with Greenpeace but work in the commercial world and if I took a job in another country I’d expect to move to where the job is and if I couldn’t for family reasons I wouldn’t take the job - so I find Pascal’s travel arrangements almost unbelievable.’ According to Greenpeace flying is ten times worse for climate change than taking the train and is responsible for 13 per cent of the UK’s impact on the climate.","Pascal Husting has been flying at the charity’s expense since 2012 .

The official Twitter feed of the Israeli Defense Force issued a warning of a . possible nuclear leak yesterday - before it claimed it had been hacked by Syrian activists. The Tweet, which warned of a leak at the country's research reactor near Dimona, Southern Israel, was soon deleted while officials reported a security breach and apologised. The tweet read: 'Possible nuclear leak in the region after 2 rockets hit Dimona nuclear facility.' The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has apparently claimed responsibility for the hack, tweeting 'Long live Palestine!' via the same account. On their own account, the SEA said it had hacked 'the whole ""Israeli army"" propaganda'. The IDF issued an apology today after deleting the tweets. 'We apologize for the incorrect tweets Our twitter account was compromised,' it said. 'We will combat terror on all fronts including the cyber dimension.' A source with the Palestinian militant group told the BBC that Egyptian intelligence officials had made 'intensive contacts' with its leaders and 'succeeded in reaching a new truce between . Hamas and Israel, and that the ceasefire agreement was to be announced . within hours'. Israel did not comment on the claims, but the killing has been widely condemned by its leaders.

"Just as the human face has evolved considerably since stone age times so it is expected to keep changing in the future. Today the human brain is three times the size of our primate ancestors. As our brains grew so did our heads get bigger, our skulls expanded and our features became flatter. Now with the advent of wearable technology, such as Google Glass, how will our heads and faces evolve in 20,000 years, 60,000 years and even 100,000 years from now? 100,000 years: The human face will have evolved to be proportioned to the 'golden ratio,' with unnervingly large eyes featuring a sideways blink . 2013: A typical man and woman . This was the question posed by artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm from MyVoucherCodes.co.uk when he quizzed Dr Alan Kwan, who holds a PhD in computational genomics from Washington University in St Louis. Based on their discussions Lamm has created a stunning series of images which display one possible evolution for the human race over the next 100,000 years. Dr Kwan believes that key to our future evolution will be man ‘wresting control’ of the human form from natural evolution and adapting human biology to suit our needs. As genetic engineering becomes the norm, ‘the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes’ writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger. 20,000 years: Humans have evolved to have bigger heads due to larger brains, while on their eyes are 'communications lens', a more advanced version of  'Google Glass' As man achieves total mastery over human . morphological genetics, the human face will become heavily biased . towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing: strong, regal . lines, straight nose, intense eyes, and placement of facial features . that adhere to the golden ratio and left/right perfect symmetry. Dr Kwan believes eyes will grow 'unnervingly large' as the human race colonizes the solar system and people start living in the dimmer environments of colonies further away from the sun. Eyes will also develop in other ways - that would seem startling from our . viewpoint today - with new  features including eye-shine enhance low-light vision and . even a sideways blink from re-constituted plica semilunaris to help . protect our eyes from cosmic rays. Skin will also become more pigmented to help alleviate the damage by harmful UV radiation outside of the earth’s protective ozone. Dr Kwan also predicts that people will have thicker eyelids and a more pronounced superciliary arch (the smooth, frontal bone of the skull under the brow), to deal with the effects of low gravity. There will be other functional . necessities: larger nostrils for easier breathing in off-planet . environments, denser hair to contain heat loss from a larger head, reports Forbes. As well as practical developments to suit changing environments there will also be more cosmetic developments. Parents will choose precisely the genetic makeup of their offspring - selecting the color of their eyes, hair etc. 60,000 years: Human beings have even larger heads, larger eyes and pigmented skin. A pronounced superciliary arch makes for a darker area below the eyebrows . Dr Kwan predicts a trend towards humans wishing to look as natural as possible even as there are greater numbers of technological advancements under the skin. 'Communications lenses (commlens) in contacts and miniature bone-conduction devices implanted above the ear will work in tandem,' predicts Dr Kwan. 'Bone-conduction devices, with embedded nanochips, will communicate with some external device for communications and entertainment.'","Artist Nickolay Lamm has created a stunning series of images displaying the evolution of the human race over the next 100,000 years .

"The G-spot may not exist in women - but there may be another 'intimate area' that creates increased sexual pleasure, say doctors . It is the legendary erogenous region that divides people the world over regarding its existence. But new research suggests that while the fabled G-spot may not exist, all is not lost. Italian doctors have now described in medical literature an 'intimate area' that creates increased sexual pleasure. It is more complex than one spot, however, and includes the clitoris, vagina and urethra - described as 'highly dynamic and sensitive structures' by the authors of the new report. In their article published in this month's Nature Reviews Urology, they say what brings a woman heightened sexual pleasure is much more complex than just one area and includes the complete reproductive system, including the urethra and clitoris. The . scientists, led by Emmanuele A. Jannini, professor of . endocrinology and sexology at Tor Vergata university in Rome, say the . idea of the one-spot approach first mooted in the 1950s is too . simplistic. The G-spot was named after Ernst Grafenberg, a German gynaecologist who . proposed its existence in 1950. Then in 1976, the landmark Hite Report on Female . Sexuality suggested that the clitoris is largely responsible for . orgasms in most women. Now, . says Profesor Jannini, modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound . have enabled gynaecologists and scientists to see what happens to . different areas of the reproductive system during sexual activity. The report authors write: 'The clitoris, urethra, and anterior (front) vaginal wall have led to the concept of a . clitourethrovaginal (CUV) complex.' This, they say, defines a broader or  'variable, multifaceted... area that, when properly stimulated during penetration, . could induce orgasmic response'. 'We know [thanks to this review] there is a much more complex than a simple, . phantasmagoric ""point"",' adds Profesor Jannini, adding the findings end 'hopefully forever' discussions on where the elusive G-spot is. He says that 'knowledge of the anatomy . and physiology of the CUV complex' may help to avoid damage to female . genitalia during medical and surgical procedures. 'The vagina is an active tissue and sexually important to be respected,' he said. Scroll down for video . The newly-defined area is more complex than just one spot and includes the clitoris, vagina and uterus . Previous research by Professor Jannini's team has found that tissue between the urethra and vagina is thickest in women who reported they had a G-spot. The researchers also found tell-tale chemical markers in the area. These markers include chemicals that process the nitric oxide responsible for male arousal. Earlier this year, another doctor spoke out about the myth of the G-spot. 'We don't think the G-spot exists and if it does, . it's not a specific physical structure,' said Dr Charles Runels, the inventor of the procedure. Instead, women have an O-spot, he claims - the area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina. Dr Runels offers a treatment called the O-Shot - which he says boosts both libido and sexual satisfaction. He . added that many women - especially those who are older and/or who have . had children - find their clitoral sensitively is reduced - 'sometimes . tremendously'. Earlier this year, another doctor spoke out about the myth of the G-spot. Instead, women actually have an O-spot - the area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina - says U.S. doctor Sam Wood, who offers 'O-shot injections (file image) The O-Shot involves drawing blood and then separating out the platelets from it. These are then injected into an area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina - dubbed the O-Spot - and stimulates the growth of new cells in this area, making it more sensitive. The idea for the treatment came from the Vampire Facelift, also developed by Dr Runels. This basically involves injecting blood (which also contains growth factors) into the face. When these growth factors enter the face, stem cells become activated to grow new tissue. This new tissue includes new collagen, new fatty tissue (for smoothness), and new blood vessels (for a healthy glow). The same principle applies with the O-Shot, which aims to 'plump the clitoris' and make the vaginal area more sensitive.","Area that creates increased sexual pleasure is bigger than one spot .

"A Massachusetts mayor is calling for an end to refugee resettlement in his city, saying Somali families are putting pressure on already strained services in Springfield, a onetime industrial center where nearly a third of the population lives below the poverty line. Mayor Domenic Sarno is the latest mayor to decry refugee resettlement, joining counterparts in New Hampshire and Maine in largely rare tensions with the State Department, which helps resettle refugees in communities across America. The mayor is drawing criticism from those who say this country has a moral obligation to help the outcast and refugees who say they're being scapegoated for problems the city faced long before their arrival. Fed up: Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno says the influx of refugees from nations like Somalia are straining the resources in his struggling city . Somali refugee Hasna Abdi, 26, holds her child Muridi Hassan, 1, in the main room of their apartment in Springfield, Massachusetts. The mayor says many of the refugees are packed into squalid apartments in the city. Refugees deny this . Somali refugees, from left, Sahra Mahamud, Nateha Kabir, Abdi Kadir Hussein, Khadijo Monangrawa and Fatumo Mohamed take their lunch sharing traditional Somalian food under a produce shelter as a steady rain falls at Red Fire Farm in Montague, near Springfield . 'Why not talk about the problems in the city, why not talk about the houses that are unstable and in bad conditions, why only talk about the Somalis and Somali Bantus?' Mohammed Abdi, 72, said through an interpreter. Sarno, leader of the state's third-largest city, first demanded last summer that the U.S. government stop sending refugees. But after recent inspections found Somali families living in overcrowded, pest-infested apartments without electricity and sometimes heat, he stepped up complaints, saying resettlement agencies are bringing in 'warm-weather' refugees and dumping them into cold climates only to leave them dependent on the city. 'I have enough urban issues to deal with. Enough is enough,' Sarno said in an interview. 'You can't keep concentrating poverty on top of poverty.' Hard examples and evidence for the mayor's stance are scant. The problems in the Somali housing have largely been attributed to neglectful landlords. The government does not track the number of refugees who rely on social services. The refugee population in Springfield of about 1,500 - around 380 of them Somali - represents about 1 percent of the city's total of 153,000. And a 2014 report by the U.S. government found that Massachusetts ranked third in the nation for refugee employment, with 73 percent of refugees enrolled in state programs finding work. Madino Idoor, a 35-year-old Somali with seven children, spent 12 years in a refugee camp before coming to the U.S. in 2004. She works two jobs — one at Goodwill at Springfield and another as a dishwasher at the Barnes Air National Guard Base in nearby Westfield. Somali refugee Mohamed Adan, 73, reflects on his experience of life in America after living for 12 years in a Kenyan refugees camp before being resettled in Springfield . Malyun Mohamed, 5, lies on a bed resting before getting ready for preschool. Critics say refugees like Malyun and her family are taking resources away from American families . Fatumo Mohamed, left, and Hamido Ali harvest Tat Soi, a leafy vegetable of the mustard green family, at Red Fire Farm. Production manager Fred Beddall when speaking about Somali refugee farm hands said, 'They are indispensable to this farm, amazing workers' 'I can work hard and provide for my family,' Idoor said. 'I do not need for the mayor to worry about me.' She and others wonder why the mayor is targeting an already vulnerable population, an idea reiterated Friday in a Boston Globe editorial. 'While Sarno raises valid points about needing adequate resources to accommodate newcomers, his stance is far too rigid and ignores both the moral imperative to help refugees and the benefits those refugees can bring,' the editorial read. About 67,000 Somalis have come to the United States in the past decade, seeking refuge from civil war. Most have settled in Minnesota, California, Georgia and Washington, D.C. In 2004, more than 100 Somalis came to Springfield, placed there because it met criteria including public transit and other urban infrastructure. The community has grown as others reunite with family members. Somali refugee Madino Idoor, left, stands at the sink filling a pot of water as Bollo Mohamed, second from left, sweeps her kitchen floor and her brother-in-law Adan Abdi, second from right, talks on his cell phone as Mohamed Abdulle stands near in Springfield . Supporters claim that only five percent of refugees stay on the government dole and are unable to find work that allows them to support their families . In 2004, more than 100 Somalis came to Springfield, placed there because it met criteria including a public transit and other urban infrastructure. The community has grown as others reunite with family members . Sarno said the State Department has not been receptive to his requests to stop sending refugees, echoing sentiments sometimes heard elsewhere. Lewiston, Maine, Mayor Robert MacDonald, who in 2002 asked Somalis there to help 'reduce the stress on our limited finances,' took heat a decade later for saying immigrants should 'accept our culture and, and you leave your culture at the door.' He later clarified that he didn't expect them to abandon their religion or language but said: 'I'm not going to apologize for ""leave your culture behind.""' Manchester, New Hampshire, Mayor Ted Gatsas in 2011 asked the State Department to stop resettling refugees there. Last year, he told the AP he still believes the city could benefit from a break in arrivals to 'get these people into working society.' Somali refugee Bollo Mohamed, 26, helps her daughter Malyun Mohamed, 5, with her shoes while dressing her for preschool at their apartment in Springfield . Bollo Mohamed, right, 26, touches her daughter Malyun Mohamed, 5, on the shoulder to say goodbye as Malyun leaves their apartment for preschool in Springfield. Bollo and her husband have five children . The refugee population in Springfield of about 1,500, around 380 of them Somali, represents about 1 percent of the city's total of 153,000 . Such requests are rare, said Daniel Langenkamp, a department spokesman. 'We make every effort to work with local officials and other stakeholders to ensure the resettlement of refugees is acceptable,' he said. The Department, he said, does not place refugees unless an area is equipped to handle them. The government's work with refugees in Springfield is mostly about family reunification, and it cannot keep families from moving there if they are placed elsewhere, he said. Federal funding of about $1,800 per person helps resettlement agencies assist refugees for as long as eight months, but Springfield argues that is not enough time for some refugees to adjust. Robert Marmor, president of Jewish Family Services, a resettlement agency in Springfield, said that aid for additional services is available from other sources and that his door is always open. 'It is unfortunate that 5 percent of refugees who struggle are the focus and not the 95 percent who are really making it,' Marmor said. Somali refugee Adan Abdi, 28, came to Springfield in 2004 with his parents and six siblings after years in refugee camps where security, food and water were scarce and a couple of pounds of corn per person had to stretch for two weeks. 'There is no comparing our new life in America to living in those camps,' said Abdi, who has a wife and three children. 'Springfield is my home. It's where I began my new life.'

"Mobile firm EE is to launch the UKs first 4G network on October 30th, the firm said today. The move follows last minute crisis talks between operators, ministers and Ofcom yesterday which avoid last minute legal action. 'We are delighted to announce that the official launch of our new customer brand, EE, offering the UK’s first superfast mobile 4G and fibre broadband service, will take place on the 30th October 2012,' said Olaf Swantee, CEO of EE. CEO of EE, Olaf Swantee, said today the firms 4G network will launch on October 30th . EE will launch with support for six handsets: . Apple iPhone 5 . Samsung Galaxy . SIII LTE, . Nokia Lumia 920, . Nokia Lumia 820, . HTC One XL . Huawei Ascend P1 . LTE . 'This is a significant milestone for the United Kingdom, and for the people and businesses of our country who will now be able to enjoy the huge advantages of superfast 4G technology for the first time. 'We are very proud to be pioneering, innovating and leading our industry in launching 4G for our nation through our new EE brand.' The 4G services will allow . uninterrupted access to the web on the go, high definition movies to be . downloaded in minutes and TV to be streamed without buffering. EE's . 4G network, which offers speeds up to five times faster than 3G, will . be available on Apple's iPhone 5, HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei . devices. EE, formerly known as Everything . Everywhere, last month unveiled its plans to make the country's first . state-of-the-art 4G services available to some 20 million people in 16 . cities by Christmas. However, the threat of legal action meant it could not announce a launch date. EE said . it will offer 4G to customers by Christmas in London, Edinburgh, . Cardiff, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Derby, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, . Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton. The . group then plans to roll out the service to further towns, cities and . rural areas next year, with population coverage of 70% and rising to 98% . in 2014. The announcement came after last minute crunch talks between ministers and mobile operators lifted the threat of legal action delaying launches. Regulator Ofcom has now agreed to bring forward the auction process that will let competing operators launch their 4G networks. Ofcom said the 4G auction process is now on track to begin at the end of the year to enable competitive 4G services across UK during the first half of 2013. Ed Richards, Ofcom Chief Executive, said: 'The actions we have taken with industry and government avoids the risk of significant delay and is tremendous news for consumers who might otherwise have waited a considerable period for the next generation of mobile broadband services. 'Ofcom's objective has always been to release the spectrum as early as possible and we remain focused on starting the auction by the end of the year.' The deal was thrashed out as mobile operators, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and communications . regulator Ofcom gathered today for crunch talks over the plans. The iPhone 5 is expected to be among the first handsets to be able to use high speed 4G networks . Ahead of the meeting, Ofcom has told the government that the process . could be accelerated to launch 4G networks in many places by May or . June. It had been thought that it would take until the end of the year. 'We are hopeful of the outcome,' Ronan Dunne, Chief Executive of O2, told MailOnline before the talks. 'We wanted to champion the customer position, and we were frustrated there wasn't a clear timeline for customers.' Mr Dunne admitted the process has been problematic. 'The whole 4G area has been a complex journey - more a marathon than a sprint. 'We are hugely excited, and customers are desperately keen to know when they can get 4G service.' The speeds should be around 5 times the speed people currently, said Mr Dunne. Rivals were angered that EE was given permission to launch first. However, Ovum's Mr Howett said while EE may appear to have been given the early . upper hand, it still has a tricky marketing task ahead if it is to . capitalise. 'I think it is about two things,' he told the BBC. 'One is about what . the pricing of 4G is going to be. 'EE would be be pretty mad to price . people out of it, so I suspect it'll be quite competitive. ""The second thing is the iPhone 5 impact. 'For me and a lot of other . people the iPhone 5 was very much an incremental upgrade. If people are . in the market for a new phone, and people who were on a two-year . contract are looking to upgrade, EE will say 'come to us'.""","EE will launch with handsets including Apple's iPhone 5 - but has not yet revealed pricing .

"Prestigious Ivy League school Brown University is getting ready to make a big change to its student health plan come August. The university, located in Providence, Rhode Island, will begin offering coverage for 14 different sexual reassignment surgery procedures. The move makes Brown one of a select group of schools and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to cover those surgeries, The Brown Daily Herald reports. Healthcare changes: Brown University, located in Providence, Rhode Island, will begin offering coverage for 14 different sexual reassignment surgery procedures. ‘We identified this as an important benefit for students to have access to,’ Brown’s Director of Insurance and Purchasing Services, Jeanne Hebert, wrote in an email to the university’s student newspaper. She said the change to the health plan was in line with the university’s ‘efforts to support all students.’ For female-to-male surgeries, the new coverage plan will include ‘mastectomy, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, vaginectomy, metoidioplasty, scrotoplasty, urethroplasty, placement of testicular prostheses (and) phalioplasty,’ Hebert said. For male-to-female surgeries, coverage will include ‘orchiectomy, penectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty (and) labiaplasty.’ The coverage for the sex change operations will be funded through renewal rates paid for 2014’s student healthcare coverage, Hebert said. The total package of sexual reassignment surgeries, hormone therapy and other services could cost up to an estimated $50,000. The university’s LGBTQ Center coordinator, Kelly Garrett, has strongly advocated the change to the student health plan for the past several years, she said, adding that one of the biggest accomplishments through her group’s efforts has been the inclusion of hormone treatment in the current school year’s coverage plan. The sexual reassignment procedures that will be covered by the university are ’very standard and very comprehensive,’ Garrett told The Herald. 'Standard procedures': The sexual reassignment procedures that will be covered by the university are 'very standard and very comprehensive,' The university¿s LGBTQ Center coordinator, Kelly Garrett, said . Up until now, transgender students were often barred from treatment due to high costs, she said. ‘I know people where it’s taken them 10 years because they needed to save money,’ said Garrett. The university’s LGBTQ Center was unable to provide statistics on how many transgender students are at Brown. Garret said that is because it is difficult to get accurate data due to self-reporting of students’ genders and the nature of some gender-identity changes that occur during their time in college. Doctors have declared the sexual reassignment procedures medically necessary, said Garrett. However, insurance companies have traditionally labelled them cosmetic and have excluded them from coverage around the country, she said. Without access to hormones and surgery, transgender students may ‘face discrimination’ as others may not accept their ‘gender identity and presentation,’ said Garret. Brown has not yet decided whether the added coverage will be extended to the staff health insurance plan, Garrett told The Herald. ‘The insurance plans are completely separate, so we’re in the discussion,’ she said. Unique move: The move makes Brown one of a select group of schools and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to cover those surgeries .","The move makes Brown one of a select group of schools and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to cover those surgeries .

"President Barack Obama claimed Monday night during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' than it was when he assumed office in January 2009. His statement, though, appears to be at odds with key economic indicators, America's sliding reputation abroad, and the American public's estimation of the direction the country has taken under the Obama administration. 'In all sorts of ways,' Obama told Democratic partisans who paid between $15,000 to $32,400 to hear him speak, 'we are not just stronger than when we – where we were when I first came into office.' He took off his golf glove: Obama took a break from his vacation to call foreign leaders with National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Monday before heading to a Democratic fundraiser where he claimed America is 'stronger' now than in January 2009 . Distance: Americans and members of Congress don't seem to believe Obama's foreign policy inspires confidence . 'It’s fair to say that America has the best cards when you look at other countries around the world.  There’s no other country you’d rather be than the United States.' 'Nobody can compete with us when we’re making the right decisions,' he said. But Americans have become increasingly skeptical about the decisions emerging from the White House, both on domestic and foreign policy. By a 20-point margin, they believe the nation is weaker under Obama's leadership, according to a Fox News poll released in June. Just 35 per cent told pollsters they agreed with what Obama said Monday night. A whopping 68 per cent said the Obama administration is less competent than Bill Clinton's was. Overall, a paltry 23 per cent of U.S. voters believe America is on the 'right track.' That number is from a Rasmussen poll released August 6. Obama's job approval rating hit an all-time low of 40 per cent last week, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. Just 36 per cent of Americans give a thumbs-up to his handling of foreign policy. Obama . appear to be fighting an uphill battle: Most polls show that his party . will suffer a stinging defeat on Election Day in November, with the . reliably center-left Washington Post predicting a strong likelihood that . Republicans will control both houses of Congress for the last two years . of his presidency. 'If the . president thinks his record is going to help Democrats in the fall, he's . whistling past the graveyard,' a Republican political consultant who has . advised presidential candidates told MailOnline. Key indicator: The ratio of America's debt to its gross domestic product has skyrocketed under Obama . 'His . coattails have shrunk to Lilliputian proportions, and it's well . deserved,' he said. 'His entire agenda will be DOA after Republicans . retake the Senate in November, and he has no one to blame but himself.' The U.S. economy has slid into troubling territory in recent years. The percentage of working-age Americans who are part of the U.S. workforce has reached the lowest level since 1978, with one out of every three staying on the sidelines and not working. And the federal government's debts have ballooned by $7 trillion since Obama took office, a sum larger than the accumulated U.S. debts between 1776 and the end of the Clinton administration. The ratio of America's debt to its GDP has skyrocketed under Obama, according to the Federal Reserve. Grove City College economics professor Tracy Miller wrote Monday in an op-ed for The Daily Caller that . '[o]ver the first five years of Obama’s presidency, the U.S. economy . grew more slowly than during any five-year period since just after the . end of World War II, averaging less than 1.3 percent per year.' Gallup's 'Economic Confidence Index,' a measure of Americans' confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy, reached -17 on Tuesday. The . poor showing, according to Gallup, is due to 'international and . domestic challenges, including the rise of Islamic militants in Iraq, . intense fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians, increasing . U.S.-Russia tensions, a wave of illegal immigrants from Central America, . and stock market volatility.' 'Whistling past the graveyard': Obama may be kidding himself when he claims America is on the rise, according to one political consultant . The immigrant deluge has been particularly harmful for Obama's standing among Americans. Republicans argue that his 2012 policy relaxing deportations of so-called 'DREAMers' – people brought to the U.S. illegally as children – has encouraged tens of thousands of Central Americans to send their children northward alone. The border battles and Obama's . policies overseas have monopolized news coverage of the White House for . weeks as he has struggled to fend off criticisms of his handling of . crises in Ukraine, Syria and Iraq. Even Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, has been piling on. She took the president to task last week, telling The Atlantic . that his 'failure' to arm Syrian rebels opposing dictator Bashar . al-Assad ultimately led to the rapid rise of ISIS, a militant Islamist . terror group that is making steady military advances across Syria and . Iraq while it slaughters religious and ethnic minority groups. 'The . failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who . were the originators of the protests against Assad – there were . Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle – . the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now . filled,' Clinton said. Obama . has heard that criticism before, and called it 'horses**t' during a . meeting with members of Congress last month, according to a lawmaker who . spoke to The Daily Beast.","President made the claim at a Democratic fundraiser on Martha's Vineyard .

"The federal government has sent more than 37,000 illegal immigrant children to adults in every part of the U.S. who claimed to be their guardians during the first seven months of 2014, data from the Department of Health and Human Services show. But tens of thousands more are languishing in 116 shelters operated with taxpayer dollars in at least 16 states. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says more than 66,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended after crossing the border illegally between October 1, 2013 and the end of this August – an 88 per cent increase over the last fiscal year with one month left to go. HHS released more than 56 per cent of the children to family members in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands between January and July, according to information the agency sent MailOnline and shown in a map below. In addition to the 116 shelters housing the rest, an estimated 28,000 kids, the feds have also proposed to open another 46 shelters in 27 states to help cope with the influx. The crisis has stemmed from an unprecedented flood of underage would-be Americans, often fleeing violence in Central America and drawn by the lure of a White House eager to mainstream them. Scroll down for video . Not surprisingly, Texans absorbed the largest share of illegal immigrant children this year -- but all 50 states are represented and even Virginia has found itself with more than 2,800 unexpected new school pupils . Deluge: Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children this year have snuck across the border into the US, where they are caught, processed in holding facilities (pictured), and then either released to relatives or kept in longer-term shelters . Tempers: A pro-immigration protester shouted at President Obama (lower left) on Monday during a labor union rally in Wisconsin . Adult relatives can claim the children from the temporary shelters run by private agencies but funded through taxpayer dollars. HHS doesn't take any action to determine whether those claiming the minors are themselves in the United States legally. The Los Angeles Times reported in August that the Department of Homeland Security had deported just 294 Central Americans from among the tens of thousands stretching American hospitality to its breaking point. Meanwhile HHS, through its 'unaccompanied alien children' program, sent 50 or more children and teens to live with 'guardians' in at least 128 U.S. counties. Adding to the complicated picture, the Federation for American Immigration Reform reported this week that HHS data indicate taxpayers will cover $761 million in expenses related to educating children placed in those counties. Few are fluent in English, and in some cases the flood of new students has overwhelmed already-crowded classrooms. And while the Obama administration has been quick to boast how many of the 37,477 former detainees it has reunited with self-described family members, it has been silent on how many children are still housed in what has become a collection of third-world orphanages. The Washington Times reported Thursday that a recent Homeland Security contract included a list of '116 facilities that have been used to house children this year.' The shelters have been featured in handfuls of local news stories. Numbers USA, a strident 'immigration-reduction' group, provided MailOnline with a map showing most of those locations. Those facilities, run mostly by organizations that receive 8- and 9-figure government grants, have become the stuff of secrecy. This map from NumbersUSA, an 'immigration-reduction' group, uses red 'warning' triangles for existing shelters yellow map pins for proposed new shelters, and blue push-pins to show where communities have beaten back federal government plans to open new facilities . Sen. Chuck Grassley is demanding information from HHS about how the Obama administration decides where to spend hundreds of millions of dollars caring for children in the US alone and illegally . One, Baptist Child and Family Services (BCFS), received more than$280 million this year to house illegal immigrant children, according to government records. Time reported in August that It has deployed 1,400 employees this year alone to staff its shelters. More than 95 per cent of that group's budget in 2012 came from the federal government, according to its tax records. But even members of Congress can't get answers about the arrangement it has with HHS. After President Obama requested $3.7 billion in July to grapple with the surge in child illegal immigrant border-crossings, Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, demanding an account of how the money would be spent. Burwell had previously testified that it can cost her agency as much as $1,000 per day to house, clothe, educate, feed and provide medicare care for each child. 'Despite being almost completely dependent on the public, BCFS has faced heavy criticism for attempting to avoid public scrutiny,' Grassley wrote. 'BCFS staff prohibited a Member of Congress from entering the taxpayer-funded detention center at Fort Sill; prevented a Los Angeles Times reporter from interviewing detainees, caseworkers, and other staff; physically pushed a local TV reporter from the entrance of a facility; and attempted to block the reporter’s camera crew from recording across the street from the facility.' Lucky ones: These Central American children aboard a cargo train headed north are traveling with their mother, while most come by themselves or with paid 'coyote' smugglers . Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson says government officials have blocked her attempts to find out more via the Freedom of Information Act. 'It's yet one more case in which the federal government now routinely keeps secret information that is undeniably public and has a tremendous impact on the public,' Attkisson told MailOnline on Thursday. 'How can Congress conduct its oversight role on impact and the contracts being written for tens of millions of tax dollars to care for the minors,' she asked, 'when the government is withholding the most basic information?' In a reported story for Sinclair Broadcast Group television affiliates, the president of a group that opposes illegal immigration told Attkisson that the Obama administration should explain itself. 'It's outrageous,' the Federation for American Immigration Reform's Dan Stein said. 'Now, this administration is telling the American people – and Congress – that we’re not even entitled to know where these people are, where they’re being held, what communities are going to be impacted.' Attkisson is gearing up to promote 'Stonewalled,' a book slated for November release, chronicling her oft-blocked attempts to squeeze public information out of the White House and its satellite agencies.","37,477 illegal immigrant children were handed over to relatives or other 'guardians' this year in 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands .

"Hillary Clinton's new book 'Hard Choices' is a 'bomb', according to a publishing source. The former first lady's memoir - detailing her time as secretary of state under Obama - has sold just 60,000 hardcover copies and 24,000 e-books, the source told The Weekly Standard. The results come after publisher Simon & Schuster's 'hoping and praying' that 150,000 print copies would be sold in the first week after the book went on sale on June 10, the source added. 'Between us, they are nervous at S&S,' the source said. 'Sales were well below expectations and the media was a disaster... It's a bomb, but it will be interesting to see how they spin it.' 'Struggling': Hillary Clinton's new book has shown disappointing early sales, according to a publishing source . A million copies were reportedly shipped when the book went on sale - meaning that the actual number sold is less than 10 per cent sell-through of what they sent, the source said, adding: 'They will be lucky to sell 150,000 total lifetime.' But the book has reached the top of the Barnes & Noble best-seller list by selling 24,000 copies, BuzzFeed reported, citing the company's Nielsen BookScan sales numbers. Despite this, it has still not performed as well as Clinton's 2003 book, 'Living History', which sold a million copies in its first month - and more than 40,000 copies in just 24 hours, a store record. By comparison, the recent BookScan numbers show the company sold just over half that amount in hardback copies of 'Hard Choices' in its first five days. 'Hard . Choices' debuted at No. 1 on the bookseller's hardcover best-seller list . - but despite this apparent success, The Weekly Standard source said . sales did not meet expectations. 'The book will probably debut on the best-seller list at No. 1 and then fall like a rock,' a source said. The New York Times best-seller list will be published on Wednesday evening. In demand? Shoppers reach for copies of 'Hard Choices' at an event in Washington on Friday. Since its release last week, she has held more than 10 events to promote the book across six cities . Clinton began her book tour at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan a week ago and more than 1,000 people lined around the block and bought copies. She has since held 10 events in six cities, including Chicago and Philadelphia. The 656-page book recounts her four years as President Obama's secretary of state. Democrats hope the book and its corresponding tour will preface another White House bid in 2016. By contrast, 'Living History' told a more personal tale of her childhood, her relationship with Bill Clinton and their time in the White House - including the Monica Lewinsky scandal and her husband's impeachment. It was her first major account of the events.","Clinton released 'Hard Choices' on June 10 - and it has sold 60,000 hardcover copies despite the publishers' hopes it would sell 150,000 .

"Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography . The head football coach at Minnesota State University was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of owning and producing child pornography. Todd Hoffner, 46, was in custody on suspicion of using underage people in a sexual performance and possession of child pornography, Blue Earth County Sheriff's Capt Rich Murry told the Mankato Free Press. Hoffner . was escorted off the football practice field on Friday and has been on . leave from his coaching position since then. After an investigation and a search of his home, he was arrested last night. Hoffner, who is married with three children, had not been formally charged by Tuesday evening, and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney. He remained in jail on suspicion of 'use of minors in a sexual performance' while authorities considered formal charges. Spokesman Dan Benson added that a university investigation is pending. 'The University's top priority is ensuring the safety and well-being of its students, program participants, and the community. 'The . University is not aware of any allegations affecting university . students or program participants,' Benson said in the statement. Assistant coach Aaron Keen told the Star Tribune: 'The whole situation comes as a shock and is still a shock.' He added that the players were 'responding well' since news surfaced. Detectives remained at Hoffner’s house . for more than an hour after his arrest. A vehicle at the house was towed . from the scene and other evidence was confiscated. Hoffner is in his fifth year as Minnesota State's head football coach.

"Tragedy: Nicholas Dellaventura collapsed and died during football practice in July 2012 at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School in Staten Island . The enraged family of a Staten Island teenager who collapsed from heat stroke and died during practice last year are suing his school for $10 million negligence. Alleging that Nicholas Dellaventura, 15, was ordered to carry on on the field, despite telling his coach and Gambino family associate Salvatore Ferraioli that he was ill, his parents are suing St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School and the Archdiocese of New York. Collapsing in July last year, Dellaventura's body temperature had soared to 110 degrees and the star freshman died hours after Ferraioli allegedly made him continue practice. The Dellaventura attorney, Ralph DeSimone told the New York Post that Ferraioli kept the 5-foot-8, 210-pound offensive linesman on the field in the mid-80s heat even after he had tried to pull out due to illness. 'These kids were winded...Nicholas had pulled himself off the field because he couldn't do it anymore, and he was told to go back and finish the practice,' said DeSimone. Ferraioli, who resigned in August 2012 after he was arrested and implicated in a Gambino gambling ring is alleged to have shouted somthing at Dellaventura that made him remain on the field. Dellaventura, a student at St. Joseph By-The-Sea HS, had finished a 90-minute-workout with his teammates who then huddled round to listen to their coach, New York Archdiocese spokeswoman Fran Davies told the New York Post . However, Ferraioli's lawyer denied that his client put the boy in any danger and alleged that Dellaventura's mother, Maria, knew her son was battling a fever caused by an infection. 'She sent him to practice knowing he had a fever,' said McMahon to the New York Post. Dellaventura family attorney Ralph DeSimone said that the teenager was forced back onto the field after tying to leave in July 2012 . DeSimone said that Dellaventura had a 'clean bill of health' and that officials at the school did not react fast enough to save the teen when he collapsed. 'They did not call 911 right away. They did not administer any type of proper first aid to him when he was in distress. There’s elementary things they could have done here that anyone with any kind of rudimentary training would have known,' DeSimone said. 'If you treat the situation in the first 10 minutes, it’s 100 percent survivable.' However, athletic director Greg Manos said that the school followed state-mandated protocols. 'There was no way that workout could have done that to Nicholas. He was running basic drills,' said football coach Sean Cusick at the time. The sophomore from New York City’s Staten Island was breathing and had a soaring temperature when paramedics rushed him to hospital, according to the FDNY. Dellaventura, a student at St. Joseph By-The-Sea HS, had finished a 90-minute-workout with his teammates who then huddled round to listen to their coach, New York Archdiocese spokeswoman Fran Davies told the New York Post. Coaches and teammates then saw that Dellaventura was struggling to breathe and couldn’t stand up from kneeling, Davies said. They gave him first aid and called paramedics. As they waited for the ambulance to arrive Dellaventura remained conscious and verbally responsive, Davies said. Several hours later he was pronounced dead at Staten Island University Hospital South. The boy’s football coach, Rich Clark, told the Post that he was a ‘really nice kid’ who always had a smile on his face. 'There are not enough nice things you can say about the kid. I feel like I lost a member of my family,’ he told the Post.","Nicholas Dellaventura, 15, died in July 2012 from heat exhaustion while practicing football at St. Joseph by-the-sea High School in Staten Island .

However, financial records shows that he’s not quite the man of the people he claims to be, with a savings account worth between $1,001 and $15,000. The 2013 financial disclosure he made in May also indicates that the Vice President and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, are worth between $1,323,970 and $162,996. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Wealth row: Joe Biden (left) took a swipe at Hillary Clinton (right) by claiming that in contrast to her moneyed lifestyle, he 'doesn't have a savings account' Hard fall: Hillary Clinton has been on a downward slide since launching her book last week, fending off tough questions about her immense wealth . Woman of the people: Clinton mingled and signed books on Monday with fans at the Tattered Cover, a trendy, upscale bookstore in Denver . Not 'truly well off': Clinton is having a nightmare of a PR week after self-inflicted wounds about her $200,000 speeches and her multiple mansions . Biden’s 2014 salary, meanwhile, is $233,000 – considerably more than the average US income of $50,054 per year – which puts him firmly in the top one per cent of earners. Biden spoke about his personal wealth at the White House's 'Working Families Summit' on Monday. 'Don't hold it against me that I don't own a single stock or bond,' Biden said. 'Don't hold it – I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension and I get a good salary.' He declared himself 'the poorest man in Congress.' As vice president, Biden officially presides over the U.S. Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes. Chez Clinton: The former first family call this upscale house in upstate Chappaqua, New York home. It's estimated worth in 2001 was $1.7million . Bill and Hillary Clinton also own a three story, 5,152-sq-ft home in DC that has four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half bathrooms and a basement. The average home in their neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia . Bill and Hillary Clinton's balance sheet has been estimated at between $50 and $100million. Despite this, the former first lady and secretary of state told the Guardian this weekend that she is 'unlike a lot of people who are truly well off.' And last week she tripped over her wallet during what was supposed to be a political coming-back-out party in conjunction with a book release, explaining how she and the former president had struggled to afford mortgages on their estates. 'Their estates – more than one,' CNN anchor Alison Kosik giggled Monday morning while reporting the story. 'I don’t know what to do with my millions,' co-host Miguel Marquez jabbed back. 'It’s very tough.' It takes a village: Clinton is on a nationwide tour to boost flagging sales of her hardcover memoir . Former South Carolina Democratic Chairman Dick Harpootlian (L) is a close ally of Vice President Joe Biden, which may explain his pot-shot at Hillary . Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, also smelt blood after Hillary Clinton’s gaffes. He framed his insult in terms the fictional aristocratic Crawley family and their servants could understand. 'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been ""Madam Secretary"" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' Harpootlian told The Washington Post. 'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning. Is it more Downton Abbey than it is America?' Harpootlian, like more than half of the Democratic establishment, backed President Barack Obama in his epic battle with Hillary for the 2008 presidential nomination. He's also an ally of Vice President Joe Biden. Clinton's handlers have done a substandard job of managing her image this year, setting up ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer with a tour of her $5 million Washington, D.C. home and its lush, Edwardian interiors. 'Swimming pools and Ming vases are just not going to resonate with working stiffs,' an Obama White House insider told MailOnline on Monday. 'Unless half the voters hit the lottery next year, they're just not going to be excited about her.' Another told the Post that wealth is 'going to be a massive issue for her. When you're somebody like the secretary of state or president of the United States or first lady, you’re totally cut off [from normal activity], so your perception of the middle-class reality gets frozen in a time warp.' Asked what Democrats should do, the adviser said: 'Panic.'","Biden sought to capitalize over recent gaffes made by Hillary Clinton .

"A group of IBM execs underestimated the all-pervading power of the Internet when they obliviously made loudmouth sexist remarks during a business lunch - which were overheard and subsequently live-tweeted by a furious female coder at the next table. Lyndsay Kirkham, an editor and freelance web developer in Toronto, had her birthday lunch ruined on Monday as she listened to the 'Big Blue' suits explain that they don't hire young women because 'they are just going to get themselves pregnant again and again and again'. Ms Kirkham, a mother to five-year-old Aodhan, wrote: 'These executives are so comfortable in the sexism that they are openly sharing. Wow. My disbelief is tempering my anger. #IBM.' Lyndsay Kirkham, a freelance coder and editor in Toronto, live-tweeted on Monday about the allegedly sexist remarks being made by IBM execs at the table next to her . Ms Kirkham had just sat down to lunch at the Richtree restaurant in Toronto with her son and her son's father, when she heard two men at the table next to her being 'obnoxiously loudly and belligerent' about their hiring strategies. Lindsay Kirkham, 36, tweeted the remarks she heard being made by men she believed to be IBM execs over a working lunch in Toronto . The 36-year-old told MailOnline today: 'It caught my attention because they were talking on what I am passionate about, women working in technology.' Ms Kirkham is head editor of Demeter Press and has an MA in English and Computer Science from the University of Toronto. She works part-time in web development and does volunteer projects for women's organizations. She said the men were in the 50-plus age range and very well-dressed. She said that their loud remarks, with little heed of who was nearby, made her question if they had been drinking but she saw no evidence of alcohol. Ms Kirkham told MailOnline on Wednesday that her anger grew as she listened to the men explain that they would hire 'mature' women who were not likely to have more children. She said: 'They said that women needed to take more breaks and longer holidays due to ''work-family stress''.' The execs also named specific women in their department who they were 'anticipating to take time off to have children' in the next few years, Ms Kirkham said. The two men were then joined by a woman, believed to be a colleague, who nodded along in agreement at their misogynistic diatribe. 'Women can be just as responsible for sexism as men,' Ms Kirkham added. The coder considered taking photos of the offending IBM execs but said she felt strongly about protecting their personal right to privacy. The editor told MailOnline: 'This is a such a serious issue. They seemed to be willing to cut off, or not even consider, young women for career advancement and saw them only as baby machines.' The working mother said that her run-in with the tech execs speaks to a more systemic problem for women in technology - whether in gaming, web design or at a corporate Goliath. She said: 'It is rampant across the board. Anytime a woman goes to a tech conference, she has to worry about being harassed. 'Any time I write an article about technology, I have a man telling me that I don't know what I'm doing with a computer.' Virginia Marie Rometty is the current chairman and CEO of IBM, the first woman to have ever headed the company. When her role was announced in 2012, retiring CEO Samuel Palmisano told The New York Times: 'Ginni got it because she deserved it. It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies.' According to the company's global employment standards: 'IBM will not discriminate in hiring, promotion, compensation of employees and employment practices on grounds of race, color, religion, age, nationality, social or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability or veteran status.' An IBM spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The views expressed in this reported conversation have nothing to do with how we operate our business in Canada or anywhere else. IBM does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.' Ms Kirkham, who is head editor of a feminist press in Toronto and a part-time coder, tweeted her anger about a problem she believes in 'systemic' in the technology industry .","Lyndsay Kirkham, an editor and freelance .

"Former CIA director and army general David Petraeus is seemingly endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, according to a new book. 'She’d make a tremendous President,' Petraeus reportedly says in the new book 'HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,' written by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. 'Like a lot of great leaders, her most impressive qualities were most visible during tough times,' he says in the book, according to The New York Daily News. 'In the wake of the Benghazi attacks, for example, she was extraordinarily resolute, determined, and controlled.' David Petraeus (l) said Hillary Clinton (R) was 'extraordinarily resolute, determined, and controlled' in the wake of the Benghazi attacks. The two are seen together in this 2008 photo . Petraeus was CIA director during the Benghazi attacks, which killed four Americans, including two who worked for the CIA, as well as Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, ABC News reports. The book will be on sale Tuesday, and claims that Petraeus and Clinton became friends while she served as Secretary of State. Clinton reportedly invited Petraeus to her house in December 2008 to talk about the Middle East over wine, according to The Wall Street Journal. The meeting is believed to been so successful, Petraeus returned for more wine the next night. The pair reportedly became allies after discussing the Middle East over a bottle of wine in December 2008 . Clinton and Petraeus, the paper adds, soon became allies over foreign relations in the Middle East. Petraeus reportedly even lent Clinton his plane when hers broke down in Saudi Arabi. Clinton and Petraeus reportedly also became close when discussing personal issues, the paper adds. After Petraeus resigned as CIA director in the wake of his extramarital affair with biographer Paula Broadwell, Clinton is believed to have sent him a note of sympathy referring to her own husband's reported infidelities, writing 'I have a little experience.'","Says in wake of Benghazi she was 'extraordinarily resolute, determined, and controlled'

"Washington has been wasting millions of tax dollars on massages for rabbits, tweeting terrorists and teaching sea monkeys synchronised swimming, a U.S. senator claims. Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn has just released his annual Wastebook where he outlines, in his opinion, $25billion of the U.S. government's 'worst spending of the year'. The list of government projects include a $500,000 project to encourage butterfly farming and $856,000 to study the movement of mountain lions which saw eight months spent on teaching them to run on a treadmill. No more waste: Republican senator Tom Coburn has outlined 100 examples of what he believes is the U.S. government's 'worst spending of the year' Coburn's tome, 'Wastebook 2014: What Washington doesn't want you to read', outlines 100 tax-funded projects this year. Coburn is a Republican senator who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, and voted against a bill which would have expanded background checks for Americans purchasing guns and other firearms. Since his election in 2005 he has relentlessly chased up what he considers to be 'government waste'. 'Only someone with too much of someone else's money and not enough accountability for how it was being spent could come up some of these projects,' Coburn said of his 2014 Wastebook. The 100 projects include a $387,000 'Swedish massages for bunnies' grant, however it is not quite the luxury pet spa project Coburn makes it out to be. Not a gym fan: A $856,000 study of the movement of mountain lions involved getting three captive cats to use a treadmill and it took eight months before they were 'comfortable' on it . Shooting down waste: The Oklahoma senator has relentlessly chased up what he considers 'tax waste' The two year project at the Ohio State University Sports Medicine Center saw the rabbits given rubdowns after being subjected to exercise, to see the impact of massages on muscle recovery. A $10,000 agricultural project gets rapped by Coburn as he claims it's 'money to watch grass grow'. Technically, this is indeed true, the Department of Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is paying for 'the cost to monitor grasses' in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida. However, this particular species of cordgrass, known formally as Spartina alterniflora, is vital for the survival of swaps, and the project will end in a 'guide on best practices for cultivating the cordgrass'. Also on the list is a study at the University of California Santa Cruz was awarded a $856,000 National Science Foundation grant to study the movements of mountain lions. This involved getting three captive mountain lions to use a treadmill, and it took eight months before they were 'comfortable' on the exercise machine so the study could commence. Another animal-focused item on Coburn's list is a study looking at the effects of sea monkeys' swimming patterns on water movement which was awarded $50,000. Wanna give me a massage? A $387,000 study on the effect of post-exercise rubdowns on muscles was carried out on rabbits . Coast guard party patrols – $100,000 . Watching grass grow – $10,000 . State department tweets terrorists – $3million . Swedish massages for rabbits – $387,000 . Paid vacations for bureaucrats gone wild – $20million . Mountain lions on a treadmill – $856,000 . Synchronized swimming for sea monkeys – $50,000 . Scientists hope monkey gambling unlocks secrets of free will –$171,000 . Rich and famous rent out their luxury pads tax free – $10million . Studying 'hangry' spouses stabbing voodoo dolls – $331,000 . Promoting U.S. culture around the globe with nose flautists – $90million . Although the 'Wastebook' covers the tax-funded grants for business, such as dairy farms looking to increase ice cream production, Coburn does not follow up on how much could be returned to the state in the form of taxes paid, or the potential for new jobs being created if the businesses are successful as a result of the grants. However, in one instance the Agriculture Department handed a town on a Native American reservation $500,000 to raise and sell butterflies, but as of August, only 50 of the 845 tribe members had signed up. Coburn goes all out claiming the U.S. taxpayer is helping Disney renovate it's Polynesian Village resort. Although the Small Business Administration has provided $1.4million in surety bond guarantees to support the massive renovation at the Walt Disney World Resort, the money is set to support two of the firms hired by Disney to do the work - not Disney World itself. Senator Coburn, a physician, announced in January he is retiring from the Senate next year, due to ongoing health issues.","Oklahoma senator outlines 100 'government waste projects' in new book .

"British cities could be hit by rioting because of an influx of Roma migrants, David Blunkett has warned. The former Home Secretary said ‘frictions’ with local people could lead racial tensions to ‘explode’ in a repeat of the riots that rocked Northern towns in the summer of 2001. Mr Blunkett called on Roma migrants from Slovakia to ‘change their culture’ because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused ‘understandable tensions’ with residents in his home city of Sheffield. A Romanian family who told the Daily Mail that they are moving to the UK . Sheffield citizens have already set up street patrols to combat anti-social behaviour by the Roma. Britain is home to more than 200,000 Roma migrants, most of them from Eastern Europe. ‘If everything exploded, if things went wrong, the community would obviously be devastated,’ Mr Blunkett said. ‘We saw this is Bradford, Burnley and Oldham all those years ago when I first became Home Secretary. If things implode it’s not outside here that cops it, it’s the community.’ Mr Blunkett called on Roma migrants from Slovakia to 'change their culture' On that occasion more than 200 people were jailed after racial tensions erupted and Asian communities clashed with far-Right groups such as the National Front. Mr Blunkett claimed that the cultural gulf between the community in Sheffield and the Roma was far greater than that between white Britons and Pakistani immigrants. He said: ‘The Roma youngsters have come from a background even more different culturally, because they were living in the edge of woods, not going to school, not used to the norms of everyday life. We’ve got to change that.’ Mr Blunkett said locals were entitled to ‘grumble’ about the large influx of migrants from Roma communities, but they should not ‘stir up hate’. ‘I wouldn’t want other people to put up with things I wouldn’t put up with myself,’ he said. ‘This is nothing to do with criticising people about being racist. By all means grumble, but don’t stir up hate. If you set a fire alight, you came from Bradford, you saw it – nobody gained from that.’ Mr Blunkett said the ‘understandable tensions’ between locals and Roma were evidence of a ‘cry for help from very, many people’ who want the authorities to intervene and return their communities to ‘the semblance we had before’. The former Home Secretary called on the police to persuade Roma people ‘not to spend all their time in the street’ and discourage them from throwing rubbish. He accused the Government of having its ‘head in the sand’ over the true numbers of Roma in Britain. In 2011, official estimates suggested ‘relatively few Roma citizens’ lived in the UK. The Mail yesterday quoted the mayor of two Romanian villages as saying half of their residents will move to the UK when restrictions are lifted in January. Koller Gabriel-Adrian said he believed ‘50 per cent’ of the 1,100 people in poverty-stricken Berini and Uliuc could travel to Britain in search of higher salaries – and the generous welfare system – in the New Year. He added: ‘In January, the only thing left in the village will be the goat.’",Mr Blunkett called on Roma migrants from Slovakia to 'change their culture' because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused 'understandable tensions'
"Experts have used a radical new satellites to capture unique psychedelic images of the ruptures in the Earth's crust caused by the Napa earthquake. Radar images from the UK's Sentinel-1A satellite have been used to map the biggest earthquake that has shaken northern California in 25 years. The images reveal the rupture is larger than previously thought. By processing two Sentinel-1A images, which were acquired on 7 August and 31 August 2014 over this wine-producing region, an interferogram was generated. The two round shapes around Napa valley, which are visible in the central part of the image, show how the ground moved during the quake. The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'. This uses two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale surface changes. Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'. Each colour cycle corresponds to a deformation of 28 mm deformation. The maximum deformation is more than 10 cm, and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly. Yngvar Larsen from Norway's Northern Research Institute and Petar Marinkovic from PPO.labs in the Netherlands processed this new interferogram from two images: one that Sentinel-1A acquired on 7 August, the day the satellite reached its operational orbit, and another captured on 31 August. It clearly confirms that part of the West Napa Fault system was responsible for the 6.0 earthquake that rocked California's wine-producing region. However, the fault had not been identified as being particularly hazardous prior to the quake that hit on 24 August. Importantly, the extent of the ground deformation in the interferogram shows that the fault slip continues further north than the extent of the rupture mapped at the surface. Sharp lines in the interferogram show minor movements on other faults, such as the part of the West Napa Fault system that crosses Napa airport. The maximum deformation is more than 10 cm, and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly. Austin Elliott, a PhD student at the University of California Davis, is one of the team mapping the earthquake rupture on the ground. Researchers have also been on the ground to examine the damage to the local area . He said, 'The data from satellites are invaluable for completely identifying the surface break of the earthquake – deformation maps from satellite imagery guide us to places where rupture has not yet been mapped.' Tim Wright, from University of Leeds said, 'This successful demonstration of Sentinel-1A marks the beginning of a new era for our ability to map earthquakes from space. 'COMET scientists are building a system that will provide these results routinely for all continental earthquakes, as well as mapping the slow warping of the ground surface that leads to earthquakes.' Sentinel-1A passes over the same spot on the ground every 12 days. However, once its identical twin, Sentinel-1B, is launched in 2016, this will be cut to just six days, so that changes can be mapped even faster .","Confirms West Napa Fault system was responsible for the 6.0 earthquake .

"A teenage boy who lost an arm and a leg as a baby has become the first person in the UK to be fitted with a prosthetic hand that is so advanced it can be controlled via a smartphone app. Patrick Kane, 16, is now sporting the i-limb ultra revolution, which can be remotely-controlled and comes complete with an iOS app allowing the wearer to control its grip. Patrick can also take advantage of five individually powered digits - including a rotating thumb - on the prosthetic, which is Scottish firm Touch Bionics' most advanced yet. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking technology: Patrick Kane has become the first person in the UK to be fitted with the i-limb ultra revolution bionic hand . The teenager, from London, lost all of the fingers on his left hand after contracting meningococcal septicaemia - the virulent form of meningitis - when he was just nine-months-old. The wearer of the i-limb ultra revolution hand can use a smartphone app to choose one of 24 different grips. Alternatively, the hand can be controlled by muscle signals. Electrodes in the wrist pick up electrical impulses created by contracting muscles and these are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand. The computer then moves the hand into any one of a series of pre-set patterns. Doctors were also forced to amputate Patrick's right leg below the knee, and part of each finger from his right hand. The student - who was fitted with his first prosthetic through the NHS shortly after his first birthday - previously wore an i-limb ultra, but has now become the first person in the UK to be fitted with the new, more advanced version from the brains at Touch Bionics. Featuring a rotating wrist and an aluminium chassis, the firm claims their creation is the most dextrous prosthetic limb ever made. It's unique app capability means the . wearer can choose from a range of 24 different grips at the touch of a . button. The app can also offers training on how to best use the device . and can diagnose problems with it. Dexterity: Patrick, 16, is seen holding a smartphone with the prosthetic hand, which can be controlled via an app . Previously Patrick could use only four pre-set grips on the go, and would have to return to his computer to alter the settings. The i-limb is so sensitive it can be used to grip a single sheet of paper, play Connect Four or tie shoelaces - but it is also powerful enough to withstand the strain of 90kg weights in the gym. The covering can be made to match the wearer's natural skin tone, but Patrick chose a jet black version of the i-limb, which costs from £25,000 to upwards of £80,000, depending on how far up the arm it needs to extend. 'I have only had it for 24 hours and it's not so much that it allows me to do new things but it will allow me to do things more smoothly and naturally,' Patrick said. 'The movement runs much more smoothly. I have been practising playing Connect 4 with it. 'There are custom grips I can choose so if I have a certain tennis racquet or cricket bat I could choose a grip for it to fit it perfectly and it will remember that. 'I also use it in the gym, on the rowing machine and using weights and pulleys,' he said. The advanced prosthetic uses muscle signals to shift into a series of pre-set patterns. It achieves this by using electrodes . in the wrist to pick up electrical impulses created by contracting . muscles, which are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand. Prosthetic: Wearers can select from a range of 24 different grips for the i-limb using a smartphone app . Improved: Scotland-based Touch Bionics says the latest i-limb boasts unparalleled dexterity and superior control and ease of use . Each of the fingers bends at the joints and can be adapted to fit around any shape of object the owner wants to hold. These pictures show Patrick using his . new bionic hand to grasp a range of items from a smartphone and a water . glass to a rubber ball and a single coin. The bionic hand can also be used for various tasks from typing to tying shoe laces. It comes in black or neutral, can automatically return to a natural position after a period of inactivity and is powered by a battery. The device is so technical that users have to undergo rigorous training in order to get the most out of it. Advanced: The latest version of the i-limb is so advanced it can be controlled via an app on a smartphone .

"President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he would 'work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator.' But the central theme of his foreign policy-heavy address was that American strength would continue to come by working through international coalitions.

Syrian people.' But . he also said he would rely on other countries including Jordan, . Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq to 'confront terrorists working across Syrian . borders.' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to West Point that 'we look at the Syria conflict as part of a broader counterterrorism challenge.' 'That is why we're going to continue increasing our support to the moderate opposition, who offer the best alternative to both the murderous Assad dictatorship and the extremists who have exploited the crisis.' It's not clear what form that support will take, or if the U.S. will offer any of it on its own. He did say that America 'will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it – when our people are threatened; when our livelihood is at stake; or when the security of our allies is in danger.' But 'when issues of global concern that do not pose a direct threat to the United States are at stake – when crises arise that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction – then the threshold for military action must be higher,' he said. 'In such circumstances, we should not go it alone.' President Obama handed out diplomas to the graduating class, which consisted of about 1,100 soon-to-be-commissioned officers in the U.S. military .

'This is American leadership, American strength,' he said. House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce slammed Obama for bringing about 'a general loss of U.S. credibility, making successful foreign policy nearly impossible' 'Of . course, skeptics often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral . action,' he allowed. 'For them, working through international . institutions, or respecting international law, is a sign of weakness. I . think they’re wrong.' He . told West Point cadets that 'in the course of your service, you will . work as a team with diplomats and development experts. You will get to . know allies and train partners.' 'You will embody what it means for America to lead.' 'By most . measures,' the president said, 'America has rarely been stronger . relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise – who . suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership . slip away – are either misreading history or engaged in partisan . politics.' Republicans . in Congress have consistently argued that Obama has weakened the United . States. Polls in Europe and elsewhere indicate that citizens of foreign . nations have lowered the opinions of the United States since he took . office. Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement after Obama's speech that the president has made foreign policy 'assurances' since taking office in 2009, '[b]ut too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions, or no actions.' 'The result has been a general loss of U.S. credibility, making successful foreign policy nearly impossible.' 'The Obama Administration has consistently underestimated the threats we face,' he said, citing Iran, North Korea and al-Qaeda.

He drew cheers from graduating cadets – far more robust applause than his speech itself – by announcing a symbolic pardon for those who were 'on restriction due to minor conduct offenses' as students. As they graduate, cadets are released from those punishments automatically. The president's biggest applause line was not for a policy position, but in praise of a former West Point cadet who was wounded in Afghanistan. Gavin White 'lost one of his legs in an attack,' Obama said. 'I met him last year at Walter Reed. He was wounded, but just as determined as the day that he arrived here. He developed a simple goal. 'Today, his sister Morgan will graduate. And true to his promise, Gavin will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her.'","'I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being,' the president insisted .

"It may be the most devastating act of mercy in history. A newspaper report chronicling how a boy of four was saved from drowning has surfaced in a German archive. The child – who historians believe could have been Adolf Hitler – was plucked from the icy waters of the River Inn in Passau, Germany, in January 1894. Rescued: Johann Kuehberger, left, saved the life of a four-year-old Adolf Hitler, pictured right in an undated photo, when they were both children . According to Max Tremmel, a priest who . went on to become one of Europe's most famous organists, his . predecessor Johann Kuehberger had rescued the terrified Hitler. Father Tremmel told before his death in 1980 how Father Kuehberger, around the same age as Hitler, had seen the other boy struggling in the waters of the River Inn and dived . in to rescue him. The story . was never verified by Hitler during his lifetime. But now a small cutting . from the Donauzeitung - Danube newspaper - of 1894 has been found in . Passau. It describes how a 'young fellow' fell through the thin ice of the river in January of that year. The report described how a 'determined comrade' - the paper at the time was left-wing - went into the freezing water to save the child who would grow into mankind's biggest monster. Icy waters: A young Hitler fell in the River Inn in Passau, southern Germany, across the border from his native Austria . The near-drowning episode also featured in a German book called 'Out of Passau- Leaving a City Hitler Called Home,' by Anna Elisabeth Rosmus, a personal history of her family's connections with it. She wrote; 'The banks of the River Inn provided an idyllic setting for the children to play. Monster: Hitler never admitted to the near-drowning accident in later life . 'In 1894, while playing tag with a group of other children, the way many children do in Passau to this day, Adolf fell into the river. 'The current was very strong and the water ice cold, flowing as it did straight from the mountains. 'Luckily for young Adolf, the son of the owner of the house where he lived was able to pull him out in time and so saved his life.' Hitler would, as a young man and later among his generals, tell stories of how he played cowboys and Indians on the banks of the river but he never once related the near-drowning tale. 'In Passau, however,' said Mrs Rosmus, 'Everyone knew the story. Some of the other stories told about him were that he never learned to swim and needed glasses.' No name is given for the child in the . old Passau newspaper but historians believe it gives credence to . Father Tremmel`s claim that it was indeed Hitler. Later this month Bavarian . Radio is to run a news feature programme on the incident. Called 'If Hitler had drowned. The legend of a fatal . lifesaving' will feature several elderly Passau residents confirming that they heard the story of Hitler's near-brush with death . as they grew up in the city. Holocaust: Child survivors in Auschwitz just after the camp was liberated by the Soviet Army . It is likely that Hitler airbrushed the incident out of his life history.

"The husband of missing Minnesota woman Kira Trevino, 30, has been taken into custody today on the suspicion that he murdered her. Jeffrey Trevino, 39, is being held at Ramsey County Jail following the disappearance of his wife, a manager at the Mall of America, who has not been seen since Friday. Her abandoned car was found in a Mall of America parking lot on Monday morning with her cell-phone and purse still inside and subsequently officers performed executed a search warrant at the couple's home in the 500 block of Iowa Avenue E in St. Paul. Scroll Down for Video . Brutal slaying: Kira Trevino was murdered by her husband in February this year but her body was not uncovered until two months after her tragic death . Kira Trevino, 30, was last seen by her husband, Jeff Trevino, at the couple's St Paul house on Friday and Trevino's family said that her cell phone and purse were discovered in the white 2010 Chevy Cobalt . Upon conducting that search on Monday evening, investigators said they found evidence at the house that a crime had been committed. Despite the arrest of Jeffrey Trevino, police still consider Kira Trevino a missing person. Her family, who have made relentless media appearances as they try to raise awareness of missing Kira, were notified of the arrest this evening. 'I actually just saw him, Jeff, Wednesday evening at my house in Wausau,' said Kira's mother Marcie Steger to CBS Local. 'As far as we know, he was the last person to see her.' Kira Trevino, 30, was last seen by her husband, Jeff Trevino, at the couple's St Paul house on Friday and Trevino's family said that her cell phone and purse were discovered in her white 2010 Chevy Cobalt. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension searched the home on Monday evening as family and friends made desperate pleas for Kira, who is a manager at Delia’s, a clothing store for teenage girls in the world-famous mall to return home. The pretty store manager was last seen by her husband on Friday and her family have appeared on television in Minneapolis and St. Paul to express their distress . Mall security noticed her car in a parking ramp on the west side of the mall at about 4:55 a.m. Monday and called police. Tara Hall, a colleague who said she is Trevino's best friend, told the Star Tribune that it's perfectly normal for Kira to park where the car was found, but not specifically in the isolated location under a ramp where police found the vehicle. However, family members told Fox 9 News that it was neatly parked in a place that she never usually stopped in and struck them as odd, because Kira was not skilled at parking. Authorities canvassed the car and said there was 'evidence that concerned investigators,' but they wouldn’t elaborate further on what that meant. Security personel are reviewing surveillance footage for any clues that could shed light on Trevino's disappearance. 'This is absolutely 100 percent out of character for her,' said her friend Jackie Arrando. Trevino is a manager at Delia¿s, a clothing store for teenage girls in the Mall of America . Kira Trevino worked at Delia's in the Mall of America, which sells teenage girl clothing . 'She would never, ever just not show up for work or go somewhere without letting people know. Never.'

'Kira, if you're watching this, I hope you're safe and I hope you come home. We're just very worried and concerned and we're going to do everything we can to find you,' Kira's Sister Keri Anne Steger told KARE 11. Damning evidence: Kira Trevino's car was found outside her workplace at the Mall of America in Bloomington . Kira Trevino's mother Marci Steger has appeared on all local television stations pleading for her daughter to return home or any information that can help with that aim . Kira was first reported missing on Saturday after she failed to turn up for work on Saturday - leaving her husband as the last person to see her. 'We are looking to see if any suspicious activity is related to this disappearance, as we do with any missing persons case,' said St. Paul Police Sgt. Paul Paulos. 'She is an adult, but she has been reported missing, and this is an active case. We recognize that this is important to her family and to her friends, and it’s important to us as well.' Trevino’s husband, Jeff Trevino, confirmed that police found the car but would not take questions about the case, saying he didn’t want to hinder the investigation.

"Britain's exports to countries outside the European Union have soared to a record high as demand around the world grows, official figures showed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said exports rose 4.9 per cent between April and June to a record £78.4billion in a major boost to the recovering economy. The surge in demand for goods stamped ‘Made in Britain’ was driven by countries outside the EU as manufacturers entered growing markets in Latin America and Asia. UK trade up: Britain's trade deficit - the difference in the amount it exports versus the value of everything it imports - narrowed to a better than expected £8.1billion in June . Exports to non-EU countries have grown by more than 40 per cent over the past five years while sales to Europe have risen by just 3.1 per cent. Sales to China, India and Thailand have all more than doubled in that time. Experts said the shift in trade away from Europe towards other markets ‘is great news for the UK economy’. Business leaders said it gave David Cameron an opportunity to demand ‘a much better deal for Britain’ in negotiations with Brussels over membership of the European Union. Exports to the EU rose by 2.3 per cent between April and June to £38.1billion. But sales to non-EU countries jumped 7.5 per cent to £40.3billion – the first time quarterly sales to the rest of the world have topped £40billion. In June alone, exports to the EU fell 0.6 per cent to £12.8billion while sales to the rest of the world rose 10.4 per cent to £14.2billion, also a record. Katie Evans, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research in London, said: ‘Advanced economies are going to struggle to regain the growth rates they were used to before the financial crisis, and so the switch towards emerging markets is great news for the UK economy. 'By tapping into fast growth elsewhere in the world the UK can secure a share of this new wealth for itself.’ Economist Jim O'Neill said the figures support his thoughts that there are fewer benefits of being in the EU . Trade with countries beyond the EU is seen as crucial to Britain’s recovery as the crisis in the eurozone depresses demand close to home. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, a campaign group in favour of renegotiating the terms of UK membership of the EU, urged the Prime Minister to demand a better deal from Brussels. ‘With the failure of the euro depressing demand on the continent, and the success of the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, it should come as no surprise British companies are increasingly looking outside the EU to do business,’ he said. ‘The onus is now on the Government to recognise that business focus is turning towards markets outside the eurozone and use this to leverage a much better deal for Britain in the upcoming renegotiation with Brussels.’ Although the UK’s share of world trade has shrunk in recent decades, manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems remain global powerhouses and the value of exports has soared. Jim O’Neill, the economist who coined the term BRIC to describe the emerging powerhouses of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said the benefits of being in the EU are dwindling. He said: ‘Given the dramatic changes in world trade as a result of the emergence of the so-called BRIC countries, China especially, neither the EU or eurozone are as important trade or economic blocks as one might have thought. The benefits of being “in” are certainly not as strong as they might have once been.’ The surge in exports has helped narrow Britain’s trade gap with the rest of the world. The goods trade deficit – exports minus imports – shrank to £8.1billion in June from £8.7billion in May and well below the £8.5billion expected by economists. Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘This confirms the strength of the UK’s recovery.’","New figures reveal exports rose 4.9per cent between April and June .

"Gulf Coast residents are getting a history lesson after a mysterious ship popped up on the beach after Hurricane Isaac. The wreckage of a presumed Civil War warship washed up in Fort Meyer, Alabama, near Mobile, after the Category 1 storm barreled down on the Gulf Cost. Portions of the blockade runner had been uncovered in previous hurricanes but the strength of Isaac's storm surge unearthed more of the ship's structure, leaving behind a stunning scene and much debate over the ship's provenance. Scroll down for video. Mystery ship: The wreckage of a presumed Civil War blockade runner appeared on the beach near Fort Morgan, Alabama after Hurricane Isaac . 'Look what Isaac uncovered!' Meyer Vacation Rentals posted on their Facebook page, with photos of the breathtaking remains provided by the local real estate company. The ship first became visible after Hurricane Ivan, in 2004, and reappeared after Hurricane Ike in 2008. 'There is disagreement about this mystery ship, whether it is a blockade runner from the Civil War or a rum runner from the 1930s.' 'Either way, it's quite interesting. This is the most visible it has been in recent years. Eventually the shifting sands will pull it back under the beach, where it will slumber until another storm is powerful enough to bring it back to the surface,' the posting added. Civil War: It appears the ship was manufactured by the British during the Civil War to break the military blockade established to weaken the Confederacy . Fast and light: The ships were designed to be longer, narrower and faster than traditional steamers guarding the coasts . The wooden boat, measuring 150 feet long and 30 feet wide, is believed . to be the remains of the Monticello, a Confederate blockade runner that had . burned after it crash trying to pass the Union Navy guarding Mobile Bay during the Civil War. The vessel appears to have been powered by steam. The ship's hull appears . to be an old water pump and a long pipe runs down the center of the . ship, according to the Mobile Press-Register. In the War Between the States, which lasted from 1861–1865, U.S. President . Abraham Lincoln ordered a blockade to cut off the South . from trading with Europe to weaken the Confederate Army during the . conflict. A runner was a military warship used to break blockades or . used in smuggling operations, because its lighter weight allowed for . greater speed. The steamships were designed to be longer, narrower and faster than traditional steamers, stationed along the coast, so . they could outrun the enemy. Blockade: U.S. President Abraham Lincoln ordered the blockade to weaken the South. Blockade runners (like the one pictured) were used to thwart the Union Navy . The design was actually the brainchild of engineers in Great Britain, . who manufactured them to allow for continued trade with the . South. The former Colonizer relied on exports like cotton from Southern farmers . and investors were keen to protect their investments during the . conflict. They also played an essential part in the war effort because they could bring much needed supplies to Confederate states. ‘For this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent . entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid,’ President Lincoln wrote in the Proclamation of Blockade Against Southern Ports, in . April of 1861. Storm surge: The ship first became visible after Hurricane Ivan, in 2004, and after Hurricane Ike in 2008, but the recent strength of Hurricane Isaac further unearthed more of the ship's wreckage . Enjoy it while it lasts: Locals say the shifting sands will pull the ship back under the beach . ‘If, therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall . approach, or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports, she will . be duly warned by the Commander of one of the blockading vessels, who . will endorse on her register the fact and date of such warning, and if . the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded . port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port,’ the proclamation continued. By the end of the Civil War, the Union Navy had captured more than 1,100 blockade runners and had destroyed another 355 vessels. Though most signs point to the ship, discovered on the Alabama beach, having been a runner some historians are arguing over the boat’s origin. Some speculate it could be the Rachel, a 20th Century schooner, a sailing vessel that had run aground in 1933. And even others suspect the ship could have been the Aurora, which was used to smuggle rum . into the U.S. during the Prohibition - the national ban on the sale, . manufacture, and transportation of alcohol that lasted from 1920 to . 1933. But regardless of its origins, locals are coming out to take in the sight and experience a bit of history after the storm. What a view: Locals are seizing the opportunity to take a look at a piece of history on the beach . Mississippi and Louisiana are now picking up the pieces after the Category 1 hurricane made landfall last week, sustaining winds of 80 miles per hour. At least seven people died in the U.S. in the storm, five in Louisiana and two in Mississippi. More than 100,000 Louisiana residents are still without power, in addition to thousands of people in Mississippi and Arkansas.","Blockade runners were lightweight warships designed to outrun traditional steamers .

"Former The Only Way is Essex star, Abi Clarke, 23, confessed about the six months of traumashe suffered following cosmetic procedures . Former The Only Way is Essex star, Abi Clarke, has spoken about the 'six months of hell' she experienced after undergoing a 10-minute lip filler procedure, which left her blistered and scarred. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain today, Abi, 23, confessed about the trauma she suffered following the procedure. 'A 10 minute quick fix turned into six months of hell,' she said. 'I went in for a an exfoliation and the person who did that for me could also do botox and fillers so they suggested to do that for me.' Abi also admitted she hadn't done enough research into the beautician or the procedure. 'That's one thing I do regret,' she said. 'I can't stress enough - 100 per cent you need to look into where you're going and who you're seeing and if they're actually capable and professional enough to do that.' Abi admitted that they made her lips go hard and split in the middle. 'It was like cement in my lip,' she said. 'It was really painful and over time, over the six months, I got blisters and the scar tissue got really sore and there were ulcers so everything was reacting!' Asked whether the ordeal has put her off cosmetic enhancements, Abi said: 'Definitely, 100 per cent I really have.' The 23-year-old, who joined the reality TV show two years ago, said she felt under pressure to look perfect and decided to follow in the footsteps of fellow stars Amy Childs and Lauren Goodger. 'When everyone looks amazing, you can think maybe I could do this, especially as some of the girls had work done. I asked them for advice,' she previously admitted when she appeared on Channel 4's Bodyshockers. 'I wasn't really thinking about the needles, just about the results,' she told TV presenter Katie Piper. But the procedure didn't give her the look she'd hoped for after she had a bad reaction to the filler. Scroll down for video . Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, Abi, 23, confessed about the trauma she suffered following the procedure.'A 10 minute quick fix turned into six months of hell,' she said. Abi (second left) on the Good Morning Britain sofa with Dr Hilary Jones (left) and presenters Kate Garraway (second right) and Ranvir Singh (far right) She explained: 'The filler reacted in my lips and I got a wedge of it that was pushing out on either side. I thought if my lips crack, that will be it, my face will be ruined for life.' The swelling did subside but the lumps of filler remained making her lips look and feel uneven. 'I regret how my lips are now, I can hide the lumps of filler with make up but it feels disgusting,' Abi's natural look in 2013, left, and in 2014, right, after the filler which made her lips lumpy and painful . Lauren, pictured after her lip filler injections, was left with a trout pout after she reacted badly to the treatment . She said: 'Now my lips are bruised and painful, I didn't realise how fake the filler would make me look. I have ruined my looks for nothing. I didn't really need them done.' Explaining more about her motivation to have the injections, Abi said she thought having a fuller pout would boost her self-esteem. 'I thought my lips were going to make me happy and the one thing that would give me that confidence - but it made me more upset,' she said. 'I have realised that confidence doesn't need to come from my lips, it needs to come from me. 'I need to have the confidence to be myself and to not want to look like all the other celebrities.' Abi's parents revealed on the documentary how they also wish their daughter hadn't 'ruined her face'. Abigail, right, pictured with former TOWIE star Lauren Goodger, left, in 2013 said she felt under pressure to have surgery to look as glamorous as the other celebrities . Abi with TOWIE co-star Jasmin Walia, left, in 2013 before she had the lip filler injected . Her father said: 'Her lips were fine as they were, no parent wants their child to be adjusting things. 'Her lips don't look natural now, they look painful.' Her mother agreed. She told Abi: 'It looks like a blow up dolly. It breaks my heart you had to do that as naturally you had lovely lips.' In a bid to get back to her natural look, Abi arranged to have filler removal treatment while being followed by the Bodyshocker cameras. This involveed having more injections in her lips to inject a chemical to break down the filler. Despite the area being numbed first, Abi squealed in pain as the needle is inserted in her upper lip. The reality TV star, pictured after the lip filler treatment when she used make-up to hide the lumps, said she wishes she had never had the procedure . Abi with Bodyshockers presenter Katie Piper after having a painful reversal treatment to make her lips look more natural again . Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal who carried out the reversal surgery on Abi said: 'Abi came to see me after a lip augmentation with dermal fillers had unfortunately gone terribly wrong. Dermal fillers carry real risk of cyst formation, infection, allergy and scarring and it's important to be aware of these as part of doing your research when seeking these procedures. 'Over several weeks I saw Abi in stages we worked to drain and remove deep cysts, free scar tissue and dissolve filler which had been misplaced. 'It was a painful process for her but she was been brave throughout, recovered well and is now looking better than ever. 'Cases like Abi's I see more and more, and it's important for patients to seek out the right qualified professional to undergo these procedures and not base their choice on cost. Finding a skilled professional you can trust Is priceless. They will always guide and help you and be there to help'you if things don't go as planned.' Abi admitted the painful reversal treatments were worth it to rid her lips of the lumpy filler once and for all. She said: 'I'm really happy, I feel so normal now but my lips will never be the same or as tight and nice as they once were.' Abi said she'd learnt her lesson and doesn't intend to have any more cosmetic surgery for the foreseeable future. 'I'm embracing the natural look now,' she said.","Former The Only Way is Essex star Abigail Clarke, 23, regrets procedure .

"They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - and here's a woman who's taken that fury to a terrifying new level. When 26-year-old Torz Reynolds found out her boyfriend of two years had been cheating on her she took revenge, in the most gruesome way possible. Miss Reynolds, from London, had thought Stuart 'Chopper' May broke up with her because he moved to Alaska to take a dream job. She even saw him off, tearfully, at the airport. But a week later Miss Reynold found out he had instead allegedly moved in with a woman he'd allegedly been having an affair with for six months. Torz Reynolds took bloody revenge by removing a tattoo of her cheating ex-boyfriend's name with a scalpel. She then sent the severed skin to him by post . Miss . Reynolds, a body piercer at the King's Cross Tattoo Parlour, got the words . ‘Chopper's Bitch' tattooed a year into their doomed relationship. Pictured left is her arm after she removed it . Miss Reynolds spent an hour and a half carefully slicing the skin around this tattoo from her arm . Gruesome: Here is the sliver of skin Miss Reynolds sliced off her arm . So, taking a scalpel to her arm, she removed tattoo she had done of nickname 'Chopper' and then sent the severed skin to him by post. Miss Reynolds was shocked when she discovered from friends that Chopper was still in the UK and had allegedly moved in with his new woman. It took her an hour and a half to carefully slicing the skin from her arm. She then used a pair of dissection tweezers to peel the skin back. Afterwards, the remnants of the tattoo were put in a jar, wrapped up with a bow and sent via recorded delivery to her former lover. Miss Reynolds even tracked it online so she knew for definite that Chopper, 24, had received it. Miss Reynolds, originally from Colchester, Essex, said: 'I packaged it up so it really did look like a present. I even used different handwriting so he'd have no idea that it was me. 'I can't imagine what his reaction was. I wish I could have been there to see it.' Torz Reynolds went out with her ex-boyfriend, Stuart 'Chopper' May (pictured), here for two years before they broke up . Miss Reynolds reckons that people take what she did too seriously: 'At the end of the day, it's only skin and it will grow back' With no anaesthetic and using only a . bottle of Vasocaine numbing spray to halt the bleeding, Miss Reynolds . made a rectangular incision around the tattoo. Afterwards, she used the . tweezers to peel back the corners. 'I don't like pain, but the skin . coming off was actually quite relaxing. It was the after-pain that hurt . the most. It felt like a nasty stinging sensation and putting on clothes . was a difficult task,' said Miss Reynolds. 'I'd . always planned to send the skin to Chopper.

I thought he was brilliant and so did all of my friends. 'I got the tattoo of Choppper's name done as a surprise and he was really proud of it.

"The White House wanted Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to lie on Sunday talk shows to downplay the part Social Security played in driving the deficit, it was revealed today. Geithner writes in his memoir Stress Test, out today, that the White House communications director asked him to downplay the long term cost of Social Security spending to mollify the Democratic Party's base. 'I remember during one Roosevelt Room prep session before I appeared on the Sunday shows, I objected when Dan Pfeiffer wanted me to say Social Security didn't contribute to the deficit. It wasn't a main driver of our future deficits, but it did contribute,' he says. 'Pfeiffer said the line was a 'dog whistle' to the left, a phrase I had never heard before. He had to explain that the phrase was code to the Democratic base, signaling that we intended to protect Social Security.' Scroll down for video . Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, pictured here in 2012, writes in his memoir that the White House Communications Director once pressured him to mislead the American people about Social Security spending . Geithner's book release comes amidst allegations that the White House changed the Sunday show talking points of U.S. ambassador to . the U.N. Susan Rice's after the September 11, 2012 attack in . Benghazi, Libya for political reasons. Days after the White House claims it knew what happened in Benghazi was 'an act of terror,' Rice wrongly blamed an anti-Muslim internet video for the deadly assault in a string of high-profile interviews on network news stations. The White House has forcefully denied that it made anything other than minor changes to Rice's talking points. Recently released e-mails between deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and White House communications staff calls the veracity of the Obama administration's claims into question. The emails show that Rice was instructed to claim the attack was 'spontaneously inspired  ' and 'to ​underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.' Geithner's anecdote about White House communications staff trying pressure him into misleading Americans about the country's ability to meet its future financial obligations once again casts a shadow on the Obama administration's willingness to tell the truth when the truth is politically unappealing. He writes that Pfeiffer, who is now Obama's senior communications adviser, often let party politics come into play when discussing how the administration should respond to fiscal issues. During a discussion on spending cuts, Geithner says that Pfieffer argued that 'we couldn't afford to alienate our base . and split a weakened Democratic Party in pursuit of an imaginary . compromise with Republicans who didn't want to compromise.' Early reviews of Geithner's book indicate that the former Treasury Secretary, who now works at a private equity firm, does not appear to have an axe to grind with Obama, giving greater weight to his recollections. Geithner mostly uses the memoir to provide context for actions he took as Treasury Secretary from 2009 to 2013 to get the nation back on track after the financial crisis of 2008. The only other seemingly negative remark Geithner makes about the White House is about President Obama, whom he says, 'Sometimes I thought he wore his frustration too openly.' 'He harbored the overly optimistic belief that since his motives and values were good, since his team was thoughtful and well-intentioned, we deserved to be perceived that way,' Geithner says in the book, according to a review in the New York Times.","In his memoir, out today, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says the White House wanted him to mislead Americans about the long term costs of Social Security .

For those not familiar with Time Lord transportation, a TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) can take passengers to any point in time and space. Amazingly, the interior is much larger than its exterior, which looks like an old London police box. The TARDIS is in some respects alive. It has a 'soul', which was once trapped inside the body of a woman, and will often redirect itself to where it thinks it needs to be. It can blend in with its surroundings using a ‘chameleon circuit’. The Doctor's TARDIS outside Earl's court station is broken and stuck in its current form. It can, however, turn invisible. It also comes with handy tools. For instance, it can translate speech and writing for people travelling inside it, enabling them to understand any alien language even once they step outside. The TARDIS can translate speech and writing for people travelling inside it, enabling them to understand any alien language even once they step outside . Most TARDIS can use their chameleon circuit to change appearance. But, the Doctor- who was recently played by Matt Smith (pictured)- has a broken TARDIS which is stuck in the form of an old London police box . Unfortunately, Google only gives you a sneak peek of the inside the interior. You can see a maze of endless corridors, but the map doesn’t allow you to go down into the libraries, art galleries and swimming pools. A Google spokesperson said: 'Inspired by the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who, our engineers thought it would be a cool idea for users to find and tour the TARDIS from Street View level.' So far fans have left 375 reviews of the venue. ‘Really neat place.

For instance, typing ‘do a barrel roll’ into its search engine will see results spin around the screen. Others features in the past have included putting ninjas in its Reader and spam recipes in its Gmail spam folders. Last year, Greg Kumparak in California created his own DIY Tardis which was larger on the inside, thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality (AR). He created it over a few hours using wood, two bottles and some dark blue paint, before fixing a working red light on the top. 'Then my stupid brain went and thought 'Hey wouldn't it be cool if it had an interior,' Mr Kumparak wrote on his blog. But how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside? First he created a 3D computer model of the interior using a free-to-use open source computer software programme called Blender. The former Techcrunch mobile editor then used the Unity graphics rendering engine. Rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model stored in a scene file by using a computer program. This information describes the geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting and shading of the virtual scene. Finally he used an AR app platform by chip-maker Qualcomm called Vuforia, to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini Tardis.","Google is allowing anyone to take a look inside using its Street View map .

"It may look like an innocuous ballpoint, but despite being disguised to look like a Parker pen it is actually a deadly weapon employed by a North Korean spy in an assassination attempt last year. Like something straight out of a James Bond film, the pen actually contains a deadly poison which, if injected, leads to almost instant muscle paralysis which in turn leads to suffocation and death. The weapon, demonstrated to CNN reporters by South Korea's answer to Q, was one of three found on a would-be assassin in Seoul who was targeting Park Sang-hak, an anti North Korea activist. Deadly: These innocuous looking pens are actually weapons employed by a would-be North Korean assassin assigned to kill Park Sang-hak, a pro-democracy activist . Sneaky: The pen actually injects a toxin which causes muscle paralyses and death within minutes . Potent: A second 'pen' weapon fires a poison-filled bullet which can pierce the skin . As well as the poison pen, Korean authorities also found a second weapon disguised as a Parker pen - but this time with a couple of clicks it fires a poison-filled bullet which can pierce the skin. The third is a flashlight, loaded with up to three bullets which, when demonstrated by forensics experts on camera, demonstrated extraordinary accuracy and effectiveness. Although the unnamed South Korean intelligence officer filmed says that the pen weapons are nothing new - Korean authorities have been using them for at least a decade, he says - the flashlight is completely new. And, far from matching the unmistakable intent of carrying a pistol, the trio of weapons are practically undetectable. New: A South Korean intelligence officer, whose identity was hidden by CNN, said that he had never seen a weapon such as this, disguised as an innocuous torch . Subterfuge: Instead of shining a light when switched on, the torch fires a bullet at its target . Testing: Forensics experts demonstrated what damage the torch weapon could potentially inflict . On target: The torch weapon was shown to be alarmingly accurate and deadly . The would-be assassin was arrested while allegedly on his way to kill Sang-hak, a former propaganda unit worker for the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth league until 1999 when his father, a government spy, urged his family to defect to South Korea. Fighting for democracy in his homeland ever since, Sang-hak is chairman of Fighters for a Free north Korea, an organisation behind the release of two million balloons containing human rights and pro-democracy propaganda into North Korea. He was understandably shocked when shown the weapons which were almost used to try and kill him. He told CNN: 'You'd notice a gun, but these weapons are so innocuous, you can easily kill someone, I'd be dead immediately. 'I didn't believe they'd try and kill me on the crowded streets of Seoul, I thought the National Intelligence Service was over-reacting.' Now given round-the-clock police protection, Sang-hak says that he is undeterred in his fight for democracy despite the subterfuge tactics employed by those said to be out to get him. His would-be killer, named simply as Ahn, was sentenced to four years in jail earlier this year. Frisked: The weapons were found on a would-be North Korean assassin who was targeting high profile pro-democracy campaigner Park Sang-hak .

"Support: Daventry MP Chris Heaton-Harris has said he will help Ian Taylor to get the signs changed . A Tory MP has agreed to help in a father's campaign to rebrand 'mother and child' parking spaces to be gender neutral. Ian Taylor, 53, is struggling with his local council in Daventry, Northamptonshire, and the operators of a car park near his home to have the signs changed and achieve 'sexual equality'. And Chris Heaton-Harris is now said to be investigating whether the signs, which show the outline of a woman holding hands with a child, could breach laws on sex discrimination. Mr Taylor, who has two children, said: 'When I first noticed the signs had gone up I wrote to the district . council thinking they were responsible. 'It turned out they weren’t, but they said they couldn’t see a problem with what the signs say. 'I . then wrote to [car park owners] Colliers International . three times asking if they could do something about the signs, but I . have never heard a response. 'Because of this lack of action I’ve now written to newspapers, the MP, and other interested parties. 'I’ve already had a message back from Chris Heaton-Harris MP saying he’ll look into the matter. Objector: Father of two Ian Taylor, 53, stands next to one of the signs he objects to . 'We’re . supposed to have sexual equality in this country, and that goes both . ways. This is an objective problem - there’s no debate really. 'Everywhere else you see signs that say ‘parent and child’ why can’t they just put them up here?' Mr Heaton-Harris today told MailOnline that the objections were 'a fair point', and that he would raise the issue with the leader of chief executive of Daventry District Council on Mr Taylor's behalf. He said: 'Is it as important as unemployment or world peace? Probably not. But it is a fair point.' A spokesman for Colliers International last night said the firm did not own the site, but managed it on behalf of a client. A spokesman said: ‘We have been in contact with Mr Taylor several times over the last few weeks and are liaising with both the client and the local council to get these signs changed.’","Chris Heaton-Harris has said that he will help father of two Ian Taylor, 53 .

"The parents of a 19-year-old who died in California after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana are determined that his death won't be in vain. Devin and Veronica Eckhardt never imagined they would be watching a helicopter bearing their only son's heart fly away from the Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. But on Thursday July 17 they honored Connor Eckhardt's wishes to donate his organs following his death after smoking a synthetic marijuana known as 'spice' the previous Saturday. Now, the family is sharing photographs of . Connor's life and death, in the hope that their son's tragic passing . will serve as a warning to others about the dangers of synthetic . marijuana. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken family: The Eckhardts standing around the hospital bed where brain-dead Connor Eckhardt lay before his organs were donated . Happier times: Veronica, Connor, Ashnika, Devin and Sabrina Eckhardt before Connor's life was cut short after taking one hit of synthetic marijuana . 'He gave into (peer pressure) — thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe — and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor’s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA. Also known as K2, spice is a mixture of herbs that's sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. The herbs and chemicals in spice vary, making it impossible for users to know what they're smoking and in what concentrations. 'These substances are not benign,' Dr Andrew Monte, the lead author of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, told the ststion. 'People may not realize how dangerous these drugs can be – up to 1,000 times stronger binding to cannabis receptors when compared to traditional marijuana.' Incredibly, it's readily available in shops and online, even though the sale of it is illegal in California. Synthetic marijuana has been labeled incense, potpourri and herbal smoking blend — and it's been sold using names such as K2 and Spice. Connor Eckhardt fell asleep after taking a hit of spice. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. Bereft: Connor's mother hugs the lifeless body of her only son . Precious moments: The Eckhardts spent four days with their son before he was taken in to surgery to remove his organs for donation . Doctors were unable to detect spice in COnnor's system because there's no way to trace its everchanging components, but the package of the drug was still in his pocket, and no other drugs were found in his system. Connor's decision to become an organ donor gave his family four more precious days with him as doctors found recipients and prepared for the tranfer of Connor's heart and other vital organs. Veronica, Devin and Connor's sisters Sabrina and five-year-old Ashnika gathered by his bedside and memorized the lines of his face, touched his hair and kissed his forehead. 'I just keep thinking he's going to open his eyes and go, ""What's up, guys?""' Veronica Eckhardt said, reported the Los Angeles Times. Veronica painted the soles of his feet and made a print, just as she had when she and Devin adopted a tiny Connor as a baby. Sabrina Eckhardt is just a year and a half younger than her brother and she, like the other two Eckhardt children, was adopted. California boy: Connor loved surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and motocross . Close: The teenager was devoted to his two sisters, Sabrina (center), 17, and five-year-old Ashnika . Meaning from loss: The family is determined that Connor's death will not be in vain and are spreading his story to warn others . She and Connor were extremely close and she is struggling to come to terms with her brother's loss. The Eckhardts used their last precious minutes with Connor, a California boy whose bronzed skin was a testament to his love of surfing and skateboarding, to do something incredibly brave. They filmed a short video by Connor's comatose side, about the dangers of synthetic marijuana. 'This is our son, Connor Reid Eckhardt,' Veronica said, her voice raw with emotion. 'He made the deadly choice to use a product called K2, or spice, and Connor is completely brain-dead... This is not a game, it is totally real, please help us fight his fight.' They have created a Facebook page as both a memorial to Connor and a warning to others about the perils of synthetic marijuana. 'Connor Eckhardt died after taking ONE HIT of synthetic marijuana (SPICE, K2, POTpourri). This dangerous substance is legal. Help us save lives by sharing,' reads the page's description.

"Roberto Firmino announced himself on the international scene earlier in the week as his 25-yard strike earned Brazil a 2-1 victory over Austria. His first goal for his country was quite a hit, and as well as making an impact for Brazil he has established himself as one of the stars of the Bundesliga. But how much do you know about one-time Liverpool target Firmino? Here, Sportsmail tells you some more… . Brazil substitute Roberto Firmino celebrates after scoring the winner for his country late on in the game . Firmino (centre) and Neymar celebrate after the former put Brazil 2-1 up against Austria in Vienna . Where does he come from? The 23-year-old was born in Maceio, the capital of coastal state Algagoas. Firmino grew up supporting Corinthians and idolising former Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldinho. The attacking midfielder started playing football at his local academy, Clube de Regatas Brasil, before he moved to Tombenese in 2008 as an 18-year-old. How did his career develop? He was loaned to second-tier Figueirense in 2010 and it was here he made his name, scoring seven goals and earning himself the player of the season award in his first campaign as a full professional. This caught the eye of many European clubs, including (reportedly) Liverpool. However it was German side Hoffenheim who acted the fastest, signing Firmino for £3.5million in January 2011 after he originally joined in December 2010. Firmino grew up as a supporter of Brazilian side Corinthians and idolised national superstar Ronaldinho . Born: 2 October 1991, Maceio, Brazil . Age: 23 . Hero: Ronaldinho . Clubs: . (2009-10) Figueirense - 38 apps, 8 goals . (2011-) 1899 Hoffenheim - 118 apps, 34 goals . Honours: ESPN Brazil's Young Brazilian Overseas Player of the Year 2014 . How did he find it in Germany? He struggled in his first year at Hoffenheim. He was dropped in November 2011 for turning up late for training. However after re-gaining his place he went on to score seven goals in 26 appearances. Firmino is now regarded as a fans’ favourite, making 127 appearances and scoring 42 times. Last season he hit 22 goals in all competitions. But, more impressively, finished fourth top scorer in the Bundesliga and second in the assist standings. Did they take any notice back at home? After what many regard as a breakthrough season in 2013-14, Brazilian journalists began to call for Firmino’s inclusion in the international set up. They voted him Young Brazilian Overseas Player of the Year on ESPN Brazil, as he beat the likes of Chelsea’s Oscar and PSG’s Lucas Moura to the award. After another impressive start to the season, scoring five goals in 11 games, he was included in the national squad for international friendlies against Turkey and Austria. Having made his debut against Turkey, he then scored that goal against the Austrians. Firmino beat Oscar (far left) and Lucas Moura (right) to become Young Brazilian Overseas Player of the Year . How far can he go? The Bundesliga is one of the strongest leagues in world football and at 23 the playmaker is already recognised as one of the biggest talents the German game has to offer. The sad reality for Hoffenheim fans is the sense of inevitability surrounding the future of Firmino – a goalscoring midfielder who prefers the No 10 role - as one would assume his performances are not going unnoticed by the giants of European football. Firmino is a more traditional, skilful Brazilian attacking midfielder who likes to shoot from range (as shown by his first international goal) and if he is able to maintain his current form there is no doubt he will go on to become a regular for his country.","Brazilian youngster scored a 25-yard goal against Austria on Tuesday .

"A towering dust devil reaching half a mile in height has been pictured swirling across the surface of Mars by Nasa. The Agency’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured the image with its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on February 16 this year as it passed over the Amazonis Planitia region of the planet. Despite the atmosphere on Mars being desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – the planet's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic events and in the area observed, paths of many previous whirlwinds, or dust devils, are visible as streaks on the dusty surface. Pluming hell: The towering dust devil snakes across the Martian surface . Air we go: Despite a thin atmosphere, Mars still generates powerful winds . The active dust devil displays a delicate arc produced by a westerly breeze partway up its height. The dust plume is about 30 metres (100ft) in diameter. The image was taken during the time of Martian year when that planet is farthest from the sun. Just as on Earth, winds on Mars are powered by solar heating. Exposure to the sun's rays declines during this season, yet even now, dust devils act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust, a little at a time. Dust devils occur on Earth as well as on Mars. They are spinning columns of air, made visible by the dust they pull off the ground. Unlike a tornado, a dust devil typically forms on a clear day when the ground is heated by the sun, warming the air just above the ground. As heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler air above it, the air may begin to rotate, if conditions are just right. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been examining Mars with six science instruments since 2006 and has has returned more data about Mars than all other orbital and surface missions combined. One of its cameras is so powerful they can reveal objects on Mars as small as an office desk. It has taken over 20,000 photographs of the Red Planet so far. The Orbiter makes a complete circuit of Mars every 112 minutes, flying a nearly circular orbit that ranges in height from about 255 kilometres (160 miles) over the South Pole to 320 kilometres (200 miles) over the North Pole. For handling large amounts of data, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has 160 gigabits of solid-state memory and a processor operating at up to 46 million instructions per second.

"A grandmother was left astonished after a photo posted on Facebook from her granddaughter’s christening appeared to show the ghost of her late husband. When Heather Sewell, 50, first saw the picture she immediately spotted the apparition, bearing a striking resemblance to her late husband Terry. The black and white face can be seen above the church font hovering over baby Mia-Bella Kennett and the rest of the family. Familiar face: The photograph taken at St.Martin's Church in Canterbury was posted on Facebook. Only later did grandmother Heather Sewell notice the face, circled, bearing a striking resemblance to her late husband Terry . The bizarre image was caught on camera at St Martin’s Church, Canterbury, Kent by Mrs Sewell's son Jamie, 29, on his mobile phone. It was only when the grandmother-of-two was looking through the photos online later that she spotted the familiar face beside the family. Outline: Mrs Sewell said she was shocked when she noticed the face in the picture taken during her granddaughter's christening . Mrs Sewell, from Petham, Kent, said she could not believe the likeness to her late husband. Terry Sewell, who worked as a labourer, died 17 years ago after committing suicide aged 41. Mrs Sewell, who works as a taxi driver, said it was 'upsetting' to see her husband's face. She said: ' I tried to convince myself . that it was not Terry - but it is so convincing that I believe it is. 'Terry had a long face and so does the ghost and it has the same hair style as Terry had. 'The ghost is also the same height as Terry was - about 5ft 8in. 'I am quite a superstitious person, but I am not over-the-top. 'I do believe there is something out there - there are too many things in the world we cannot explain.' She added: 'I was so shocked when I saw it, as we all were. 'It looks very much like Terry. I know there has been no photo trickery so it is all very spooky and perhaps not what you want to see at a christening. 'I was in the pub afterwards when I first saw the Facebook page and everyone was stunned because it’s so clear.' St Martin’s is the oldest church in the country that is still in use for religious services, but a ghostly encounter has never been reported previously at the church. Heather's daughter Gemma Sewell, 27, and her partner Jamie were joined by their older daughter Jaiden, 5, and two sets of godparents for Mia-Bella Kennett's Christening.","Heather Sewell noticed familiar face hovering over family in photo .

"It's a familiar struggle most new mothers will be able to identify with - trying to get work done with a toddler in tow. Whether it is simple tasks such as doing the washing or loading the dishwasher, everything seems to take longer with a little one running around. Blogger Esther Anderson has highlighted 'Why Moms Get Nothing Done' in her latest video, filmed with her daughter Ellia, who takes delight in stopping her from doing her chores. Blogger Esther Anderson, pictured left, has highlighted 'Why Mums Get Nothing Done' in her latest video, filmed with her daughter Ellia, right, who takes delight in stopping her from doing her chores . The video shows Ellia pulling clothes out of the drawers faster than her mother can put them away . The little girl then climbs into the drawer so she can reach the others to empty them . The amusing video, which has had more than 50 million views on Facebook, takes in a typical day at Esther's home in Florida, which she shares with husband Thad. The footage shows Esther attempting to fold away Ellia's clothes and put them away in drawers in her room – only for the little girl to pull out the clothes faster than her mother can put them away. She then sabotages Esther's attempts to sweep the kitchen floor by spreading the dirt around again before her mother has a change to sweep it up in a dustpan. Sweeping the floor isn't a simple task for Esther as the video filmed in the Texas home shows . Ellia spreads the dirt around the floor again before her mother can sweep it up . The little girl also rolls in the dirt for good measure in the video that has had 50 million views on Facebook . Then when Esther attempts to pack the dishwasher, Ellia throws dirty, plastic plates out of the bottom shelf while her mother tries to load the top shelf - the same thing happens when Esther tries to tidy up her daughter's toys as their bemused dog looks on. And it's a similar story when she tries to load the washing machine as Ellia pulls the dirty clothes out before her mother can put them all in. A shot of Ellia rolling around in the garden in the mud and then covered in food when she eats reveals why Esther spends a lot of her day washing her daughter and changing her clothes. The final scene shows Esther despairing of cleaning the windows as her toddler smears her dirty fingers and mouth over one side of the glass while her mother attempts to clean the other. The little girl empties the washing machine before her mother can fill it up . She also pushes the door closed before it's full to further hinder her mother's attempts to do the housework . Filling the dishwater is no simple task either as Ellia find it fun to through the plastic plates out . Esther said the many shares her video has had shows it's not just her who has trouble getting anything done thanks to having a toddler around as Ellia is here pictured closing the dishwasher before Esther has filled it . Esther uploaded the video onto her personal website storyofthislife.com that charts her experiences and observations of motherhood. One of her other videos reveals why co-sleeping means no sleeping for the mother and another asks viewers ;which type of mom are you?' showing how some mothers are obsessed with disinfecting their child's every move and not allowing them to touch something until it has been thoroughly cleaned first. Esther is pictured wasting her time tidying up toys as Ellia just empties more on to the rug . The toddler doesn't stay clean for long thanks playing in the garden, left, and eating yoghurt, right . No wonder Esther spends so much of the day washing her daughter and changing her clothes . Many parents have agreed that Esther's video is an accurate reflection of motherhood . But Esther's video of her daily trials  getting 'nothing done' has been by far her most popular post. She said: 'Fifty million views (on Facebook) in under 24 hours shows me that it's not just me that has this problem.' Mothers rushed to share the video and agreed it was an accurate reflection of their own lives. Commenting on the video's upload on YouTube, 'The Hippy Homemaker16' said: 'I think that every mom on the planet can relate to this,' while Ashley Carter said: 'This is exactly my life. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one!' At the end of the video, Ester, who lives with husband Thad, despairs of cleaning the windows . Ellia finds it more fun to smear her fingers and face on the windows while her mother attempts to clean .","Blogger Esther Anderson filmed her attempts to get chores done with Ellia .

"Medical tourist: More Brits are going abroad for cosmetic surgery . Forget jetting away to find sun and tropical beaches, millions of Brits are now using their holidays as an opportunity to undergo cosmetic surgery. Demand for 'cosmetic surgery tourism' has risen as the number of people travelling overseas for treatments has more than doubled in the past two years, according to new research by private healthcare search engine WhatClinic.com. The ability to get cheaper treatments is the main reason more people are opting to have dentures, boob jobs and bottom lifts abroad. But it's not just cosmetics treatments which are proving popular with tourists, more Brits are also travelling over seas for fertility treatment. Even with the cost of flights and hotels, the total spend adds up to less than the bill for private surgery in the UK. The research has revealed which destinations are the most popular for various procedures. For example, Thailand has proven a hotspot for dentures, with demand soaring by 320 per cent in the past year. On average a full set of dentures costs £184 in Bangkok, which is £256 cheaper than in the UK. Hungary is also quickly becoming a renowned hot spot for cosmetic dentistry and a preferred choice for those who don't fancy flying to the other side of the world in search of the perfect smile. The country has seen a 172 per cent . increase in demand for dental implants, while lingual braces are up by . almost a fifth in the past year alone. Dental implants in the UK will . set you back £1,928 but in Hungary the same procedure costs a quarter . of the price (£500). Eastern Europe boasts the largest number of hubs for cosmetic tourism, as short flights and cheap fares with budget airlines prove popular with patients. The Czech Republic has seen a 304 per cent increase in interest for nose jobs in the past year, with an average procedure costing £847, versus £3,557 in the UK. The operation, which separates the nasal skin and soft tissue from the nasal framework, allows the nose to be reshaped. Never mind the beach, get me to the dentist! Thailand is the top destination for dentures . Meanwhile, those looking for breast implants are heading to Poland. Enquiries there have risen by 57 per cent . in the past year. With flights taking just over two hours and costing . as little as £42 return from London to Warsaw, patients can look to . still make considerable savings by paying £1,972 in Poland for the . operation, instead of £3,736 in Britain. Huge costs attached to IVF and NHS waiting lists . have also led to serious growth in fertility hubs around Europe. In the . Czech Republic, one treatment will cost £791 but in the UK it costs . £2,420. Greece offers egg donation and . pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at a considerable saving . compared to the UK - patients can save between £700 and £900 per . treatment. Caelen King, CEO of WhatClinic.com, comments: 'The biggest draw of medical and cosmetic tourism is price - as Brits going abroad can look to make considerable savings even after the travel costs. You may even be able to tie it in with a holiday for less than the cost of the procedure in the UK. 'But with any procedure, wherever it's done, make sure you do your research and shop around. Speak to a number of specialists until you find one that you are comfortable with. If you do decide to go overseas, be realistic about recovery time and getting home. 'There are fantastic cosmetic surgeons all over the world but some countries are less regulated, so standards can vary dramatically depending on where you go. Ask about aftercare and what happens if something does go wrong, as it may be more difficult to fix without needing a return trip.'","Increase in Brits travelling abroad for cosmetic surgery .

"Nazeem and Rashma Khan have crossed India in a desperate search to find their three-year-old daughter. Little Tyaba was with her parents at a family friend's wedding reception in Delhi when she disappeared. Since then, her devoted parents have searched adoption homes, red light districts and orphanages in all of India's major cities but hope is fading. Their loss is shared by thousands of families, whose children simply vanished. Seven-year-old Mansi poses with a photograph of her missing three-year-old sister Muskaan inside their house in New Delhi April 28, 2013. Hers is one of a collection of haunting photos taken by photographer Mansi Thapliyal, who wants to raise awareness of India's missing children . Pannalal, 33, a construction worker, holds a photograph of his missing eight-year-old daughter Bhuriya as his wife Sheela, 30, stands inside their house in New Delhi . Sheela, 30, holds a woollen cap belonging to her missing daughter Bhuriya, eight, who disappeared from a weekly market near the family home on May 11, 2010 . Their stories have formed a . project by photographer Mansi Thapliyal, who met families of missing . children to highlight the issue in the country. This year alone 725 children in Delhi . have been reported missing and are untraced, according to data from . India's Zonal Integrated Police Network website. Children's and women's rights have . been unprecedented focus in India in recent months, since a Delhi . student died in December after being gang-raped on a public bus. Her death sparked furious protests in . the country and cases of child abuse and child rape have since been . given greater attention. Yoga teacher Sarita Gupta, 51, holds a doll belonging to her missing daughter Ambika, 15, who went missing almost three years ago . Rekha, 30, sitting with son Shyam, shows a picture of her daughter Deepali, seven, who went missing from school in November, 2010 . Atika disappeared when she went to use a public toilet. Her parents Azhar, 51, and his wife Shabra, 45, have been left devastated . Shabra, 45, reads the school notebook of her daughter Atika, 10, who went missing while visiting a public toilet . In the latest shocking incident, a 20-year-old man has been arrested in Delhi on suspicion of raping a four-year-old girl. A neighbour found the girl, who was home alone, crying after the alleged attack. She was taken to hospital where she was described as being in a stable condition. It comes after a five-year-old girl died after being gang-raped in Madhya Pradesh. Reuters photo-journalist Thapliyal said the project was inspired by the crime and she wanted to investigate the affect such disappearances have on the families that are left behind. Aanchal Gupta, 21, stands in front of dolls belonging to her missing sister Ambika that still hang on the wall almost three years after she disappeared . Mehmun Khan, 30, says her daughter was abducted by a woman posing as a volunteer from a government welfare program. She holds up a dress she bought for the 10-year-old while sitting next to her son Imran (right) and daughter Nazia . Hema Devi, 35, holds a pair of school shoes belonging to her missing seven-year-old daughter Kajal, who disappeared while playing outside the family home in New Delhi . She said: 'Nothing . can surpass the agony and desperation that has become their lives. The . haunted looks on their faces speak of pain which is beyond all . comprehension. 'I’m not sure if my pictures will bring these missing . daughters back to their parents, but maybe they’ll make people stop and . think about the next time they see a girl begging on the side of the . street or a young maid working inside a home. 'It’s . time to stop being silent spectators and take steps in the right . direction or else who knows if the nightmare might come knocking on our . doors.' Among the seemingly endless list of . names of missing children are Atika, 10, who disappeared in August 2008 . after going to use a communal toilet close to her house. A poster of missing fifteen-year-old Ambika is pictured on a wall outside a police station in New Delhi. This year 725 children were reported missing in the city . Mamta, 32, poses with a dress belonging to her missing seven-year-old daughter Bharti inside her makeshift shelter in New Delhi . Chandravati's three-year-old daughter Muskaan, whose trousers she is holding, went missing while  playing near the family home . Her mother is still making a 'bistra' - a bedsheet given to Muslim brides on their wedding day - for her . daughter in the hope she will come home. Ambika, 15, has not been seen since October 10, 2010, when her mother awoke to find her daughter had vanished from her bed. NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan said about 65 per cent of children that go missing are girls, according to Thapliyal's research. Most of those are taken and forced into the sex trade or trafficked to work as domestic workers. Tyaba, three, disappeared from a family friend's wedding reception in October, 2009. A framed photograph of the child rests on a bed headboard at the family home . Tyaba's father Nazeem Khan (left) and mother Rashma (right) have searched across the country for their daughter, visiting adoption homes, red light districts and orphanages . Most families are too poor to search for their children themselves. They rely on the police, who have . been accused of corruption and heavily criticised in the recent rape . cases that have shocked India. Mamta's family, who earn just $4 a . day, are relying on NGOs to try to find their daughter Bharti, who . disappeared in April this year from near their home. The photographer said: 'For four . days, I met parents of girls who had gone missing. Every story was . different, every story was equally sad. ''I spent hours with them, listening . to their harrowing tales, understanding the grief and misery these . families were going through. Only then did I turn my camera on to take . pictures. 'Despite retelling their stories . again and again over many years to hundreds of people, the mothers I met . still cried their eyes out for their missing daughters when they spoke . to me.'

"Japanese scientists have unveiled a robot with a sense of humour, and claim it is even capable of knowing when its jokes have fallen flat. The pint-sized roller-skating Emiew2 - pronounced 'emu' - is able to have a short conversation with a human, without being given a script. The red and white robot picks key words from a sentence - for example, 'how many' - to try to work out what question it is being asked, then confirms the inquiry before firing back an answer. Scroll down for video . Hitachi have unveiled their humanoid robot EMIEW2, which they say is capable of telling jokes and understanding when they've had a poor reception. Here it is holding a conversation with an employee during a demonstration at the company's central laboratory in Tokyo on 20 May . Robots have been creeping into our homes, streets and cities - and soon they could be dominating our boardrooms. In a world first, Japanese venture capital firm Deep Knowledge recently named an artificial intelligence (AI) to its board of directors. The robot, named Vital, was chosen for its ability to pick up on market trends ‘not immediately obvious to humans’. Vital is an ‘equal member’ of the Hong Kong-based group and the first ever software program to be appointed as a board member. The robot was developed by Aging Analytics UK who have licensed it out to Deep Knowledge to help make business decisions on therapies for age-related diseases . At a demonstration in Tokyo, the 31-inch (80 cm) tall device answered a question on the number of people working at the Hitachi facility with the somewhat surreal: 'We have two swans.' When its interlocutor appeared puzzled, the robot let on that it had been joking. 'You got it? I'm kidding. We have about 800 people working here,' it 'drolly' revealed. Engineers at Hitachi have programmed the . android to understand a range of human responses, including non-verbal . signals like nods. It uses this comprehension to determine . if the person it is talking to (known as an interlocutor) has got the . 'joke' it has just told, said scientists. Hitachi's Hisashi Ikeda said while the robot's sense of humour may not be very refined at present, the ability to comprehend reactions was an important step forward. 'The new technology makes it possible for a robot to understand what a human means, even if they only gesture,' he said. Emiew2 - its name is an acronym for 'excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate' - is intended ultimately to provide company in some form, perhaps as a kind of house pet, or even as a receptionist, the company said. The Hitachi humanoid robot Emiew2 is 31 inches (80 centimetres) tall and weighs 14 kilograms (30 pounds). It moves on wheeled legs and is equipped with 14 microphones on its helmet that can pick out human voices from background noise .","A robot known as Emiew2 has been revealed by Japanese scientists .

"Politicians were yesterday  accused of squandering 350 years of British transport supremacy after Dubai overtook Heathrow as the world’s busiest airport. Dubai International Airport has carried more international passengers than Heathrow for three months in a row, according to the latest figures. The quarterly results from the airports reveal that Dubai is also well on course to overtake Heathrow’s passenger numbers  for the whole of this year – which would put an end to a 350-year period in which Britain has been home to either the world’s busiest port or airport. Second place: Heathrow (pictured) is no longer the world's NO1 airport after quarterly figures revealed Dubai hosted more passengers . The changing of the guard was seized upon by the bosses of Heathrow and British Airways, both of whom have been campaigning for a third runway at Europe’s busiest airport. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company IAG, blamed dithering politicians for allowing Heathrow to be knocked into second place. ‘We have squandered our No 1 world ranking through a total lack of political vision for Britain,’ he said. ‘This country has no aviation policy.’ Mr Walsh predicted in 2012 that Heathrow would be overtaken by Dubai, blaming political indecision. Surge: Statistics from both airports showed that Dubai (pictured) hosted 18million international passengers between December 2013 and February 2014, compared to 14.9million at Heathrow . Yesterday, the Irish boss, who has said he does not believe British politicians will ever agree on a third runway at Heathrow, warned that the delay was hurting the economy. ‘This isn’t just about aviation, this is about connecting the UK to the world. It will cost British jobs, growth and reputation.’ Heathrow’s drop into second place was revealed on the same day that the airport’s boss, Colin Matthews, announced his decision to retire. Criticism: Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, British Airways' parent company blamed 'dithering politicians' for the poor results . And Mr Matthews issued a parting shot at politicians for hampering Heathrow’s future, while competitors such as Frankfurt, Dubai and Paris have grown rapidly. ‘Heathrow can’t keep up with them,’ he said. ‘It is full, with no spare capacity. Unless we expand, Heathrow’s decline will make the whole of the UK a less attractive place to do business.’ A commission led by economist Sir Howard Davies has been considering options for expanding the UK’s airports since 2012, but is not due to come up with a final recommendation until 2015. London Mayor Boris Johnson favours a new £65billion hub in the Thames Estuary, while Gatwick has made its case to be allowed a second runway. Dubai has grown rapidly thanks to its position in the Middle East and the strength of the luxurious Emirates airline, which is based there. Statistics from both airports showed that Dubai hosted 18million international passengers between December 2013 and February 2014, compared to 14.9million at Heathrow. Mr Matthews’ retirement is understood to be unconnected to Heathrow losing top spot. The airport boss said he had ‘decided the time is right to pass on the baton’ after six years in the job. Mr Matthews pointed to his record in revamping Terminal 2, which is due to open in June, as well as improvements in customer satisfaction surveys after the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008. But he has also presided over crises such as the chaos caused by snow in 2010, when flights were grounded for days.

"Premiership Rugby made a robust case for its salary cap on Friday after Saracens claimed that seven Aviva Premiership clubs have indicated they want the existing system scrapped. Saracens say the the matter will be discussed at a Premiership Rugby shareholders meeting on February 4. In a press release issued by the club, Saracens said they are 'creating a consensus among Premiership clubs to remove the salary cap, releasing the 'handbrake' on English club rugby.' Dan Carter, who has just agreed to sign for Racing Metro, chose France over the Aviva Premiership . Premiership Rugby introduced a salary cap in 1999. It is currently £5million per club, and will rise by £500,000 for next season, when clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee 'excluded players'. That decision was a unanimous one made by Premiership Rugby shareholders earlier this year. The Premiership's umbrella organisation described the salary cap as 'a progressive system whereby the maximum spend is linked to revenue increases from TV and other centralised commercial rights.' In a statement, Premiership Rugby said: 'The salary cap ensures the financial viability of the member clubs and underpins the sustainable growth of the competition for all stakeholders. 'In addition, the salary cap provides a level playing field for all clubs, ensures a competitive Aviva Premiership rugby competition; promotes home-grown players and supports the performance of the England team, and allows the recruitment of elite players from other countries through the Excluded Players provision. Dan Carter will become rugby's highest-paid player in the world when he joins Racing Metro . 'Premiership Rugby keeps the salary cap under constant review and consults with its shareholder clubs to ensure that its regulations remain the most appropriate and proportionate means of achieving its objectives.' Comments made by Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths on Friday come ahead of next year's World Cup in England, after which many of the world's top players are expected to base themselves in Europe on lucrative club deals. New Zealand star Dan Carter has already agreed a £1.3million per year contract with wealthy French club Racing Metro, while Australia back Adam Ashley-Cooper is to join Bordeaux-Begles. Any changes to the Premiership salary cap would require a 75 per cent majority of shareholders. All Blacks centre Ma'a Nonu is also reportedly fielding overseas offers from a number of different clubs . 'The salary cap has served its purpose,' Griffiths said. 'It's time to seize a golden opportunity to grow the game, to ensure a level playing field in Europe, to build the strongest league in world rugby and to let players earn market-related salaries. 'The combination of England hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2015 and sevens featuring in the 2016 Olympic Games creates a historic, but fleeting, platform for rugby union to grow dramatically. We must release the handbrake and step on the accelerator. 'The clubs need to encourage investment, to provide the spectacle and quality deserved by our broadcast partner, BT Sport, and title sponsor, Aviva. England hooker Dylan Hartley revealed this week that he had turned down a big-money move to France . 'It would be a pity if the world's top players light up the World Cup on English soil, and then leave to play club rugby in France. If the salary cap is left to forbid the required investment, it will kill any hope of growth.' Griffiths said he understood the concerns of some clubs regarding wage inflation if the salary cap was removed. 'English clubs must compete in the European Champions Cup against Irish and French clubs spending two or three times as much on players,' he added. 'Imagine the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City being asked to compete with Barcelona, FC Bayern and Real Madrid under those circumstances. It would never happen, but it happens in rugby. 'Strong legal opinion suggests the salary cap, as applied, breaches European competition laws. 'We understand some clubs fear the removal of the salary cap will cause wage inflation, yet, in reality, salaries are already being driven by the French clubs. We can either sit back and become a second-rate 'lowest common denominator' league, or we can leap forward. 'Lastly, we must be fair to England international players, who are encouraged to play club rugby in England to be eligible for the national team. 'Their salaries should be determined by the free market, nothing less. It is simply unfair, inequitable and possibly illegal for their pay to be restrained by the artificial mechanism of an outdated salary cap. Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths said the cap had to go for English teams to compete in Europe . 'Time moves on. Situations change. The game needs to evolve. In the interests of English rugby, in the interests of building the best league in the world, in the interests of the sponsors and broadcasters, in the interests of the players... it is time to #scrapthecap.' Harlequins chief executive David Ellis described Friday's developments as 'somewhat surprising.' Elllis said: 'The comments regarding an abolition of the salary cap were somewhat surprising given we have recently had discussions on this very topic as a league. 'The fundamentals of this regulation were approved recently at a shareholder meeting, and so I can't understand why the issue is being raised again so quickly. 'If there is a genuine desire to have a fresh discussion on the salary cap, then we are more than happy to have a debate as a league, but in the right way, in the right forum. 'As a club, Harlequins fully supports the salary cap - it is one of the elements which makes ours one of the most competitive leagues in the world. 'Every game counts in the Aviva Premiership, and that has been more than evident this season. Most of the great leagues globally have salary caps or systems in place to monitor spending.'","Premiership's umbrella organisation hits back at Saracens claim .

The Northampton winger tips the scales at 16 stone and nine pounds but he can sprint 40 metres in 4.97 seconds. Wales winger George North is a freakish specimen and one of the new breed of monstrous outside backs . BREAKFAST: Toast, four eggs, curly kale, porridge . LUNCH: Chicken, rice, veg, yoghurt . afternoon snack Salmon, sweet potato, salad . DINNER: Cottage pie, mashed potato, veg, fruit salad . SNACKS: Peanut butter sandwich, nuts, fruit . GUILTY PLEASURES: Chewy sweets, gammon and chips, Indian takeaway . ALCOHOL? Allowed a drink, but won’t touch a drop during the Six Nations . That puts North up there with three of the world's fastest sports stars in the form of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (4.82 seconds), Springbok flyer Bryan Habana (4.77 seconds) and Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt (4.65 seconds). The British and Irish Lions winger, who famously carried Wallabies winger Israel Folau on his back during the second Test in Melbourne, can bench press 353lb (64 house bricks) and squat 496lb (equivalent to a large male gorilla). North has to eat a lot to maintain his size and stats in the gym. The former Scarlets flyer consumes almost 4,300 calories a day. That’s nearly twice the recommended daily intake for a man (2,500). He could easily reach this with 8.8 Big Macs.","George North can run 40 metres in 4.97 seconds .

"Australian F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has topped the leaderboard as the fastest driver in Top Gear's 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' challenge. Dethroning Britain's Lewis Hamilton in the latest episode of the show, host Jeremy Clarkson said Ricciardo made the best time he's ever seen. 'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track,' Clarkson declared during the episode. VIDEO Scroll down to see Daniel Ricciardo in a drag race alongside a fighter jet .

Jeremy Clarkson (centre) said 'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track' Ricciardo's time has overtaken reigning F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton previous best set two years ago . Earlier in the week Ricciardo had already set his sights on toppling Hamilton and his attempt at the famous Dunsfold Aerodrome site in Surrey was screened on February 8. Hamilton's time took some beating as he is the fastest of all the F1 drivers to have raced on the makeshift circuit. He is ahead of the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and Rubens Barrichello. The 30-year-old Mercedes driver, who clinched his second Formula One world title last year, set his time two years ago in a Suzuki Liana - a car reserved for the F1 stars. Ahead of his crack at Hamilton's time, 25-year-old Ricciardo said: 'It's been a while since I heard people asking ""When are you going to go on Top Gear?"", so the time has come.' The Red Bull driver, who won three grands prix last season, added: 'I hope it's cold so the engine is crisp, but I also hope it's dry so I can actually have a good crack. 'We'll see how we go. I believe Lewis has the crown at the moment, so it would be nice to take at least one title off him.'

"Protesters filmed themselves blocking a London road with dozens of parked cars as they called for Israel to relinquish its grip on Gaza amid concerns the community is becoming 'radicalised' Drivers parked their cars, honked their horns and shouted 'free free Palestine', bringing the major commuter route in east London to a standstill. Local councillors claim the footage is the latest cause for concern that the community is becoming 'radicalised' and 'one-sided'. Scroll down for video . Blocked: Dozens of drivers parked their cars and honked their cars in Blackwall tunnel shouting 'free Palestine' Protest: Other cars were branded with Palestinian flags and the word 'Gaza' as traffic came to a standstill . The demonstration took place on July 20 in the Blackwall tunnel which connects Greenwich in south London with Tower Hamlets, an east London borough with a large Muslim population, police confirmed. The footage of parked cars covered in . Palestinian flags and the word 'Gaza' emerged on YouTube early this week . and has been shared on Facebook more than 6,000 times. It is unclear how long the tunnel remained blocked during the incident. It came just days before Tower Hamlets's Muslim mayor sparked outrage by raising the Palestinian flag outside the town hall. Condemning the protest, Conservative Tower Hamlets councillor Andrew Wood told MailOnline: 'My main concern is that the community is being radicalised by all this. 'It is obviously very concerning. It's something I'm worried about. There are issues in other parts of the world like Ukraine and Nigeria - and there are issues in Tower Hamlets. 'But there is a danger in Tower Hamlets that we are focussing our attentions on one part of the world. Mayor Lutfur Rahman put a Palestine flag outside the town hall. Obviously that was a very strong message. It is not a balanced conflict, we shouldn't be taking sides. Blocked: The protest, blocking the tunnel between east London's Tower Hamlets and Greenwich in south London, came days before Tower Hamlets's mayor hung the Palestinian flag outside the town hall . 'Concern': Local councillors said the footage was the latest cause for concern the area is being 'radicalised' 'Last night at our council meeting, we spent 45 minutes speaking about Gaza which meant we ran out of time to talk about GP surgery closures. 'We need to ensure we maintain a balanced view.' His words came hours after Mayor Lutfur Rahman flew the Palestinian flag outside the town hall in Tower Hamlets. Barely 24 hours after it emerged Mr Rahman is to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud, he ordered the flag to fly ‘in support of a ceasefire and peace’. Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts. In a statement Mr Rahman said: 'We are flying the Palestinian flag over the town hall as a humanitarian gesture of our solidarity with the people of Gaza. 'In addition to the current military onslaught, the blockade of Gaza is causing a humanitarian catastrophe. Over 1,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. An urgent aid corridor needs to be opened to allow those injured to receive treatment and medical care. 'We mourn the loss of life in this tragic conflict. We call on our Prime Minister to help create a lasting peace that breaks the cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and prevents any further loss of innocent lives.' An estimated 1,300 Palestinians and 59 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after a surge in rocket fire from the territory. Hamas, which controls Gaza, has said it will not stop fighting until a blockade on the area, maintained by both Israel and Egypt, is lifted. Outrage: Tower Hamlets's Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman (right) sparked outrage this week by raising the Palestinian flag outside the town hall (left) 'in solidarity with Gaza' Anger: Residents blasted Mr Rahman for focusing on Gaza rather than concerns in the east London borough . Support: The act garnered support from a number of people in the area which has a large Muslim community . Already this month there have been angry rows about Preston Town Council and Bradford Council flying the Palestinian flag. David Israel of the Leeds Jewish community said the Preston council was wrong to take sides in the conflict. innocent Israeli civilians have suffered through war and conflict,' he told the BBC. 'If you're going to put up one flag you need to put up the other flag to show support for innocent civilians on both sides on the conflict.' Earlier David Cameron announced an extra £3 million aid for Gaza as he repeated his call for an unconditional ceasefire to stop the conflict. Britain has already given £7 million in aid. Speaking during a Q&A session with workers in Warrington, Mr Cameron said the £3 million would ‘help make sure the people in Gaza have the basic necessities of life, the food, the shelter and the assistance that they need’.","Drivers parked cars and honked horns shouting 'Free free Palestine'

"While Sam Warburton was watching his beloved Tottenham take on Arsenal at White Hart Lane, Rhys Webb was tearing through the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes on his quad bike. The morning after last week’s defeat by England was, according to the Wales scrum half, not the time to lock oneself away in the house. Webb admitted that he faced questions about the result from passers-by and the 26-year-old is determined to provide answers with a backs-to-the-wall performance against Scotland on Sunday afternoon. Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb scored their a try in their Six Nations opening match at home to England . ‘Everyone is entitled to their opinion,’ said Webb. ‘But I don’t take too much notice. The Welsh public probably think we are no good any more, but there you are. We’ll be back.’ The dunes just outside Bridgend have a history with downbeat Welsh rugby players. Adam Jones carried out lone fitness training on ‘The Big Dipper’ - the highest dune in Europe - when he was without a club last summer, while JPR Williams and Steve Ovett also used to run along the sands in a previous era. ‘I took my quad bike and did a few doughnuts,’ said Webb. ‘I went out and about and I watched my local team play.' 'At the end of the day it is a game; it is a game of rugby. We’ve lost and obviously we’re bitterly disappointed with that, but personally I didn’t want to keep myself in the house, I wanted to get out. You take it on the chin.’ If previous results provide any indication, Wales should reverse their fortunes at Murrayfield on Sunday. Webb (front) was ultimately on the losing team though as England rallied from behind to win 21-16 . They have won their last seven meetings with Scotland, including a 51-3 thrashing at the Millennium Stadium last year. The Scots, however, are revitalised under new coach Vern Cotter. There were reasons for optimism after their attacking performance against France last week, while Wales courted criticism for their showing against England. Warren Gatland’s players failed to involve their strike runners and the Kiwi will be demanding more initiative on Sunday. ‘Some of the boys were probably a bit lazy at the weekend; not getting up off the floor quick enough and areas like that,’ said Webb. ‘We had six or seven guys - forwards - on the deck and international rugby is all about numbers on your feet; trying to create something. I just felt as a nine, and Dan Biggar was the same, that we didn’t have anything to work with. Webb (centre left) believes he and his team-mates will be back following their setback . 'Every time we got the ball we seemed to be trying to get out of danger. This week is about not being afraid to shift it and have a go. Focus has been about getting the boys up off the floor and working hard.’ Wales were nullified up front and struggled to provide a platform to attack from the set-piece against the English. Scotland do not offer the same levels of power in the scrum, however they will look to target Warren Gatland’s side at the line-out. Wales training has been at full-throttle at the Vale of Glamorgan and the breakdown is another area to improve. ‘England had a big pack and we didn’t deal with the threats coming over the ball,’ said Webb. ‘There was one passage of play where George Ford, who was probably the smallest guy on the pitch, disrupted our ruck when we had a big dent in the phase. Webb (centre) is hoping Wales put in a better display when they travel to Scotland in Sunday's match . 'He had no licence to slow that down. He should have been cleaned out. It’s about forwards scanning to see whether they need to go to these rucks or whether they can get on their bike and be a threat out wide.’ With the World Cup looming, the Welsh game plan will come under more scrutiny if it fails to fire this afternoon. But Gatland’s group have a tendency to perform when the chips are down, and Webb is hoping to be stopped for the right reasons on his next trip to Merthyr Mawr. ‘Everybody is against us having lost to England,’ said Webb. ‘We want to do well not just for ourselves and our families, but for the nation as well. We need to repay our fans this week.’","Wales travel to Scotland in the Six Nations on Sunday afternoon .

"A woman who was attracted to her father has revealed how they had oral sex after she discovered he also had incestuous feelings for her. Natasha Rose Chenier, 27, from Vancouver, Canada, has shared her shocking story with Jezebel. She relates how she discovered her biological father 'wanted to have sex with me from the first moment he laid eyes on me' after they met for the first time when she was 19. Natasha felt full of 'self hate and disgust' after acting on sexual feelings she had for her father (file photo) Eventually they succumbed to their feelings as Natasha recalls: 'We had oral sex a few times, almost always preceded by my descending into a whirlwind of self-hate and disgust and dry heaving over the toilet in the bathroom attached to his room.' The sexual encounters came after Natasha had established contact with her her father two years before when she was 19. He lived in Jamaica and she had been to visit him there a few times and spoke with him on the phone between visits. Natasha's mother had a casual relationship with her father when she was also 19 but he made a 'quick exit' when she became pregnant - so Natasha had not known, or had any contact with him, when she was growing up. She explains how she tracked him down as a teenager and arranged to meet him at a time when she was 'lonely and angry at my mother'. Describing meeting her father for the first time, she said he 'dazzled her', treating her to expensive meals. She then reveals how they would keep in touch by phone between visits and had lots in common. 'When I first met him in person I noticed that we even had the same posture, the same way of carrying ourselves in the world. I was intoxicated by our likeness, which I never shared with my mother, or with any siblings (I am an only child),' she explains. She writes how she then started to be sexually attracted to him - and even started sleeping in his bed. She writes: 'As well as shocked and horrified to realise it - I spoke of it to no one, least of all him. I hoped I would go home and the feeling would go away. But it didn't. Instead, it grew.' Incest can occur when relatives meet as adults because 'people tend to select mates that are like themselves physically and mentally' (file photo) It was during her final visit to see him in 2009 when she was 21 that she 'discovered our sexual attraction to be mutual' and her father admitted to her that he had wanted to have sex with her 'from the first moment I saw you.' Natasha writes: 'I imagine that, unless you have experienced genetic sexual attraction yourself, this is going to sound entirely unbelievable. But trust me: it is as real and intense as anything. The sexual feelings I had for my father felt like a dark spell that had been cast over me. 'I was not only a victim of my father's two-year seduction; I also felt a victim of my own sexual feelings. I felt ashamed of myself, and I had no one to talk to about it. I wasn't equipped to understand or handle my feelings.' After having oral sex on a number of occasions, Natasha said she then shut herself in a bedroom away from her father on her final night in Jamaica and he drove her to the airport the next day in silence. She hasn't returned to see him and six years on, she's still trying to make sense of what happened between them. She has had therapy and is writing an 'autofictional' novel about her experience. There were 830 offences of incest or familial sexual offences detected in England and Wales in 2011/12 according to Home Office statistics . She learnt that genetic sexual attraction can often occur between relatives who did not know one another when growing up. This has led her to believe 'genetic sexual attraction is normal, and very real.' But thanks to her therapy, she has accepted it wasn't her fault and is experiencing less self-loathing over what happened. Leading behavioural hypnotherapist and regressionist Nicolas Aujula says he has treated numerous people after they have had incestuous relationships, as he has sourced case studies to appear in his 'Taboo Hunters' documentary. He said: 'The most common form of incest is between siblings which more readily occurs when the older child is a boy who forces younger sibling into sexual contact usually during puberty. It rarely occurs if girls are older than male sibling. 'Father/step-father and daughter incest ranks second on list. When incest involves minors its clearly an act of abuse fuelled by power-driven attitudes and perverse behaviour picked up in childhood. 'There can also be an enjoyment on the abusers part of getting their own back from past experiences of being belittled or wronged.' He said that genetic sexual attraction can occur in 50 per cent of cases when relatives meet for the first time as adults because: 'There is usually a strong emotional attraction that gets turned into sexual feelings, though not all genetic sexual attraction feelings turn into sexual acts. 'One explanation is people tend to select mates that are like themselves physically and mentally; known as assortative mating.' He added that when he has hypnotised those who have had an incestuous relationship, they have revealed 'on a deep subconscious level, underlying feelings of childhood rejection and a need to seek familial approval fueled this act.'","Natasha Rose Chenier, 24, shared her shocking story with Jezebel .

"Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl converted to Islam during his captivity, declaring himself a 'mujahid', or warrior for the faith according to once-secret documents revealed today. Bergdahl, who was taken prisoner by the Taliban in 2009 after being found wandering a road alone and cursing America, became accepted by his captors to the point where he was allowed to fire an AK-47 during target practice, played soccer with them and was permitted to carry his own firearm. Psychologists who spoke to Fox News' James Rosen about the purported eyewitness accounts of Bergdahl's imprisonment said the documents illustrated a possible case of Stockholm Syndrome - the condition which causes hostages to sympathize or even join the cause of their captors in order to survive. However, the documents reveal that Bergdahl, who was returned to American custody during a POW exchange over the weekend, endured a checkered relationship with his Taliban captors. Scroll down for video . The hand off: The Taliban released this video showing a seemingly-healthy Bowe Bergdahl being given over to American allies in spite of President Obama's earlier claims that his declining health prompted the trade . In late June 2010, he is said to have escaped for five days and on his recapture was confined to a specially designed metal cage, where he was kept 'like a caged animal'. At other times during his five-years of internment with his Haqqani captors, Bergdahl conversed in friendly terms with them and would frequently use the word 'Salaam', which is the Arabic word for peace. This information was obtained by and seen by Fox News provided by the secretive Eclipse Group. It is a top-secret private firm of former intelligence operatives subcontracted by the Defense Department to obtain ground reports from every corner of the globe. Using a source within the 200 or so Taliban captors who kept Bergdahl, the former spies compiled reports for the US Central Command, or CENTCOM, which is headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, from November 2009, to May 31, 2010. Eclipse is operated by Duance R. Clarridge, who used to be a senior operations officer for the CIA in the 1980s. However, he is best remembered for being indicted for lying to Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. He was pardoned by President George H. Bush in December 1992, during his trial. Using his groups assets, Clarridge compiled 13 situation reports or SITREPs, which were sent to Brig. Gen. Robert P. Ashley Jr. - who in April 2010 was named the director of intelligence at the J-2 level at CENTCOM. Despite the initial contract expiring in 2010, according to Fox News, Clarridge used $50,000 of his own money to continue the providing the reports. Relief: No specifics about Bergdhal's medical condition have been publicly released but a spokesman said today that he is getting better on a daily basis . It was SITREP # 3023, dated August 23, 2012, that provided information from Clarridge's Haqqani sources, which makes the claim that that Bergdahl had declared himself a 'mujahid'. This was allegedly provided to Brig. Gen. Robert P Ashley, who is now commanding general at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence and Fort Huachuca. Calls to that base about what was known about Bergdahl were not returned. The documents seen by Fox News date from October 2009, which is around three-months after Bergdahl walked away from his base in Afghanistan to August 2012. They paint a picture of a turbulent period in captivity - which included bouts inside a metal cage after his failed June 2010 escape. Other reports reveal that Bergdahl would play soccer with his Taliban captors and was granted the use of an AK-47 for target practice. Bergdahl was also allowed to carry his own firearm during certain times of his imprisonment. Retired US Marine Corp Gen. James N. Mattis, who was CENTCOM commander from August 2010 to August 2012 told Fox News he knew of some intelligence from Eclipse, but there was never any intelligence to suggest Bergdahl was a collaborator. SITREP #3023 was compiled using a source close to Mullah Sangeen, the Haqqani commander charged over the past five years with the care of Bergdahl. Eclipse admit in the report that he was not 100 percent trusted by the group but 'does have plausible access to the information reported and claims to have seen Bergdahl personally in Shawal' - which is in North Waziristan. Waiting for a call: Bergdahl has been in American custody for five days but has not yet called his parents Jani and Robert, seen with President Obama during the announcement of Bowe's release . In a prior report, seen by Fox News, it outlines how Bergdahl and his captors changed their behavior after his June 2010 escape attempt. 'Conditions for Bergdahl have greatly relaxed since the time of the escape. Bergdahl has converted to Islam and now describes himself as a mujahid,' cites the report. 'Bergdahl enjoys a modicum of freedom, and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen, firing AK47s. 'Bergdahl is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion.  Bergdahl plays soccer with his guards and  bounds around the pitch like a mad man. 'He appears to be well and happy, and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying 'Salaam' repeatedly.' The top secret files were released to Fox News by Clarridge, who had his agents' reports described by the New York Times in 2011 as, 'an amalgam of fact, rumor, analysis and uncorroborated reports' He released them to demonstrate, 'We know what we're talking about'. This information comes as a Taliban commander told NBC News that when Bergdahl was picked up, 'Our people at the time couldn’t understand his language, but it was after he was shifted to a safe location, he said he wasn’t happy with his countrymen, but he didn’t intend to convert to Islam or join mujahideen (holy warriors)'. This revelation comes as U.S. government officials reported that Bergdahl's medical condition is 'stable and improving daily'. Even though he has been in American custody for five days and remains in treatment at a hospital in Germany, he has still not spoken with his parents- even though he has been able to communicate with others. 'He is conversing with medical staff and becoming more engaged in his treatment plan. He is resting better,' Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said Thursday. USA Today reports that Bowe's father Robert Bergdahl sent a video message to his son earlier this week and recorded a portion of the tape in Pashto, the language of his son's captors. That would have been Mr Bergdahl's first communication with his son in five years and there is no way he would have known anything about his son's linguistic abilities. Waiting: Though they have still not spoken with their son, Robert Bergdahl, seen here on Sunday, apparently sent a taped video message to Bowe and Robert recorded a portion of it in Pashto . CNN reported this evening that Bowe is speaking in English while in the American military hospital in Germany. The spokesman would not elaborate on the timetable for his transition from the American military hospital in German to the mainland United States. He is believed to be in the second part of the three-part transition process that will end with him reuniting with his parents- likely in a military hospital in San Antonio, Texas. The 28-year-old Idaho native is meeting with psychologists on a daily basis to help him 'regain control of his emotions'. Bergdahl was initially found by Afgan civilians, but word traveled to the local Tali ban leaders who went to collect the strange American. Apparently the group first thought it was a staged subterfuge tactic, with the idea being that Bergdahl intended to be picked up so that he could spy on the Taliban. 'As we never saw their soldier patrolling alone... we would ask him how he managed to walk out of his base... He would tell us that it was personal issue,' the unidentified commander told NBC. The circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's alleged desertion in 2009 are currently the subject of a federal investigation, but President Obama reiterated today during a press conference in Brussels that he will 'make no apologies' for arranging the prisoner swap with the Taliban in order to secure his release. When the exchange was first announced over the weekend, the administration said that Bergdahl's declining health was a cause for concern, but the video released by the Taliban showing the hand-off appear to show Bergdahl in relatively good health. Today the administration added that it was not only his health that prompted the deal to be made but also an alleged imminent threat to his life. No further details about that alleged threat have been released.","Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl converted to Islam during his captivity by the Taliban .

"An ex-CBS reporter is releasing a book that blames mainstream media outlets for covering for President Obama. Sharyl Attkisson left CBS in the spring and opened up about her former employer and colleagues in 'Stonewalled' and claims that the media is liberal and covers up for the current administration. According to a review in the New York Post, officials within the administration constantly criticized Attkisson's report efforts as 'unreasonable.' Stonewalled: Ex-CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson says that she encountered obstacles from the Obama administration and her own colleagues while reporting . Eric Schultz, part of the Obama press team, reportedly yelled at her when she pressed him about the scandal over the ATF's gunwalking scheme called Operation Fast and Furious. 'Goddammit, Sharyl!' he shouted. 'The Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, The New York Times is reasonable. You’re the only one who’s not reasonable!' Attkisson, who is now senior independent contributor for The Daily Signal, a media channel for conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, claims in her book that corporate media is hesitant to court controversy. While reporting on the shortcomings of Red Cross disaster relief efforts in the period following Hurricane Katrina, Attkisson says she was told to wait for CBS's stock split with Viacomm to report anything that might unsettle to corporate partners. She also says that her employer, CBS News, would kill stories or direct her away from lines of reporting critical of the Obama administration. Attkisson writes a colleague told her that one executive wanted stories about failing green energy companies on the CBS Evening News, but then-executive producer Pat Shevlin did not agree. Novel: Her revelations claim to show there is a liberal bias in the news media as a whole that excuses the Obama administration . When told that the stories would be 'pretty significant,' Shevlin retorted, 'What’s the matter, don’t you support green energy?' Atkisson also claims one of her superiors made it a rule to explicitly label conservatives as such, but that liberals and left-wing analysts were not called out. Apparently saving the details for the book, Attkisson says a conservative analyst who was far afield of her boss's personal views would be labeled 'right wing' in scripts. Another issue Attkisson points out is that CBS President David Rhodes has a glaring conflict of interest with the Obama administration, as his brother Ben is Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications. Nasty emails to Ben and David would apparently be sent when the network aired something distasteful to the administration, according to Attkisson. CBS reporters have still gone after the Obama administration in the past — a 60 Minutes report from Lara Logan about the unpreparedness of consular security in Benghazi retracted after its primary source was determined to be a fraud. For Attkisson though, the digging was too little too late, and she left the network in 2014, unsatisfied with what she saw as liberal excuses for the administration's actions.","Sharyl Attkisson left CBS in the spring, with some reporting she had split because of the network's 'liberal' bias .
Attkisson, who is now a contributor for The Daily Signal at Heritage Foundation, says the administration hounded her for her coverage of Fast and Furious and Benghazi .
She also blames CBS for being willing to kill stories that were critical of government or controversial .
A conflict of interest with CBS President David Rhodes, whose brother is part of the Obama administration, also complicated reporting ."
"Oregon State University is firing first lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson as head coach of their men's basketball team. A source told Sports Illustrated about the sacking on Monday, which brings to a close Robinson's six-year term with the Pac-12 team. While the president's brother-in-law ends his tenure with a losing record of 93-104 and no NCAA tournament appearances, he was once a beacon of hope for the sub-par Beavers. Out of office: First lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson has been fired as head coach for Oregon State University's men's basketball team. Pictured above at a tournament game against the University of Washington in Los Angeles in March 2012 . In his first year on the job, Robinson inherited a team that lost 21 straight Pac-10 games, turning the crew around for a 19-win season in 2008-2009. But this season the team finished with a lackluster 16-16 record and are now losing all of their starting players. However, the Beavers' failing record is unsurprising for a team which hasn't made it to the NCAA tournament since 1990. Jay John, who coached the team before Robinson, ended his five plus seasons with the Beavers with an even worse 28-68 record. Political connections: Robinson is the brother of first lady Michelle Obama and started at Oregon State the same year his brother-in-law was elected president. Pictured above with his sister at the Democratic National Convention in September 2012 . Robinson still has three more years remaining in his contract which means the school is set to owe him more than $4million. Robinson started at the Corvallis, Oregon college the same year Barack Obama was elected president. During his six years with the team, Robinson brought the West Coast team to DC for a few games. In November, the president, first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha watched court-side as the Beavers beat Maryland. First family supporters: The president, first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha watched the Oregon State Beavers battle the University of Akron while on vacation in Hawaii last December . Robinson even helped secure his sister as commencement speaker for the school in  2012. It's unclear where Robinson will head next, but his brother-in-law, a noted basketball aficionado, has often spoke about his talent as a coach. 'Craig Robinson is an outstanding coach. ... Anybody in Oregon and anybody who knows sports knows he turned it around. He loves Corvallis and I'm sure that as a young, successful coach he's going to start getting offers,' Mr Obama said in 2009. Big speech: Robinson even helped secure his sister as Oregon State's commencement speaker in 2012 .","Craig Robinson has been the coach of the Oregon State Beavers since the 2008-2009 season - the same year his brother-in-law became president .

"India's 'Elephant man' has turned down the opportunity to get a new face so he can pay for his daughter's wedding. Mannan Mondal, who is also known as the 'melted man' of Delhi, has refused radical reconstructive surgery so he can continue begging. The 50-year old, who suffers from neurofibromatosis - which means he has a high risk of growing tumours - relies on his appearance to make a living. So he has rejected the offer from surgeons in a bid to fund 20-year-old Rasheeda's big day. Scroll down for video . Refused: Mannan Mondal, 50, who begs in Delhi, has turned down radical reconstructive surgery so he can carry on begging and pay for his daughter's wedding . Opportunity: He received a consultation and surgeons said he could have a new face constructed, but rejected the offer . 'I will have to buy a lot of things - beds, cabinets, rings, watches and a cycle for the groom,' said Mannan, who is missing an eye, an ear and most of his teeth. 'The money I earn while begging is barely enough to feed my family. But I have no other way to help my daughter. I have to continue like this. I have to think about feeding my family first.' Mannan was born to an impoverished family in Kolkata, West Bengal, and opportunities were already limited. But he was further shunned because of his appearance and banned from school - leaving begging as his only option. Despite his condition he found love at 18 and now has two sons and two daughters to provide for. Selfless: The father-of-four relies on his look to make money, which he then sends to his family . Beg: He says he will need to pay for 'beds, cabinets, rings, watches and a cycle for the groom,' when it comes to his 20-year-old daughter, Rasheeda's, big day . He travels across India begging at holy sites, earning about £5 a day to send back to his beloved family. None of them have inherited the condition. He said: 'I have been like this since birth. I was born poor and I had limited options. When I was younger these deformities were much smaller but they have all grown much larger with age. 'People around me do not treat me very well. They are disgusted by me and don't like me. This is how it has been for years. 'I have learned to manage like this. For example, I don't use a toothbrush to brush my teeth. I use my fingers as I have only four teeth. 'I do not have a home. I live on the streets under tents pitched on the footpath and I do not have money to buy land or houses. Condition: Mannan suffers from Neurofibromatosis, which means he has a high risk of growing tumours . Making a living: He travels across India begging , earning about £5 a day to send back to his beloved family. None of them have inherited the condition . 'But my wife and family have been very supportive. They have always told me that my condition is God's creation. We humans cannot do anything to avoid it.' Mannan had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life-limiting. But only last month he was given a thorough consultation by Dr Ajay Kashyap, director of Plastic Surgery, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, in Gurgaon. He determined Mannan suffers from a type of neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition which causes uncontrollable growths along the nerves. The condition made headlines when 53-year-old Italian Vinicio Riva - who suffers from a similar condition - was kissed by Pope Francis at the Vatican last year. Dr Kashyap said: 'Mannan's tumours are benign, they are not cancerous. They will not shorten his life expectancy. 'But the bones have not developed . properly on one side of his face so he has no support and this has . caused the tumour to drop down. 'To . reconstruct his face we would have to take away as much of the tumour . as possible. After that, we would reconstruct the vital parts of his . face he is missing. Prognosis: Mannan had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life-limiting . Struggle: Mannan has suffered from the condition since he was a child, but still managed to find love at 18 and now has a family . 'We could give him a new mouth, some kind of an eye socket and some skeletal support to make his appearance as normal as possible. 'But even after the procedure, he would not be 100 per cent normal. My main aim would be to give him some comfort and to make him and his children feel like he is normal.' Surprisingly Mannan has turned his back on this opportunity - and vowed to continue begging. He feels this is his career and his sole option to make enough money to provide for his family. 'If there was an option of getting better without having to pay then I would definitely take it,' he said. 'But not now. I have a wedding to think about. I will have to go back home, talk to my family and then decide. But feeding my family will always come first.' While modern medicine can finally offer Mannan the chance of a new face - and a new life - it may have come too late for him. And so tonight, as for most nights in the last 50 years, he will once again be back on the streets plying his trade. Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome . Slamet is . believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the . name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of . their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a . gene mutation before they are born. There . are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type . one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The . condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name . given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. However, . in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had . Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms . such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head. The . confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had . suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and . Proteus syndrome. However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive. Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin. These . harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many . people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a . centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. NF1 . is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop . gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary . considerably from person to person. People . with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and . behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral . nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1 . over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved . spine.","Mannan Mondal, 50, relies on his appearance to make a living .

"Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood is home to art galleries, fashion stores, townhouses and now a new breed of cockroach that won't die even if forced to live outside all winter. The High Line, a park that turned a dilapidated stretch of elevated railway in the neighborhood into one of New York's newest tourist attractions, may have been responsible for bringing a new breed of cockroach to the city. Rutgers University insect biologists Jessica Ware and Dominic Evangelista said the species Periplaneta japonica is well documented in Asia but was never confirmed in the United States until now. The scientists, whose findings were published in the Journal of Economic Entomology, say that it is too soon to predict the impact but that there is probably little cause for concern. Competition: The Periplaneta japonica cockroach (left) has been documented in Asia but never in the U.S. before now . Natives: The new breed of cockroach will have to compete against the local populations of American (above), German, Brownbanded and Oriental cockroaches . 'Because this species is very similar to cockroach species that already exist in the urban environment,' Evangelista said, 'they likely will compete with each other for space and for food.' That competition, Ware said, will likely keep the population low, 'because more time and energy spent competing means less time and energy to devote to reproduction.' Michael Scharf, a professor of urban entomology at Purdue University, said the discovery is something to monitor. 'To be truly invasive, a species has to move in and take over and out-compete a native species,' he said. 'There's no evidence of that, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned about it.' The newcomer was first spotted in New York in 2012, by an exterminator working on the High Line. Stowaways: Researchers believe that the new cockroaches made their way to New York in plants imported for the High Line park in Chelsea . The scientists suspect the little critter was likely a stowaway in the soil of ornamental plants used to adorn the park. 'Many nurseries in the United States have some native plants and some imported plants,"" Ware said. ""It's not a far stretch to picture that that is the source.' Periplaneta japonica has special powers not seen in the local roach population; it can survive outdoors in the freezing cold. 'There has been some confirmation that it does very well in cold climates, so it is very conceivable that it could live outdoors during winter in New York,' Ware said. 'I could imagine japonica being outside and walking around, though I don't know how well it would do in dirty New York snow.' The likelihood that the new species will mate with the locals to create a hybrid super-roach is slim. 'The male and female genitalia fit together like a lock and key, and that differs by species,' Evangelista says. 'So we assume that one won't fit the other.' Recycled: The High Line used to be an elevated train track before it was turned into a park by the city .","Researchers believe an Asian cockroach made its way to the U.S. in plants imported for the construction of a New York City park .
Periplaneta japonica has never been confirmed in the U.S. until recently .
This form of Asian cockroach is different from common American cockroaches in that it can survive outside in the winter ."
"He is known as a reclusive street artist who spends his time secretly painting urban art murals on walls around Britain and beyond.

Ellsworth-Jones, the author of Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall, said it . was ‘fascinating’ to see the works gathered together in one place. He said Banksy's anonymity was part of his art, saying: ‘Originally he had to be anonymous because he'd get arrested. Liverpool Rat: Another work on display - pictured here in its original location - is a giant rat painted on the wall of a Liverpool pub . Girl With Balloon: A stencil of a girl with a balloon from an East London wall is being shown at the exhibition, and will be auctioned off on Sunday . ‘Now I think people would be embarrassed if they arrested him and it helps him market the art’. But Mr Ellsworth-Jones said the artist would not be impressed with the sale, saying: ‘He would much prefer the art if necessary to be destroyed rather than taken off and sold like this’. Sincura . was criticised last year for handling the sale of a Bansky mural whose . removal from the wall of a north London store dismayed many locals. The . works on show now include an image of two children playing with a ‘No Ball Games’ sign which was cut off of a shop wall in London last year. Sincura, which has valued the work at £1million, said proceeds from its sale will go to unspecified local charities. Banksy's works have been commanding higher prices as he has become better known to collectors in the US and in continental Europe. At a recent event in London held by an art exchange that allows investors to buys shares in works of art, one of the most sought-after pieces was a stenciled painting on canvas by Banksy called ‘Heavy Artillery’ that features an elephant weighed down by a missile strapped to its back. Its 1,000 shares were listed at £120 ($200) each.

"Eight staffers at Cory Booker's tech start-up have started looking for new jobs as the company is expected to shutter. The video aggregation company is said to be losing cash quickly and it is supposedly being kept alive through early November so that it's closure doesn't hurt Booker's chances at winning the New Jersey Senate race. The latest news about the floundering company, called Waywire, comes days after it was revealed that the 15-year-old son of CNN president Jeff Zucker had a position on the company's advisory board and had stock options in the company. The teenager resigned just hours later, and it now is clear that he is not the first person to leave the company. Public face: Cory Booker (pictured Thursday), the current mayor of Newark, New Jersey who is now running for Senate, is the founder of a video aggregation start up and he stands to make $1million to $5million out of the company . Keeping up appearances: Insiders believe that the company is going to remain open just until after the November election so that its closure doesn't hurt Booker's chances at winning the New Jersey Senate seat . It was known that the small company had a round of layoffs in the spring, but now The New York Post reported that eight peole left in April. 'When the company moved its focus from original production to curation, the production team was impacted. Several were given the option of changed, curation-focused roles with the company; they declined,' a spokeswoman told The Post. It isn't just staffers who are looking for work elsewhere, but also one of the three founding partners, Nathan Richardson. The company spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Richardson, who serves as CEO, is looking to be appointed on the board of a different, unidentified company. 'That engagement would not impact his ability to meet his Waywire commitments,' she said. Booker did his best on Thursday following a debate to calm the fires without actually revealing any more details/ . Her idea: Sarah Ross is said to be the one who approached Jeff Zucker's son Andrew (seen with his father at left in 2009) to be a member of the advisory board of Cory Booker's start-up Waywire. He has since resigned . Connected: Sarah Ross, seen here talking with Booker and trailed by Mark Zuckerberg, is well known in Silicon Valley . 'This company is in its infancy. Of . course it has changed its business model. It’s going through changes,' he said of the internal overhaul at Waywire. 'I’m a part of an ownership group and we’ve concluded not to discuss that.' The . other parts of the ownership group are Mr Richardson and Sarah Ross, . the tech entrepreneur who admitted to being the one to suggest Zucker . join the board because the teenager is apparently known for his insight . into popular trends among teens. Ms . Ross then had a conversation with both Jeff and Andrew Zucker and they . agreed to have the now-15-year-old sign on to Waywire's advisory board . and receive a 'de minimus' amount of stock options in return. An . unidentified source told CNN Money that Booker himself was 'not . involved at all' with the decision, and Ms Ross herself admitted at an . early stage that the politician would not be a part of the day-to-day . operations of the start up. Promoting the brand: If  Booker wins, he will have to resign from the board of Waywire and stop promoting it from his well-followed Twitter feed . The . New York Times reported that even in the nascent phase, it was clear . among the founders that Booker would be a more public role. When . the launched the company, Ms Ross reportedly said to Booker: 'You know . what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don’t have to . be involved — you’ve got a full-time job. But found the company.’ Unlike . many of the other boldface names connected to Waywire, like Oprah . Winfrey and Google's Eric Schmidt, it does not seem as if the elder . Zucker actually has any financial stake in the company. Very little has previously been revealed about the start-up, which was officially created in May 2012. Booker . reportedly came up with the idea for the company, whose mission is to . effectively become a different iteration of YouTube where the work of . up-and-coming students is highlighted, while meeting with Ms Ross and Mr . Richardson. He said it was . easy to raise the $1.75million worth of seed money for the venture . 'because of the power of the idea'. He said nothing of his rising power . on the national political stage. For . Booker's part, he may not be able to be involved in the company much . longer. If he wins the Senate race in November, he will be forced to . withdraw from Waywire's board.","Cory Booker helped found a video aggregation start up site called Waywire .

"A 14-year-old girl died in the street after a pharmacy refused her a life-saving adrenaline injection when she suffered an allergic reaction to peanuts at a Chinese buffet. Emma Sloan was denied an EpiPen shot - a special allergy injection - which by law, cannot be obtained from a chemist without a prescription, the Herald reported. Ireland's Children's Minister Frances Fitzgerald last night called for an inquiry into the death. Emma Sloan, right, died in a Dublin street after suffering a reaction to peanuts. Her mother Caroline rushed to a nearby chemist but the pharmacist refused to issue give her an adrenalin injection because she didn't have a prescription . It was reported on RTÉ that the pharmacy regulatory body, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, is examining the case. The teenager told her mother that she became unable to breathe after eating satay sauce in a Chinese restaurant in Dublin, it was reported. Caroline Sloan was said to have asked a nearby pharmacist for an EpiPen injection which would have released adrenaline to Emma, but the pharmacist said rules forbade them giving out the pen without a prescription. Ms Sloan, from Drimnagh, Dublin, was about to take her daughter to Temple Street Hospital in the city but Emma died on the street surrounded by a crowd, according to reports. Ms Sloan told the Herald newspaper: ‘I’m so angry. I was not given the EpiPen. I was told to bring her to A&E.’ Jimmy Chungs, the Chinese restaurant in Dublin where 14-year-old Emma accidentally ate Satay sauce. Her mother Caroline Sloan says she does not blame the restaurant, adding they did not see the warning not that the dish contained nuts . Ms Sloan, 40, said her daughter was a ‘beautiful, smart and funny girl – one of a kind.’ She appealed to parents of children with nut allergies to always carry an EpiPen. ‘I . was told to bring Emma to an A&E department. Emma was allergic to . nuts and was very careful. How could a peanut kill my child?’ she told . the Herald. The mother told . how she and Emma, along with her other daughters Amy, 20, and Mia, 2, . and Ms Sloan’s sister, Susan, had gone for dinner on Wednesday at . 6.30pm. The teenager, who . had a nut allergy, ate satay sauce, which contains peanuts, but Ms Sloan . said they had thought it was curry sauce. ‘It looked and smelled like . curry sauce,’ she said. ‘I’m not blaming the restaurant because there was a sign reading 'nuts contained' but it wasn’t noticed. Moments after eating the sauce, Emma is said to have told her mother that she couldn't breathe. Ms Sloan said they left the restaurant and went around the corner to a nearby chemist. Peanut allergies are often diagnosed in children who are less than two years old. Currently in the UK, one in 100 people suffer from an allergy to the nuts, with the majority suffering the affliction for life. An . allergy to peanuts is the most severe of all food allergies, with the . symptoms of a reaction triggered by a tiny trace of peanut protein. Peanuts provide a cheap source of dietary protein and so they are commonly used in a wide range of products. Currently there exists no treatment for the allergy and sufferers with a severe form are forced to avoid nuts altogether. The . Department of Health advises that for children under the age of three, . whose parents have a history of allergies, also avoid peanuts. As with other allergies, a peanut allergy, is caused by an over-reaction of the body's immune system to the protein. When a sufferer is struck by a reaction they typically develop a rash on the face or body. Sneezing, coughing and choking, wheezing and having trouble breathing are also symptoms. Severe reactions are known as anaphylatic shock. Anaphylaxsis can be fatal if it is not treated. While . there is currently no cure for a peanut allergy, sufferers can carry a . pre-loaded adrenaline injection, known as an EpiPen.  And antihistamine . can be used for more minor reactions. EpiPen's contain a single dose of epinephrine, which is injected into a sufferers thigh muscle. The heartbroken mother told the Herald that a worker at the pharmacy told her ‘I couldn’t get it without a prescription. He told me to bring her to A&E I left and I knew we’d have to run all the way to Temple Street Hospital.’ But just metres from the pharmacy the teenager collapsed on the ground and died on the pavement surrounded by onlookers. A doctor, who was passing by, tried to assist, placing Emma into the recovery position but the rescue attempt was unsuccessful. Ambulance staff and firefighters also tried to aid in the recovery but Emma was not responsive. The teenager died in front of her toddler sister Mia. ‘My daughter Amy held Mia in her arms as Emma died,’ Ms Sloan said. ‘Mia saw her die.’ Ms Sloan had just bought her two tickets for the X Factor tour as a Christmas present. She had been a fan of teenage singer Luke Friend. The mother described the fashion-conscious girl as ‘beautiful, smart and funny.’ ‘She wanted to be a make-up artist,’ Ms Sloan said. ‘Every day she’d have a different look.  She loved boys and music and make-up and clothes. ‘Emma was a very attractive girl and had modelled for her class recently at Our Lady of Mercy Secondary School in Drimnagh. ‘She was due to sit the Junior Cert in June.  She was a beautiful, smart and funny girl.  If I could sum her up in one sentence she was one of a kind. ‘I took down the Christmas tree this morning – I’ll never celebrate Christmas again.’ The pharmacy made no comment, saying it had been asked by the gardaí (Ireland's police force) not to make a statement. However pharmaceutical regulations do prohibit the sale of an EpiPen injection without a prescription. EpiPens are classed as S1B drugs, because they contain adrenaline with the potential to cause harm. This means they cannot be obtained without a prescription. A staff member at Jimmy Chung’s restaurant said that a sign had been visible which read ‘Satay Sauce. Nuts contained.’ A statement from the restaurant manager Tony Shek read: ‘The staff are often asked by family members if foods contain nuts. But nothing was mentioned to any staff yesterday.’ A security man at Clarks Shoe store close to where the 14-year-old died, Mujahid Najeebhun told the Herald he had witnessed the moments after the girl collapsed. He said: ‘I saw the girl lying on the ground.  She was in the recovery position on the pavement. A woman was shouting “My daughter is dying. My daughter is dying.” ‘People saw the fire brigade at the traffic lights and they were shouting at them to hurry up.’","Emma Sloan died in front of her mother and sisters in a Dublin street .

"Clayton Lockett spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack . A death row inmate spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack following a new cocktail of drugs administered in a lethal injection on Tuesday night. Oklahoma prison officials halted Clayton Lockett's execution after the experimental drug left the man writhing and clenching his teeth on the gurney. The 38-year-old, who was found guilty of shooting a woman and watching his friends bury her alive, was declared unconscious ten minutes after the first of the state's new three-drug lethal injection combination was administered. Three minutes later, though, he began breathing heavily, writhing, clenching his teeth and straining to lift his head off the pillow. It later emerged his vein had ruptured. The blinds were eventually lowered to prevent those in the viewing gallery from watching what was happening in the death chamber, and the state's top prison official eventually called a halt to the proceedings. Lockett died of a heart attack a short time later, the Department of Corrections said. Local media present said Mr Lockett sat up and said 'something’s wrong' 13 minutes into the procedure. 'It was a horrible thing to witness. This was totally botched,' said Lockett's attorney, David Autry. Scroll down for video . Oklahoma Department of Corrections director Robert Patton, left, called off the failed execution. Lockett was sentenced to death for shooting Stephanie Neiman, right, and watching his friends bury her alive . Witness Ziva Branstetter told broadcaster MSNBC Lockett was thrashing about and appeared to be in pain. 'His . body was sort of bucking. He was clenching his jaw. Several times he . mumbled phrases that were largely unintelligible,' she said. A Tulsa World newspaper claimed that Lockett was 'still alive,' and lifted his head as prison officials lowered the blinds. Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination. Other . states have used it before; Florida administers 500 milligrams of . midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma used 100 . milligrams of that drug. Republican Gov. Mary Fallin ordered stay of execution for Charles Warner who was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett . 'They should have anticipated possible problems with an untried execution protocol,' Autry said. 'Obviously . the whole thing was gummed up and botched from beginning to end. Halting the execution obviously did Lockett no good.' Republican . Gov. Mary Fallin ordered a 14-day stay of execution for an inmate who . was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett, Charles Warner. She . also ordered the state's Department of Corrections to conduct a 'full . review of Oklahoma's execution procedures to determine what happened and . why during this evening's execution.' Robert . Patton, the department's director, halted Lockett's execution about 20 . minutes after the first drug was administered. He later said there had . been vein failure. The execution began at 6:23 p.m., when officials began administering the first drug, the sedative midazolam. A doctor declared Lockett to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m. Once . an inmate is declared unconscious, the state's execution protocol calls . for the second drug, a paralytic, to be administered. The third drug in the protocol is potassium chloride, which stops the heart. 6:23 p.m. - The injection process begins. Lockett has heavy, slow blinks, laid still . 6:29 p.m. - Consistently closed his eyes . 6:30 p.m. - First check of consciousness; still conscious . 6:33 p.m. - Announced Lockett was officially unconscious . 6:34 p.m. - Lockett started to move his mouth . 6:36 p.m. - Lockett began convulsing and mumbling . 6:37 p.m. - Lockett sat up and said 'something's wrong' 6:39 p.m. - Prison officials lowered the blinds . 7:06 p.m. - Lockett dies of massive heart attack . Patton . said the second and third drugs were being administered when a problem . was noticed. He said it's unclear how much of the drugs made it into the . inmate's system. Lockett began writhing at 6:36. At 6:39, a doctor lifted the sheet that was covering the inmate to examine the injection site. 'There . was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having that . (desired) effect, and the doctor observed the line at that time and . determined the line had blown,' Patton said at a news conference . afterward, referring to Lockett's vein rupturing. After an official lowered the blinds, Patton made a series of phone calls before calling a halt to the execution. 'After . conferring with the warden, and unknown how much drugs went into him, . it was my decision at that time to stop the execution,' Patton told . reporters. Lockett was declared dead at 7:06 p.m. Autry, . Lockett's attorney, was immediately skeptical of the department's . determination the issue was limited to a problem with Lockett's vein. 'I'm . not a medical professional, but Mr. Lockett was not someone who had . compromised veins,' Autry said. 'He was in very good shape. He had large . arms and very prominent veins.' Bailey Elise McBride, who reports for the Associated Press in their Oklahoma bureau, tweeted immediately after the botched execution . 'After weeks of Oklahoma refusing to . disclose basic information about the drugs for tonight's lethal . injection procedures, tonight Clayton Lockett was tortured to death,' said Madeline Cohen, an attorney for Warner. Adam . Leathers, co-chair of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death . Penalty, accused the state of having 'tortured a human being in an . unconstitutional experimental act of evil,' reported CNN. In . Ohio, the January execution of an inmate who made snorting and gasping . sounds led to a civil rights lawsuit by his family and calls for a . moratorium. Nightmare: Patton said the inmate was writhing on the gurney, pictured, and shaking uncontrollably about 13 minutes into the execution . Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma . used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug . combination. Other states have used it before; Florida administers 500 . milligrams of midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma . used 100 milligrams. The . problems with the execution are likely to fuel more debate about the . ability of states to administer lethal injections that meet the U.S. Constitution's requirement they be neither cruel nor unusual punishment. That question has . drawn renewed attention from defense attorneys and death penalty . opponents in recent months, as several states scrambled to find new . sources of execution drugs because drugmakers that oppose capital . punishment - many based in Europe - have stopped selling to prisons and . corrections departments. Defense . attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged several states' policies of . shielding the identities of the new sources of their execution drugs. Missouri and Texas, like Oklahoma, have both refused to reveal their . sources, but both of those states have since successfully carried out . executions with their new supplies. The state has stood by the execution but said Monday that it's boosting the dosages of its lethal injection drugs. A . four-time felon, Lockett was convicted of shooting 19-year-old . Stephanie Neiman with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two . accomplices buried her alive in rural Kay County in 1999 after Neiman . and a friend arrived at a home the men were robbing. Warner had been scheduled to be put to death two hours later in the same room and on the same gurney. The 46-year-old was convicted of raping and killing his roommate's 11-month-old daughter in 1997. He has maintained his innocence. Lockett . and Warner had sued the state for refusing to disclose details about . the execution drugs, including where Oklahoma obtained them. The . case, filed as a civil matter, placed Oklahoma's two highest courts at . odds and prompted calls for the impeachment of state Supreme Court . justices after the court last week issued a rare stay of execution. The . high court later dissolved its stay and dismissed the inmates' claim . that they were entitled to know the source of the drugs. By . then, Fallin had issued a stay of her own - a one-week delay in . Lockett's execution that resulted in both men being scheduled to die on . the same day. Warner was served a final meal Tuesday of 20 boneless chicken wings, potato wedges, cole slaw, two fruit cocktail cups and a 20-ounce soda. Lockett's request of steak, shrimp, a large baked potato and a Kentucky Bourbon pecan pie was denied because it exceeded the $15 limit. He declined a separate offer from the warden for a dinner from Western Sizzlin', prison officials said. Oklahoma changed its execution protocols twice this year, leaving State officials with five options for lethal injections, including a new three-drug mixture that was used for the first time Tuesday. Two of the drugs used carry warnings that they can suppress the respiratory system and the third warns that cardiac trouble can occur at high but non-lethal doses, and lists specific steps to take if a medical patient receives too much of the drug but doesn't die.","Clayton Lockett execution halted 20 minutes after first drug administered .

"Russia may have access to American top secret intelligence and battle plans, the Head of the Defense Intelligence Agency announced on NPR on Friday. Lt.Gen Micheal Flynn warned U.S. officials that they should prepare for the worst case scenario following the Edward Snowden leak detailing the ins and outs of the U.S. surveillance network. Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden is seeking asylum in Moscow after following his information leak to The Guardian last year and the United States Intelligence committee can only assume that Russia already has some information from Snowden or that they are trying to obtain it. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General Michael Flynn warns of the likely possibility Edward Snowden leaked important information about U.S. security to Russia . 'If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries — in this case, of course, Russia,' Flynn said. Flynn is worried about what else Snowden may know because he may have information about technology and weapons systems, operational capabilities, and intelligence capabilities, reports CNN. Re-vamping the U.S. surveillance network and changing military tactics is essential to national security but will be an arduous process. 'We really don't know' what Snowden's got, Flynn said. 'we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised,' he warned. He said that if Russia had U.S. intelligence, which they very well may, that it's very 'serious.' According to Flynn and and the Director of U.S. intelligence James Clapper, Snowden's leaks have already posed a threat to U.S. National Security. Former contract employee at the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, is currently seeking asylum in Russia . The leak has caused the U.S. to lose critical information sources. 'What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs,' Clapper said back in January. 'As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners.' Terrorists who make it a priority to familiarize themselves with American intelligence agencies will be more prepared than ever to go under the radar. 'Snowden claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished,' Clapper added. 'If that is so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security.' Flynn chimed in and said, 'the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm's way.' Russia has stirred up the battlefield recently and has stationed troop is in the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has currently stationed soldiers in the Crimea Peninsula of Ukraine in attempt to claim the Soviet region's independence .","Edward Snowden may have given Russian information about U.S. security that could threaten the nation .

"First came KFC's now infamous Double Down, a heart attack waiting to happen, which saw the usual burger bun replaced with pieces of chicken. The fast food chain marketed it as a sort of 'sandwich' despite the meaty meal consisting of bacon, two types of cheese and a special sauce crammed between the crumbed chicken - with no bread in sight. But now South Korea has taken the concept and stepped it up a notch, with the addition of a slab of beef smack bang in the middle of the burger - turning it into the Double Down King. Scroll down for video . South Korea has taken the KFC Double Down and added a beef patty to the bacon and chicken 'burger' Now a quadruple-meat concoction, KFC offers hungry customers two pieces of crumbed chicken, bacon, and a beef patty coated in a two types of sauce for what works out be less than $10 Australian. It weighs in at 750 calories, which is about a third of an adults recommended daily intake. As for whether it's coming to Australia, KFC told Daily Mail Australia there was something else in store for their customers Down Under. 'At the moment, the burger is only launching in South Korea. The Double always creates a lot of hype in Australia and we’ll be giving our fans something to get really excited about in early November,' a spokeswoman said. The original Double Down was first released in America in April 2010, and consisted of two pieces of bacon and two melted slices of cheese, slathered in mayonnaise and sandwiched between two slices of chicken. Last year they came up with the Double Down Maxx, which had a hash brown sandwiched between the chicken . Nutritionists were horrified by the launch of the super fatty dish in a country where two-thirds of the population is overweight or obese. KFC insists the sandwich contains 540 calories - but it was reported that it actually racked up a much higher figure of 1,228, or about half of a man's recommended daily intake. The 'burger' has also been released in Australia - first in March 2011 for a few weeks before it made a brief re-appearance on the market in June 2014. Last year in South Korea the first adaptation of the meal for meatlovers was dubbed the Double Down Maxx. This version of the fast food feast kept the concept of having chicken as the bun, but added a hash brown, cheese and a variation of sauce for the filling. The original Double Down sandwich was chicken as the bun, bacon, cheese and sauces .","South Korea has released a new version of KFC's Double Down burger .

"Scotland  will be left without any weapons to defend itself if it votes for independence and refuses to take on its share of UK debt, an MP has warned. Ian Davidson, the chairman of the influential Scottish affairs committee, said that Alex Salmond’s ‘cavalier’ plan to renege on Scotland’s debts if he does not get his way on the pound would ‘poison’ negotiations with the UK. He warned that Scotland would be denied access to military equipment and could be left with ‘a navy with no ships, an air force with no planes and an army with no guns’. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond’s (left) ‘cavalier’ plan to renege on Scotland’s debts if he does not get his way on the pound would ‘poison’ negotiations with the UK, says Ian Davidson (right), chairman of the influential Scottish affairs committee . Mr Salmond has been under intense pressure to give details of an alternative if Westminster does not agree to the share the pound, but he has said he has no intention of proposing a ‘plan B’. All three main UK parties have promised to veto a currency union if Scotland votes for independence on 18 September. But Mr Salmond has insisted that monetary union with the rest of the UK would go ahead and promised not to help repay British debt if it does not. Yesterday, Mr Davidson warned that an independent Scotland could not expect to receive military equipment if it walks away from UK debt. He told the Mail: ‘Any decision by a separate Scotland to repudiate its share of the National Debt will clearly have an impact upon any potential division of assets and liabilities, since the National Debt is the major liability. HMS Ambush alongside Valiant Jetty at Faslane.Scotland will be left undefended it votes for independence and refuses to take on its share of UK debt (File photo) ‘It is difficult to imagine the UK handing over assets such as warships, aircraft and other military equipment when the Scottish share of the borrowing that has helped pay for these items is not being repaid. ‘Thus debt repudiation could result in a Scottish Navy with no ships, a Scottish Air Force with no planes and a Scottish Army with no guns.’ The Labour MP for Glasgow South West said that the UK could try and block Scotland joining the EU or Nato if it did not take on any existing debt. He said: ‘Any debt repudiation by a separate Scotland will poison the waters of all other negotiations. ‘The SNP will have to clarify whether a Scotland in dispute with the UK over debt will be eligible to apply to join the EU? Or Nato? ‘Clearly the collaboration and support from the UK for any Scottish application to such organisations, and for the negotiation of terms, is less likely to be forthcoming if a separate Scotland is reneging on debt.’ He also warned that a debt default would ruin Scotland’s reputation for fiscal responsibility and stop it being able to raise money for spending. HMS Blyth leaving Faslane - the base could be abandoned by the Royal Navy if Scotland votes for independence (File photo) ‘As for defence procurement – there is little chance of orders for equipment, which will be partly funded by new borrowings, being placed in a Scotland which will not pay its share of previous debts,’ he said. ‘Thus debt repudiation will accelerate the job losses in defence industries that will follow separation. ‘Now that the First Minister is making debt repudiation one of his strategic objectives then voters in Scotland need to be aware of the consequences.’ The UK Treasury will today publish new expert analysis that shows more than a tenth of Scottish jobs are linked to trade with the UK. The figures, based upon independent academic research from Professor Brian Ashcroft of Strathclyde Business School, reveal that almost 270,000 jobs are connected with UK trade.","Chairman of Scottish affairs committee said Alex Salmond’s ‘cavalier’ plan to renege on Scotland’s debts would ‘poison’ negotiations with UK .

"The second-largest school district in California is raising eyebrows after its police force recently acquired a military-grade armored vehicle. The San Diego Unified School District now has a 14-ton M-RAP — short for mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle — that American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan usually ride into combat to protect them against explosives. The $700,000 tank was donated to the school district under a military program that distributes surplus military equipment to local police agencies. The federal initiative has come under heavy criticism after police in Ferguson, Missouri, used military weapons usually reserved for trained US Marines against regular citizens protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18. This digitally altered image shows what school police officials in San Diego want their new armored truck to look like . This image shows another potential look for the military-grade truck obtained by California's second-largest school district . The armored vehicle has been stripped of any weaponry and will possibly be painted white to resemble an ambulance. It only cost the school district $5,000 for shipping from Texas, KSWB reported. But even within the school district, officials are questioning the need for such equipment. 'The symbol of having an armored vehicle in the district is not the message we want to send to schools,' school board trustee Scott Barnett told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'But we have it now,' added Barnett, whose school board wasn't consulted when the police force applied for the tank. 'Can we leverage that vehicle to fund something we really need — new patrol cars?' The school district's police chief, Rueben Littejohn, says the truck is intended to be used as a rescue vehicle that could evacuated up to 40 children in the event of an emergency. 'It’s not the militarization of schools,' Littlejohn told the Union-Tribune. 'The vehicle has been stripped . of all offensive equipment and it’s been repurposed for humanitarian . purposes.' American soldiers in Afghanistan relax prior to a mission using a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, one of which has now been redirected to a school district in California . Soldiers in Afghanistan use mine-resistant vehicles like the one now housed amid yellow schoolbuses in San Diego . 'After Sandy Hook there was a lot of conversation about what folks should do — what do you do for that kind of situation?' the police chief told the newspaper. 'My team took that very seriously and came up with some creative solutions, this being one of them.' School safety expert Robert Macy disagrees. 'A school that has someone in charge of the school safety plan and . someone in charge of what you do when someone is on campus and they . practice the protocols — you are going to get more mileage out of that . than many armed vehicles,' Macy, who heads the International Trauma Center, told VICE News. 'It's not as easy as putting big heavy weaponry on campus.' 'A tank is cartoonish,' he added. 'It gives the school a false sense of security.'","The San Diego Unified School District has acquired a 14-ton armored truck that its police says it can use to protect children in case of an emergency .

"A Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly bringing guns across the border said he never intended to leave the country but missed an exit when heading to meet friends in a border town. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 25, said he was headed to dinner in San Ysidro on March 31 when he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in Tijuana, U-T San Diego reported. 'I was going to call them after I drove off the exit, but I never got off the exit, I blew right past it,' he told the newspaper in an interview from jail. 'I wasn't paying attention, thinking I had way farther to go. I ended up in Mexico with no way to turn around.' Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi left,  is being held at Tijuana's La Mesa Penitentiary on weapons charges for mistakenly crossing the border with a shotgun, handgun and rifle in his vehicle . He said Mexican authorities found three guns inside the truck he had recently driven from Florida to make a new start in San Diego. He was jailed, and is now being held in Tijuana's La Mesa Penitentiary without bail. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter last week wrote a letter asking Secretary of State John Kerry to secure Tahmooressi's release. State Department officials said they were aware of an arrest of a U.S. citizen in Mexico, but they do not comment on arrests of private individuals without the person's permission. Similar cases have occurred before. In 2008, an active-duty Army soldier was jailed in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, for driving into Mexico with guns, knives and ammunition. In 1999, a Marine was detained in Tijuana for two weeks after driving into Mexico with guns, the newspaper reported. If Tahmooressi is convicted, he faces six to 21 years in a Mexican prison, his lawyers said, adding that alternatively the case could be dropped if the Mexican attorney general's office in Mexico City requests dismissal. Tahmooressi served four years in the Marines, including two tours in Afghanistan. He says he was honorably discharged in November 2012. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter last week wrote a letter asking Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured) to secure Tahmooressi's release . After he was jailed, Tahmooressi tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, and then onto another one. He gave up when a guard opened fire, but the incident earned him the nickname 'Spider-Man'. He later grabbed a light bulb and stabbed himself in the neck. He was taken to the hospital and given stiches. He said he longs for his family and friends and has been receiving visits from an English-speaking Christian chaplain. 'I put my faith in God that he will take care of me,' he said. 'It was just a big mistake, and I hope that the people here will realize that and that the judge will realize that.'","Sgt.

"A Second World War bunker with no windows and 4ft thick walls has been transformed into a pair of surprisingly light and airy £440,000 luxury homes. The bunker, on a former RAF base at Caversfield, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, was originally built to withstand a bombing, gas or chemical attack and came complete with decontamination showers, air lock doors and a war room. However, the huge building, which once had bare walls and a muddy floor, has now been split in half and transformed into two distinctive 1,400 sq ft two bedroom homes which are on the market for £440,000 each.

"Miami Heat are poised to make a direct pitch to retain free agent LeBron James, after reports emerged that the Cavaliers have agreed a deal to free up salary cap room in their bid to lure James back to Cleveland. With the signing period kicking in after the stroke of midnight in America, widespread media reports said James was set to sit down with Heat president Pat Riley in Las Vegas, where the four-time league most valuable player is hosting his basketball camp. Straining to improve the Heat after last month's five-game NBA Finals loss to San Antonio given salary cap limits, Miami have announced agreements to add free agent forwards Josh McRoberts and Danny Granger. VIDEO Scroll down to watch LeBron James put on a brilliant slam dunk show . Many happy returns? LeBron James could move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat . Make the call: Usher said he would be happy to call LeBron James to convince him to come back to the Cleveland Cavaliers . VIDEO LeBron will stay in Miami - Denevey . Cleveland, believed to be the chief rival to Miami for getting James's signature on a new contract, made salary room for the Akron, Ohio native by agreeing to a three-team swap that will enable them to drop $9.5 million against the cap. James played his first seven NBA seasons with Cleveland before joining Miami as a free agent in 2010. The Cavaliers would send guard Jarrett Jack ($6.3 million) and Russian forward Sergey Karasev ($1.5 million) to the Brooklyn Nets, and center Tyler Zeller ($1.7 million) along with a future number one pick to the Boston Celtics, according to espn.com and other media sources. Brooklyn would ship guard Marcus Thornton to Boston, while Cleveland was expected to acquire a future draft pick in the three-way swap that would bring the Cavs $21.7 million under the cap. Scathing attack: Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert was not impressed when LeBron James decided to leave . The Cavaliers were also receiving draft rights to Ilkan Karaman, Christian Drejer and Edin Bavcic. While James, who reached four NBA Finals and won two championships in his four seasons in Miami, could change the league landscape with his decision on where to play next season, other big names were also weighing their options. Carmelo Anthony, who averaged 27.4 points and 8.1 rebounds last season for a New York Knicks team that are keen to retain him, has been courted by the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. Chris Bosh, who joined the Heat as a 'Big Three' along with fellow free agents James and Dwyane Wade in 2010, has reportedly been offered a four-year deal worth $88 million to join center Dwight Howard and guard James Harden in Houston. Other prominent players shopping their talents include Luol Deng, Gordon Hayward and Spanish veteran Pau Gasol.

"A man has claimed he has new pictures of the elusive Bigfoot, taken this weekend on the eastern coast of the U.S. Randy O'Neal, 40, posted the Sasquatch photographs online, which he says his father took on a camera phone this weekend near the Intracoastal Highway in Virginia. He also suggests that the video could prove an encounter he had with the beast 25 years previously, which neither he nor his family have ever been able to prove. Scroll down for video . Bigfoot? Randy O'Neal, from Virginia, posted this photograph online. He says it was taken near the coast this weekend and shows an ape-like creature he saw 25 years previously . Mysterious: The hunched, black figure seems to have its hands forward, standing on a log jutting out into a creek . Accepting the inevitable scepticism that follows claims of seeing the mythic creature, Mr O'Neal posted a written commentary describing both encounters, then challenges internet users to prove his pictures are faked. The image shows what appears to be a hunched black figure on a log which juts out into a body of water. The figure seems to have its hands in front of its body, and to be looking out towards the photographer. Sceptics have suggested it is just a tree trunk. In his written explanation of the encounter, Mr O'Neal says his father - who is not named - and a family friend referred to as 'Uncle Jap' took the picture on a fishing trip using an aging camera-phone. He does not definitively identify the creature as a Sasquatch, but says it is 'something that I have never seen or heard before nor again in my life'. Fresh sighting? Mr O'Neal's video is a new entry in a string of Bigfoot sightings, including (above) a 1967 film purporting to shot the beast in Bluff Cove California . He said: 'My memories and experiences have made me a believer. Here are the pictures again. Feel free to pause, copy, zoom, dissect or whatever you need to do to prove this fake. I can honestly say that these are the clearest, most ‘non-blurred’ images I personally have ever seen.' Mr O'Neal also refers to a previous encounter in the same spot. The precise location is not given, but it is said to be near the northern end of the Intracostal Highway - a network of waterways stretching from Norfolk, Virginia to the southern tip of Florida. Recounting the moment, Mr O'Neal writes that he, his father and 'Uncle Jap' had a late-night meeting with the 'unknown creature' 25 years before. He claims that while sitting round a campfire he saw 'a set of red eyes' watching through the bushes. His father - believing he was imagining it - handed the 15-year-old Mr O'Neal a shotgun and asked him to flush the creature out. When he complied, the creature 'let out the most blood-curdling scream', smashed through the woods and plunged into a creek. In the morning, he claims, a path of destruction could be seen where the animal is thought to have knocked over trees on its way to safety. A map was released in September last year which plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years . Mr O'Neal's video is the latest contribution to a long string of Bigfoot sightings, which have often been written off as fake. In 1951 American Eric Shipton the footprint of a beast he called a yeti. Reports of his find prompted a spate of other 'sightings'. The Sasquatch Genome Project, an organisation in America, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars investigating and researching potential sightings. A map produced last year by a PhD research candidate recorded 3,313 sightings between 1921 and 2013, mostly on the western coast of the U.S. The scientific community is yet to be convinced that they are anything more than hoaxes or mistakes.","Jim O'Neal posted images online allegedly from this weekend .

"So much for the best and the brightest! Harvard students believe that American is a bigger threat to world peace than ISIS, according to a recent survey of attendees at the prestigious Cambridge university. Campus Reform, a self-styled 'campus watchdog' for conservative students, carried out the interviews in the quad at the Ivy League school on Saturday and asked: ‘Who is the bigger threat to world peace, ISIS or the U.S.?’ The students featured in the video were overwhelming in their belief that America and its interventionist foreign policy is a greater threat than the group of Muslim fanatics that have gained global notoriety in recent months through a series of video of Western hostages being beheaded. Scroll down for video . A group of Harvard students quizzed  overwhelmingly said that America rather than ISIS was a bigger threat . 'We are, at some level, the cause of it,'  another student told interviewer Caleb Bonham . ‘American imperialism and our protection of oil interests in the Middle East are destabilizing the region and allowing groups like ISIS to gain power,’ said one student. 'We are, at some level, the cause of it,' she adds. 'As a western civilization we’re to blame for a lot of the problems that we’re facing now,' said another student. 'I don't think anyone would argue that we didn't create the problem of ISIS, ourselves.' The interviews were carried out by Caleb Bonham, editor of Campus Reform and a frequent guest on the Fox News Channel. 'In many ways I have to think it's America because America is making decisions that are much more likely to affect the world,' one student responds to Bonham's question. 'The amount of spending that America has on causes of potential destruction in the world is really outlandish,' she continues. After interviewing Harvard students, Campus Reform editor Caleb Bonham (right) was quick to be critical of their opinions and accused them of trying to be intellectual . 'We've been learning about this recently how much america spends on defense mechanisms alone and it's really quite astounding compared to any other country in the world really.' Another student tells Bonham: 'I just an interesting conversation last night with a couple of my neighbors and they can see how the ideology of ISIS might appeal to people in the Middle East who are not familiar with how we think as Americans.' 'They have a skewed view of us just as a lot of Americans have a skewed view of them, he adds. Bonham was highly critical of the student's responses. ‘This video demonstrates the absurdity behind the bash America fad,’ he told FoxNews.com. ‘Unfortunately, too many students think it is intellectual to try and piece together a reason why America is a greater threat than this terrorist organization trying to establish a caliphate through public executions, bombings and beheadings.’ As one of the world's most prestigious universities, Harvard enjoys an almost unparalleled reputation in America. It is the oldest academic institute in the United States, dating from 1636, and boats an impressive 210-acre main campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The total cost of attending Harvard College without financial aid is $58,607 for tuition, room, board and fees combined, although that does not include books or personal expenses. ‘American imperialism and our protection of oil interests in the Middle East are destabilizing the region and allowing groups like ISIS to gain power,’ another student responded . In the past nine months, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the US continues to intervene in Iraq. The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani. This week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned  that ISIS is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups, including the one that led the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. 'It’s a serious threat because this is the best-funded, most professional, expansionist jihadist military force that we have ever seen,' Clinton told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to the Washington Post. The total cost of attending Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachussetts, without financial aid is $58,607 for tuition, room, board and fees combined, although that does not include books or personal expenses . 'This is far more advanced and far richer than al Qaeda ever was,' Clinton declared. Campus Reform promotes itself as a watchdog to the nation's higher education system and claims to exposes bias and abuse on the nation's college campuses. Bonham is a graduate of Colorado State University. Campus Reform describes him as bringing 'his unique message, filled with introspection and humor, across the country speaking to young leaders and encouraging them to lead with the strength of their convictions'.","Students felt that US foreign policy is greater threat than the Muslim fanatics .

"To some he is hero, a selfless freedom fighter who liberated his nation after years of oppression. But to others he is a ruthless terrorist who lit the fuse for World War One, plunging Europe into years of darkness and despair. Now, 100 years after 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, as they rode through Sarajevo, the act continues to create bitter divisions in a deeply fractured country. Scroll Down for Video . Miljkan Princip, the grandson of Gavrilo Princip's brother, poses with a photo of the assassin's old house as he stands in front of it in Bosansko Grahovo . Among those caught in the middle of the row is Princip's great nephew who was given his name and still resides in . East Sarajevo, where he runs a hotel. Serbs . who fled the region are collecting money to rebuild the . family home in time for the centenary on June 28. Princip's house is one of hundreds of . gutted homes scarring the bleak plateau, untouched since they were . sacked by Croat forces on the heels of fleeing Serbs at the end of the . Bosnian war. The Sarajevo footprints have gone. The house was razed three times, . during the two world wars and again in 1995. They're wasting their time, . said Gavrilo. 'It will be . burned down and destroyed again,' he said. 'We build and then we . destroy. That's how things are in Bosnia.' Fateful day: Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie ride through Sarajevo one hour before they were shot and killed by Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip . This is an artist's impression of the moment when Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were shot by Gavril Princip . Bosnian Serb forces under Ratko Mladic attempted just that eight decades later. Sarajevo . mayor Ivo Komsic, a Bosnian Croat, noted the city's role in the two . wars that framed the last century when unveiling plans for the centenary . last month. 'The . eyes of the world will be focused on Sarajevo once more and it is . important that we send messages completely different from the messages . of war sent in 1914 and 1992,' he said. Such . comparisons have riled Serbs in Bosnia and neighbouring Serbia, for . whom Princip is a pan-Slavic hero, the shot he fired marking the death . knell for centuries of foreign occupation over Serbs, Croats and . Bosniaks alike. Archduke Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside his wife, Sophie on June 28 1914. Eventually killed by 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, the couple had earlier that day been attacked by another man who threw a grenade at their car. Archduke Ferdinand was shot in the neck, while his wife was hit in the abdomen. The assassination is believed to have started a domino effect which led to the break out of the First World War a month later. Princip and others wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia. This action led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia. After that Serbia's ally Russia, and Russia's allies France and Britain, were pulled into conflict with Austria-Hungary and its treaty partner, Germany. Two rival sets of events are being . planned, and accusations of 'revisionism' are flying at a time of . renewed Cold War-style tensions between East and West. The . row goes to the heart of Bosnia today, a country still affected by . big-power divisions and still arguing about the past, divided by the . present and uncertain about the future. 'We haven't moved on,' said Bosnian historian Vera Katz. 'It's like we're 100 years before 1914, not 100 years after.' Sarajevo bookended the 20th century, . opening with Princip's Browning revolver and closing with the sniper . rifles and mortars of his ethnic kin besieging the city from the hills . during Bosnia's 1992-95 war. To some, like the woman at the museum, the two events were part of the same arc of Serb nationalism. According . to that narrative, Princip was a 'terrorist' bent on uniting Orthodox . Serb lands at the expense of Bosnia's Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic . Croats. This was the official narrative for decades in socialist Yugoslavia, when Princip was venerated as a freedom fighter for all the nations and faiths gathered together by Josip Broz Tito. Schools and roads took the assassin's name. His footprints were enshrined in the pavement at the spot from which he fired. In his native mountain region of Bosansko Grahovo, a plaque erected in 1949 still stands above the doors to the local school, hailing Princip's 'fearless' fight for the 'national freedom of our peoples'. Today, the plaque is blackened, licked by the flames that razed the school in 1995 as Yugoslavia crumbled. Sarajevo, now inhabited largely by Bosniaks, plans to mark the centenary of the assassination with a series of cultural events sponsored in large part by France and also with the help of Austria and possibly the European Union.

Mayor of Bosansko Grahovo stands in the house which once belonged  to Gavrilo Princip whose assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is widely believed to have lit the fuse for World War One .

Organisers of the Sarajevo . commemoration, who are hoping to get funding from the EU, say it will . steer clear of the issue of whether Princip was terrorist or hero. The . centrepiece will be a concert of the Vienna Philharmonic in the city's . much-loved Vijecnica, Sarajevo's city hall-turned-National Library that . burned down at the start of the 43-month Bosnian Serb siege of the city. The concert will mark its reopening. On . June 27, French philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy, who supported the . Bosniak call for Western intervention to halt the war in Bosnia, will . premiere his latest play in Sarajevo, which deals specifically with the . 1992-95 conflict. Bosnia's . autonomous Serb Republic has refused to participate, except in a leg of . the Tour de France cycling race in the capital on June 20-23.

The . Serb events will be choreographed by filmmaker Emir Kusturica, a . Sarajevan born into a Bosniak family but who later took on the Serbian . Orthodox faith, who plans to stage an opera about the assasination and . show a documentary about Princip. Authorities in Serb-controlled East Sarajevo say plans are in the pipeline for a statue of the assassin. 'We . once all lived in one state (Yugoslavia), and we never looked on it as . any kind of terrorist act, as some historians try to present it today,' said Nenad Samardzija, the Serb mayor of East Sarajevo. 'We looked on it as a movement of young people who wanted to liberate themselves from colonial slavery.' The contradictions are inevitable, said sociology professor Slavo Kukic. 'Through . no fault of his own, Gavrilo Princip is the result of all those . political conflicts and differences on the territory of the former . Yugoslavia ... over the past quarter of a century,' he said. 'We've had . many Gavrilo Princips in our recent past.'

The demands of each side in Bosnia have changed little since its war - while the Bosniaks want a more centralised, unified state, the Croats say they need their own entity like the Serbs. Serb leaders, meanwhile, look east to Serbia, saying they have little need for Bosnia at all, much as pro-Moscow forces now in Crimea are looking to Russia and rejecting Ukraine. The political system put in place in Bosnia by a U.S.-brokered peace deal in 1995 divvied up power along ethnic lines, fuelling corruption, stifling development and triggering unrest last month unprecedented since the war. The historian Katz, her office unheated since the war because the state History Institute can't afford the bills, said all the centenary plans were inappropriate given the far more pressing economic and political problems facing Bosnia. 'It's like putting on makeup when you haven't even had a bath,' she said.","Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914 .

"Prosecutors in the case of a man accused of killing a University of Richmond student earlier this summer said he may have been seeking retribution for U.S. military action against Muslims in the Middle East. Ali Muhammad Brown and two accomplices are facing charges in connection to the slaying of 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin, who was shot multiple times in his car on June 25 in New Jersey. Brown, 29, also has been named a suspect in three other deadly shootings in Washington state. Payback: Ali Muhammad Brown, 29 (left), accused of killing 19-year-old college student Brendan Tevlin (right), allegedly told police he was seeking retribution against the U.S. for its military action in the Middle East . According . to court documents filed last month and cited by NJ.com, Brown told police he considered it . his mission to kill Tevlin, a Livingston, New Jersey, native, as an act . of 'vengeance' for innocent lives lost in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and . Iran at the hands of American troops. ‘All . these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life,’ he was quoted as telling detectives, according to . the documents. Firebrand: Talk radio host Todd Pettengill blasted mainstream media for failing to draw attention to what he called Brown's act of domestic terrorism . Prosecutors described Brown as a devout Muslim who considered U.S. military action in the Middle East 'evil.' Brown's . case was brought to the forefront this week by talk radio . host Todd Pettengill, who devoted eight minutes of his program, The Todd . Show on WPLJ Wednesday to what he described as an 'act of domestic . terrorism.' Pettengill . called out mainstream media and President Obama for not focusing enough . attention on the case, despite Brown's statements about retribution . against the U.S. ‘It was in . fact an act of jihad, perpetrated by a fellow American who sympathized . more with those who want to annihilate us than with his own country and . its people,’ he said. The 29-year-old suspect was one of four men arrested last month in connection to the deaths of 19-year-old Tevlin and a second New Jersey teen, 17-year-old Cheyanne Bond. Mr Brown also has been charged with three other shooting deaths in Seattle in April and June. Also charged: Eric Williams (left) was implicated in Tevlin's murder. Andre Fields is wanted in the shooting death of Cheyanne Bond and two gay men in Seattle, police said . Accomplice: Jeremy Villagran was also charged in Brandon Tevlin's death . In handcuffs: Ali Muhammad Brown, 29, pleaded not guilty in the Tevlin murder in August . After spending the evening of June 25 . at a friend’s house playing video games, Brendan Tevlin reportedly . texted his mother to say he was heading home, before getting in the . family’s Jeep Liberty between 11.30pm and 12.00am. As he was sitting at a stop light at the corner of Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange, Tevlin was approached by Ali Muhammad Brown and Jeremy Villagran, 19, who allegedly intended to rob the young man. Over an iPhone: Williams lost her life because Fields wanted her iPhone, authorities said . After a brief exchange, police said the two fired 10 rounds into the college student's car, killing him. 'He was, at this time, a simple victim of an intent to rob,' Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn A. Murray said last month. After the shooting, Villagran jumped into a getaway car driven by Andre Fields and fled the scene. Meanwhile, Brown moved Tevlin's . body into the passenger seat and drove the Jeep to an apartment complex, . where he ditched the car, police said. Brown . is also wanted in the double murder of two gay men in Seattle, . according to police. The registered sex offender and vagrant was . arrested July 18, and a gun found in the makeshift tent where he lived . was linked to all three murders, said Murray. The . crime spree that would eventually claim multiple lives started on April . 27 when police discovered the body of Leroy Henderson, 30, laying in . the street in Seattle. Brown was linked to the killing thanks to shell . casings found at the scene. The 29-year-old also has been charged in the murders of two gay men from Seattle, Ahmed Said and Dwone Anderson-Young on June 1. Life cut short: Rev. Brian Needles of the Church of St.Philomena officiated at the sad service. 'Brendan, an amazing gifted young man¿ with so much potential, so much to look forward to, so much to offer this world, never getting a chance, it¿s just not supposed to be like this,' he said . Close: Brendan, here with his younger brothers and sister Allison was the closest of siblings . The 29-year-old suspect is being held on $5million bail at Essex County Jail. Brown could potentially face the death penalty if extradited from New Jersey to Washington state and convicted of the murders. Brown's alleged accomplice Andre Fields has been charged with the killing of Cheyanne Bond, who was gunned down . June 29 after two other men demanded her iPhone. She graduated from . Malcolm X Shabazz High School in Newark only days before her death. She was shot in the head; Bond's friend was wounded but survived.

"Scotland will be plunged into a deeper economic crisis than the 2008 crash if it breaks away from the UK, Danny Alexander warned. The Lib Dem Treasury minister said the devastating financial collapse which took Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink would be 'dwarfed' by the impact of independence. It came amid claims Scotland will lose its £300million-a-year share of the UK's EU rebate if it votes for separation. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander warned the 2008 economic crash would be 'dwarfed' by the impact of independence . With barely 50 days to go until Scots have their say in the independence referendum, warnings about the economic impact have escalated. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said Scotland would face a devastating combination of falling North Sea oil revenues and an ageing population which would imperil the economy. He told The Sun: 'If you're a Scot and you're worried about public expenditure and austerity, if you vote for independence you ain't seen nothing yet. 'The financial pressures that an independent Scotland would face would dwarf what I've had to do in the last four years.' It follows a similar warning earlier his month from former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling who said the risks of Scotland going it alone ‘are colossal’ and there will be no going back. Mr Darling, who was Chancellor in the Labour government when the banking crisis hit in 2008, said the ramifications of independence would be even greater. First Minister Alex Salmond is under growing pressure with barely 50 days to go until the independence referendum . The UK taxpayer spent £66billion bailing out failing banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. ‘Being told the world's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system,’ Mr Darling told The Independent. ‘But the decision on Scotland is forever. It's irrevocable, irreversible. If we get it wrong, it will have a profound effect, not just on Scotland, but the rest of the UK. The stakes in the banking crisis were big; this is so much bigger.’ The economic challenge an independent Scotland would face were laid bare with a fresh warning about its £300million-a-year share of the EU rebate. Professor Carlos Closa of the European University Institute in Florence said Alex Salmond has no right to the UK's hard-won windfall. The First Minister had claimed the rest of the UK and a newly separate Scotland would share the rebate in the event of independence. But Professor Closa has become the latest expert to dismiss the idea. 'There is no right to a rebate. It is just something the UK has negotiated,' he said. Gordon Brown has warned that losing the rebate would cost the Scottish Government £20billion over seven years. An independent Scotland may also have to contribute to the money the UK gets back, which would cost £540million, also over seven years. That would be a major blow to Scotland's finances, with the country £12billion in the red last year - a proportionately higher deficit than the rest of the UK. Despite this, the SNP Government has promised to continue high public spending, which Finance Secretary John Swinney plans to bankroll with £3.6billion of borrowing over two years. There was at least some good news for Mr Salmond, as Professor Closa predicted Scotland would be allowed to rejoin the EU if there was a Yes vote. He admitted other member states - any one of which could block an independent Scotland - were concerned about a domino effect among separatist regions of their own countries. But he expects them to admit Scotland - then close the door to those who try to follow. Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has warned the risks of independence are 'bigger' than the banking crash . Professor Closa said: 'Scotland has a very good position because it is the first one in the line. But there is real fear of a domino effect across Europe, and not just in Spain's Catalonia or Basque Country. 'There are other member states which fear Scottish independence might trigger claims in their own territories. Italy, France and Hungary, for example, have minorities. 'After Scotland, you may expect moves to prevent other member states splitting apart. Even if Scotland gains recognition and becomes a member state, other countries will want to close this option.' A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'Scotland has a huge amount to offer the EU, including almost 60 per cent of its oil reserves and around a quarter of Europe's wave and offshore wind energy potential, which is why we will be in a very strong negotiating position - and why it will be in other countries' interests for Scotland to continue in membership. 'The current EU budget has been agreed until 2020 and prior to then Scotland's share of the UK rebate will be a matter for negotiation between the Scottish and UK Governments. For subsequent budget rounds, an independent Scotland will be in a position to negotiate the best deal for Scotland.' A beleaguered Alex Salmond is failing to convince Scots on separation as the country approaches the last 50 days of campaigning before the referendum, a major study shows. The British Election Study (BES) of about 6,000 Scots - a far higher number than other polls - shows 51 per cent plan to vote No. The Yes campaign is winning over more undecided voters, but not enough to close the gap. The BES also becomes the latest observer to say that Mr Salmond's failure to deliver a credible economic case for separation - with no answers on currency and start-up costs - will cost him. It says the economy is the biggest issue among undecided voters considering a Yes ballot. According to BES, 51 per cent of Scots plan to vote No, 39 per cent Yes, and 10 per cent remain undecided. The BES asked 5,896 people how they intended to vote in February and March, and another 6,182 in May and June. The results show some undecided drifting towards Yes, but not in high enough numbers. The pro-Union Better Together group said it was another encouraging survey showing most Scots want to stay in the UK. But Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: 'Support for Yes is solid and as we move into the final eight weeks of the campaign we will be working hard to continue the flow of undecided voters to our side.'","Lib Dem minister sounds the alarm over impact of Scotland leaving the UK .

"Vice President Joe Biden insisted on Monday that the estimated 11.5 million people living in the U.S. illegally are 'already Americans,' whether or not the U.S. Congress passes a law providing them with a path to citizenship. His comments at a breakfast to mark the beginning of Cinco de Mayo, an unofficial holiday that residents of the Mexican state of Puebla founded to mark their country's unlikely victory over French armed forces in 1862. 'To continue the dreams of all the American people, we have got to get 11 million people out of the shadows,' Biden said. 'It’s not just to benefit those 11 million people; it’s badly needed for the country. The country needs a shot in the arm and this would give it a considerable shot in the arm.' Vice President Joe Biden wound up a crowd of about 100 Hispanic-Americans, mostly advocates for President Obama's flavor of comprehensive immigration reform, during a Cinco de Mayo breakfast at the Naval Observatory near his official residence . Double dipping: Protesters also flooded Oakland, California streets on Thursday with demands for immigration reform on May Day, which is linked in the u.S. to organized labor and illegal immigrant protests . Immigrant rights rallies have hit Capitol Hill, but only Democrats have embraced the idea of an amnesty . Not everyone in America's fast-growing community of Latinos appreciated the speech, however. Latino Rebels, a wildly popular center-left English-language Latino blog, called it 'Hispandering' to likely Democratic voters. The bloggers behind the website run a charitable foundation that aims to fund the entry of more Hispanic filmmakers and journalists into their respective industries, according to NBC Latino. Advocates of President Barack Obama's preferred route to what he calls 'comprehensive immigration reform' generally admit they don't know for sure that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is holding steady at 11.5 million. Official government numbers rely on guesswork to estimate how many knowingly fill out U.S. Census Bureau forms incorrectly. National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers chairman Zack Taylor wrote in an open letter last September that 'the more likely figure is 18-20 million and rising daily.' For Mexican-Americans and illegal . immigrants from South of the border, the fifth of May has become a day . to celebrate Mexican heritage and culture. But Biden used it Monday to call on Congress to green-light President Barack Obama's proposal that would, in the long term, give legal status to the millions who have crept across U.S. borders, jumping in line ahead of millions more who have obeyed immigration laws and waited their turns for legal acceptance. The bill would be an economic boon, he argued, saying its likely effects 'are the exact opposite of what the right has been preaching, what the nativists have been preaching for a long time.' Senate Democrats passed the measure last ear, but House Republicans declared it dead on arrival. Biden also doubled down on comments he made earlier in the year which angered some in the GOP. 'I know I was criticized for saying a couple of months ago in Florida that these 11 million folks in the shadows are already Americans,' he told an audience of about 100, 'and I got pretty roundly criticized for that. But they are Americans. They may not be citizens, but they are Americans.' 'Hispandering'; Biden is a likely contender for the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination, and is working to publicize his bone fides among Latino voters . Obama's second-term agenda includes a total overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, a goal that Republicans in the House of Representatives have resisted . The vice president pointed to America's history as a nation of immigrants, saying that foreigners to emigrate to the U.S. have 'sort of self-selected. The best came. What we’ve gotten over the last 230 years is – we’ve gotten people who already posses in their DNA the sense of courage and optimism and movement.' 'That’s exactly what the hell we are. That’s who we are.' Secretary of Labor Tom Perez was in attendance, along with Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Eduardo Medina-Mora, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Earl Anthony Wayne, and Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez. At least two members of the House of Representatives also attended, but a White House pool reporter noted that Biden publicly acknowledged Rep. Julian Castro, who was not among them. 'We share so much more in common with . Mexico than just a border,' Biden added. 'We share values, a common . history, and I think common dreams.'","The vice president spoke to a Latino audience, marking the kick-off of the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo .

"The boss of a Christian TV network has stepped down from his role because of a ‘moral failure’ in his marriage. Rory Alec said he was handing over the running of God TV, a worldwide network that got its start in Britain, to his wife Wendy. He did not elaborate – but religious figures have quit similar positions in the past after having extramarital affairs. Scroll down for video . GodTV co-founder Rory Alec has stepped down from heading the network he founded with his wife Wendy 20 years ago. She will assume the leadership of the network . Rory Alec (right) says he will step down due to a 'moral failure' in his marriage . Alec and his wife Wendy, who launched God TV from their London home in 1996, have been married for 27 years. In a brief statement, South African-born Alec said: ‘After 20 years of service, I have had a moral failure this year. For this reason, I am stepping down. 'Please forgive me for the disappointment I’ve caused, but I know your eyes are on Jesus who is the author and finisher of your faith and not on me, an imperfect man. ‘It is with a heavy heart that I confirm my season with God TV is over for now.’ Within hours, his name was removed from the list of leaders on God TV’s webpage. Mrs Alec said she would explain the reasons for his departure with ‘transparency and authenticity’ in a broadcast from the network’s main studio in Jerusalem this week. Viewers expressed their support on God TV’s Facebook page. ‘Rory and Wendy we stand with you in prayer for restoration, reconciliation and forgiveness!’ wrote Victoria Webster-West. ‘Rory thank you for stepping down in honesty during this time of God’s dealing with your heart. Wendy all of our love and support. You’ve both done so much to build God’s kingdom and our prayers cover you!’ Linda Ford wrote: ‘So sorry for you both. We are all vulnerable to temptation, but there is forgiveness and restoration? This is my prayer for you both and may you both know the love, comfort and Shalom peace of The Lord Jesus at this very sad and difficult time.’ Another said: ‘God’s Grace covers a multitude of sins – we are made of flesh and we fail but God’s grace heals all.’ God TV can be seen in more than 60 countries and is popular in the US, where it competes with other religious broadcasters. It claims to reach more than 900million people with its mixture of sermons and uplifting stories of people saved by faith. The Alecs feature regularly along with US-based evangelists. Last year, the couple appeared in a show that attempted to exorcise ‘demons’ from President Obama to free him from ‘Jezebel’s clutches’. They were planning to open an office and a prayer revival centre in a former nightclub in Plymouth, Devon. Sources at the network said the revival centre would go ahead despite Alec’s sudden departure. Rory (center) and Wendy (right) Alec's marriage is rocky, but the couple says they will work through it . The couple, who are in their 40s, met as singers on the cabaret circuit in South Africa. Mrs Alec was born in London but grew up in Durban, South Africa, and became a devout Christian after seeing the face of Jesus in a mirror in the lavatory of a nightclub where she was singing. The couple decided to set up a Christian TV channel in Europe after hearing a prophecy that they would do so. They launched God TV with £140,000 in savings and it quickly became popular with US evangelists who paid to appear and gain access to European audiences. The couple still have a home in London but spend much of their time in Jerusalem at God TV’s main studio. One of the first Christian broadcasters in Britain, God TV can be viewed online and on its Sky television channel . Alec is the latest US TV preacher to be involved in scandal. Jim Bakker quit after being caught using prostitutes, while Jimmy Swaggart resigned over an affair.","Rory Alec, who co-founded the network with his wife Wendy, says he's stepping down due to the 'disappointment I've caused'

"Austerity-hit Britain is spending a larger share of its wealth on foreign aid than any other G8 member nation, despite making huge spending cuts at home, a report revealed yesterday. The G8 'accountability' review showed that between 2011 and 2012 several countries decided to rein in their foreign aid budgets. Japan, Italy and the US chose to focus on helping their own citizens, handing out a smaller percentage of their national income than the year before. Italy was even given a 'red light' warning for failing to meet 'internationally agreed targets'. But cash-strapped Britain spent 0.56 per cent of national income on aid against 0.19 per cent in the US and just 0.03 per cent in Russia. Scroll down for video . Aid: Barack Obama has reduced US spending on foreign aid to 0.19 per cent of national income while Britain under David Cameron (right) has increased overseas spending to 0.56 per cent . Cuts: Russia under Vladimir Putin (right) spends only 0.03 per cent of national income on aid while Britain is set to hit 0.7 per cent this year . And we are now on course to spend 0.7 . per cent of our national income on overseas aid by the end of this . financial year, despite dropping a plan to enshrine that commitment in . law. The report, published as David Cameron . hosted the G8 summit in Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, will renew . complaints that Britain's aid commitments make us the 'soft touch' of . the international community. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence . Party, said: 'These figures prove that the Government wishes to . burnish its moral credentials at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. 'Britain's foreign aid budget is . rising while hospital accident and emergency departments, libraries and . other public services are being cut back or closed.' Tory MP for . Shipley, Philip Davies, a longstanding critic of the Government's . foreign aid commitments, said: 'Other countries are making more sensible . decisions about their priorities given the tough economic times we are . in. We are now the mugs of the world. We're spending money we haven't . got. 'They are making sure their spending . across the board is being cut, not just on domestic things. I'm afraid . it proves that our argument that if we do it everyone else will follow . suit is just pure humbug.' Mr Davies also rejected Mr Cameron's . argument that Britain's lead on aid boosted its standing on the world . stage. 'We'd be chairing the G8 whether or not we were giving this . amount of money,' he insisted. 'It is a nonsensical argument. The truth is the Prime Minister made a promise he should not have made. 'He has now boxed himself in but he . should be brave enough to say he made it in good faith but the economic . situation is now so much more tough and more difficult than anyone . anticipated that he has to react.' The UK's aid spending stood at 0.56 . per cent of national income in 2011/12, or £8.55billion, rising to . £8.813billion in 2012/13. But the total is soaring this year to . £11.554billion, or 0.7 per cent of national income, and will go up to . £12.162billion in 2014/15. Shake: Mr Obama and Mr Putin staged a show of unity at a G8 press conference last night, despite deep divisions over how to end the slaughter in Syria . Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's absurd that the UK continues to increase the size . of its aid budget far faster than the rest of the G8 despite the huge . financial pressures at home. 'If the Department for International . Development made better use of its existing budget and cut out lots of . waste and bureaucracy, ministers could achieve even more abroad without . increasing the burden on hard-pressed British families. 'Countries in far better economic . health aren't spending anywhere  near as much of their national income . on overseas aid, so it beggars  belief that our Government is still . hiking the amount of our money it is committing.' However Brendan Cox, from the IF . campaign against global hunger, said: 'UK governments deserve real . credit for delivering aid increases that have helped save millions of . lives. 'But with one in eight people in the . world going hungry it is high time that other countries also stepped up . to the mark and provided the cash they have promised.' Last week, Mr Cameron attempted to . justify Britain's aid spending, insisting: 'National interest is not . just about standing up for yourself but standing up for what's right. 'When a country like Somalia fractures . and breaks, that affects us, not just in the terrorism threatened on . our streets, or the flows of mass immigration but in the piracy off the . Horn of Africa that affects British trade. 'When there is instability in the Gulf it affects us too – because 100,000 British citizens live there. 'On the other hand, as nations develop . and as their middle class grows – that presents huge opportunities for . an exporter like Britain. 'We made the decision to protect the . aid budget because I believe this commitment is in Britain's long-term . interests. Yes, this is a moral issue, but it is an economic one too.'","Between 2011 and 2012 several countries reined in foreign aid budgets .

"He's already been married twice. But that didn't stop Bill Murray from giving relationship advice after crashing a bachelor's party in Charleston, South Carolina. The 63-year-old offered some words of wisdom to the groom and his friends at a steakhouse over Memorial Day weekend, captured on a video obtained by Deadspin. Scroll down for video... Cheeky: He starts off my asking the men, who hail from Boston College, whether they approve of their friend's bride-to-be . Sage advice: Bill Murray imparted some words of wisdom after crashing a bachelor's party over Memorial Day weekend in Charleston, South Carolina . According to the website's Concourse blog, one of the groom's friends spotted Murray sitting downstairs. They asked the waiter to send the actor free drinks, but Murray declined. One of the friends then went up to Murray and asked if he would say a few words to the groom, whose name was EJ. Murray initially said no, but much to the mens' delight, the star emerged and proceeded to dispense with some marriage advice. Nice surprise! The partygoers seemed giddy with excitement at having the famous actor crash their party . He starts off by asking the men, who hail from Boston College, whether they approve of their friend's bride-to-be. 'What do you think, thumbs up on her or not?' he asks, to which the friends laugh and answer yes. Murray then goes on to give some sage advice, seemingly off-the-cuff. Good advice! Murray suggests you take your love on a trip around the world before deciding if they're the one . Having fun: Murray playfully put his head in his hands at one point while the men cheered . 'You know how funerals are not for the dead, they're for the living? Bachelor parties are not for the groom, they're for the uncommitted,' he told the unmarried men. He then explained how to figure out if the person you're with is right for you. 'If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just sort of think in your ordinary mind, ""Okay, let's pick a date. Let's plan this and make a party and get married,""' he said. 'Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if when you come back to JFK, when you land in JFK, and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.' He then picked up the groom and hoisted him over his shoulder while the men cheered. An auspicious beginning! Murray spoke directly to EJ, the groom, before hoisting him over his shoulder . Good luck: Bill Murray lifts EJ Rumpke up in the air at the end of his impromptu speech at his bachelor party over the Memorial Day weekend . Murray has been married twice previously, first to Margaret Kelly, from 1981 to 1996, and then to Jennifer Butler, whom he divorced in 2008 after 11 years of marriage. Prior to their split, Butler accused Murray of physical abuse, alcohol addiction and infidelity. She said she felt forced to move the couple's four sons to a new home as a result of his various issues. Still searching: Murray has been married twice, pictured with his second wife Jennifer Butler, whom he divorced in 2008 . Bill Murray is legendary for his unusual and creative interactions with the public. So much so that they have become modern day urban myths. Each story usually ends with the Hollywood actor telling his flumoxed fans 'No one will ever believe you'. Indeed, so prevalent have Bill Murray stories become that a website has been created to collect them all. 1 - Bill Seybot recounts one story when he left his laptop open at a Starbucks while he left to get a drink. When he returned, Billy Murray was sitting in front of the screen, using the computer. Stunned, Seybot says that he simply let Murray continue whatever it was he was doing before standing up, saying, 'No one will ever believe you' and walked off . 2 - On another occasion a group of friends were in New York City karaoke bar, One 7, when in walked Bill Murray with a female friend. They invited the Ghostbusters actor into their booth, but he politely declined. Fifteen minutes later he walked in and bought drinks for everyone and proceeded to sing an Elvis song and then just as promptly as he arrived, left. 3 - In 2010, Bill Mrray was at Austin's SXSW festival with members of the Wu-Tang clan. He arrived at the city's Shangri-La bar and insisted on bartending. However no matter what they order he would only pour them tequila and lots of it. 4 - In 2006, Bill Murray was in St. Andrews, Scotland, for a golf tournament when he went out drinking. He bumped into Swedish student Lykke Stavnef, who invited him to a party. However, instead of dancing away the night, Murray decided to clean up all the student apartment's entire dirty plates. 5 - One New Yorker claims that he and his little brother were in Little Italy in the Bronx when they noticed Bill Murray in the same restaurant as them. He was eating pasta and had a bag of unopened chips next to him. One of the brothers was aware of Murray's unusual reputation for strange behavior so walked up to him, opened his chips, began to eat them and said, 'No one will ever believe you!' and walked away. Murray broke into raucous laughter and walked over to the men and gave them both a big hug.","Bill Murray was in a Charleston, South Carolina steakhouse at the same time as a groom-to-be's bachelor party .

"A Florida woman who became famous for her uncontrollable hiccupping has been found guilty of first-degree murder. A . Pinellas County jury deliberated four hours Friday night before . delivering the guilty verdict against 22-year-old Jennifer Mee. Mee . wept in the courtroom as the verdict was read. Scroll down for videos . Trial: Defendant Jennifer Mee, pictured on Wednesday, reacts to testimony during her murder trial after she was deemed fit to stand . Hiccups: Mee, 22, found fame in 2007 as a teen because of her uncontrollable hiccupping . Mee, 22, lured Wall-Mart . worker Shannon Griffin to an abandoned home under the pretense of . selling him marijuana in October of 2010. Once there, two of Mee's . friends robbed him at gunpoint - but the victim struggled and was shot . four times. Mee, who . found international fame in 2007 after developing a case of hiccups that . lasted for five straight weeks, was charged with first-degree murder despite not pulling the trigger. She denies the charge. Under . Florida law, someone who participates in a robbery that leads to a . death can still be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility . of parole. Earlier this week, the court heard a recording of the phone conversation she had with her mother hours after her arrest. 'I didn't kill nobody,' Mee said. '…I . set everything up. It all went wrong, Mom. It [expletive] just went . downhill after everything happened, Mom.' On Wednesday, Mee's attorney told the . court her client was a schizophrenic. The judge then ordered Mee to . undergo psychological evaluation. It was later determined Mee is . competent to stand trial. Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo admitted Mee wasn't the one who aimed the gun at Shannon Griffin in his opening address, but he said she was still guilty of first-degree murder because 'she set everything up.' He told the jury the then-19-year-old used a social networking site through a cell phone to contact Griffin and offer to sell him marijuana but it was all a con. 'There was, in fact, no marijuana to be sold. In fact, instead of marijuana they had a loaded .38-special handgun with six shots in it,' LaBruzzo said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He explained that the two men she lived with robbed the 22-year-old Griffin before they struggled over the gun and 'shot him... four times in the chest and they left him for death in a dark alleyway.' The victim's wallet, keys were later found at Mee's apartment and her fingerprints were discovered on Griffin's driver's license, LaBruzzo said. Mee's lawyer, John Trevena, used his opening statements to claim that Mee wasn't even at the home when Griffin was fatally shot. Crime scene: Kurt Bradshaw, St. Petersburg Police officer, shows the jury a photograph of the crime scene during Jennifer Mee trial on Wednesday, September 18, 2013 . 'She is not at that scene but they want you to convict her of murder in the first-degree based on their theory that Ms Mee was setting up a marijuana deal that somehow went bad,' he told the jurors. Trevena suggested Mee couldn't have been behind the disturbing plot because she didn't even own a cell phone, and therefore couldn't have planned the drug deal with the young man. Also on Wednesday, Kurt Bradshaw, an officer with the St. Petersburg Police Department, showed the jury a photograph of the crime scene. A handgun and a pair of shoes can be seen on a sidewalk near a white fence. The jury was selected on Tuesday in the murder trial of the woman who appeared on several national television programs as a teen because of her out-of-control hiccuping. Judge Nancy Moate Ley told potential jurors in a Pinellas County courtroom that the trial would probably wrap up by the end of the week. Miss Mee is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Walmart employee Shannon Griffin Jr during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg. Back in court: Jennifer Mee holds her head after she looked at family members, as jury selection begins her murder trial Tuesday . Defense: Mee talks with her attorney Bryant Camareno at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater, Fla. Bleak prospects: Mee, 22, faces a life in prison if convicted in the 2010 murder of a Walmart employee . Relapse: Mee's lawyer said she has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine . Judge Moate Ley said in court Tuesday . that the prosecution and defense will have to choose a dozen jurors from . a pool of about 70, The Tampa Tribune reported. Two prospective members of the panel were excused . after explaining that they would not be able to be impartial. Two . other would-be jurors were also dismissed: one of them because Judge . Moate Ley had presided over her husband's divorce case, and the other . because she had to take care of her ailing mother. The . case has attracted widespread attention because Mee had gained . notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop. Videos . of her hiccuping up to 50 times a minute gained her national attention, . as did her attempts to quell the problem. She tried home remedies and . consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, until . the hiccups finally stopped on their own. Just over two weeks ago, Mee's . co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after . being convicted of first-degree murder. Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence. At . issue is whether Mee was a bystander or the person who planned the . robbery — prosecutors say she played an active role in planning the . robbery, which lead to Griffin's death. Under . Florida law, a person can be convicted of murder if he or she committed . a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a . result. Trevena, . Mee's attorney, said his client suffered from Tourette's Syndrome, a . neurological disorder that can cause involuntary movements and speech . problems. Charged: Jennifer Mee, 22, is accused of luring Shannon Griffin (right) into a robbery in 2010, which ended in him being shot dead . Co-defendants: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30 . He said that the hiccups were one symptom of Tourette's and said Tuesday that he will mention that during the trial. 'It . won't be used as a direct cause for what occurred but it might help . explain her errors in judgment and her often thoughtless response to law . enforcement,' said Trevena, who said Mee did not participate in . the robbery. Trevena said Mee has been in jail pending trial since her October 2010 arrest — much of that time in isolation because detention deputies say she is a high profile inmate. Mee has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, said Trevena, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine. 'It controls the hiccups,' he said. During a tearful prison interview on . the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame . for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad . company. In the spotlight: Jennifer Mee first appeared on television as 'hiccup girl' when she was 15 (left), and she was even invited on the Today show (right) When . Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began . hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and . earned her international publicity. Three . years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with . first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to . lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery. Mee . is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can . be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which . then leads to someone's death. She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged. Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to . think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind . bars. Fifteen minutes of fame: Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop . Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed . She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My . sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me' The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day. Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, . Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder. She is . accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to . a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50. Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past. But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death. Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing . Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company . Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup . girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made . her go off the rails. Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students. She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a . chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just . stopped on their own a few weeks later. Her lawyer, Trevena, said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'","Jennifer Mee, 22, has been found guilty in the 2010 murder of Shannon Griffin .

"Officers at a police station in New Mexico believe they are dealing with more than just criminals.

"Metallic temporary tattoos have been summer's biggest new beauty hit. From clubbers hitting the coolest bars in Ibiza to teen festival-goers at Glastonbury. Even Beyonce chose to sport the fade-away accessories while posing on her European superyacht. And according to Paris Fashion Week, the temporary trend is here to stay. Models at the Dries Van Noten SS15 show were painted with gold lip rings in Paris . The minimal, metallic make-up was inspired by the famous Burning Man festival . Finally, a catwalk trend we can all afford! On Wednesday, models at Dries Van Noten SS15 in the Grand Palais sported painted-on gold lip rings with the same metallic foil effect as the other popular tattoo jewellery seen this summer. Makeup artist Peter Philips told Vogue.com the gold line down each model's lower lip 'could be a piercing… it could even look like the shine from a lip gloss.' He used an eyeshadow brush to draw a line with MAC Mixing Medium and Ben Nye Gold Powder, and retraced the line with Make Up For Ever's Aqua Liner (in #1). He continued: 'Dries was thinking of the kind of girl who goes to Burning Man. She's not a hippie, but she loves nature - and she's also a bit high-tech.' VIDEO Scroll down to see Kim Kardashian's revealing Paris fashion week outfit . At Anthony Vaccarello, the vibe was more techno/rock, leading the trend away from the hippie look the jewellery has previously been associated with. Models' earlobes were painted in a lacquered patent black, adding a gothic edge to the Spring/Summer 2015 ready-to-wear presentation on Tuesday. The show's make-up artist Tom Pecheux said Anthony 'came up with the idea to create a piece of jewellery using makeup. 'I thought, perhaps we don’t do an earring, but a black tattoo - something that felt very graphic, because the collection is graphic,' the artist told Allure. He drew rigid shapes on each ear lobe with a felt-tip eyeliner pen, before using Homeoplasmine to apply iridescent black glitter. At the Anthony Vaccarello show models' earlobes were painted in a lacquered patent black . Fashion fans wanting to get this look now should invest in a Sharpie, or one of the packs of Temporary tattoos from Divine Ink London, Seekers of Sun, Flash Tattoos or Rosie Wonders. These stencils mimic jewellery and take just 10 minutes to set after being applied with water. They then wear off gradually after a few days. Dior designed a £100 limited-edition set of temporary tattoo cuffs, earrings, chokers and bracelets made of 24-carat gold in 2012. A set from our favourite high street brand Divine Ink London comes in a little cheaper at £15 per pack. The tattoo-as-jewellery trend really took off at the beginning of summer. Alessandra Ambrosio and Aerin Lauder were the first celebrities to be spotted in them, and this month Beyonce, 33, showed off an impressive collection of temporary gold and silver body art while on a yacht around Europe. The star has sported various iterations of the tattoos while on holiday including belly chains, necklaces, bracelets; and even obscure designs such as peacock feathers on her hip and stencils on her shoulders and shins. Beyonce, 33, showed off temporary gold and silver body art while holidaying on a yacht in Europe . She has worn more obscure designs too, such as peacock feathers on her hip and stencils on her shoulders . Fashion blogger Mademoiselle Robot is a fan, she says: 'I first found out about the trend for metallic tattoos through Instagram (which is possibly where all things pretty can be discovered). 'A friend of mine who is a make-up artist in Los Angeles had used them on a shoot. After a quick investigation (read: increasingly harrassing comments to my friend), I was in possession of my very own metallic tattoos. 'I love them because they are the perfect complement to tanned skin - long live this Indian Summer - and they are also the lazy girl's best companion when it comes to accessorising. How could you say no to a built-in gaggle of bangles? 'You can be as conservative or as creative as you want with the placement of your tattoos as well. I wear mine instead of jewellery, but I have seen some girls proudly sporting theirs in lieu of make-up at festivals and other dance parties in abandoned buildings...' Fashion blogger Mademoiselle Robot was inspired by a make-up artist friend in LA . Celebrity make-up artist Nikki Wolff says: 'This new trend is fun and original and can definitely be translated onto the high street. 'Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend colouring in your earlobes with eyeliner to go into the office, replacing your usual eyeliner with a metallic one, or pressing a little fine gold glitter into the centre of your lips over a gloss or balm is a quick, simple way to wear this trend with minimal effort. Celebrity make-up artist Nikki Wolff recommends using Mac Reflects glitter to recreate a wearable effect . 'Mac's Reflects Gold Glitter (£17) is perfect for this look. 'Keep it under done and not too perfect... if your gold eyeliner smudges, or glitter falls onto your cheekbones, all the better!'

"It appears that the job of motivating children to work harder and calm down was as much part of a teacher’s role in Ancient Egypt as it is today. A 1,700-year-old classroom complete with motivational quotations written on its walls by educators has been discovered in Egypt and dates to a time when the Romans controlled the area. The building is the first to be found that is definitely a schoolroom and features Greek writings on its walls, including a calming quotation from Homer’s ‘The Odyssey’. Archaeologists have discovered a 1,700-year-old school with Greek writings on its walls (pictured) in the ancient town of Trimithis, Egypt. It is thought the teacher wrote it very carefully in Greek for pupils to copy . Text on the wall includes quotations from The Odyssey, which tells a take of ancient drug use, when Helen of Troy gives her dinner guests a drug which ‘takes away grief and anger and brings forgetfulness of every ill.’ ‘Whoever should drink this down when it is mixed in the bowl would not let fall a tear down his cheek in the course of that day at least. Imitate,' it says - urging pupils to copy it down. Another text written by a teacher was found in a different classroom encouraging pupils to work hard and to improve their rhetorical skills to a god-like level. A quotation says: ‘Be bold, my boys; the great god [Hermes] will grant you to have a beautiful crown of manifold virtue’ while another reads: ‘Work hard for me, toils make men manly’. It bears a striking resemblance to more modern classrooms as there are benches for students to sit on and lessons written on walls in Greek, which was widely spoken, Live Science reported. The building is located in Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis, some 200 miles (322km) west of the Nile, which was once the ancient time of Trimithis. Text on the wall includes quotations from The Odyssey, which tells a tale of ancient drug use, when Helen of Troy gives her dinner guests a drug which ‘takes away grief and anger and brings forgetfulness of every ill.’ The building is the first to be found that is definitely a schoolroom from the era and features Greek writings on its walls, including a calming quotation from Homer's 'The Odyssey' The building is located in Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis, some 200 miles (322km) west of the Nile, which was the ancient town of Trimithis (marked) ‘Whoever should drink this down when it . is mixed in the bowl would not let fall a tear down his cheek in the . course of that day at least. Imitate,’ the painted script says. The word ‘imitate’ is thought to indicate that the children should copy the passage and ancient records say that the passage from the famous text has magical calming qualities to it – which could have come handy in the classroom. Another text written by a teacher was found in a different classroom encouraging pupils to work hard and to improve their rhetorical skills to a god-like level. It is thought that the school was only open for 20 years, before the room was amalgamated into a large house that belonged to a town councilor called Serenos and transformed with images of Greek gods (pictured) A quotation says: ‘Be bold, my boys; . the great god [Hermes] will grant you to have a beautiful crown of . manifold virtue’ while another reads: ‘Work hard for me, toils make men . manly’.

The school was discovered in 1979 but it was not until 2001 that archaeologists unearthed the writing (pictured) to confirm the building's purpose . The building is unique as it is the only one from the era that was definitely used for educating children, Raffaella Cribiore, a professor at New York University explained in the journal Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik. Schools were often part of houses for wealthy children in ancient times and are notoriously difficult for experts to identify, but the inscriptions inside the classroom make the Amheida building a one-off. He wrote that the texts are ‘further proof that teaching and learning took place there, and confirm that they belong to the only building so far discovered from antiquity that was certainly a school and showed educational activities.' It is thought that the school was only open for 20 years, before the room was amalgamated into a large house that belonged to a town councillor called Serenos and transformed with images of Greek gods. Researchers think the closure of the school might have occurred when the teacher either moved away of died. Susanna McFadden, an author and professor at Fordham University said archaeologists have recently discovered paintings of a banquet scene and flutist as well as geometric motifs covering ‘almost every surface’ so that a person entering the room 1,700 years ago must have been completely overwhelmed. It is thought that the writings of the past teacher were preserved by the family as a sign of their cultural sophistication or that they approved of the motivational messages.","The building is located in Amheida in the .

"An American climber has told how he was convinced he was going to die after tumbling some 70 feet into an icy crevasse on a Himalayan mountain with no hope of rescue. Professor John All, 44, a professor of geography and environmental studies at Western Kentucky University, suffered several broken ribs and a fractured arm in the accident - and pleaded to be rescued on a desperate Facebook post. Writing on the American Climber Science Program page, he said: 'Please call Global Rescue. John broken arm, ribs, internal bleeding. Fell 70 ft crevasse. Climbed out. Himlung camp 2. Please hurry.' Scroll down for video . Inside view: A badly bruised All recorded a video from inside the icy crevasse . Misstep: Dr All fell through this small hole in the ice seen from inside the crevasse .

Lived to tell the tale: Western Kentucky University professor John All was rescued Tuesday after falling into a . crevasse on a Himalayan mountain in Nepal . Plan B: All was planning to scale Mount Everest for a second time, but had to change his plans after last month's death of 16 Sherpa guides . It had taken him six hours to crawl out of the . hole and another three hours to reach his tent. He spent the night in . pain before rescuers reached him the next morning, he said in an . interview in a Katmandu hotel where he is recovering. After his initial plea for help on Facebook, All posted further status updates as the ordeal unfolded. Another message said: 'GR can't find a helicopter so I'll try to survive tonight. I crawled back to tent. Unless the bleeding inside gets me, I should live.' Plea: Professor John All asked for help through a Facebook message . Desperate: Prof All reveals that he's in a precarious state . Agony: All tells of the severe pain that he's in . Nepalese officials say that three climbers are now presumed dead after being caught in an avalanche on the slopes of Mount Kanchenjunga, the world's third tallest peak. Police official Meghraj Kadel says rescuers found no trace of an Indian climber and her two Nepalese Sherpa guides after they were hit by the avalanche at 7,300 meters (23,940 feet) on Wednesday. The Indian was identified as 35-year-old Chanda Gayen, and her guides Temba and Dawa Wanju. They scaled Kanchenjunga on Sunday and were attempting to climb Yalung Kang, a sister peak. In April, an avalanche hit a trail on Mount Everest, killing 16 Sherpa guides in the mountain's worst disaster that led to the cancellation of the climbing season because many Sherpa guides refused work. Friend Wendy DeCroix replied: 'We are sending healing thoughts your way, John! Let us know if we can do anything on our end.' Just before he was rescued, he wrote: 'Bleeding inside feels better but so cold. Pain meds running low. Longest night ever.' All and his research team had moved to Mount Himlung in north central Nepal because the Mount Everest area was closed last month after the death of 16 Sherpa guides in an avalanche. One of those Sherpa guides was from All's team. They were planning to climb Mount Lhotse, a sister peak of Everest. Climbers attempting to scale both the peaks share much of the route. 'I thought I was going to die, there was no way out. I was alone,' a bruised and bandaged All said describing his first thoughts after falling into the crevasse Monday. 'I landed on an ice ledge probably 3 feet wide which saved me from falling further into the crevasse.' He broke five ribs and an arm, dislocated his shoulders, suffered internal bleeding and bruised his face and knees. All shared a brief video on his Facebook page, which he recorded while being stranded in the crevasse. Environmentalists: All's group were collecting . ice and snow samples to study the level of pollution and rate of . glaciers melting . The footage shows the 44-year-old climber with a bloody nose stuck in a narrow hole with snow and ice all around him. He narrates that he was lucky to land on a ledge. 'How the f*** do I get back up there though?' he wonders out loud with the camera pointing to the mouth of the crevasse 70 feet above him. All crawled out of the hole using his ice axe but because of his broken ribs and right arm he could only move very slowly. His teammates were in lower camps and would take two days to get to him. Once he got out of the crevasse, All did not have a radio to call for help so he struggled his way back to the tent and barely made it inside. His Facebook pleas for help were sent using a satellite messenger. A helicopter rescue team was eventually dispatched. Adventurer: Dr All is pictured in full gear at a Mount Everest base camp four years ago . Lucky to be alive: All suffered five broken ribs and an arm, and dislocated his shoulder . Well-prepared: Despite his injuries, the 44-year-old was able to crawl to his tent and spend a frigid night there all alone until help arrived . Undeterred: All plans to take a two-week break to recuperate before continuing on to Peru . 'Because of bad weather the helicopter could not reach me on that day, so I knew I had to spend the night by myself,' he said adding the he spent hours bleeding and shivering. He suffered from frostbitten fingers. The rescue helicopter landed in a flat area near the camp at the altitude of some 19,600 feet Tuesday. The pilot and another rescuer dragged the 240-pounds, 6-feet 5-inches-tall All to the helicopter on a sleeping pad and flew him to a hospital in Katmandu where he spent the night in intensive care. He said he checked out from the ICU the next day despite protest from doctors who wanted to keep him for a week. Survivor: The 44-year-old alpinist managed to crawl to his tent for nine hours despite his extensive injuries . In a status update Wednesday, All thanked the members of his team who helped him make it out of the icy hole alive. Looking back on his ordeal, the 44-year-old climber said that having a dislocated shoulder for 32 hours was the worst part. The geography researcher and alpinist from Bowling Green, Kentucky, plans to stay at his hotel in Katmandu for a couple of weeks to recover before heading to Peru next month for another climbing trip.

"Joseph Wilcox, 31, was shot dead by white supremacist couple Jerad and Amanda Miller on Sunday after he confronted them in a Las Vegas mall . The civilian shot dead by a white supremacist couple on Sunday after he confronted them in a Las Vegas mall has been hailed a hero for his fearless bravery in attempting to protect others. Joseph Wilcox, 31, was shopping in Wal-Mart when Jerad Miller and his wife Amanda Miller entered. The couple had just killed two police officers and in the store, Jerad Miller fired one round and told everyone to get out. Wilcox, who was legally carrying a concealed weapon, told his friends he was going to confront the gunman - not realizing that he had an accomplice. Wilcox went from the checkout area to Jerad Miller and pulled his concealed firearm. But before he could fire, Amanda Miller shot him in the ribs and Wilcox collapsed. ‘Joseph died attempting to protect others. His death is completely senseless,’ said Sheriff Doug Gillespie. 'He had no idea the wife was walking behind him,' a police official told the Las Vegas Review Journal. 'This guy (Wilcox) was not some idiot with a gun. To me, he was a hero. He was trying to stop an active shooter.' At the time of his death, Wilcox was unemployed. Ironically, he had applied to the Metropolitan Police Department a few years earlier, but hadn’t been accepted. Police have confirmed that Wilcox was not able to get off a shot before he died. Amanda and Jerad Miller ran into a North Las Vegas pizzeria on Sunday morning and shot dead two police officers, before then killing Joseph Wilcox . Jeremy Tanner, a friend, was with Wilcox at the Walmart before the shooting started. ‘Joseph . had the option to go left and exit the store to safety, but he instead . went into the store and chased after the gunman,’ he told CNN. ‘I wanted . to tell him: “Don't do this. Come with me.” But I also felt that he's . possibly going to be saving some lives.’ Wilcox's sister, CJ Foster, said her brother was pro-gun and believed that people kill people, rather than guns. ‘He did a very brave thing and I'm very proud of him. I'm proud to call him my brother,’ she said. His uncle, John Wilson, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that, 'He wasn’t political. But he definitely believed in the right to bear arms and the right to defend yourself and others.' A poster with the images of the police officers - Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo - that were killed is shown at a memorial at CiCi's Pizza during a vigil outside the restaurant on June 9, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada . On Sunday, the two Las Vegas police officers were having lunch at a pizza buffet in an aging strip mall about five miles northeast of the Las Vegas Strip when the Millers fatally shot them. The attack at a CiCi's Pizza killed officers Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, both of whom were husbands and fathers. Jerad Miller fatally shot Soldo in the back of his head. As his partner tried to react, Miller shot him once in the throat. Amanda Miller then pulled her own gun and both shot Beck several times. Police believe that while the Millers wanted to target police, the choice of Soldo and Beck was random. Pulling the mortally wounded officers from the booth, they took their guns and ammunition and put a yellow Gadsden flag featuring the phrase ""Don't tread on me"" and a swastika on Beck's body. The flag, with its roots in the American Revolution, is a symbol for anti-government groups. Cheri Rasmussen cries while looking at a makeshift memorial at CiCi's Pizza  created to honor two Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officers who were killed . Police said they believe the swastika . was intended to paint police as Nazis, not necessarily as an expression . of the Millers' own white-supremacist views. The couple also told restaurant patrons that their act was 'the beginning of the revolution,' the same message as a note they left at the restaurant. The couple went next to a Wal-Mart about a block away, where Jerad Miller entered, fired one round and 'told the people to get out and this was a revolution and that the police were on the way.' In the frenzy, shopper Joseph Wilcox decided to confront Jerad Miller - not realizing that Amanda Miller was his accomplice. But before he could fire, she had shot him in the ribs. By now, police had arrived, and two five-officer teams entered the massive store. Near the back, one team confronted the Millers, and exchanged fire. Eerie: One of the many bizarre pictures the couple posted online . At one point, Jerad Miller tried to . blast a rear emergency exit door open with a shotgun, but police had . blocked it with a car and he could not escape. By looking at the store's surveillance camera feeds, an officer saw that Jerad Miller had built a makeshift barricade around his wife. As police closed in, Amanda Miller shot her husband several times with a handgun, killing him. She then shot herself in the head. When officers arrived, she was still breathing, and was taken to the hospital. She later died. Police found hundreds more rounds of unspent ammunition in the Millers' bags.

"Banking giants must be broken up to drive down the cost of mortgages and loans for customers, a leading think tank said today. Separating high street banking from high-risk investment arms would increase competition and make it easier for people to get a better deal, the Institute for Public Policy Research. The Don't Bank On It report warned customers are paying huge fees and charges because a handful of big name banks dominate and impose charges on customers to maximise pay and bonuses. Call for change: The report by the IPPR argued competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market . Global banks have become too . ‘detached’, focussing on maximising salaries and bonuses even if it . meant ripping off customers, the report said. In future banking bosses could be . personally fined if things go wrong. Senior management should suffer the . internal equivalent of bankruptcy’, which would mean they lose their . jobs and any deferred bonuses and pension rights. Ministers are also accused of being ‘too timid’ in taking on the City to split retail and investment banking. It is argued that if the risky . investment banking was hived off, no bank would be ‘too big to fail’ and . the taxpayer would not be forced to step in to rescue an institution . which got into trouble. Competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market, the report argued. ‘Given the culture of the financial . sector is unlikely to change without external influence, retail and . investment banking activities should be split into separate . institutions.’ Retail banks would offer a ‘relatively . simple process’ with policymakers would be to ‘facilitate a high degree . of  competition’ to get the best deal for customers, both savers and . those looking for a loan. ‘Investment banking would be far more . complex in nature and would require much stricter regulation designed to . control risk-taking and minimise the risk of another financial crisis. This could include making senior managers and directors financially . responsible when things go wrong.’ The IPPR warned that ‘detachment from customers’ was to blame for several banking scandals. ‘Multiple evidence of mis-selling, the . Libor scandal and the anecdotal evidence that large investment banks . such as Goldman Sachs exist primarily to maximise the salaries, bonuses . and share options of their staff rather than to deliver the best . possible service to their customers  are all signs that the culture of . finance has changed for the worse.’ Tony Dolphin, chief economist at IPPR, . said: ‘The Government is making some progress on tackling the implicit . subsidies the rest of the economy provides for the financial sector and . on reducing future liabilities for UK taxpayers in the event of a . financial crisis. ‘It has also taken steps to better . protect stakeholders, such as depositors, borrowers, investors and . shareholders. But more action is needed in both areas.’ The report also suggested that . policymakers might have to look at putting greater curbs on mortgage . lending to lessen the chances of any return to potentially risky . lending. This could involve setting maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios on mortgages, the left-of-centre think-tank said. The report said the Bank of England . should be particularly concerned about any institution that records a . sharp increase in its share of the mortgage market. Last month, the Parliamentary . Commission on Banking Standards, set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging . scandal, said that plans included in the Banking Reform Bill ‘fall well . short of what is required’. The commission's report warned the ring-fence to separate risky operations from savers' deposits needed ‘electrification’.","IPPR says banking giants became too detached from customers and took risks to maximise pay and bonuses .

"The Chinese government has revealed for the first time that it has nuclear submarines capable of attacking cities throughout the United States. Last week, state-run Chinese news agencies - such as China Central TV, the People’s Daily, the Global Times, the PLA Daily, the China Youth Daily and the Guangmin Daily - ran identical reports about the 'awesomeness' of the People's Liberation Army's submarine force. 'This is the first time in 42 years since the establishment of our . navy’s strategic submarine force that we reveal on such a large scale . the secrets of our first-generation underwater nuclear force,' the . Global Times said in a lengthy article titled 'China for the First Time . Possesses Effective Underwater Nuclear Deterrence against the United . States.' Deterrent: China's state-run media has reported that it now has subs capable of launching nuclear weapons at the United States . Chinese news agencies also reported on the Army's lethal intentions should it ever use the nuclear weapons the submarines are capable of launching. 'Because the Midwest states of the U.S. are sparsely populated, in order . to increase the lethality, [our] nuclear attacks should mainly target . the key cities on the West Coast of the United States, such as Seattle, . Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego,' the Global Times said. 'The . 12 JL-2 nuclear warheads carried by one single Type 094 SSBN can kill . and wound 5 million to 12 million Americans. But West Coast cities aren't the only metropolitan areas in the U.S. that face the threat of a nuclear attack from the Chinese, according to the country's state-run media. Patrol: The Chinese media says that the country's submarine fleet currently is on routine patrol . 'If we launch our DF 31A ICBMs over the North Pole, we can easily . destroy a whole list of metropolises on the East Coast and the New . England region of the U.S., including Annapolis, Philadelphia, New York, .

"White House staff are tip-toeing around revelations that the French president has a mistress as they face the awkward question of just who will be his plus one at a state dinner next month. Francois Hollande, 59, faced the world's media for the first time on Tuesday after it was reported that he had been sneaking to a Paris apartment to meet up with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet - unbeknown to his partner and France's de facto first lady Valerie Trierweiler. When asked if Trierweiler was still the first lady of France, the President dodged the question earlier this week, saying: 'This is neither the time nor the place.' Scroll down for video . French President Francois Hollande  pictured outside the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday. The White House is unsure of who he is bringing to a state dinner next month - his girlfriend or alleged mistress . President Obama speaks alongside French President Francois Hollande  at the G8 Summit at Camp David in 2012. Questions have been raised over who the French president might be bringing to dinner in DC next month after news of an affair broke . Mr . Hollande, who allegedly has been sneaking off on a scooter for trysts with Ms . Gayet in a flat 150 yards from the Elysee, said that he would make his mind up about who his first lady was . by February 11. This is the date that he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Obama and First Lady Michelle.  The White House invitation was addressed to 'President Hollande and Valérie Trierweiler'. The Obama administration sidestepped all questions on the dinner, directing queries to the French government. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Embassy of France in Washington today. However earlier statements from French officials suggested that they were also bewildered as to who Mr Hollande would bring as his White House dinner date. Despite the diplomatic headache that is causes with regards protocol, White House spokesman Jay . Carney has said: 'The president looks forward to seeing President . Hollande for the state visit in February. 'On issues of the delegation . that the French come with, I would refer you to the French government.' First Lady Michelle Obama poses with Valerie Trierweiler, domestic partner of Francois Hollande in September last year. Ms Trierweiler is treated as the de facto first lady of France . In . words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr . Hollande even confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official . status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down by whoever . was confirmed as first lady. Democrat Representative Gerald Connolly, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs panel told thehill.com: 'Quel dommage...What a problem to have.' Ms . Trierweiler, meanwhile, remains in a central Paris hospital after she . had a 'nervous breakdown' finding out about Mr Hollande's cheating. President . Hollande is not thought to have even visited Ms Trierweiler at the . Petite Salpetriere hospital since she checked in last Friday. Ms .

In it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more . than a year ago' that she has found an 'older man, very different from . earlier boyfriends, who is in politics.' This raises the prospect . that Mr Hollande started the affair within a few months of being sworn . in as French president in May 2012.

Mr Sarkozy told Le Canard Enchaîné he had dealt with his relationship with Carla Bruni much better. 'He's got himself into a right old pickle,' He said. 'While everyone has the right to a private life, when one is a public figure and president, one must be careful to avoid being ridiculous.' Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, was also quoted in the Times as saying Hollande acted like a 'retarded adolescent' when presented with pictures of the president on the scooter.

"A campaign has been launched to ban Sir Tom Jones' hit Delilah from being sung at Welsh rugby matches over claims it 'glorifies domestic violence'. Senior politician Dafydd Iwan, 71, is leading a protest to ban the iconic ballad being sung by choirs at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, because he claims it depicts a brutal revenge killing of a woman. The campaign over the song, which has become an unofficial anthem for Welsh rugby fans, comes more than 40 years after it was first recorded by Sir Tom. Scroll down for video . Delilah has become an unofficial anthem for Welsh rugby fans and Sir Tom Jones has even sung it to the crowds at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. However, a campaign to ban it has now been launched . Senior politician Dafydd Iwan, 71, is leading a protest to ban the iconic ballad being sung by choirs at the Millennium Stadium (pictured) because he claims the song depicts a brutal revenge killing of a woman . Bosses at the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) have defended the hit by comparing its dark subject matter to the best of Shakespeare's works like Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet and Coriolanus. A spokesman said: 'Within rugby, Delilah has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics. 'There is however plenty of precedent in art and literature, prominently in Shakespearean tragedies for instance, for negative aspects of life to be portrayed.' Mr Iwan, the former president of nationalist party Plaid Cymru and a renowned folk singer, said the song had become 'a secondary national anthem' sung by choirs before Welsh games. However, he said it should be replaced. He said: 'It is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem. 'I think we should rummage around for another song instead of Delilah.' Bosses at the Welsh Rugby Union said they would be open to a public debate on the song but said they had 'not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter'. Pictured: Cardiff's Millennium Stadium . Rugby chiefs at the WRU defended the record  but said they would listen to a public debate about the matter. An WRU spokesman said: 'The Welsh Rugby Union condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue. I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window . I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind . She was my woman . As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind . My, my, my, Delilah . Why, why, why, Delilah . I could see that girl was no good for me . But I was lost like a slave that no man could free . At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting . I cross the street to her house and she opened the door . She stood there laughing . I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more . My, my, my Delilah . Why, why, why Delilah . So before they come to break down the door . Forgive me Delilah I just couldn’t take any more . 'The WRU remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of Delilah but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter.' Tens of thousands of Welsh fans happily sing along to the hit, which has become an unofficial anthem for the Welsh rugby and football teams. Delilah was recorded by Sir Tom Jones in 1968 and reached number two in the charts before going on to become a Welsh favourite among fans. Written by Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham, with music by Les Reed, the song earned Reed and Mason the 1968 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. The WRU adopted the song - and often plays it before kick-off at games with the words being shown on the giant screens at the Cardiff stadium. Mr Iwan is not the first person to question the song's place in the nation's songbook. Helen Mary Jones, chief executive of Youth Cymru, which supports youth work in Wales, has also claimed Delilah is offensive to female victims of domestic violence. But Welsh operatic star Wynne Evans, who is famous for starring as Gio Compario in the Gocompare.com insurance adverts, said Delilah played an important part in creating atmosphere among the fans. He said: 'Fans absolutely love it and I have been fortunate enough to sing at the stadium on a number of occasions. 'I think anything which brings the mojo and atmosphere into the stadium is good because when that stadium is quiet it is quiet - but when it is noisy there is nowhere else like it in the world.'","Senior politician leading protest to ban Sir Tom Jones' iconic hit Delilah .

"As she prepares to scale back her duties, it appears the Queen is preparing to apply the same dedication to her leisure pursuits as she has a lifetime of public service. She braved grey skies and drizzle today to make a third appearance at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in Berkshire today. As one of Britain's most high-profile equestrian enthusiasts, it is perhaps no surprise that the damp weather failed to deter the Queen from attending the Marathon Competition on day four of the event at Windsor Castle. Royal fan: The Queen was well equipped for the drizzly weather as she attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show for the second day running today . On Wednesday the 87-year-old monarch delivered a speech at the State Opening of Parliament watched by her son Prince Charles, who attended the ceremony for the first time in 17 years. His presence has been widely interpreted as an indication that the Queen is set to hand over more of her duties to her son. Tellingly, the Queen travelled straight from the ceremony at Westminster to Windsor for day one of the horse show, swapping her State finery for a raincoat and an Hermes scarf to cover her hair. She stuck to similarly sensible outdoor attire today, wearing the same navy raincoat, by Royal warranted label Musto (for whom Zara has designed a collection) and another colourful printed scarf.

"It's the bane of every hiker's life: what to do when you run out of water. Is it safe to drink from the nearby stream? Would you risk sipping from that pond over there? Is your level of thirst greater than your willingness to spend the next four days doubled over in the bathroom? Why didn't I just pack my Brita water filter? But now there's an answer: a straw-shaped portable water filter that enables you to drink safely from any body of water - even from a puddle. Or, in fact, from a toilet. Scroll down for video . Would you drink from your toilet? Now you can, thanks to the LifeStraw, available for £29.99 on Firebox, that makes sipping from lakes, ponds and puddles safe . The LifeStraw was developed in Denmark in 2005 and hopes to save millions of people in Third World countries where a child dies every 15 seconds as a result of drinking dirty water . Now available to buy online via Firebox, the 22cm-long LifeStraw was originally developed by Danish manufacturers in 2005 as a solution to the devastating problem of unsafe drinking water in the Third World, where one child dies every 15 seconds as a result of drinking dirty water. That year it was named Best Invention of 2005 by Time Magazine and Invention of the Century by Gizmag, and in 2006 it was heralded by the New York Times as 'a water purifier that could save lives'. Forbes Magazine called it 'one of the ten things that will change the way we live'. The straw's powerful purification pipe removes 99.9999 per cent of water-borne bacteria plus many other parasites, including E-coli, campylobacter, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella and salmonella. And it will safely filter at least 1000 litres of water. (There are only about 13 in your toilet cistern, so plenty to go around.)

'Lack of access to safe drinking water contributes to the staggering burden of diarrhoeal diseases worldwide, particularly affecting the young, the immunocompromised and the poor. Nearly one in five child deaths - about 1.5 million each year - is due to diarrhoea. Diarrhoea kills more young children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined . 'In many rural and urban areas of the developing world, household water-quality interventions can reduce diarrhoea morbidity by more than 40 per cent. Treating water in the home offers theopportunity for significant health gains at potentially dramatic cost savings over conventional improvement in water supplies, such as piped water connections to households. 'Water filters have been shown to be the most effective interventions amongst all point-of-use watertreatment methods for reducing diarrhoeal diseases.

"Thousands of mothers risk falling pregnant this Christmas because they are so rushed off their feet they forget to take the Pill. The number of births in England and Wales peaks every year nine months after winter, which has been linked to couples conceiving as the nights draw in. But it has been claimed that some women who already have children will be so busy preparing for the festive season that they will forget to take precautions leading to a rise in unplanned pregnancies. Official figures show births peak in July, August, September and October, nine months after the winter months . Last year more children were born in July, September, October and November – nine months after the previous winter. By contrast, February and April saw the fewest births, according to officials figures. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas), which offers abortions, said it expects a rise in demand in the coming weeks as a result of ""contraceptive slip-ups during the festive party season"". Clare Murphy, of bpas, told MailOnline: “Many women are at risk of unplanned pregnancy over the busy festive period. We see more women in the first months of the New Year for advice about unplanned pregnancy than any other time of the year. ‘Many unintended conceptions become much wanted pregnancies, so it is no surprise that September, nine months on, is one of the busiest months of the year for births. For other women however, starting the New Year with an unplanned pregnancy can be a cause for considerable distress.’ She said that while ‘boozy Christmas parties’ could be to blame for some unplanned pregnancies, others are the result of mothers being too busy to take precautions. The pressure of preparing for Christmas means some women might forget to pick up contraceptive supplies (file picture) Miss Murphy added: ‘We see many older women who are simply rushed off their feet at Christmas and forgot to pick up contraceptive supplies or missed a pill. ‘We see thousands of women in their 30s and 40s in January and February, the majority of whom are already mothers, who were so busy getting ready for a family Christmas that their own needs got forgotten. ‘We urge women not to forget about themselves, get their contraception sorted out in advance and know that if they do have an accident there are now forms of emergency contraception that can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex.’ The most births in 2013 were in July, a total of 61,422, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Most of those would have been conceived over October and November. The other months with the highest number of births were October (60, 519), September (60,289) and August (60,238) - corresponding to conceptions between November and February.","Births peak in July to October - nine months after the winter months .

"She is, without a shadow of doubt, the most famous ghost at one of Britain’s most haunted sites. But does this murky photograph show the fabled Grey Lady of Dudley Castle or something less spooky? The image was taken by Amy Harper, 28, on her smartphone during a visit to the castle – which dates back to 1071 – with her husband Dean, 33, and their three children. It was only when they were back home in Birmingham that Mrs Harper took a closer look. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Dean and Amy Harper believe their picture (close up right and circled left in yellow) shows the 'Grey Lady' who has supposedly haunted Dudley Castle in the West Midlands for centuries . The blurred close-up appears to show the outline of a woman with black hair dressed in grey robes standing next to a girl in an archway in the Sharington Range, pictured . She zoomed in on the picture, taken from the castle tower, of Sharington Range, a ruined Tudor building in the grounds. Suddenly, she saw a hazy image of a woman in grey standing inside the arch. ‘It is really creepy,’ said Mrs Harper. ‘Dean had heard about the ghost of the Grey Lady and we think it must be her.’ The photo sparked speculation on social media that it was either the result of clever editing or had been achieved by using a special app that can implant ghoulish figures into images. But Mrs Harper denied the suggestion, insisting: ‘To be honest I wouldn’t have a clue where to start.’ Barri Ghai, lead investigator at the Ghostfinder Paranormal Society, who call themselves the UK’s leading ghosthunters, said the figure is ‘too vague and grainy’ to be a hoax. He believes the image may be the result of ‘matrixing’, a term increasingly used among paranormal investigators to describe the human mind’s natural tendency to find something familiar in complex shapes or colours. This can cause the brain to think it can see a specific person. Amy Harper, pictured with her children Maycey, nine, Georgie, six and Scarlett, four, captured the chilling image on her mobile phone on a day trip to Dudley Castle . Mr Ghai, whose team has appeared in television shows in the UK, US and Japan, said that in the case of the Grey Lady, the shadows and light in the arch, combined with knowledge of the ghost’s fable, make us see what we want to see. Matrixing may also help explain why people think they can see faces or symbols, for example, in clouds or burnt into a piece of toast. But Mr Ghai said there could also be the far simpler explanation for the Grey Lady’s appearance – that someone happened to be standing in the shadows when the photo was taken. Whatever the explanation, the photograph, which was taken in August, is only now creating a stir among ghosthunters – just in time for the Hallowe’en season. Dudley Castle is located at Castle Hill near Dudley in the West Midlands. Historians date the ruined castle back to the Norman Conquest of 1066 and it is thought one of the Conqueror's followers Ansculf de Picquigny built the first castle there around 1070. His son William Fitz-Ansculf owned the castle when it was recorded at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. The earliest castle would have been made of wood and no longer exists. Over the centuries, the stone castle was assembled and extended. Hundreds of years later it would become a Royalist stronghold during rhe English Civil War and was besieged twice but before its surrender to Cromwell's forces in 1646. Tourist attraction: Historians date the ruined castle back to the Norman Conquest of 1066 . The castle was eventually surrendered in May 1646 and parliament ordered that it be partly demolished. The present ruined appearance of the keep results from this decision. The bullk of the remaining habitable parts of the castle was destroyed by fire in 1750. But by the nineteenth century, the site found a new use as a 'Romantic Ruin' and parts of the site were revamped. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century the site was used for large events and pageants and in 1937, when the Dudley Zoo was established, the castle grounds were incorporated into the zoo. Over the years the has gained a reputation as being one of the most haunted castles in Britain.","Dean and Amy Harper had been visiting Dudley Castle in the West Midlands .

Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman of 84 inmates facing the death penalty in the state, figures showed from a report by Georgia's Department of Corrections last year. She is set to be the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735, according to the AJC. In 1997, she was convicted of having her husband killed by her boyfriend Gregory Bruce Owen, her co-defendant who she was having an affair with at the time. She told his sister she was planning to separate from her husband, according to prosecutors. Owen suggested that Gissendaner divorce her husband, but she instead said to kill him because she did not expect Douglas to leave her alone after they were separated.

Owen was sentenced to life in prison, instead of facing the death penalty, after he testified against Gissendaner. In the state of Georgia, the last time a woman was executed occurred in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder  for shooting her boss.

But the brave act cost the teenager - branded a 'hero' by onlookers - his life. Cheng was enjoying the public holiday at the rural spot in Xinyang, at Henan province in central China, when tragedy struck. Heroic: Brave Cheng Changjiang died just moments after this picture was taken. The selfless teenager rushed to save three children from drowning in the lake at the beauty spot in central China . Beauty spot: Cheng, 18, rushed into the water after hearing three children screaming for help. Wang Caihe, 11, fell into the water after trying to help her younger brothers who slipped on wet rocks . Wang Caihe, 11, and her younger brothers, aged six and four, were visiting the lake with their grandmother Wang Zhongyuan, 63. While her back was turned the trio went to the water's edge. But the four-year-old slipped on the wet rocks, dragging his brother with him. When their older sister rushed to help, she also got into difficulty. Cheng, who was the only other person nearby, heard the children's screams. With no thought for his own safety, the teenager - who could not swim - waded into the water, pulling two of the stricken children free from danger.

"Who’d be an England captain? Mitchell Johnson gets out on the right side of bed. Your match-winning spinner quits. Your star persona becomes non grata. Your rock at No 3 falls ill. Your coach packs it in. You lose at home to Sri Lanka. Then Trent Bridge hands you a surface with less life in it than one of MS Dhoni’s press conferences. The irony of the Nottingham Test is that Alastair Cook enjoyed one of his best matches as captain. I know, I know: this is not necessarily saying much. And there was still plenty he could have done differently. But he was inventive with his field settings, treated Moeen Ali’s off-spin with respect, and even proved his sense of humour hasn’t deserted him by producing an uncanny impersonation of Bob Willis. Making people smile won’t affect his chances of holding on to the Test captaincy, though the japes suggested a sense of perspective.  We could all do with a bit of that. On his knees: Alastair Cook had a good Test as England captain but could not inspire that elusive victory . In any case, the alternative was bursting into tears. When Cook compared the surface to the one served up by the unfortunate Praveen Hingnikar, head groundsman at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium at Nagpur, in December 2012 – when India had to beat England to salvage a draw – he confirmed just how over-my-dead-body grudging the Trent Bridge pitch really was. English cricket needs something to cheer about right now. The Test team are in the middle of their most winless sequence for over 20 years, and many fans feel alienated following the Kevin Pietersen affair. Suddenly, we’re forced to recall just how good England had it for the vast majority of Andy Flower’s reign. Hell, it used to be the case that we expected to beat Australia. The visit of India, complete with abysmal overseas record and inexplicably cautious captain, appeared to offer a crack at redemption. And then Steve Birks, no doubt with the blessing of the suits at Nottinghamshire, produced a track that would have neutered Harold Larwood. Sometimes, you can’t catch a break. The harsh fact remains that England have won none of their last nine Tests, and Cook has not scored a century for 26 innings. And while he was unlucky to be bowled behind his legs, he exposed his leg stump because he was so concerned about moving across to the off stump to deal with his tendency to nick good-length balls. In trying to solve one issue, he created another. Lord’s is shaping up as a crucial moment in Cook’s career. If two more batting failures are combined with a draw or an Indian win, his apologists will be running out of straws to clutch. A century in a draw would help; a pair of failures in an England win would not count against him either. But it is the combination – no runs, no wins – that becomes debilitating. England actually had two openings in Nottingham to India’s one. The first came when India slipped to 346 for nine in their first innings, only for their last pair to add 111. The second was on the final morning, when Liam Plunkett bowled Dhoni. Long, lonely walk: Cook had another batting failure at Trent Bridge as his run drought continues . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . India’s opening, by contrast, lasted much longer, as England recovered from 202 for seven to 496 all out. But it was the collapse from 134 for one that will be of most concern. England suffered the same fate twice against Sri Lanka at Headingley. Collapses are what mediocre sides do, no matter whether your No 11 can dig you out of a hole. There is clearly spirit in this England side. We saw it on the last day in Leeds, and we saw it during the world-record stand of 198 between Joe Root and Jimmy Anderson. But their frustration with the authorities is palpable: both Sri Lanka and India have been greeted by surfaces more akin to Colombo and Kolkata, and next is up will be another flat’un at Lord’s. At some point over the next few weeks, Anderson or Stuart Broad may keel over. Five Tests in 42 days is bad enough – but five Tests in 42 days on pitches designed to help the host venue’s bottom line rather than the home team’s bowling figures is simply unaccountable. Raising a smile: Cook ended the first Test on a light-hearted note by running in to bowl like Bob Willis (right) There is a less Anglo-centric reason to grumble, too. Dhoni himself made the point on Sunday evening that, when you play abroad, you expect to encounter the home conditions. It’s what makes Test cricket so engrossing. Right now, English pitches seem to be going the way of the Caribbean – slower, lower, more heart-breaking, more injury-inducing. Most crucially, the cricket becomes boring. Nottinghamshire may have got the fifth day they so obviously craved, but at what cost to the game as a whole? As this column never tires of pointing out, when the business ousts the sport, the sport invariably suffers. Before the Trent Bridge Test, MS Dhoni suggested that the ‘processes’ were more important than the results. The game over, he was at it again: ‘You don’t always want results in your favour but what you want is to see the team improving.’ He makes it sound as if India are a team in constant transition, forever preparing for the next battle while ignoring the current one. India’s fans may think they deserve better. Part of the process: MS Dhoni is adamant India are more interested in the means rather than the end . Simon Kerrigan is back in the England squad, less than a year after his left-arm spin was pummelled by Shane Watson at The Oval. This episode has generally attracted the kinds of adjectives and nouns more readily associated with a horror movie, but it seems Kerrigan can see his analysis for 8-0-53-0 for what it is. Asked on Sunday what he had learned from the experience, he replied: ‘That the sun will come up the next day. It is not the end of the world.’ The Top Spin likes him even more after that. A positive spin: Simon Kerrigan (left), bowling for Lancashire against Notts on Sunday, has been recalled by England . When Sachithra Senanayake was reported by match officials following the one-day international at Lord’s in May because of a suspect bowling action, Sri Lanka privately fumed that this was all England’s fault. Now the ICC have banned him. It’s all very well turning a sense of grievance to your advantage, as Sri Lanka did for the rest of their stay in England, but at some point the basic mechanics of the game will assert themselves. You probably can’t blame England for that. Blame game: Sachithra Senanayake of Sri Lanka (left) has been banned by the ICC because of his suspect action .

"The extent to which the Premier League overshadows English football’s ruling body will be demonstrated when the FA publish their annual accounts. The figures for the year ending July 2014 put the FA’s turnover at £332million, with a gross profit of £261m. These are big numbers and compare favourably with the RFU, who turned over £152.2m during the same period. But they are dwarfed by the £5.1billion the Premier League gained for their domestic TV rights over three years, with more billions to come from overseas deals. The FA's £261million profit is dwarfed by the new Premier League mega deal, worth £5.1billion . The FA will have to change general secretary Alex Horne's review, after he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014-15 FA Cup, which never happened . Sky Sports paid the Premier League an average of £11.1m per game — the same amount the FA brought in from their combined annual increase in broadcasting, sponsorship and licensing. Meanwhile, the FA will have to alter former general secretary Alex Horne’s review, written last November, contained in the accounts. He wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014-15 FA Cup which never happened. Horne also singled out Sian Massey as a leading match official ‘setting a global standard’. She was at the women’s Under 20 World Cup but hasn’t been an assistant referee for a PL game this season — first because of injury and now because she is pregnant. More evidence that UEFA are orchestrating the three-strong presidential challenge to Sepp Blatter came with their strategist Mike Lee’s Vero Communications helping to launch Luis Figo’s campaign in London this week.

The ECB have set a dangerous precedent by allowing struggling England one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play in the whole of the Indian Premier League. His £156,000 deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad means he will miss the one-day international against Ireland on May 8 when he would have been due to lead the side — form permitting — and that means England will need to pick another skipper, devaluing the position. It’s still questionable business as usual at FIFA with the extraordinary early sale of the 2026 World Cup TV rights to Fox in the USA without a tender — to the fury of ESPN and other rival networks. The USA are favourites to host that tournament and delaying selling the rights until the location is decided could have brought in far more money. But Fox have been the biggest opponents of the switch to a winter World Cup in Qatar and this deal will ensure they don’t take legal action.

However, the European Judo Union, led by Russian Sergey Soloveychik, have cancelled the event at short notice in protest at the partnership. Cook said: ‘It’s outrageous to do this with just eight weeks to go and after so much planning had gone into staging the event in Glasgow. If they didn’t want our money then cancel the sponsorship rather than the Championship.’ Former Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook engineered £250,000 in sponsorship for the British Judo Association's hosting of the European Championships, but the event has been cancelled at short notice . The patrons of Twickenham’s west car park, including long-standing debenture holders, have been further antagonised by the RFU’s commercial obsession. This has seen the Bollinger champagne facility moved a short distance to new premises, further marginalising the dwindling space left for west car park users to enjoy food and drink from their own car boots. They include Bill Beaumont, chairman of the RFU management committee, and Ian Metcalfe, chairman of the Professional Game Board. But making money comes first at Twickenham.

"Suspected Boko Haram gunmen kidnapped at least 20 young mothers near a town in northeast of Nigeria where more than 200 schoolgirls were abducted nearly two months ago. News of the abduction came after gunmen from the militant group slaughtered hundreds of villagers in the north-east of the country. There were conflicting reports of how many women were abducted from the nomadic settlement near Chibok in Borno state, with one local leader putting the number as high as 40, according to AFP. Feared: Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Nigeria's Islamic extremist group Boko Haram . The latest kidnappings, which happened on Saturday in and around the village of Garkin Fulani, five miles from Chibok, were the latest in a spate in the area. 'Available information revealed that the gunmen came around noon and abducted 20 women and three young men left to keep watch on the village,' said Alhaji Tar, of a local vigilante group. 'All the males in the settlement were away in the bush with their herd (of cattle) for grazing when the abductors came to the village.' There was no immediate indication of where the women were taken and there had been no contact from the kidnappers. A local official of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) said 40 young mothers were singled out and put into vehicles before being driven to an unknown location. Rant: Shekau speaking on a video released by Boko Haram after they abducted over 200 schoolgirls nearly two months ago . MACBAN is the umbrella organisation of the nomadic Fulani cattle herders in Nigeria. Similar kidnappings for ransom have been going on in the area for some time but locals were too afraid to speak out in fear of reprisals from the Islamist militants, the official said. 'This is not the first time women are being kidnapped in this area and only released when we pay cattle ransom to the kidnappers. It has happened several times,' said the official. 'They come and go door-to-door bringing women outside and select young women and take them away in their vehicles and demand between 30 and 40 cows for their release', he explained. Locals always paid the ransom but do not inform the authorities, he said. A Borno state government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the authorities were aware of the kidnapping of women from the village but denied knowledge of previous abductions. 'This is the first time we are hearing abduction of Fulani women and we are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the kidnap and necessary action to take,' he added. On Thursday Boko Haram gunmen slaughtered hundreds of villagers in the far northeast corner of Nigeria, after arriving disguised as soldiers and promising to protect them. Altogether, Boko Haram militants slaughtered hundreds of people in three villages. A community leader who witnessed the killings on Monday said residents had pleaded for the military to send soldiers to protect the area after they heard that militants were about to attack. The militants arrived in Toyota HiLux pickup trucks - commonly used by the military - and told the civilians they were soldiers and that they had come 'to protect you all', the same tactic used by the group when they kidnapped the Chibok schoolgirls. Meeting: Mothers of some of the  schoolgirls abducted from Chibok during a forum organised by NGOs in Lagos, with three of the schoolgirls who escaped in the backround covered in white sheets . 'We all thought they were the soldiers whom we earlier reported to that the insurgents might attack us,' said the community leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his life. After the militants forced everyone into the village centers, 'they began to shout ""Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar,"" then they started to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all who had gathered were dead,' he said. Allahu akbar means God is great. The killings took place in the villages of Danjara, Agapalwa, and Antagara, part of Gwoza district in Borno state. The community leader said he fled to Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, adding that some who escaped the massacre crossed into the neighboring country of Cameroon while others remain trapped in the mountainous region. 'They still see the gunmen going about attacking villages and hamlets by setting them on fire,' he said. He said managed to survive because 'I was going around to inform people that the soldiers had come and they wanted to address us.' As people were fleeing, other gunmen lurked outside the villages on motorcycles and mowed them down. The slaughter was confirmed by Mohammed Ali Ndume, a senator representing Borno whose hometown is Gwoza, and by a top security official in Maiduguri who insisted on anonymity because he isn't allowed to speak to the media.","The latest kidnappings by Boko Haram happened in Garkin Fulani .

"Supermarkets are selling bottled tap water to millions of unsuspecting customers. Bottles of Tesco ‘Everyday Value Still Water’ and Asda ‘Smartprice Still Water’ are sitting on shelves alongside big brands of mineral water such as Evian and Perrier. However, there is no explanation on the label of these supermarket brands that the contents are simply tap water. Display: Asda's 17p Still Water next to other, more well-known, mineral waters . On the face of it, the supermarket water, which costs 17p for a two-litre bottle, offers remarkable value compared with the big brands. In reality it is no more than a filtered version of the mains water that comes out of the tap at a cost of just a third of a penny a litre. This means the supermarkets and their suppliers are enjoying a mark-up of around 2,500 per cent for filtering the water – something the mains suppliers say is unnecessary. They then put it into plastic bottles and ship it to thousands of stores across the country. It echoes one of the best-loved episodes of the BBC’s Only Fools and Horses, featuring David Jason as the entrepreneurial Del Boy, of Trotters Independent Traders. In pursuit of his millionaire dreams, Del came up with the idea of bottling tap water and selling it as the exclusive ‘Peckham Spring’. Just as Del Boy failed to mention the tap water origins of Peckham Spring, so Tesco and Asda have left this important detail off their labels. Tesco sells the filtered mains water under the name of Everyday Value Still Water which can be bought in a two-litre bottle for 17p or six 500ml bottles for £1. On the label it says ‘Just water, nothing added’. There is a carbonated version which also sells for 17p. Sneaky? Asda has attempted to defend its selling of what is essentially tap water in bottles . French connection? A Tesco representative said that its bottled water originated from France - but just what is the truth? Asda’s product is sold as Smartprice Still Water at 17p for two litres or 88p for a pack of six 330ml bottles. The prices look cheap compared with the 88p for a two-litre bottle of Evian Mineral Water, 69p for Highland Spring, or £1 for a 750ml bottle of Perrier. The trade body for the nation’s mains water suppliers, Water UK, insists the product coming out of the taps is cheap, healthy and safe, with absolutely no reason to filter it. According to the latest report from the Drinking Water Inspectorate, 99.96 per cent of all samples are within health and safety standards. Jo Tanner, of Water UK, said: ‘UK tap water is incredibly safe. ‘We really are a gold standard in terms of water quality. In terms of health and safety there is no need to filter mains water. ‘The idea of selling filtered tap water in supermarkets has a whiff of Del Boy and Peckham Spring about it. I  can see it would be a nice money-making wheeze.’ When asked about the origins of its value water, a Tesco spokesman initially offered a completely inaccurate explanation. She said: ‘My understanding from speaking to our water buyer is that it originates from a spring in France.’ Asked whether it was filtered mains tap water, she said: ‘No, absolutely not. No, its origin is French, but it is bottled in the UK – I think somewhere in the West Midlands. ‘The bottle doesn’t pretend to be anything other than it is. It is categorically not water from a tap and put into a bottle.’ Remember this? The revelations echo the famous Only Fools And Horses storyline where Del Boy and Rodney tried to pass off tap water as 'Peckham Spring' Later, the company confirmed that the water comes from the UK mains and has been filtered to remove chlorine and what it said were ‘other impurities’ found in tap water. Tesco claimed that while the water originated from the mains, the fact it is then filtered means it is unfair to describe it as tap water. It said: ‘Our Everyday Value Still Water comes from UK sources and is filtered to improve the taste and remove impurities. Tesco sells a wide range of waters to suit all tastes and budgets. ‘All of our products are clearly labelled so customers know what they’re buying.’ Asda confirmed that its Smartprice water is filtered mains water. Its manufacturer gets its supplies from the tap water firm Yorkshire Water before filtering and bottling it. A spokesman argued the water was cheaper than buying a water filter and jug for the home. Asda said: ‘Our two-litre bottle is 17p. For comparison – if a customer bought a Brita water filter jug at £16 and used it for the recommended 40 gallons, it would cost 21p to produce two litres of filtered water. We’re saving our customers time and money – as well as providing a container.’ In 2004, Coca-Cola ran into trouble after it began selling the premium bottled water Dasani, which turned out to be filtered tap water from Sidcup in Kent. Jeanette Longfield, of the campaigning ethical food group Sustain, said: ‘First Del Boy tried it with Peckham Spring, then Coca-Cola with Dasani water, and now Tesco. ‘When people are struggling with their grocery bills the last thing they need is to be ripped off by eye-watering mark-ups and misleading labelling. ‘I hope people return to trustworthy tap water – saving money, saving energy and saving waste in the process.’ The Tesco and Asda still water bottles sit alongside big-name mineral water brands on the shelves. At Tesco, the Everyday Value Still Water features a ‘best seller’ sticker while at Asda shoppers are drawn to a promotion sign advertising its 17p low price. The Tesco brand adds the slogan: ‘Just water, nothing added.’ Asda’s tells customers it is ‘Good for hydration’ and its ingredients are ‘Still Water (100%)’. The bottles also sit alongside the supermarkets’ own brand mineral waters. Tesco’s Ashbeck and Asda’s Eden Falls – at 42p and 45p respectively – list their spring source.","What appears good value is tap water marked up 2,500 per cent .

"Addicted: More than a million patients are taking potentially harmful tranquillisers, with some hooked for more than 20 years (posed by model) More than a million patients are taking potentially harmful tranquillisers, with some hooked for more than 20 years, experts have warned. Although guidelines state benzodiazepines should only be used for a maximum of a month, many users are becoming dependent. Psychiatrists say that some patients are begging for repeat prescriptions while others are buying them illegally from foreign websites. It is estimated 1.5million Britons are currently taking a form of benzodiazepines, which include temazepam and diazepam. A study published in the British Medical Journal found the pills increased the risk of dementia by 50 per cent, even if only taken for short periods. Other research has linked them to premature death. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, of the Royal College of Psychiatry, said: ‘There’s no doubt that benzodiazepines can form a dependence, can be addictive for people. ‘But on the other hand if used properly, they are a short-term treatment for anxiety. ‘I can certainly imagine how the doctor feels they are doing some good and unfortunately that’s not always the case. I’ve seen patients on benzodiazepines for 20 years.’ Researchers estimate that as many as 8 per cent of the over-65s are taking them at any one time. However in the past two decades the number of prescriptions have fallen by 40 per cent, largely because GPs are far stricter in handing them out. Worrying traits: Psychiatrists say that some patients are begging for repeat prescriptions while others are buying them illegally from foreign websites . There were nearly 10,600 prescriptions written out last year, down from 16,400 in 1991. Some patients who were addicted say their drugs made their lives a ‘complete blur’ and caused memory lapses and extreme tiredness. But when they tried to come off the pills they suffered withdrawal symptoms including severe abdominal pain, sickness and loss of appetite. Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The NHS should accept it has a part to play in treating the side-effects of a drug which was originally prescribed with the best of intentions.’","Psychiatrists say some patients are begging for repeat prescriptions .

"A six-year-old boy courageously gave his life during the Newtown school massacre to save six of his classmates, it was revealed today. Adam Lanza's gun jammed after he burst into Jesse Lewis' classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed teacher Victoria Soto. Jesse saw in a moment that he had an opening. He shouted to his classmates, who were huddled in the corner, holding hands. Six children fled the classroom and made it to safety. 'He yelled, ""Run!"" Adam reloaded and shot him in the head,' said his mother . Scarlett Lewis, who learned details of the events inside the classroom . from investigators. Scroll down for video . Hero: Jesse Lewis, 6, was shot in the head after screaming for his classmates to run and flee gunman Adam Lanza . Survivors: Eleven children from Jesse's class manages to escape Lanza - thanks to Jesse's courage and the heroism of his teacher who shielded them from the bullets . In all, 11 children from Miss Soto's class survived. Five other first-graders hid in a closet. In . the classroom next door, led by teacher Lauren Rousseau, only one child . was left alive - reportedly after hiding under the bodies of her dead . classmates. The Hartford Courant . released the new account of the events in Miss Soto's classroom on Friday. The story of Jesse's bravery comes from the young survivors, who . told investigators what they witnessed on December 14. 'When I heard he used his last few . seconds on Earth to try to save his friends, I was not surprised,' she . said. 'I am so incredibly proud of him,' Ms Lewis told the Associated Press. The new . evidence also suggests that Lanza might have started in Soto's room. Surviving students from her class say they didn't hear any gunshots . until he started shooting there. Scarlett Lewis, Jesse's mother, says she was not surprised to learn that her son's last act was to save his classmates . Adam Lanza killed himself after murdering 20 children and six teachers . It was initially thought that Lanza started with Ms Rousseau's class because he killed all but one child in the room. Lanza, . 20, shot his way into the school on December 14 and killed 20 . first-grade children and six staffers at the school, in one of the worst . school massacres in U.S. history. He also killed his mother earlier in the day and committed suicide as police arrived at the school building. A report on the Newtown shooting by . investigators is due to be released soon. Investigators have not . disclosed a possible motive for the massacre. It was reported shortly after the shooting that Miss Soto, 27, hid some of her . children in a closet and gave her life trying to distract Lanza. However, little Jesse's heroism and his role in saving the lives of his classmates had not previously been publicly known. Lewis has dedicated herself recently to the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation, which promotes ways for communities to 'choose love over anger, gratitude over entitlement, and forgiveness and compassion over bitterness.' The foundation was inspired by a message that Jesse had left on their kitchen chalkboard with the words 'nurturing,' 'healing' and 'love.' She told People magazine last December: 'With Jesse, I have absolutely no regrets. I loved him to pieces, he knew it, and I knew he loved me to pieces. That is a blessing. Jesse was a gift.'","Jesse Lewis, 6, courageously shouted for his classmates to run while gunman Adam Lanza was reloading .

"The U.S. has finally lost its dubious honour of having the world's highest number of overweight and obese people. Fuelled by a worsening diet of fizzy drinks and cheap fast food restaurants, Mexico has now become the fattest nation in the world. Around 70 per cent of Mexican adults are now overweight and a third of them are obese, causing a range of serious health problems. Obesity epidemic: Experts in Mexico say four of every five of its overweight children will remain so for the rest of their lives . Once reserved for special occasions, . many Mexicans with sedentary jobs are now indulging daily in fat-heavy . tacos, tamales and quesadillas, as well as American fast food. Mexico may still be battling . malnutrition and hunger among some of its poor but now it is also managing to claim the . largest number of overweight people, according to a UN report. The fat epidemic is most prominent among the poor and the young - many of whom also suffer from malnourishment because of poor diet. High profile case: Mexican Manuel Uribe has been losing weight since he made an appeal for help on national television but he has become symbolic of the country's severe weight problems . Experts say four fifths of overweight children will remain so their entire lives. Abelardo . Avila from Mexico's National Nutrition Institute said: 'The worst thing . is the children are becoming programmed for obesity.' The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) announced two years ago that the national weight gain had reached emergency levels, but it has proved difficult for the authorities to tackle. Dangerous habits: Childhood obesity has tripled in a decade in Mexico . Part of the difficulty is that the . crisis has taken hold rapidly - In 1989, fewer than 10 percent of . Mexican adults had any weight problems. Studies show that Mexicans are eating more processed foods than ever before and fewer whole grains and vegetables. This year was the first time Mexico has . inched ahead into first place, with a 32.8 per cent obesity rate to . America's 31.8 per cent. However, this was only among the most populated countries of the world. Both Mexico and the U.S. have nothing on the small countries such as American Samoa in the Pacific where the rate of overweight inhabitants has now reached 95 per cent. Islanders living on the beautiful . American Samoa archipelago are officially the fattest in the world, . according to World Health Organisation figures. Being overweight can result in a . catalogue of chronic diseases and health complications, including . hypertension and heart disease, diabetes and subsequent renal failure . and liver disease. It is also linked the asthma, cancer, depression, stroke and problems with digestion. The number of people with obesity-related diabetes is expected to double to 300 million between 1998 and 2025.

"Lord Howell, a former foreign office minister, said tough immigration and immigration and visa checks were harming Britain . Tough immigration policies have made Britain ‘nasty’, George Osborne’s father-in-law warned today. Lord Howell, a former foreign office minister, said rules and regulations on who can enter the country were creating a ‘blot’ on the UK’s reputation. Visa restrictions are damaging Britain's standing on the world stage and must be urgently overhauled, he warned. The Tories have taken an increasingly tough stance on immigration, in part to counter the rise of the UK Independence Party. It has included moves to cut net migration to the tens of thousands and a crackdown on migrants claiming benefits. But Lord Howell of Guildford said the issue requires ‘very careful handling’ and warned the government: ‘We are not getting it right.’ The 78-year-old Tory peer served in Margaret Thatcher;s Cabinet and when the coalition was formed became a foreign minister for two and a half years. His daughter, Frances, is married to Mr Osborne, the Chancellor. He now chairs a Lords committee on Soft Power, which today published a report warning British diplomacy is stuck in the last century and risks leaving the UK ‘outwitted, out-competed, and increasingly insecure’. Peers warn that domestic policies can damage attempts to forge relationships and highlight how almost every expert that appeared before them warned that the Coalition's visa reforms were ‘harming the assets that build the UK's soft power’. They call for students to be removed from net migration targets and a change in tone from the government in the way it speaks about immigration. Lord Howell told BBC Radio 4's Today that a string of witnesses to the committee had suggested visa and immigration policies were ‘creating a nasty Britain feeling’. Business people were being put off coming to the UK by a ‘tangle of regulation’ and many students were almost in ‘despair’ at the restrictions imposed on them. ‘This country has got to be open for business, our leaders say that all the time,’ he said. The comments risk causing embarrassment for George Osborne, who has spent this week visiting towns across the country to prove business is booming . ‘Being open for business means we've got to welcome the right people, including a lot of students and brilliant skilled people who add to our power in the world and we've got to keep out those obviously who would do bad things to Britain and damage us. ‘This requires very careful handling. We are not getting it right. ‘All our witnesses who came before us - and we had 24 hearings and a vast amount of written evidence - said the visa policy and some of the handling of immigration policy was creating rather a blot, creating a nasty Britain feeling when in fact we've got all these fantastic assets which, if we handle them right and tell the story right, can promote a very positive image for Britain, increase our trade, enable us to export more, invest more. ‘Clearly this aspect needs clearing up. Everyone agrees that.’ He said: ‘Many business people who want to move into Britain to develop and strengthen our economy are finding it very difficult to get through the tangle of regulations. ‘And I think many students, particularly from some of the Commonwealth countries, are finding it really almost a matter of despair trying to get in and, when they have finished, wondering whether they have to go home and all that sort of thing.’","Ex-foreign office minister says rules are creating a 'blot' on UK's reputation .

"Good bacteria: Gut microbes are being linked to mental health issues . People suffering from anxiety, might just need to eat more 'healthy' bacteria. Some scientists think there may be a link between our digestive tract microbes and disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia and autism. They are beginning to recognise the power of healthy gut bacteria, especially seeing that the average adult carries up to five pounds of bacteria - trillions of microbes - in their digestive tract. Probiotics are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods with specially added active live cultures, such as in yogurt, soy yogurt or as dietary supplements. Probiotics are also delivered in fecal transplants, in which stool from a healthy donor is delivered like a suppository to an infected patient. A study published in Nutritional Neuroscience from The Great Plains Laboratory, has shown that HPHPA levels - the chemical byproduct of the clostridia bacteria - are much higher in the urine of autistic children. Those treated with antibiotics effective against clostridia show a decrease in symptoms of autism. Dr James Greenblatt, a Boston-area psychiatrist, treated a teenager with severe obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an array of digestive problems. Greenblatt first did a simple urine test for the metabolite HPHPA and found that it was elevated. He put the patient, Mary, on a course of high-powered probiotics to boost her good bacteria, followed by antibiotics, and her levels began to ‘dramatically’ go down, he told ABC News. After six months, Mary's symptoms began to disappear. And by a year, they were gone. Today, three years later, Mary is a senior in high school and has no sign of either mental disorder. Autism: HPHPA levels - the chemical byproduct of the clostridia bacteria - are much higher in the urine of autistic children . Dr James Greenblatt, a Boston-area psychiatrist, says all doctors should make organic acid urine testing for HPHPA levels a standard practice . In some patients, the strep bacterium has been linked to OCD in a condition known as PANDAS - an acronym for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections. PANDAS, which is a rare disease that usually appears in children, is hypothesised to be an autoimmune disorder that results in a variable combination of tics, obsessions, compulsions, and other symptoms that may be severe enough to qualify for diagnoses such as chronic tic disorder, OCD and Tourette syndrome. A 10-year-old from Virginia was treated with probiotics after being incorrectly diagnosed with PANDAS after he developed compulsive symptoms following a strep infection and a lengthy course on antibiotics. ‘He had no gut flora,’ said his mother, Robin, who did not want to use her last name. ‘He had been healthy and athletically coordinated and then developed these compulsive behavior and tics. It didn't seem like it was in his control.’ After probiotics, ‘it was like night and day’, she told ABC News. ‘His symptoms went away and he was totally fine.’ A recent study in the journal Science shows that thin and fat people have different bacteria -- a discovery that could lead to weight-loss programmes. Babies are born with a sterile digestive tract and first acquire their bacteria while traveling through the birth canal and get more in breast milk and in the world outside the womb through contact with other people. Sterile: Babies are born with zero microbes in their digestive tract and first acquire their bacteria while traveling through the birth canal and then through breast milk . Scientists are so far unable to identify every strain of bacteria, but they can test for the chemical byproducts that they produce, according to Greenblatt. He said he checks every patient for HPHPA with a simple organic acid urine test before moving ahead with medications to treat symptoms. 'Eight out of 10 people are fine,' he said. 'But in the two patients where it's elevated, it can have profound effects on the nervous system.' 'I don't know why this test isn't done on every psychiatric patient,' he said. 'I question that every day.' HPHPA causes deactivation of an enzyme so that dopamine cannot be converted to the neurotransmitter neuroepinephrine, Greenblatt said, and that causes a build-up of dopamine. 'We know elevated levels in the dopamine gene cause agitation,' he told ABC News. In one 2010 study at McMaster University in Canada, published in the journal Communicative and Integrative Biology, scientists found a link between intestinal microbiota and anxiety-like behaviour. Researchers compared the behaviours of normal 8-week-old mice and those whose guts were stripped of microbes. Those without bacteria showed higher levels of risk-taking and the stress hormone cortisol. They also had altered levels of the brain chemical BDNF, which has been linked to anxiety and depression in humans. Lab mice: A test showed that those without bacteria showed higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol and altered levels of the brain chemical BDNF, which has been linked to anxiety and depression in humans . Jane Foster, associate professor of neuroscience and behavioral science and part of the McMaster University & Brain-Body Institute, says gut bacteria ‘talk to the brain in multiple ways through either the immune system or the enteric nervous system’. However, while using probiotics may help a ‘subset of patients’, she said. It's not a ‘magic bullet’. Early life stresses, nutrition and building a strong immune system all play an important role in a person's mental health, she said.","The average adult carries up to five pounds of bacteria .

"Up to 320,000 homebuyers with  interest-only mortgages risk losing their property because they are struggling to pay, the financial regulator warned yesterday. The figures, based on research by the Financial Services Authority, reveal they have either missed or struggled to make a payment on loans which are specifically designed to be more affordable. The scale of the problem follows recent warnings of a ‘ticking timebomb’ of interest-only mortgages. Big dipper: Mortgage rates have plunged over the last five years but, if they were to rise suddenly, thousands of people on interest-only deals would struggle to keep up with their repayments . Of the 11.2million mortgages in . Britain, around 35 per cent are interest-only, meaning that the . homebuyer pays only the interest every month, but not a penny of the . capital. In theory the mortgage-holder should . save to pay off the capital at the end of the term, but nearly 80 per . cent have no repayment strategy, according to the FSA. They have been . categorised as ‘mortgage prisoners’. Others have been saving, but have been . bitterly disappointed by how their investments, such as endowments, . have performed. The regulator said between 5 and 8 per cent of these . loans are ‘in forbearance’, which means the homeowner has either missed a . payment, or made the payment late. Default: The tactic of putting people on interest-only mortgages has helped to keep repossessions low. They peaked at 48,300 in 2009 . Experts warn that homeowners have . little chance of keeping a roof over their heads if they cannot afford . such mortgages with interest rates at a historic low. For more than . three years the Bank of England has kept the base rate at 0.5 per cent. An interest-only mortgage offers a cheaper way to purchase a property . than with a capital repayment mortgage, because borrowers are only . paying off only the interest and not the capital. For example, a . £150,000 homeloan at 5 per cent over 25 years would cost £625 per month . interest-only, and £877 per month capital repayment. But at the end of the mortgage term, the interest-only loan will have . paid off only the interest - leaving the original £150,000 debt to be . repaid, whereas the repayment mortgage would have cleared the debt. Erik Britton of financial consultants Fathom said: ‘We are creating . zombie households that can only stay in their properties if interest . rates are 0.5 per cent.’ Despite the base rate being frozen, . around one million homeowners will be hit next month by a jump in . standard variable mortgages. The average increase is 0.62 percentage . points, adding £53 per month to a typical £150,000 mortgage. Before the credit crunch in 2007, it . was easy for a homeowner to take out an interest-only mortgage without . providing any evidence of how the actual loan would be paid off. Other . research by the FSA, published in December, shows the extent of the . problem as these loans come to the end of their life, but the borrowers . have no money to pay them off. Between 2011 and 2020, it expects around 1.5million interest-only mortgages worth £120billion will be due for repayment. Questioned by MPs recently, Martin . Wheatley, a director of the Financial Services Authority, said: ‘There . is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years.’ To make matters worse, it will soon become much more difficult for homeowners with an interest-only loan to remortgage. When new FSA rules come into force, . probably in 2013, it will be impossible to take out an interest-only . mortgage unless you can prove you are saving to pay off the loan. A spokesman for the British Bankers’ Association said: ‘Banks are committed to treating customers . sympathetically and will help where they can.’","35% of 11.2million mortgages are interest-only deals .

"The distraught father of a missing college senior whose purse was found on a walkway of the George Washington Bridge has choked back the tears as he pleaded for her to come home. 'Please get a phone,' Christopher Aiello said in a message to his daughter, Paige Aiello, as he grew emotional. 'Call because we need you and want to see you again.' The devastated father said his youngest daughter had been under a lot of stress at the College of New Jersey, where she was the tennis captain and a top honors student. She was deciding which law school to attend out of the nine she had been accepted to when she vanished on Tuesday - just two days before her 22nd birthday. Scroll down for video . Overachiever: Paige Aiello, a College of New Jersey senior and the captain of the school's tennis team, went missing two days before her 22nd birthday. Her family has said she was under a great deal of pressure . 'With her birthday coming and with the fact that she was distraught, [maybe] she just wanted to be missing and not celebrate during this time,' Mr Aiello told NBC. 'I really don't know what to think.' He added to WPIX: 'She had a work ethic so I hope that hasn't been her downfall.' Paige Aiello was reported missing on Tuesday by her family in Hillsborough after she apparently took her mother's car without permission, authorities said. That night, a passer-by reported finding her purse, cell phone and car keys on the south walkway of the George Washington Bridge. Fears: Her father, Christopher Aiello, choked back tears as he pleaded for his daughter to come home . No sign: She was last seen at the family's home in Hillsborough, pictured, on the afternoon of April 9th . Desperate search: Police scoured the Hudson River under the George Washington Bridge, but failed to find anything to lead them to Aiello's whereabouts . Authorities searched the Hudson River and both levels of the bridge and did not find anything, and surveillance camera images at the bridge are not recorded, WPIX reported. On Wednesday, authorities found the missing car at a parking garage in New Brunswick, next to the train station. Mr Aiello said it was believed she took the train to New York. He told WCBS that his daughter, a co-captain of the school tennis team who also worked several jobs, had done ‘incredibly well’ in high school and college and was accepted to nine law schools. But he added that she was feeling under a great deal of stress and was living at home for added support. ‘She had hit almost like a wall where she felt she was not maybe either worthy of all this or she just couldn't handle it,’ he said. Under stress: Aiello, a communications major, . has been working two jobs, struggling with a heavy workload at school . and preparing to attend law school in the fall. Her family described her as a 'perfectionist' Top student: Paige's father worried that the fact that it was her 22nd birthday on Thursday may have something to do with her disappearance on Tuesday . He said his message all day had been: ‘Not only do we have to be watching our children that are not doing well and getting in trouble, but we have to see and watch the kids that are the overachievers. ‘They have a self-imposed stress. You don't need a parent to be constantly on their back if their stress is internalized.’ Aiello said he was encouraged that no . one reported witnessing anyone jumping from the bridge. He said he was . worried that without a cell phone, she could just be wandering around. Miss . Aiello was last seen by her father at around 1pm at home. About two . hours later, her mother came home and noticed that her car, a 2006 grey . Audi A4, was gone, along with her daughter. The . student was not answering her phone, and shortly before 8pm her father . reported the woman missing. At some point, the device was apparently . switched off, according to Paige's sister, Erin.

"A North Carolina hospital took the groundbreaking decision to let a dog into the operating theater yesterday as it's seven-year-old owner underwent life-saving surgery. First-grader Kaelyn Krawczyk has a rare illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy-like symptoms - such as hives, swelling, nausea and shortness of breath - to occur without warning. Her pet terrier, JJ, is trained to detect oncoming attacks and on Wednesday when she was operated on at the Duke University Medical Center the fluffy pooch acted as an 'additional monitor' for medics. Scroll down for video . A girl's best friend: Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina decided to let JJ the dog into the operating theater yesterday as it's seven-year-old owner, Kaelyn Krawczyk, underwent life-saving surgery . Turning in circles indicates a mild reaction while barking shows the situation has become more urgent. Resreachers believe that medical response dogs such as JJ, can detect subtle changes in body chemistry or behavior in their owner. Anesthetist, Dr. Brad Taicher, told the Charlotte Observer: 'It was kind of logical, actually. Knowing what JJ could do, we realized that [she] was not much different from other monitors we use.' 'It sounds silly, in this age of technology but this little dog  was more sensitive than all the machines' While JJ couldn’t be allowed into a . sterile operating room, she could go into a less strict procedure zone. She was given a thorough bath on Tuesday evening in preparation for her . hospital visit. The purpose of Wednesday's 45-minute-long operation was to look for a cause of Kaelyn's recurring kidney infections, which, if left untreated, could prove fatal. Early Wednesday, JJ followed the youngster into the surgery and sat on the floor next to her bed. Rare condition: The first-grader has an illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy-like symptoms - such as hives, swelling, nausea and shortness of breath - to occur without warning . Trusty friend: Her pet terrier, JJ, is trained to detect oncoming attacks and on Wednesday when she was operated on at the Duke University Medical Center the fluffy pooch acted as an 'additional monitor' for medics . Dr Taicher says anesthesia can, in rare . cases, cause an allergic reaction in patients, so he watched for any . signs from JJ as the sedative was administered to Kaelyn. Though the monitors showed no change in . her vital signs, JJ got up and turned circles as her body felt the . effects of the drug - a minor alert - and then sat back down. Dr. Sherry . Ross, who performed Kaelyn's surgery said the injection of a 'test dye' during the procedure could have also triggered a reaction. But, again, . no problems occurred. The only other instance JJ stirred was as Kaelyn was brought out of sedation, and she turned a couple of circles again. 'Knowing what JJ the dog could do, we realized that she was not much different from other monitors we use' 'It was just as we expected,' Dt Taicher said. 'If we had had a script, she followed it to a tee.' Although service dogs are used in many medical instances, including detecting blood-sugar fluctuations in diabetics and seizures in people with epilepsy, Dr Taicher said he was impressed with JJ’s abilities. 'It sounds silly, in this age of technology, when we have millions of dollars’ worth of equipment beeping around me, that we had a little dog who was more sensitive than all the machines,' he said. Since JJ became Kaelyn’s service dog 18 months ago, she has exceeded the hopes of even her trainer, Deb Cunningham at Eyes Ears Nose and Paws in Carrboro. Ms Cunningham knew it was possible to train a dog to help when a person goes into medical distress but she wasn’t sure a dog could learn to alert someone of something happening at a cellular level before the person even shows signs of a problem. On standby: The little dog sat on the floor while her owner was operated on . Grateful: Kaelyn's mother, Michelle, says JJ makes life a lot easier . In 2012, Ms Cunningham trained JJ, a who was rescued from an animal shelter, about how to react to Kaelyn's condition. Previously . the infant from Apex, North Carolina, experienced three to four severe . reactions a year but since JJ entered her life there has been only one. That’s because JJ alerts before the reaction progresses, giving Kaelyn’s parents time to take action. Her mother, Michelle, says the dog often senses a problem before Kaelyn shows any symptoms or says that she's feeling unwell. 'JJ has made it possible for us to give out daughter a more normal life' As . well as signaling that there is some wrong, JJ can also go to a cabinet . at the family’s home and fetch a kit containing an EpiPen in . preparation. If the Krawczyk’s are away from home traveling, she knows to go to Michelle’s purse and get the kit. 'JJ . has made it possible for us to give [Kaelyn] a more normal life,' Michelle said. Meanwhile her daughter calls JJ 'very beautiful and . smart' and at 'the top of my love list.' Kaelyn is currently . recovering from yesterday's procedure. It is very unusual to have a dog . present in a hospital operation room. Indeed, Dr. Timothy E. Smith, . an associate professor of pediatric anesthesiology at Wake Forest . Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina told Today.com that he had . never heard of such a case.","Kaelyn Krawczyk, aged seven, has a rare illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy-like symptoms to occur without warning .

"Knowledge is power - or at least that’s what we’ve been led to believe. But knowing too much could accidentally trigger a countdown to Armageddon, according to two U.S. physicists. The scientific theory suggests we may have nudged the universe closer to its death just by looking at it. U.S. researchers argue that continuous observation of the universe might put it into a state that will destroy us . The double-slit experiment reveals how the very act of looking can change the behaviour of a particle. In the experiment, when scientists shoot a single particle towards a barrier with two slits, the particle behaves like a bullet and travels through one slit or the other. Yet if no-one watches the particle, it moves in a wave-like pattern. This means, bizarre as it sounds, that the particle can travel through both slits at the same time. This demonstrates that matter and energy can display characteristics of both waves and particles, and that the behaviour of the particle changes based on a person's perception and consciousness. Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and colleague James Dent, claim that astronomers have sped up the process over the past two decades. This is because they’ve dared to measure dark energy, the mysterious force that is driving galaxies apart. The researchers, who first proposed their idea in 2007, argue that continuous observation of the universe might put it into a state that will destroy us all. Their theory relates to a strange . property of quantum physics which controls the behaviour of subatomic . particles and possibly the whole universe. The good news is that if we stop looking, the universe could shift to a state at which its decay much slower . Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment created by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. In the hypothetical experiment a cat is placed in a sealed box next to a radioactive sample, a Geiger counter and a bottle of poison. If the Geiger counter detects that the radioactive material has decayed, it will trigger the smashing of the bottle of poison and the cat will be killed. The experiment was designed to show the flaws in something known as the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics. This states that a particle exists in all states at once until observed. If the Copenhagen interpretation suggests the radioactive material can have simultaneously decayed and not decayed in the sealed environment, then it follows the cat too is both alive and dead until the box is opened. Quantum systems can shift a particle’s energy state at random, for example, when a radioactive atom decays. Some scientists think the universe is overdue for a quantum energy shift that would cause everything to cease to exist at any moment. If a collapse occurs, it won't exceed the speed of light, so we’ll probably see it coming, according to Esther Inglis-Arkell at iO9. The reason for a collapse, says Professor Krauss, has to do with the strange way quantum states are affected by someone looking at it. In the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, a cat in a box whose fate is decided by subatomic particles is both alive and dead until someone lifts the lid and observes it. Only then is the cat discovered to be either ‘alive’ or ‘dead’. According to a law known as the ‘quantum Zeno effect’, whenever we observe or measure something at the quantum level we set its decay clock back to zero. The physicists calculated that observing the effects of dark energy may have reset the universe's decay clock. The good news is if we stop looking, the universe could shifts to a state at which its decay much slower. The same concept applies to the start of the universe. Professor Kraus recently told Radcliffe magazine that the universe sprang from nothing. He says we just happen to live in a universe with the right set of laws to support human life - we wouldn’t exist otherwise. ‘The answer to the question, why is there something rather than nothing, is really quite simple,’ Professor Krauss said. ‘Just wait, there won’t be for long.’","This is based on strange way quantum states are affected when observed .

"A mother's invention that gave her wheelchair-bound son the chance to walk has been launched onto the worldwide market. A Northern Ireland company has turned Debby Elnatan's idea for a walking harness into a product that could transform the lives of countless disabled children. Mrs Elnatan, a music therapist, came up with the concept to help her young son Rotem, who has cerebral palsy. Scroll down for video . Miracle steps: From left, Claire and Daniel Smyth, Louise and Bethany Watson and Cameron and Charlotte Taylor take the Firefly Upsee for a test run . Delight: From left Daniel Smyth, five, Bethany Watson, and Charlotte Taylor, both three, gave the invention their seal of approval . She designed a support harness that would enable Rotem to stand upright and, by attaching it to herself, let parent and child take steps together. After a global search for a company to mass-produce her ""Upsee"", the Israeli mother chose Northern Ireland-based manufacturer Leckey, which has a long track record in making equipment for children with special needs. After successful trials with families in the UK, US and Canada, the Firefly Upsee was today launched globally. 'It is wonderful to see this product available to families across the world,' said Ms Elnatan, who was at the official unveiling at the Leckey factory in Lisburn. Striding out: The harness attaches around an adult's waist to hold the child upright, they can then walk in step with their parent, as demonstrated by Charlotte and Cameron . 'When my son was two years old, I was told by medical professionals that ""he didn't know what his legs are and has no consciousness of them"". 'That was an incredibly difficult thing for a mother to hear. I started to walk him day after day, which was a very strenuous task for both of us. Out of my pain and desperation came the idea for the Upsee and I'm delighted to see it come to fruition.' The Upsee allows infants and small children to stand and achieve repetitive walking training with the support of an adult. It includes a harness for the child, which attaches to a belt worn by an adult, and specially-engineered sandals that allow the parent and child to step simultaneously, leaving their hands free for play and other tasks. Designers, engineers, textile experts and therapists from Leckey's Firefly team have been working on the project since 2012. Heartwarming scene: Charlotte's twin brother, Daniel, was delighted to see his sister, who has cerebral palsy, walking and gave her a celebratory kiss . The product has been launched by Northern Ireland-based manufacturer Leckey . Maura McCrystal, mother of five-year-old Jack, from Draperstown in Northern Ireland, has been one of the first UK parents to use the product. 'Last Sunday was a significant one for us as a family as it was the first time our son Jack was able to play football in the back garden with his dad, his brothers and our little dog Milly,' she said. 'To see Jack playing like any other five-year-old boy made me very emotional. Jack and his brothers so enjoyed it.' Firefly's clinical research manager and occupational therapist, Clare Canale, said the product could help families across the world. 'Short-term, the Upsee improves special needs family participation and quality of life, while research suggests it has the potential to help with physical and emotional development in the longer term,' she said. 'It has been humbling to see the progress and happiness the Upsee is creating; watching children to do simple things for the first time such as kicking a ball or playing with a sibling is wonderful for everyone involved, but especially the families.'

"The world’s fastest fiddler can add another string to his bow - he’s been declared the quickest human on the planet. Talented violinist and four-times world speed-violin record holder Ben Lee was awarded the title of World’s Fastest Superhuman for his rendition of The Flight of the Bumblebee, at an average of 15 notes per second. Judges and scientists for the Quest programme Superhuman Showdown unanimously voted the 32-year-old musician the fastest superhuman on earth, beating off competition from a speed shooter and a base jumper. World's fastest fiddler: Ben Lee, right, is one half of rock violin duo Fuse, with Linzi Stoppard, left. Mr Lee has been hailed as the world's fastest superhuman after an international competition . Mr Lee, from Eastbourne in Sussex, said: 'I set new records not only in electric violin, but in classical as well and from there I took the next challenge - to appear on Superhuman Showdown beating some incredible competition. 'It’s taken tens of thousands of hours of practice to reach this speed but it definitely helped that my parents were musical and encouraged me to play.' Mr Lee was tested for speed against world base race champion Frode Johannessen, who can ‘fly’ unassisted at 170pm and speed shooter Jerry Miculek who can fire eight rounds on four targets in 1.06 seconds. He was also up against head spinner Aicho Ono, who can perform 135 head spins in one minute without experiencing dizziness, and speed eater Pete Czerwinski, who can eat a 12 inch pizza in 34 seconds. They were measured for speed in a controlled environment by scientists including former Olympic pentathlete Professor Greg Whyte from the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science at Liverpool John Moores University. 'I can only get faster': Mr Lee credits Ms Stoppard with helping him to develop his phenomenal playing speed and presence on stage . The result was announced researchers used magnetic electrical pulses to measure brain activity during the tasks. Ben has played the violin since the age of five. At 16 he was awarded Daily Telegraph Young Jazz Composer Of The Year. He is one half of rock violin duo Fuse and was the first person to hold the Guinness World Records for the Fastest Violinist In The World in both the electric and acoustic categories. 'I’ve been challenging myself to play as fast as I can since I was five years old,' said Mr Lee, who insured his lightening quick fingers for £3million last year. 'It wasn’t until I had a serious bike accident and nearly lost the ability to play that Linzi Stoppard, my music partner, challenged me to enter the Guinness World Records as the world’s fastest violinist. 'Meeting Linzi, who changed my image, got me physically fit and turned my life around so I’d have the same professional stage presence as she did helped my stamina and my focus. 'I believe that all of this combined to help me win the Superhuman title and set new world records which I plan to hold onto. I can only get faster from here.' Each contestant on Superhuman Showdown was specially selected from hundreds of fast performing humans around the world. Professor Whyte said: 'Through dedicated and long term practice, Ben is able to devote larger portions of his brain to a task. 'Ben bows with his right hand, which means that his left cortex should utilised more than his right. 'However, with the focus and control he uses with his left hand, Ben has developed a greater proportion of his right cortex, giving him powerful dexterity and the ability to play at 810 notes per minute.' It is because of this that Mr Lee has become the first person to break the ‘magic minute’ barrier, which most professionals said could not be done. His record for playing Flight of the Bumblebee note perfect on the electric violin is 58.05 seconds.","Ben Lee awarded the title for playing The Flight of the Bumblebee at a phenomenal 15 notes a second .

"On the face of it, this Mako shark may not be the prettiest creature on the planet. But would you dare say it to its face? The Mako has a reputation as one of the deadliest and fastest sharks in the ocean and could certainly make its displeasure known if it wanted to. With its seemingly lifeless eyes and terrifyingly sharp teeth the Mako has been known to stalk its prey at lightning speeds of almost 100kmh - and has even been known to attack humans. But Mexican photographer and diver Gerardo del Villar has set out to prove that the world's 'deadliest' sharks are misunderstood - by taking these stunning pictures of the shark without the protection of a cage in a bid to save the species from overfishing. Scroll down for video . The Mako shark may not be the most beautiful creature in the ocean but former matador turned photographer Gerardo del Villar is smitten . Coming this close to a bull shark would scare many of us, but Gerardo del Villar's previous career as a matador is sure to help with any nerves . Del Villar's photos, including this scarred Great White, were borne out of a desire 'to prove sharks are predators whom are wrongly tagged as killers' The photographer caught this Bull shark mid-snack during his underwater photo sessions . At up to 10 ft in length and weighing in up to a hefty 135kg, the Shortfin Mako, sometimes described as the 'peregrine falcon' of the shark world because of its speed, will not hesitate to attack especially when provoked. The shark has even been known to break free of fishing lines and try its best to attack fishermen attempting to catch it, battering their boat and sometimes leaping out of the water up to an impressive 20ft. The sharks are mainly found in relatively warm water most commonly in the Atlantic from Argentina to the Gulf of Mexico. Though they are often seen hunting around the surface, they can live at depths of up to 490ft and have a distinct advantage over their prey because their body temperature is seven to 10 Celsius warmer than the temperature of the water. But even though they are renowned for being incredible hunters, numbers of the species are diminishing because they are often the target of fishermen hoping to catch them for their lean meat and fins which are used for medicinal purposes in some cultures. Gerardo del Villar, who faced down more than 600 bulls in a 10-year career as a matador in Mexico, took these magnificent snaps to raise awareness of overfishing. As well as the Mako, Gerardo also got up close and personal with the Bull Shark, Great Whites, Sand Tigers, Oceania White Tips and the Blue shark. Sand Tiger sharks are among the creatures snapped by Del Villar, who wants to 'help create a culture that cares for and protects different species of sharks' A Bull shark faces up to Gerardo del Villar as he and another diver explore the waters off Mexico . An Oceanic White Tip shark swims despite a large injury to the side of its mouth . A Bull shark devours its dinner as its rows of teeth are on show for the camera . He said: 'I want to demonstrate to the rest of . the world that sharks are not killing machines and help create a culture . that cares for and protects different species of sharks. 'I . want to prove sharks are predators whom are wrongly tagged as killers, . they are everything but. Most of the shark attacks on humans, are caused . out of identity confusion.' Earlier this month, American . scientists claimed that sharks could face extinction if overfishing . continues with up to 100 million being killed each year. Because sharks take a long time to grow and reproduce slowly, they fear that some species could be wiped out altogether. Gerardo del Villar is no stranger to facing ferocious creatures. He faced down more than 600 bulls in a 10-year career as a matador in Mexico. He suffered nine broken ribs, a . dislocated shoulder, two fractures of the sternum, two horn stabbings, a . collapsed lung and a host of other bumps and scrapes from his time in . the ring. But fearless Del . Villar combined his passions for scuba diving and photography and . decided to dive with the 10 most dangerous sharks in the world without a . cage to highlight how misunderstood they are. A Blue shark is unperturbed by the presence of Gerardo del Villar and his diving mate . Del Villar dives without a cage to show how misunderstood 'killer' sharks, such as this Tiger shark, are . Gerardo del Villar has swapped his matador's chaquetilla (jacket) for breathing apparatus and a camera to try to change the perception of sharks as being dangerous . The bizarre flesh-like stripes hanging from the fin of the Mako shark (pictured) are likely to be parasitic copepods. There are some 1,700 species and most of the small crustaceans belong in the sea or freshwater habitat. Many of them are host specific meaning that they can only latch on to one type of creature, while others have a limited number of potential hosts. Some of the species are able to move about their host body, while some penetrate so deeply that they are permanently attached to the host. The usual size of an adult copepod is between one and two millimetres long, but some can be as small as 0.2mm in length. The longest copepods can grow up to 10mm long. They are an important part of the aquatic food chain linking microscopic algal cells to juvenile fish to other creatures the size of a whale. Copepods have a variety of sensory capabilities. The most noteworthy are bristle-like setae that act as mechanoreceptors responding to flow that causes bending. An array of such sensors allows detection of patterns of water flow around the body caused by approaching prey or predator, and the copepod can distinguish between the two. The sensors are highly specialized for sensitivity and the nerves are even myelinated for fast conduction.","Former matador Gerardo del Villar takes the stunning up-close pictures WITHOUT the protection of a cage .

"Online auction site eBay has been blasted for an 'inexcusable delay' in taking action after it was revealed that its servers were hacked three months ago - compromising the personal details of 15 million British users. The email, home . addresses, passwords, phone numbers and birth dates of every eBay . account holder - 233 million worldwide -  are now in the hands of the hackers. The company has told users to urgently change their passwords amid the biggest criminal raid ever carried out . online. eBay is requesting that all users change their passwords. Earlier today, a message was posted under the headline 'eBay Inc. To Ask All eBay Users To Change Passwords'. The only text in the body of the post was 'placeholder text.' It was taken down within hours . The eBay database was hacked between late February and early March. It gave hackers access to encrypted passwords and other non-financial data. This included eBay customers' name, encrypted password, email address, home address, phone number and date of birth. However, the database did not contain financial information or other confidential personal data. Cyber attackers accessed the information after obtaining ‘a small number of employee login credentials’. The online market place added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members' accounts. But security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud. eBay became aware of the hack a fortnight ago but is still unsure exactly how it happened. It is unclear why it has taken eBay so long to make users aware of breach. It has been revealed that hackers accessed eBay databases by using the accounts of company employees as long ago as February. MPs have rounded on the American company for the 'inexcusable delay' in informing its customers. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, told the Telegraph: 'We . have urged companies to take much more seriously the threat of hacking. It is inexcusable that a company as important as eBay has failed to . inform its customers immediately that this has occurred. We need a full . explanation. 'We will be writing to them to ask how this happened and whether this problem has been resolved.' In a statement on their website, the . US auction site said it was asking all its users to reset their . passwords after an attack ‘compromised a database containing encrypted . passwords and other non-financial data’. Often consumers use their eBay . password for a host of other websites, including their banks, so they . may also need to make changes to these to protect their accounts from . being hijacked. Paul . Martini, the chief executive at iboss Network Security, said that the . online auction site was the 'golden goose of hacking targets'  due to . the sheer amount of information which is held. He . said that the damage could have already been done and warned that while . hackers may  not be taking money or goods out of eBay - they may be . using personal information to target other sites. An eBay spokesman said: . 'We discovered unauthorised access to our corporate network earlier in . May and immediately began a forensic investigation which discovered this . issue leading to yesterday’s announcement. 'eBay is a global marketplace and this thorough investigation worked as quickly as possible.' The company . owns and runs the internet payment system PayPal, but claimed that this . was not involved in the raid, saying: ‘PayPal data is stored separately . on a secure network, and all PayPal financial information is . encrypted.’ The firm has . 128million active users and accounted for £126billion worth of commerce . in 2013. Shares in the web giant, which has more than 14million active . users in the UK, fell by 3.2 per cent in early trading yesterday amid . fears that the company will lose the trust of their customers, leading . to a downturn in trade and profits. A spokesman added: . ‘Working with law enforcement and security experts, the company is . aggressively investigating the matter and applying the best forensics . tools and practices to protect customers. ‘Information . security and customer data protection are of paramount importance to . eBay Inc, and eBay regrets any inconvenience or concern that this . password reset may cause our customers.’ The auction site added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members' accounts. But security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud . The cyber attack was made between late February and early March, giving hackers access to eBay customers' name, encrypted password, email address, physical address, phone number and date of birth. The firm said it will be emailing users later today to inform them of the breach . ‘Our customers are our highest priority; and to . ensure they continue to have a safe, secure and trusted experience on . eBay, we will be asking all users to change their passwords. ‘There is no evidence that any financial information was accessed or compromised; but we are taking every precaution.’ But . Graham Cluley, independent security expert, said: ‘Obviously they’ve got . hold of names, addresses and dates of birth. All of this can be used to . commit identity fraud. ‘If . they have your password, and you have the same password for other . websites, hackers could access your email, your Amazon account and who . knows what else.’ And . internet security expert Paul Martini said: ‘eBay users must act and . follow the advice to change their passwords. But the damage could have . already been done, as the time lag is months between the cyber breach . and the discovery of the breach. ‘It . could well have been viewed as the golden goose of hacking targets. Its . popularity means that it holds personal details, making its a potential . gold mine.’ He added: . ‘Cyberhackers may not hit the obvious target of siphoning money or goods . out of eBay; they may take the personal information gained from the . database and target other popular sites.’ The . internet is still recovering from the Heartbleed bug, a flaw in the . OpenSSL encryption on computers that protects user information when . someone is online. The flaw . had been present for two years undetected, and offered hackers a way . into personal accounts across the web. UK parenting website Mumsnet was . the first to admit they had been a victim of the bug. Fixes, or . ‘patches’, have since been applied across the web as sites recover from . the breach in security. What personal details were stolen? Hackers gained access to eBay customers' names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. It is unclear whether all, or any, of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst. Are my credit cards details safe? The firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details, so in theory, yes. Will changing my password solve the problem? Changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen. However, they could still use names, addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud. It’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this. It’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password. If a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination. As a rule, the same password should never be used across different sites. Should I change my PayPal password as well? PayPal, which owns eBay, has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack. However, as a matter of course, it’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites, including PayPal. Which countries are affected? At the moment, we can assume that all eBay customers worldwide will be affected by this breach, until eBay says otherwise. Is this hack a result of the Heartbleed bug? When Heartbleed was exposed, eBay announced its customer’s account were secure and had not been affected. This suggests the latest hack is a separate attack. How did hackers steal the information? It is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but eBay said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question. Why did it take so long for eBay to inform customers of the breach? MailOnline has contacted eBay for an answer to this question. It is unclear what caused the delay. Typically, following cyber attacks, a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected, and the severity of the attack, before issuing advice. Early reports claimed the password change on eBay could be as a result of the worldwide Heartbleed security breach last month, but PayPal said at the time its servers weren't at risk and had not been affected .","Attack made between February and March and affects 128 million users .

"Britain faces a further wave of unemployed migrants arriving from southern Europe, as struggling Croatia became the latest country to join the EU. Croatia, which has a youth jobless rate of more than 50 per cent, became a member at midnight, meaning its citizens can travel freely to Britain from today. The news comes as a major international survey revealed tens of thousands of southern European workers have been coming here since the start of the eurozone crisis. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report reveals numbers of migrants fleeing here from countries hit by the euro crisis are close to the 100,000-a-year mark. Croatia became the latest country to join the EU . Croatia has a population of 4.2million and overall joblessness rate of more than 20 per cent. However Croatians must wait until their country has been in the EU for seven years, till 2020, before they can take jobs here. Migrants fleeing Greece, Spain and Italy to look for work in Britain have almost doubled amid the the recession, the OECD said. Spain and Greece’s emigration is more than twice the rate of 2007 and, it added, ‘the main countries of destination are Germany and the United Kingdom’. Britain received 88,000 from southern European countries in 2011 and Germany 78,000. Like citizens of Romania and Bulgaria – who will have the right to work in Britain from January – people from Croatia must wait until their country has been in the EU for seven years before they can take jobs in this country. The report said: ‘As the debt crisis has followed on the heels of the financial crisis in a number of countries, the deteriorating labour market situation in some of them has resulted in an increase in the outflows of their nationals in search of work towards other OECD countries, which have been less affected, if at all, by the economic downturn and debt crisis. ‘This is especially true for the countries of southern Europe.’ The OECD’s International Migration Outlook report added: ‘The main countries of destination are Germany and the United Kingdom, with flows to these two having almost doubled in recent years and reached 80,000 or more.’ The OECD report has derived its count from national insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals in Britain. However the official British figures for EU immigration are notoriously unreliable, since no checks are made on people coming into the country on EU passports, who enjoy the right freely to travel and work here. The Office for National Statistics uses a survey, the International Passenger Survey, carried out among arrivals at ports and airports, to reach its estimates. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovi, left, and President of the SDS party Janez Jansa at the ratification. A treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union is ratified in the Slovenian National Assembly . Unemployment in Britain is low compared to levels in other EU countries. The jobless rate here is 7.8 per cent among those willing to work, compared to 27 per cent, more than a quarter of the workforce, in both Spain and Greece. Youth unemployment in this country, among workers aged 16 to 24, is just over 20 per cent, compared to nearly 63 per cent in Greece and more than 56 per cent in Spain. Greece is suffering political unrest as well as deep economic hardship. Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said: ‘These numbers do not tally with British immigration numbers, but they do seem to be evidence that Germany and the UK are the main destination for workers from southern Europe as a result of the economic crisis.’ Croatia has gone through seven years of tortuous and often unpopular reform under Brussels instructions in order to become the 28th EU country while the eurozone remains deeply mired in crisis. It has handed over more than a dozen Croatian and Bosnian Croat military and political leaders charged with 1990s war crimes by the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. It has privatised shipyards, steeped in history and tradition but deeply indebted, and launched a high-profile fight against corruption that saw former prime minister Ivo Sanader jailed. There remain concerns at the level of graft and organised crime. Croatian citizens get immediate freedom of movement rights across the EU, but have to wait through a seven-year period before they get free access to labour markets in Britain and other EU states with the most jobs on offer. Citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, have the right to work in this country from January. There are powerful signs that many thousands will take advantage of their new right to work in Britain. The OECD figures, from national . insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals, do not correspond with . those from the Office for National Statistics.","Croatia has a population of 4.2million and overall joblessness rate of more than 20 per cent .

"Luna Park could be forced to tear down its newest ride after the harbourside amusement park failed to get proper planning approval for its 50-metre drop tower. The Hair Raiser ride, which drops at 80km per hour from 50-metres in the air, opened at the heritage-listed Luna Park last November. While it's the first new ride to be built at the 80-year-old Luna Park in a decade, it has since been revealed the theme park's operators did not lodge a development application with the NSW Department of Planning, the Mosman Daily reports. Luna Park could be forced to tear down its Hair Raiser ride after the harbourside amusement park failed to get proper planning approval for its 50-metre drop tower . The government has ordered Luna Park's owners, Brookfield Multiplex, to lodge a development application by November or they will tear the ride down. Luna Park was initially given 14 days to respond to the government in August stating their reasons why the ride should not be removed. Being listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, Luna Park must seek building approval from the Department of Planning. In their response to the government, Brookfield Multiplex claimed they interpreted the existing approval as being allowed to make alterations to rides if it was needed for operational purposes. 'The Department accepts this was genuinely Luna Park's interpretation, but we do not share it,' a department spokesman said. Being listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, Luna Park must seek building approval from the Department of Planning. The government has given them until November to lodge a development application . A department application would require consultation with residents who would be able to give their opinion on the ride. The amusement park, built in 1935, has attracted a number of complaints from nearby residents due to noise and concerns about certain rides. Luna Park has opened and closed several times over its 80 year history. It closed for the first time and had most of the park demolished  in 1979 following the infamous ghost train fire that killed six children and one adult. The amusement park closed again in 1988 due to ride repairs and just 13 months after reopening in 1995, it closed again partly due to probability. The current Luna Park has been operating since 2004 after further redevelopment.","The 50m Hair Raiser drop tower opened at Luna Park last November .

Microblogging site Sina Weibo launched in 2010 but it now has 300 million users. About 100 million messages are sent daily. But the Chinese government seems to ask Chinese companies to censor posts. Support Syrian rebels . Lying of gov (Jixian) Beijing rainstorms . Judicial independence . Freedom of speech . One-Child policy abuse . Group sex . Corpse plants in Dalian . Human Rights news . The researchers said: 'We found that deletions happen most heavily in the first hour after a post has been submitted. 'Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we observed that nearly 30 per cent of the total deletion events occur within five to 30 minutes. 'Nearly 90 per cent of the deletions happen within the first 24 hours. 'Leveraging out data, we also consider a variety of hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which they use retrospective keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet popularity interacts with censorship. 'We also perform a topical analysis of the deleted posts, overcoming the usage of neologisms, named entities, and informal language that typifies Chinese social media.' Crandall and Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo. During that time, 300 of the accounts, or 12 percent of the total, were deleted. Accounts that got censored the most often also had posts censored the most quickly, showing that they might be the target of more scrutiny. Though they could not estimate the exact number of people dedicated to deleting posts on Sina Weibo, the two computer scientists said that the company would need to employ at least 4,000 censors every day if none of the process was automated. In December last year the ruling Communist arty, led Xi Jinping, announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country. It's draconian internet censorship system has been dubbed the 'Great Firewall of China'. China already heavily restricts access to many foreign sites. It blocks Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and many other websites citing a need to maintain social stability.","Study was carried out by computer scientists Jed Crandell and Dan Wallach .

"'Easy-to-assemble' labels might adorn boxes for flat-pack beds or bookshelves - but for a house? A Canadian company has designed a sleek 10ft by 10ft 'micro-home' with a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen that can be sent anywhere in the world and assembled within days. And the company, based in Vancouver, claims that not only is the tiny property space effective, but it's also cost effective - priced between $25,000 and $28,000 - and good for the environment, too. The house has been designed and built but now the company, NOMAD, is seeking funding through an online campaign to test prototypes and develop infrastructure for larger scale production. Scroll down for video . A (small) place to call home: Canadian company NOMAD has designed a $25,000 10ft by 10ft 'micro-home' that can be shipped anywhere in the world and assembled easily by its new owners within days . The two-storey home features a living room, snug kitchen and toilet room on the ground floor, and steps lead to a double bed and closet on the first floor. The smart interiors make the most of the space, fitting a bed beneath a . slanted roof and the stairs above the kitchen sink. The bathroom doubles as a shower while storage can be used as seating. The exterior comes with an optional deck . that wraps around two sides of the home, adding a few extra feet, and . it can also be fitted with outdoor storage lockers or sun shades. NOMAD explains that the micro-home can be shipped anywhere on the planet and can be assembled within days. Snug: The home is fitted with a living room, kitchen and bathroom on the ground floor of the structure . Home: It is light enough to ship but durable enough to insulate and protect against the elements . Upstairs: It also makes the most of its space - doubling up storage units as seats here in the bedroom . Compact: The designers say the small home gives a green, cost-effective way to live and simplify your life . It means that the property is . lightweight - reducing assembly time and shipping costs - and yet . durable, protecting the owners from fire, moisture and termites. They have used light, specialized . layered wall panels that minimize the need for heat. The home is also . fitted with solar panels and a rainwater collection system to lessen the . owners' energy use. The . company says the home can be built in urban or rural landscapes and . could be used as a home office or studio. It could even be used for . shelters in disaster zones. By . opting for a 'build-your-own' feature, rather than a factory assembling . the home, the property's costs are drastically reduced, the company . explains on its website. In a promotional video, NOMAD's president Ian Kent explains that the micro-home is a solution to the problem of costly, limited housing. In the mail: The walls, windows and counters are sent flat-pack to the owners along with the faucet . Sleek: Sketches show the storage space in the kitchen beneath stairs that lead to the bedroom . Making the most of the space: The bathroom, on the ground floor, also doubles as a shower room . Neighborhood: The designers said the units could be used for a work space or studio in urban or rural settings, and could even be used for quick housing during natural disasters or developing countries . 'The . world would be a better place if housing was more affordable and . accessible to everyone,' he said. 'But the reality is that . supply and demand has made it too expensive for most - at least for the . sized house we're accustomed to. 'If houses were smaller, more efficient . and easier to build, this reality could change.' He . said that already people are shaking up their living spaces to build . smaller homes that give them a simpler lifestyle across North America, . Europe and the United Kingdom. 'They've taken stock of their daily lives, then dismantled and reassembled them to reflect a new personal philosophy,' he said. NOMAD hopes to raise $120,000 online to develop the project. It has raised $23,000 so far.","10ft by 10ft home is sent in flat-pack boxes and assembled by the owner .

"A female soldier who befriended a heroic bomb-hunting dog in Afghanistan tracked down her comrade and gave him a new home after he became too timid to serve on the front lines. Angie McDonnell, 40, a reservist who served in war-torn Helmand province as a medic, became 'best friends' with four-year-old Vidar while the two were based at Camp Bastion. But after they had served together, her canine friend - a Belgian Malinois - developed symptoms akin to post-traumatic stress disorder and started to lose his sight - which left him at risk of being put down. Best friends: Angie McDonnell served alongside four-year-old Vidar in Afghanistan . Returning the favour: Mrs McDonnell believes Vidar saved her life by sniffing out a cache of Taliban explosives - so she saved him from being put down . Vidar, a military sniffer dog, hunted down stashes of Taliban weaponry, and found a huge cache of guns and explosives on a routine patrol in April 2012. Mrs McDonnell believes the haul of weapons - which was seized and defused by British weapons experts - was about to be used in an attack on her and her comrades, which was foiled by Vidar's skilful find. The Army reservist, who works full-time . as a paramedic, said: 'He saved my life so it’s only fair that I did . what I could to save his. 'The . dogs out there are heroes and I knew from the first moment I saw him . that he was a one-in-a-million. He looked like he needed a cuddle so I . went into his kennel and rubbed his belly. 'We became best friends out there and I was sad to leave him when I returned home. 'When I heard he had been retired after staring to get scared, I knew I had to track him down to help him. 'I would have done anything to make sure he had a loving home.' At war: Mrs McDonnell served as a medic based at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province . 'Perfect pet': Mrs McDonnell said she was worried Vidar would be overlooked for adoption in favour of cuter breeds of dog, so took him in herself . The pair were inseparable during their months of joint service, and would go on runs together and play in the dusty desert between their regular duties. Vidar stayed in Afghanistan when Mrs McDonnell, who served with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and the 1st Royal Regiment of Fusiliers for a six-month tour. But she later heard her canine friend was experiencing the PTSD-like symptoms after his second tour of duty. She also heard that his eyes were failing, making it unlikely he would be able to return to his former heroic work. Mrs McDonnell was eventually able to track Vidarn down to a training camp in Germany, from which she was able to arrange for her companion to be sent home. He now lives a happy retirement with her in Barry, South Wales. Desert companions: Mrs McDonnell and Vidar are pictured above in the Afghan desert . Retirement: Vidar now lives happily with Mrs McDonnell is Barry, South Wales . Lively: Despite Vidar's vibrant personality, he has managed not to damage any furniture at home . She added: 'I had to find him after he had been such a hero in Afghanistan. 'The dogs out there do an amazing job, protecting the men and women serving their country from dangerous IEDs. 'They don’t have the fear factor so it broke my heart that after working so hard he had started to get scared. 'Really cute labradors and springer spaniels get rehomed easily but because he’s such a big dog I was worried no-one would want him and there was a chance he would get put down. 'I thought we’d have the house torn apart when we brought him home because he wasn’t used to living with a family but he’s not ripped anything up. 'He’s just the perfect dog and I’m so happy I can repay him for saving my life while we served together.'","Angie McDonnell met Vidar, a Belgian Malinois, while serving in Helmand .

"A Labour politician has spoken out about losing his virginity at the age of five to an alien holographic. Simon Parkes, a councillor in Whitby, North Yorkshire, says he has been visited and taken by extra-terrestrials ever since being in his mother's womb, and has no fear of them. The 53-year-old added that anyone who felt his beliefs made him an unsuitable representative for Stakesby should not worry, as he is never taken by the aliens during meetings since they do not like large gatherings of people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Simon Parkes said he is visited by green aliens called Mantids, who are seven feet tall and wear cloaks, and produced a drawing he had done of one . The Councillor and driving instructor appeared on ITV's This Morning today to explain to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield that he wished to destigmatise alien visitations and encourage others like him to come forward with their stories. He said that only by thousands of people coming forward every day would the media's attitude change. Cllr Parkes explained that he had been visited by aliens ever since being inside his mother's womb, when he has 'a very clear . memory of a face with no real distinguishing features', and then 'suddenloy being . aware that there was much more to this world than i knew'. He describes it as 'a spiritual experience'. He said that the type of alien he was most frequently visited by were Mantids - green, seven feet tall - and produced his drawing of one who frequently comes to visit him wearing a cloak. Simon on This Morning with Holly and Phil, showing them a picture of the alien who visits him . Cllr Parkes then described losing his virginity to one of the aliens in 1965, when he was five or six years old. He said: 'It was a holographic sexual experience so I didn't exactly lose my virginity... it was using much more advanced technology than anything we have on Earth, or anything the army think they have. To aliens it's not about age, it's about experience and souls.' Aware that 'some people can't handle the truth', Cllr Parkes suggested that anyone who felt he was unsuitable for the role of Councillor in Whitby instead 'vent your angry spleen on those members of parliament who stole money, . who defrauded the country, who got others to take penalty points for . them, on those great tycoons and bankers who nearly destroyed Britain'. Holly and Phil interviewing Cllr Parkes about his beliefs this morning . He added: 'When i was elected I'd already gone public. What people want is someone . to fights and defend Whitby. My policies are very strong and very clear. Nobody has asked  me to resign because this is a private matter.' When Philip wondered if being taken by aliens might clash with his duties, Parkes said: 'I am not taken during meetings. These creatures do not want attention . drawn to themselves. And they don't have an agenda or oppose me discussing this, otherwise i wouild have . been stopped.' Cllr Parkes has already spoken publicly about rowing with his wife after revealing he had a child called Zarka with an alien he refers to as the Cat Queen. The driving instructor said he has sexual relations with the alien about four times a year. Whitby Town councillor Simon Parkes, who believes he has had 'hundreds' of encounters with aliens throughout his life and (left) a drawing he made of his alien mother . 'What will happen is that we will hold hands and I will say ""I'm ready"" and then the technology I don't understand will take us up to a craft orbiting the earth,' he explained. 'My wife found out about it and was very unhappy, clearly. That caused a few problems, but it is not on a human level, so I don't see it as wrong.' Cllr Parkes, who also claims his 'real mother' is a 9ft green alien with eight fingers, said people only claim he is mad because they have not shared his experiences and that the encounters don't affect his work on behalf of Whitby residents. 'I can understand how you would say that because you have not seen anything yourself and that's your immediate fall-back position, but you come and spend some time with me and follow me around for a day and you will actually walk away shaking your head because you will think actually he's not mad. 'There are plenty of people in my position who don't chose to come out and say it because they are terrified it will destroy their careers.' He told Channel 4 documentary Confessions Of An Alien Abductee his first recollection is of being lifted out of his cot by an alien.

Councillor Parkes, who spends hours . drawing his extra-terrestrial experiences as it helps him to comes to . terms with them, said: 'The only thing I can remember after that is it . saying to me you will never be hurt, your will never be harmed. 'I think I am fairly clear in my head that I am being monitored [by aliens] very closely and if there is anything that's seriously about to happen or does happen then I am fairly confident in my own mind that they will intervene, they have in the past.' He said he is also often followed by the security services and that he and a female passenger in his car were recently abducted by aliens in Cloughton, near Scarborough, before being returned to the vehicle as it moved.'","Whitby councillor Simon Parkes is a married father-of-three .

"Casey Anthony has become the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive liar and heartless mother who murdered her own . daughter so she could spend her life shopping and partying. But with today's sensational not-guilty verdict, the 25-year-old could be free as early as Thursday morning to begin the slow process of rebuilding her life - and cash in on her new-found celebrity status. There is already speculation the compelling case could be turned into a movie, and she is likely to be inundated with . lucrative television and book deals worth millions of dollars. Despite the acquittal of capital murder charges, the Casey family lawyer said it was too early to say if they would welcome Casey back. Sheer relief: Casey Anthony reacts after she is found not guilty of murder in Orlando today - but she will now have to pick up the pieces of her life and confront her family after a trial that ripped the Anthonys apart . Speaking after the verdict he said: 'The family hopes that they will be . given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the . best way to move forward privately.' Although Casey smiled and broke into tears . of delight as she learned she had escaped the death penalty, she is . also likely to face the fear of attack from an angry public who were . stunned by the jury's decision. She will also have to confront her . family, which was torn apart after her defence team dramatically accused . both her father and brother of sexually abusing her. Only one thing will be certain when she . walks out of the Florida courtroom: Anthony will never again . live an anonymous life. Anthony's trial, for the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee in June 2008, has captivated the nation. Countless chat shows will give her the . opportunity of telling her story for the first time - an offer she seems . likely to take up, after her defence team had to dissuade her from . giving testimony at the trial. And because she has been found not guilty, there is nothing to stop Anthony selling her story to the highest bidder. Adult entertainment company Vivid has even offered her a career as a porn star. After her release, it is not clear where she will live, or how she will be reintegrated into society. What does the future hold? Casey Anthony breaks down as the verdict is read out, left, and she breaks into a smile, right. She is now likely to be inundated with countless chat show offers and book deals . Stony-faced: In stark contrast to the scenes of jubilation, Cindy and George Anthony were the first to leave the courtroom today, and remained emotionless as the verdict was read out . She will face constant security fears, and it seems unlikely police will continue to provide protection after her release from jail. Anthony found herself abandoned by many of her friends during her trial, who gave evidence saying she was proud of being a . 'good liar', and even entered a 'hot body' competition at a night club . just days after defence lawyers claimed Caylee drowned. It seems impossible that Anthony could return . to her parents' Florida home, after the trial ripped the family apart . with allegations of rape and incest. In a statement after the verdict, Cindy and George Anthony described their daughter's defence as 'baseless', but said they had achieved 'closure for this chapter of their life. Anthony appears to have become close to her legal team, and she may stay with defence attorneys Jose Baez or Dorothy Sims, who wept . after the not-guilty verdict was read out. Her freedom means she could also resume the party-loving life for which the prosecution claimed she murdered her daughter. Shocked: Crowds of people gathered outside the courtroom for the verdict, and many were visibly stunned by the jury's decision . Outrage: Cathy Cooper expresses her shock to the amassed media outside the Orange County Courthouse . Despite the not-guilty verdict, Anthony will face an upward struggle to clear her name. Her trial attracted intense media . attention, and there were even fights in the courtroom as angry members . of the public attempted to catch a glimpse of the woman portrayed as a . cold-hearted murderess. She was condemned by her own defence team in court as a liar, and the . jury convicted her on four counts of deceiving police as she wove a web . of lies following her daughter's disappearance. Although each of those misdemeanour . counts carries up to a year in prison, she is likely to walk free at . sentencing on Thursday after having already spent three years in jail. Anthony . will struggle to rebuild her relationship with her parents. Cindy and . George Anthony stood by their daughter throughout the investigation and . trial, risking foreclosure on their home by paying her legal bills. Mrs . Anthony even tried to protect her daughter by apparently lying to the . court, claiming she, rather than Casey, carried out searches for . chloroform on the home computer. Innocent victim: Caylee Anthony, whose skeletal remains were found with evidence that her mouth and nose had been covered in duct tape . But Anthony's own lawyers dropped a bombshell which rocked the entire trial when they accused her father of sexually abusing her since the age of eight. They alleged Caylee drowned in a swimming pool, and at her father's insistence Anthony tried to cover up the death. During testimony, the defence also questioned whether tests had been . conducted to determine if Casey Anthony's brother Lee was the father of . her daughter Caylee. The judge ordered her legal team not to mention the incest allegations in their closing arguments, but the shocking claims will make it impossible for the Anthonys to return to anything resembling a normal family life. Winners: Cheney Mason and Dorothy Clay Sims speak to the media after their client Casey Anthony was sensationally spared the death penalty with a not guilty verdict for murder . Defeated: Assistant state attorneys Jeff Ashton and Linda Drane Burdick sit at the prosecution table, seemingly in shock, after the verdict . Mr and Mrs Anthony were expressionless as the verdict was read out, and left the court as their daughter was still being embraced by her jubilant legal team. If she is released as expected on Thursday, it is likely she will be looked after by her lawyers in the short-term. The Orlando Sentinel reported that . she had just $94.49 in her bank account last Wednesday, and she has . largely been supported by her parents. But even before today's verdict, . Anthony had received donations from wellwishers across the nation, . allowing her to buy personal items while she was on trial, including . shampoo, black mascara, nachos and BBQ chips. She seems to have spent much of her time writing, ordering two boxes of 20 pens to be delivered to her prison cell during her trial. Those wellwishers may come to her aid now, as she prepares herself for life outside prison for the first time in three years.","Casey could be free as early as Thursday .

"The mother of a young Michigan boy who told her he had no friends to invite to his 11th birthday party created a Facebook page so family friends could wish him happy birthday - that now has more than 13,000 likes. Kalamazoo mother-of-two Jennifer mentioned her son Colin's 11th birthday to him and was heartbroken when he told her he didn't want to have a party because he had no friends to invite. Jennifer wanted to show Colin that there were many people who cared for him on his birthday, so she created a Facebook page a little over a week ago, with the intention of showing it to Colin on his birthday, March 9. Birthday boy: Colin is turning 11 on March 9 but doesn't want a party because he doesn't have any friends to invite . She hoped, she said, to get about 50 responses from friends and family, but what she got was an outpouring of love and support for her son from around the world. Colin was diagnosed with sensory processing disorders last year, reports Wood TV, which are similar to autism and Asbergers syndrome. He finds it difficult to socialize and tends to act out in certain situations. 'Things like lights and sound and changes will cause him to melt down,' Jennifer told Wood TV. 'When you put a bunch of 10 year olds and one who acts like that, and they are all going, ""What’s wrong with that kid?"" You know, it’s hard.' Well-liked: Judging from the Facebook page his mom set up for his birthday, Colin is a lot more popular than he thought . Performer: Colin loves making video recordings full of humorous observations and aspires to be a comedian one day . Jennifer wrote on the Happy Birthday Colin page that other children at school don't like him and that he eats his lunch every day alone in the office. She wanted to throw him a birthday party but Colin didn't seem keen. 'We were talking about his birthday coming up and I had mentioned it a few times and he said he didn’t want a party. And I said, ""Why don’t you want a party?""' Jennifer told Wood TV. 'Mom, who am I going to invite? I don’t have any friends,' Colin responded. Beloved: Colin's mom Jennifer and sister Ella can't wait to surprise him on his birthday, when Ella says he'll probably 'scream his pants off' Jennifer decided to show Colin he did have friends - but even she didn't realize quite how many. Bright: Colin's story has inspired people from around the world to share their stories of schoolyard hardships and words of encouragement . 'I thought, if I could create a page . where people could send him positive thoughts and encouraging words, . that would be better than any birthday party,' Jennifer wrote on . Facebook. Colin, a fifth-grader who is obsessed with Dr Who, aspires to be a comedian, loves his Nintendo Ds and is very close to his little sister Ella, has no idea about the page's existence. Jennifer is planning to keep the secret for almost another month until Colin's birthday and will record his reaction to post on the Facebook page. 'What do you think Colin's going to do when he sees it?' Jennifer asked her daughter Ella in a video the two posted on Facebook. 'Ummmm,' says Ella. 'Scream his pants off?' In addition to the Facebook page, Jennifer has also added a postal address where well-wishers can send Colin a birthday card, after requests from Facebook commentators. People from as far away as Scotland, Australia and Switzerland have written to wish Colin a happy birthday, and to share their own school stories with him.","A Facebook page set up by a Michigan mother for her son's 11th birthday has captured attention from around the world .

"A large house spider might seem like a thoughtless killing machine, but a team of biologists claim arachnids have distinct personalities. While some individuals might be aggressive, other arachnids could be naturally 'timid' and docile',the researchers said. They studied social grass spiders and found that a spider's personality not only determines the creature's survival, but contributes to the success of failure of its society. Scientists studied social grass spiders (like this one in a tunnel web) and found that a spider's personality not only determines the creature's well-being, but contributes to the success of failure of its society . Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, led by Jonathan Pruitt, found the spiders could be timid or aggressive and prone to sexual cannibalism. While most spiders live solitary lives and territorial of their webs, a handful of species live in social groups where females share the upkeep of the web as well as jobs like raising their young and defending their home from intruders. The study, which took six years and was published in journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, in July, examined sociable grass spiders. The researchers categorised the spiders into two groups - aggressive or docile - to investigate how the mixture of personalities serves the community's well-being. They established three different spider colonies in Tennessee, beginning with a pair of docile spiders, a pair of aggressive spiders and a mixed pair. While some spiders might be aggressive, other arachnids could be naturally 'timid' and docile,' scientists said - which might go some way to helping some people become less afraid of the creatures. The researchers believe spiders have personalities . Leaving each colonies to go forth and multiplying the wild, the scientists checked on the creatures' progress every summer for six years. While the docile colony seemed to be thriving at first - reproducing faster than the others and spreading colonies nearby - their webs were invaded by more aggressive species that stole their food and eggs as well as eating the passive hosts. At the end of the six year term, the colonies descended from the docile pair were extinct, while the colonies started by aggressive pairs and a mixture of the two personalities survived, even if their colonies got off to a slower start as they reproduced more slowly. The biologists found that the animals' personalities didn't matter if there was no common enemy as when there were no invading species, all the colonies thrived. While the docile colony of grass spiders (like the one pictured) seemed to be thriving at first - reproducing faster than the others and spreading colonies nearby - their webs were invaded by more aggressive species that stole their food and eggs as well as eating the passive hosts . Dr Pruitt said the aggressive spiders acted like the colony's immune system. He told the Orlando Sentinel: 'They keep this social disease, these parasites, at a low abundance.' They also found that while bold spiders were often aggressive there was no link to their body size and larger spiders could be docile. 'Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social spider independent of age,' the write in the study. The researchers have now turned their attention to other species and are looking at sexual cannibalism in grass spiders as well as social spiders in India and Africa. They are also examining the personalities of tiny slave-making ants that enslave other ant species inside acorns and force them to find their food and raise their young. Dr Pruitt said: 'Sometimes they'll have a revolt and kill the slavemakers, but it's pretty infrequent. I bet you it has something to do with their personality types.'","U.S. researchers found a spider's personality not only determines the creature's well-being, but contributes to the success of failure of its society .

"Three fire engines and at least twelve firefighters were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a child's swing. The girl slid herself into the swing in Finsbury Park, north London, yesterday afternoon, but was unable to get out without assistance. The large contingent of firefighters, who arrived in three separate fire engines, were eventually able to free her after removing the swing from its frame. Trapped: The girl had got herself stuck in the child's swing in Finsbury Park, north London . Response: Three fire engines, which would have been carrying between 12 and 15 firefighters, can be scene attending the incident . It is believed the girl was freed after the firefighters were able to slide the swing off of her legs. A bystander told MailOnline: 'She had her hands in her head, . embarrassed, and was being filmed by her family and was clearly stuck in . the child's swing.' 'A lot of firemen had showed up - they were there for about 15 minutes. They . took the chains off the swing and managed to slide it off of her.

'Embarrassed': Passers-by watched as several firemen attempted to free the girl from the swing . Crowd: The incident was reportedly filmed by friends of the girl . A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: 'We were called just after 6pm yesterday to a child stuck in a swing. 'We take anything to do with children seriously, and send the correct response for any eventuality. 'We never know exactly what we're going to find until we get there, but once we ascertained what it was we were able to free the child from the swing and get our fire engines away quickly.' 'Two fire engines and a fire rescue vehicle was sent.

"Thousands of gun advocates gathered peacefully Saturday at state capitals around the U.S. to rally against stricter limits on firearms, with demonstrators carrying rifles and pistols in some places while those elsewhere settled for waving hand-scrawled signs or screaming themselves hoarse. The size of crowds at each location varied - from dozens of people in South Dakota to 2,000 in New York. Large crowds also turned out in Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington state. Some demonstrators in Olympia, Wash., Phoenix, Salem, Ore., and Salt Lake City came with holstered handguns or rifles on their backs. At the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort, attendees gave a special round of applause for 'the ladies that are packin'. Representing: In Albany, New York, an estimated two thousand people rallied outside the State Capitol brandishing signs, flags and weapons . Hartford: A man who refused to be identified holds an AR-15 semi-automatic riffle with a green and white ribbon reading Newtown at the Capitol in Hartford, Connecticut . Clear message: Jared Jeanotte of Long Island, New York, displays a hand-made sign depicting an AK15 rifle and its alleged purpose to kill fascists . Activists promoted the 'Guns Across America' rallies primarily through social media. They were being held just days after President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping package of federal gun-control proposals. The crowd swelled to more than 800 amid balmy temperatures on the steps of the pink-hued Capitol in Austin, where speakers took the microphone under a giant Texas flag with 'Independent' stamped across it. Homemade placards read 'An Armed Society is a Polite Society,' 'The Second Amendment Comes from God' and 'Hey King O., I'm keeping my guns and my religion.' 'The thing that so angers me, and I think so angers you, is that this president is using children as a human shield to advance a very liberal agenda that will do nothing to protect them,' said state Rep. Steve Toth, referencing last month's elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn. Toth, a first-term Republican lawmaker from The Woodlands outside Houston, has introduced legislation banning within Texas any future federal limits on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, though such a measure would violate the U.S. Constitution. According to organizers an estimated 1,800 people from throughout Oklahoma crowded into the south plaza at the state Capitol to voice their support for their second amendment rights . Attacks: A protestor holds a sign showing Gov Andrew Cuomo's face, four days after he signed the nation's toughest assault weapon and magazine restrictions for the state . Speaker: New York Assemblyman Steven F. McLaughlin called Gov Cuomo's new law an 'abuse of power' before the thousands of protestors . Rallies at statehouses nationwide were organized by Eric Reed, an airline captain from the Houston area who in November started a group called 'More Gun Control (equals) More Crime.' Its Facebook page has been 'liked' by more than 17,000 people. Texas law allows concealed handgun license-holders to carry firearms anywhere, but Reed said rally-goers shouldn't expose their weapons: 'I don't want anyone to get arrested.' A man who identified himself only as 'Texas Mob Father' carried a camouflaged assault rifle strapped to his back during the Austin rally, but he was believed to be the only one to display a gun. Radio personality Alan LaFrance told the crowd he brought a Glock 19, but he kept it out of sight. At the New York state Capitol in Albany, about 2,000 people turned out for a chilly rally, where they chanted 'We the People,' 'USA,' and 'Freedom.' Many carried American flags and 'Don't Tread On Me' banners. The event took place four days after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the nation's toughest assault weapon and magazine restrictions. Republican Assemblyman Steven McLaughlin said the new law was 'abuse of power' by the governor. Some in the crowd carried 'Impeach Cuomo' signs. Protester Robert Candea called the restrictions 'an outrage against humanity.' Voices heard: Braving the cold, the protestors passionately turned out to send a message to legislatures around the country . All the people: A little girl carried her own colorful sign on the shoulders of a male protestor . Magazine rights: Sisters Naphtali Rothrock, left, and Naomi Rothrock, both of Sprakers, New York joined the thousands in Albany . Representing: John Noto of Springville, New York holds two signs attacking Gov Cuomo and representing his political views as a Conservative America . Fascism: Will Moses, of Eagle Bridge, New York holds a sign depicting Gov Cuomo as a fascist . About 1,500 people showed up in Olympia, Wash. Former NFL tight end Clint Didier, who unsuccessfully ran for the GOP Senate nomination in the 2010 election, urged the crowd to prepare 'for the worst possible predicament' by stocking up on food, guns, ammunition, communication devices and medicines, The Olympian newspaper reported. In Connecticut, where task forces created by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy are considering changes to gun laws, police said about 1,000 people showed up on the Capitol grounds. One demonstrator at the rally in Maine, Joe Getchell of Pittsfield, said every law-abiding citizen has a right to bear arms. In Minnesota, where more than 500 people showed up at the Capitol in St. Paul, Republican state Rep. Tony Cornish said he would push to allow teachers to carry guns in school without a principal or superintendent's approval and to allow 21-year-olds to carry guns on college campuses. Capitol rallies also took place in Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin, among other states. Back in Texas, Houston resident Robert Thompson attended the rally with his wife and children, ages 12, 5 and 4. Many in the family wore T-shirts reading: 'The Second Amendment Protects the First.' Not to blame: A protestor's sign reasons that more gun laws won't stop those who are already crazy in America . Turn out: The 'Guns Across America' rallies were held just days after President Obama unveiled a sweeping package of gun-control proposals . Patriots: In Hartford gun right supporters took a few moments to place their hands to their hearts and pledged their allegiance to the flag . Symbols: Keeping warm while maintaining their patriotism in Albany, a demonstrator wrapped himself in an American flag . New Hampshire: Hundreds of gun supporters rallied at the Statehouse in Concord . Texas: In Austin, Steve Wandtke turned out wearing tea bags hanging from his hat in the state capitol . 'What we are facing now is an assault weapons ban, but if they do this, what will do they do next?' Thompson asked. William Lawson drove more than four hours from Wichita Falls and held up a sign reading 'Modern Musket' over the image of an assault rifle and the words, 'An American Tradition since 1776.' 'I'm not some wild-eyed person who wants to fight in the streets,' Lawson said. 'This is a country of laws. But I want to protect our Constitution.' Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson conceded that the Second Amendment sometimes leads to killings, but he told the crowd that the First Amendment can be just as dangerous. Patterson said news coverage of those responsible for mass shootings can spark copy-cat shootings. 'All of us here, together, are right about our liberty,' Patterson said. 'And we will not back down.'","'Guns Across America' rallies held days after President .

"The former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood has said it would be 'an honor' to join the caliphate in a letter to ISIS, it has been reported. Nidal Hasan has apparently requested to be made a 'citizen soldier' of the caliphate in the letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Hasan opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women on November 5, killing 13 and injuring 30 others. Scroll down for video . Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan (pictured) has apparently requested to be made a 'citizen soldier' of the caliphate in the letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . Hasan has reportedly said it would be 'an honor' to become a citizen of the caliphate. Pictured are ISIS militants marching in Raqqa, Syria . He was shot and paralyzed from the waist down in the resulting gunfire and was sentenced to death last year. Earlier this year FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the shooting carried out by Hasan at Fort Hood in Texas was inspired by al-Qaeda. The federal government has termed the attack an incidence of 'workplace violence,' saying that the home-grown Hasan didn't meet the legal definition of an international terrorist. In an undated letter, obtained by Fox News,  Hasan reportedly requests to be made a 'citizen' of the Islamic State. He goes on to say it would be 'an honor for any believer to be an obedient citizen soldier to a people and its leader who don't compromise the religion of All-Mighty Allah to get along with the disbelievers.' It is unclear at what point the letter was intercepted after it was sent to al-Baghdadi. Hasan walked into a Fort Hood medical readiness building in November 2009 carrying two guns and several magazines of ammunition. He shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' - Arabic for 'God is great!' - and opened fire on soldiers awaiting medical tests and vaccines. First responders prepared wounded for transport and pronounced the casualties' deaths outside Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Processing Center on November 5, 2009 . Fort Hood mourned as one during a memorial service the day after Hasan opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women . Hasan described himself at trial as a soldier who 'switched sides' in a supposed war between America and Islam. Government lawyers also said Hasan did not want to go on an impending deployment to Afghanistan. In August, a military jury sentenced Hasan to death for the shooting rampage at Fort Hood, delivering the only punishment the Army believed fit for a massacre of unarmed fellow soldiers that killed 13 people and injured 30. A second American reportedly killed while fighting for the Islamic State in Syria was yesterday identified as a father-of-nine from Minneapolis who had vowed to 'give up this worldly life for Allah'. Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, is believed to have died last week in the same battle as U.S. rapper Douglas McArthur McCain, who grew up in the same city. Two sources confirmed Muhumed's identity and said a picture of his body had been sent to his family from Syria, according to Fox News. State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said the U.S. has no independent confirmation of the reports, but added that officials were 'looking into it.' Radicalised: This picture tweeted earlier this year by journalist Mukhtar Ibrahim shows Abdirahmaan Muhumed who is believed to be the second American killed last week while fighting for the Islamic State . Muhumed was identified earlier this year as one of a host of disillusioned young Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities lured by ISIS fighters in a sinister new phenomenon dubbed 'Jihad Cool'. NBC cited an anonymous member of the opposition Free Syrian Army as saying two Americans were killed in a battle last week with Islamic State fighters. The U.S. confirmed the death of  McCain, who grew up outside Minneapolis in the town of New Hope and most recently lived in San Diego. A relative, Kenneth McCain, told The Associated Press that the State Department called to tell his family that Douglas McCain had been killed in Syria. 'We do not know if he was fighting anyone,' he said. Investigators were aware that McCain was in Syria to fight with the militant group, said a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss by name an ongoing investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Surveillance flights have begun over Syria on the orders of President Barack Obama, a move that could pave the way for airstrikes against the Islamic State group.","Nidal Hasan claimed it would be 'an honor' to join ISIS caliphate in letter .

"A four-month-old Orangutan is recovering after having the tips of his fingers hacked off, allegedly during forest clearances for a new oil palm plantation in Indonesian Borneo. Sura, who was discovered by a resident of the Tumbang Koling village in East Kotawaringin Regency, is being nursed back to health by specialists at the Nyaru Menteng Rescue centre. Vets carried out a full health check and discovered three of his fingers had been severed by either a knife or machete. Tragic: Four-month-old Sura was found in the wreckage of his home with fingers hacked by a machete . Sura now needs to be cared for by a full-time babysitter. British charity Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation is helping fund the centre and Sura's care. It is the latest scandal to emerge in the . controversy over deforestation as companies plough through Indonesia's wildlife to build oil . plantations.

And now homeless, many have been captured by local villagers, abused, and used for entertainment. Last month, International Animal Rescue saved an orangutan from Tempurkan, which had no food or water and was being forced to dance and fight with humans. Alerted by a villager, the charity found Ael - which means 'Saint' - sedated her and then moved her to a rescue centre. She will be released into the wild when a safe area in the forest can be found for her. Meanwhile, the villagers have been told that catching and keeping an orangutan is against the law in Indonesia.","Sura, four months, was found wounded in Tumbang Koling, in Indonesian Borneo, after a forest was cleared for a new oil palm plantation .

"It was already shaping up to be one of the greatest missions this decade, but now Rosetta could turn out to be one of the most amazing space endeavours of all time. Remarkable new photos have shown that its target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is actually what is known as a ‘contact binary’. This means it is likely two comets stitched together, in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse for the spacecraft as it nears its approach. Stunning images of the comet Rosetta is heading towards were released last month. Shown here, they reveal that the comet previously thought to be a single object actually has two parts. How these two parts came to be is not known, but more information will be gleaned in the next few months . According to the BBC, how the comet took this form is unknown. A contact binary occurs when two celestial objects, such as asteroids or comets, slowly move towards each other until they are touching. The slow approach of the two means they will form a single-oddly shaped body, rather than rebounding of one another. Nine near-Earth objects are known to be contact binaries. However, it is estimated that as many as 15 per cent of all near-Earth asteroids more than 650 feet (200 metres) in size are actually contact binaries. It could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second. What is certain, though, is that it poses some intriguing problems for Esa. The most notable will be the planning landing of the Philae probe on its surface in November. This will be the first cometary landed ever attempted - but now a decision will be made on what part of the comet to land on. Irregardless, Rosetta is still planning to enter orbit around the comet on 6 August. The orbit will gradually be lowered to 19 miles (30 kilometres) once the gravitational field of the comet is known - which could be more odd than expected given its shape. The new observations suggest the comet is 2.2 by 2.5 miles (3.5 by 4 kilometres) in size, reports The Planetary Society's Emily Lakdawalla. According to Philae navigator Eric Jurado, ‘navigation around such a body should not be much more complex than around a nucleus of irregular spherical type.’ But, he adds, ‘landing the Philae probe, however, could be more difficult, as this form restricts potential landing zones.’ The images taken by Rosetta reveal a two-lobed comet rather than the single comet expected. This could make a planned landing in November by the Philae probe more difficult. Rosetta is due to enter orbit on 6 August after ten years of travel, when more will be known about the comet. Credits: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for Osiris Team et al . Speaking to MailOnline Pedro Lacerda, astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and part of the team analysing results of the Rosetta mission, said: '67P does seem to be made of two lumps. 'On one hand this is unexpected, because the shape model we had based on observations from Earth didn’t predict a binary structure. That just highlights the importance of these missions - they tell us more. 'On the other hand, three of the five comets previously visited by spacecraft seem to be composed of two chunks too, so it could be that binary comets are quite common. 'Now we need to find out what this is telling us. Is this a result of the way comets form, or is it a consequence of their evolution? 'Hopefully, Rosetta will point us to the answer. The Kuiper belt, where this comet is believe to originate, seems to have a very high fraction of binaries, up to 30 per cent depending on where you look, which is also interesting. 'It could be that many of these objects start out as binaries. 'In terms of the landing, I think the binary shape just raises more interesting questions. 'Where do we land so that we maximise the science return? Technically, it probably does not change much. The landing will be challenging no matter what.' The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet . Rosetta will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. The . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its . final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For . the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation. Rosetta will enter orbit around the comet in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s . surface in November. While . in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet's composition, . which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar . system and discover the origin of comets. Rosetta has been firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it's hurtling towards the comet. There will be a total of four before Rosetta comes . within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the comet in early August, beyond . the orbit of Mars. The final rendezvous will require two more precision maneuvers. The probe, launched a decade ago, will spend time observing 67P before dropping a lander called Philae onto its icy surface in November. If the Philae . lander is successful it will become the first vehicle ever to land on a . comet. The comet is about 2.5 miles (four kilometres) long and orbits the Sun every six-and-a-half years. Once . at the comet Rosetta will follow it on its journey around the sun, . performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface. The . spacecraft's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit, bringing . it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet. In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings . The comet is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. Even . though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - . its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to . gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus. As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma. The . warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity . rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of . the material to stream out into a long tail. This will give Rosetta some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet's emissions and find out more about its composition. Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, when they will be between the orbits of Earth and Mars. On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk .","Stunning images of the comet Rosetta is heading to have been revealed .

"Two knee surgeons in Belgium have found a new body part - a previously unknown ligament in the human knee. The surgeons, at University Hospitals Leuven, believe their finding could explain why people with repaired knee injuries find the joint sometimes gives way during exercise. Orthopaedic surgeons Dr Steven Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans conducted research into anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in an attempt to discover why this injury can cause the knee to give way. Two knee surgeons in Belgium have found a previously unknown ligament in the centre of the human knee (pictured horizontally). The new ligament - marked by the arrows below the blue box - has been called the anterolateral ligament and 97 per cent of people are thought to have one. (LCL stands for lateral collateral ligament) The researchers, who have been investigating the injuries for four years, began by studying an 1879 article by the French surgeon Paul Segond who speculated about the existence of an additional ligament located in the centre of the front part of the knee. They dissected 41 knees that had been donated for medical research and discovered that the speculation was correct in all but one of the knees. The Belgian surgeons are the first to identify the ligament, which has been named the anterolateral ligament (ALL). They believe it is present in 97 per cent of human knees. Having discovered the ligament, they set about trying to establish the role it plays in causing injured knees to give way. They discovered that this phenomenon is caused by injury to the ALL. This finding could revolutionise the way in which knee injuries are treated - Dr Claes and Professor Bellemans are currently working on a surgical technique to correct ALL injuries. The surgeons’ findings, published in the Journal of Anatomy, have been praised by the Anatomical Society as ‘very refreshing’. The newly discovered ligament is thought to be responsible for injured knees giving way during exercise - a previously unexplained problem experienced by many people with anterior cruciate ligament tears . It commended the researchers for reminding the medical world that, despite the emergence of advanced technology, our knowledge of the basic anatomy of the human body is not yet complete. ACL tears are common among athletes in sports such as football, basketball and skiing. The ACL is one of the four major ligaments in the knee and is critical to providing stability in the joint. A tear tends to cause swelling and pain in the knee as well as instability. It often has to be treated surgically.","Dr Steven Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans found a new ligament .

"Barack Obama tonight urged Scottish voters not to break apart ‘one of the closest allies we’ll ever have’ by voting for independence on Thursday. The dramatic intervention, just three days before Scotland goes to the polls, will infuriate Alex Salmond - with the battle for independence set to be decided by the smallest of margins. Up to half a million voters remain undecided - with concerns over the future of Scotland’s place in major international organisations like the EU, Nato and the UN still hotly debated. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama does not want Scotland to break up the United Kingdom because the US has a 'deep interest' in keeping it together, his spokesman said today . White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr Obama wanted Britain to remain 'strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States' Mr Obama’s spokesman Josh Earnest said: ‘From the outside, the United States has a deep interest in ensuring that one of the closest allies we'll ever have remains strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States.’ The remarks came after Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed Scotland would have to reapply to join the military alliance - and stressed that to do every members would have to agree. He said: ‘In case that Scotland voted in favour of independence then Scotland would have to apply for membership of Nato as a new independent state. A decision on accession would have to be taken by unanimity, by consensus as always in Nato.’ The double salvo against independence comes amid warning that the US would vigorously oppose the Alex Salmond’s plan to move Britain’s Trident nuclear submarines from the Clyde after independence. Britain’s nuclear capability is key strand of Nato’s military defence and any threat would spark fury in Washington. Earlier this year Mr Obama used the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings to praise the United Kingdom and warn against Scottish separatism. Speaking alongside David Cameron, Mr Obama said: 'I would say that the United Kingdom has been an extraordinary partner to us. ‘From the outside at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.' The British people will make the ‘right decision’ in an in-out referendum, he said. ‘We obviously have a deep interest in making sure one of the closest allies we will ever remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.’ David Cameron urged Scots not to vote for independence in a speech to Better Together supporters in Aberdeen today . President Barack Obama's intervention will have delighted the Prime Minister, who is battling to save the union . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond - at Edinburgh Airport  in Edinburgh today - has previously made light of US criticism of Scottish independence . Mr Obama added: ‘Whenever our two nations stand together, it can leave a world that is more secure and more prosperous and more just. ‘On that day, like so many others, American and British troops stood together and fought valiantly alongside our allies. ‘They didn't just help to win the war, they helped to turn the tide of human history and are the reason that we can stand here today in a free Europe and with the freedoms that our nations enjoy . ‘Theirs is the legacy that our two nations and our great alliance continue to uphold and I'm grateful to have a fine partner in David in making that happen.’ Mr Salmond attempted to make light of the remarks at the time. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Salmond said: ‘America had to fight for its independence. We are very fortunate in Scotland that we have a democratic, agreed, consented process by which we can vote for our independence. ‘So, in summary, I suppose my message to President Obama is “yes we can”.’ Mr Obama is not the first world leader to have spoken out against independence. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott last month said: 'As a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it’s hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland.' Genealogists believe they can trace Mr Obama’s ancestry to William the Lion, who ruled Scotland from 1165 to 1214. A maternal ancestor of Mr Obama, Edward FitzRandolph, is said to have emigrated from Scotland to America in the 17th century. The First Minister has never met Mr Obama but did invite him attend the 2009 Homecoming Festival, although he did not get a reply. The President led international condemnation in 2009 of the decision by Mr Salmond’s administration in Edinburgh to free the Lockerbie bomber and allow him to return to Libya to a hero’s welcome.","US President's intervention comes just 3 days before Thursday's referendum .

"When Tom White spotted a cougar approaching his teenage son outside their home in rural Washington state last week, there was only one thing to do - hand a gun to his 11-year-old daughter. Without a moment's hesitation, Shelby White killed the female cougar, and wildlife officials suggested that the animal may have been sick. The mountain cat was 4 years old and weighed about 50lbs, which is about half of what an animal that age should weigh. Fearless: Shelby White, 11, is posing with a cougar she shot dead last week on her grandfather's property . My, what big teeth you have! Shelby is showing off the teeth of the predator that was stalking her 13-year-old brother . Family hobby: Shelby (left) has been hunting with her trusty .234 caliber gun since age 8 or 9, and her younger brother Cody (right) is also an enthusiast of the sport . 'This cougar was very, very skinny,' State Fish and Wildlife Officer Cal Treser said. The . fearless 11-year-old took action when she saw the cougar following her . 13-year-old brother as he was walking towards their home in the town of . Twisp, population 940. In . a phone interview with MailOnline Wednesday night, Shelby’s . grandfather, William White, revealed that it was a fourth cougar killed . on his property in the past several weeks. Mr . White, 64, a cattle rancher, said that earlier this month, Shelby’s . 13-year-old brother, Tanner, also shot a cougar that has been circling his farm. ‘We're real avid hunters,’ Mr White said of his clan, which he described as 'backwoodsy.' . The . rancher explained that until recently, local residents were able to keep the . cougar population in check by hunting the predators with dogs, but two . years ago, the local Legislature outlawed the practice. Danger: This 125-pound male cougar was killed the week before on the White ranch in Twisp . Trophy: Cody White, 9, gunned down this 125-pound male cougar earlier this month under the supervision of a game warden . Big game: Cody White, 9,  is posing in the snow with his first slain cougar . Cycle of life: This is a photo of the calf that a cougar had killed on White's farm earlier this month . William White explained that last Thursday, Shelby and her young brother were walking home from school when a dog started barking, alerting them to the presence of a predator. ‘She looked out, and there was this cougar,’ Mr White recalled. Cougars are the largest members of the cat family in North America. Adult males weight 140-180lbs and measure 7-8 feet long from nose to tip of tail. Cougars live throughout Washington where suitable cover and prey are found. The cougar population for the year 2008 was estimated to be 2,000 to 2,500 animals. The cougar population in eastern Washington is declining and the western population is stable. Wildlife offices throughout the state receive hundreds of calls a year regarding sightings, attacks on livestock and pets, and confrontations between the predators and their human neighbors. The state's increasing human populations and decreasing cougar habitat may create more opportunities for such encounters. Source: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife . The animal appeared to be moving in the direction of Shelby’s 13-year-old brother, who was unaware of the danger as he made his way toward the basement door with a bag of animal feed in his hands. The girl’s father, Tom White, was home at the time, but Shelby was the only one in the family with a tag - a permit to legally kill a cougar. ‘He said, “Shelby, grab that gun and go shoot that cat,”’ White said, adding that the 11-year-old ‘wasn’t scared a bit’ as she pulled the trigger. ‘She was excited to get to do that,’ Mr White recalled. Luckily for the older brother, the boy . didn’t realize he was in danger until the cougar lurking nearby was . dead at the hands of his sister. The 64-year-old farmer used to be a hunter safety instructor and taught all his grandchildren how to properly use weapons. ‘I want my grandkids to know how to protect themselves ‘cause we have a lot predators,’ White explained. Mr . White said that Shelby has been hunting since she was 8 or 9 years old. Every year, the girl bags  a deer with her .234 caliber gun – her . weapon of choice because it does not have a powerful recoil. Diana the huntress: Shelby has bagged three deer over the past three years, and also has a license to shoot cougars . A cougar for everyone! Each one of the White kids has killed a cougar this season, including Shelby (left) and 13-year-old Tanner (right) Not your average family: Shelby (far right), Cody (center) and Tanner (second left) all have been taught by their grandfather how to hunt and handle weapons safely . Cougar infestation: William White shared this photo of a cougar shot by a friend 200 yards away from his ranch just two days before the attack thwarted by Shelby . According to William White, there is still one more cougar somewhere on the property that has been threatening his dogs and cattle. ‘She is eager to shoot it,’ he said of Shelby. Increasing problem: Cal Treser, a Fish and Wildlife officer, is seen with a cougar he killed in August . Shelby is not the only one among her three siblings who knows her way around a gun – or a cougar. According to her grandfather, the girl’s 9-year-old brother, Cody, also bagged himself a cat who wandered onto the ranch and killed one of his calves. A game warden from the Fish and Wildlife Department was present and gave the boy, who had a permit, the green light to pull the trigger. Tanner White killed himself a cougar earlier that day same. Analysts are trying to determine why there are more cougar attacks this year than in previous years. One of the theories suggests that the animals may be wandering into more residential areas in search of food if they are not finding enough deer- their usual prey- to keep them satisfied. This incident was the third report of a cougar being killed in the span of a week in the area. Over the course of this winter, however, state officials have tracked and killed give other cougars in the greater Twisp-Winthrop region. Those five were flagged up after they attacked domestic animals. An additional five cougars were killed by hunters. The Fish and Wildlife Department felt it necessary to issue five special permits that allowed hunters to track cougars using dogs and kill the animals.

"His dramatic post-court speech, in which he announced he had saved Casey Anthony's life, drew gasps almost as loud as those that came when the jury found his client not guilty of murdering her young daughter. It was a rather bold statement to make by defence lawyer of the moment Jose Baez, who has been called 'the luckiest man in America' by one lawyer. Baez was chosen by Casey Anthony to represent her 'at random', court tapes revealed, after she heard his name mentioned by other prison inmates. It was a choice many questioned at the time - both among her family and in the legal profession. Scroll down for video . Delighted: Man of the moment Jose Baez pulls off the victory of his career . Speaking to the Miami Herald, Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and law professor at Nova Southeastern University, echoed the thoughts of many when he called Baez: 'The luckiest man in America.' In taking on the job of attempting to clear Anthony of murder charges related to the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, Baez went from being a small-time local lawyer to the defence attorney in the most high-profile case in America. Jeff Ashton, one of the three . prosecutors who led the case against Anthony, announced tonight that he . will retire at the end of the week. Mr Ashton, 53, has prosecuted for the . Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office for 30 years. His reputation and . experience was in stark contrast to that of Jose Baez, Anthony's lead . defence attorney, who was admitted to the Florida Bar only three years . ago. In 2008, when the decision went public, Richard Hornsby, the president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers, was shocked. 'I first said, ""Jose who?"" Hornsby told ABC News. 'I had no idea who he was.' Baez, 42, a Navy veteran, took almost a decade simply to start practising as a professional lawyer. Despite graduating from law school in 1997, he was was perennially denied entry to the Florida bar until 2005 - because he refused to pay child support to his former wife or secure life and health insurance for his teenage daughter. Hand in hand: Baez clings tight to Anthony as they await today's verdict . Victory for them both: Casey and Baez hug after she is found not guilty today . Relief: Casey Anthony clings on and cries as Baez looks proudly ahead . He had previously declared himself bankrupt and defaulted on loans, according to an order by the Supreme Court of Florida. As a result, he was barred from the bar for eight years, because, according to the Florida Supreme Court, the financial marks on his name showed 'a lack of respect for the rights of others and a total lack of respect for the legal system, which is absolutely inconsistent with the character and fitness qualities required of those seeking to be afforded the highest position of trust and confidence recognised by our system of law.' 'It kind of happened at random in booking. 'I . heard a couple of people talking about attorneys... His name came up and . I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along' Casey Anthony on why she hired Baez . The decision to hire Baez was also criticised by Anthony's family. In jail house tapes from July 2008 played to the court, Lee Anthony, Casey's brother, warned her to switch attorneys. Understand your rights in this... If at any point you want to change jockeys in this horse race, you can do it…it's as simple as you reaching out to anyone in the Corrections Department…and make it known on what you want to do,' he told his sister. Her father George Anthony added: 'I just, I hope that the compassion that he says that he has is being . genuine…I hope he's not building a reputation for himself.' When Lee probed her on how she came to hire Baez, Casey explained: 'It kind of happened at random in booking. 'I heard a couple of people talking about attorneys...His name came up and I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along…It was an inmate and there was three other people that confirmed it.' In court, Baez faced much media criticism for what appeared to be a series of bold and dangerous moves, which could have scuppered his defence case. He was slammed, in particular, almost daily by notorious host Nancy Grace for his choice of argument in court and for 'relishing in the spotlight' outside of it, supposedly using the case as an opportunity for fame. In his opening statements, Baez stunned onlookers by claiming his client had lied all along about what had happened to her daughter. Furious: Nancy Grace has continually argued against Baez's tactics in court . She was no longer arguing that a nanny had taken her for a month before her disappearance was reported but that a tragic accident in her parents' swimming pool led to them attempting to cover up little Caylee's death. Baez then told the court she had lied . because of psychological problems that stemmed from Casey having been . sexually abused by her father - a claim he completely denied. 'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez' Nancy Grace on the verdict . Once the new story was established, Baez essentially backed himself into a corner, critics argued. The . only witness who could corroborate these bold claims was Casey herself . and legal experts almost always warn against bringing one's client to . the stand. As it transpired, the claims were never backed up and Casey did not give evidence. Baez . was heavily criticised throughout the case by notorious host Nancy . Grace and was labelled 'incompetent' on one of her shows. Speaking . with defence attorney Raymond Giudice about testimony instigated by . Baez that Caylee's remains may have been tampered with by woodland . animals, Grace said: 'You know what? Maybe it was a dingo dog or . Sasquatch or Bigfoot or a martian! 'You . know what? I really think -- you know, I see you laughing, but here`s . the deal.. The defence can`t laugh. They've done it now. They can sit . there and laugh in open court. What were they thinking?  A coyote did . it?' Different: Baez was criticised for using so many posters and charts in court . Giudice responded: 'We`re seeing is an entire team, not just Mr Baez, their incompetency.' After the not guilty verdict was announced today, Grace said rather ungraciously: 'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez.' Baez had been practising as a lawyer for just three years when he was booked by Anthony. In his highest profile case before the Anthony trial, he defended a Nilton Diaz, a man accused of killing the granddaughter of a boxer. After Diaz was convicted of manslaughter, the client filed a . motion arguing that Baez was a defective attorney, although his motion was denied. While he was waiting to be admitted to the bar he worked with two bikini businesses - Bon Bon Bikinis and Brazilian-Bikinis.com, which are both now inactive. He also worked for not for profit organisations which fought to prevent domestic violence and child abuse. While his profile has soared since the Anthony trial began, Baez's financial troubles have not ceased. 'Saved a life': Baez addresses the media after the historic result . His home was in foreclosure last . year, according to reports, and it is unclear how he was paid to . represent Anthony, although money from sales of pictures and footage of . Caylee are thought to have contributed. 'He's . a guy with a colourful and complicated past and a very confusing . present,' Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and professor at Nova Southeastern . University Law Center told ABC News during the case. 'His courtroom demeanour leaves you with a sense that this is a guy who is in over his head. 'He's really flying by the seat of his pants. From his very confusing open, from the way he's been cross examining witnesses, at this point, you really have to wonder what his strategy is.' Despite all the criticism, however, today's result is an undoubted milestone success for the attorney - which is perhaps why he so basked in the moment. Turnaround: Baez won despite claims he took the job for fame . As the clerk of the court read the verdicts, Anthony hugged Baez and soon after began to cry. Later, as the judge spoke to the jury, she could be seen mouthing . 'thank you' to him, before the whole defence team hugged in tears like a victorious sports team as the . session ended. In a bizarre speech given after the case in both English and Spanish, Baez appeared shaken with emotion as he shamelessly declared that his defence had ‘saved a life’. He told the media he was ‘very happy for Casey. I’m ecstatic for her and I want her to be able to grieve and grow and somehow get her life back together’ but spent much of the speech focussed on how the moment felt for him. He used to opportunity to speak out against Casey’s ‘trial by media’ and the death penalty, which he labelled ‘disgusting’, before saying: ‘I want to thank everyone who stood behind me and supported me throughout this time.’ The speech then reached its climax as, holding back tears, Baez declared he was especially proud that when he went home this evening his daughter ‘will ask me what did you do today and I can say I saved a life.’ Watch the videos .","'I saved a life' says Casey lawyer .

"A floating island of debris the size of Texas has been crossing the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas since a devastating tsunami inundated Japan in 2011, says a new study. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean that day in March, and more than one million tons of flotsam continues to head towards the west coast of the US. While the first documented debris from the tragedy has already been found in California, scientists fear these new findings mean there could be a lot more to come and it might arrive all at once. Gigantic: A floating island of debris the size of Texas is floating toward California coast after washing into the Pacific in Japan's horrific 2011 tsunami . Slowly but surely: The Texas-sized trash island is floating to the northeast of Hawaii after over two years of sailing across the Pacific . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) released its updated findings last week, which show the huge island floating northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. NOAA scientists add that a larger and less-concentrated debris field stretches from Alaska to the Philippines. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. The Texas-sized trash island is located northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Some of the more mobile items have been documented as washing up on the coast of California as early as 2011. In April, a 20ft boat ran aground at Crescent City, California. It was formally identified as a boat that belonged to the marine sciences program at Takata High School in the city of Rikuzentakata. In all, 27 items from among . more than 1,600 reports of debris have been firmly traced back to the . tsunami, NOAA spokeswoman Keeley Belva said. The . confirmed items include a small boat found in Hawaii waters, large . docks that have washed ashore in Washington state and Oregon, and a . motorcycle that washed ashore off the coast of British Columbia. A soccer ball found on an Alaska island with a student's name on it was also traced to the city of Rikuzentakata. But distinguishing everyday trash from tsunami debris has proven difficult in most other cases. Items . that are confirmed as having come from the tsunami, like the soccer . ball and boat, tend to have unique markings. It’s far more difficult to . distinguish between domestic and Japanese everyday wooden debris, for . instance. Geiger counters, which detect radiation, are no help in identifying debris. It was initially thought that the instruments might be able to pick up traces of radiation from the still-leaking nuclear . reactor at Fukushima, but none of the floating . debris has any detectable radioactivity. Large items: The 164ft Japanese fishing vessel Ryou-Un Maru entered US waters March 31, 2012, on its ghostly journey after being washed away by the massive wave. The ship eventually sank in the Gulf of Alaska .","Part of the over one million tons of debris dispersed in the Pacific, the trash island is located northeast of the Hawaiian Islands .

"A plucky parakeet is lucky to be alive - after being sucked up into her owner's vacuum cleaner. Birdie thought she'd found the perfect hiding place to lay an egg when she crawled inside her owner Marie Margarone's vacuum cleaner at her home in Milton, Massachusetts, on February 23. But the eight-year-old ended up being violently drawn up into and thrown around the canister of a hoover after Ms Margarone went to do some spring cleaning and switched on the appliance.

Morocco's king has chosen the head of an Islamist party that won the most votes in Friday's elections as the next prime minister. King Mohammed VI received Abdelilah Benkirane, the secretary general of the Justice and Development Party, in the mountain town of Midelt yesterday and named him prime minister. Under the country's new constitution, the king must choose a prime minister from the party that won the most votes in the election. The Islamist party took 107 seats out of the 395 in Parliament in Friday's election - almost twice as many as the second-place finisher. It must now assemble a governing coalition. Several parties have already expressed their interest in an alliance. The FJP said in a statement that early indications showed it in the lead for both party-list and individual mandate seats. It said the ultra-conservative Islamist al-Nour party was next, followed by the liberal Egyptian Bloc. An . FJP source, who declined to be named, said it had secured 40 per cent . of votes cast for party lists across the nine governorates where voting . was held in this week's first round. The FJP statement said the party's strongest showing so far was in Fayoum, south of Cairo, followed by the Red Sea, Cairo and the southern city of Assiut. It said the rival Nour party was a strong competitor in Kafr el-Sheikh and Alexandria. Other areas that voted in the first round include Luxor, Port Said and Damietta.

"It would have been the quirkiest of funerals. The coffin was to be driven in the same hearse that once carried Winston Churchill, then brought into the crematorium to the sound of Move Your Feet, a 2003 pop hit by Danish duo Junior Senior. Inside, the relatives would be waiting in specially selected fancy dress. And Deryn Blackwell, just 14, was to be laid to rest sporting his pink mohawk hair cut and wearing a suit. Second chance: Deryn staying positive in hospital, pictured during his fight with cancer . ‘I thought I should probably turn up at my own funeral reasonably well dressed,’ he says with a wry smile. But the boy who had suffered two types of cancer and was given just days to live last December has now found himself on an unexpected road to recovery – one so astonishing it has left the medical community dumbfounded. Deryn, too, is finding it difficult  to understand. While others are rejoicing at his good fortune, he is trying to come to terms with his miraculous survival. ‘He found it easier to deal with dying,’ admits his mother Callie,  33. ‘He described it as having an open door in front of you with a light, and you know that when you walk through that door all pain will end and you will be free. He was told he wouldn't see Christmas, but Deryn, who is the only person in the world to suffer from both leukaemia and another rare form of cancer has made a miraculous recovery . Doctors are at a loss to explain why Deryn Blackwell, who is one of just five people in the world with Langerhans Cell Sarcoma, has had such a miraculous recovery . ‘And then someone slams that  door shut in your face.’ After four years of fighting and, eventually, finding himself at peace with the prospect of his own death, Deryn has had every certainty removed, says his father Simon. ‘He actually stopped eating on purpose in the hope that it would kill him because he was so disappointed that he now wasn’t dying. He wanted an end to it.’ Deryn’s story is one that is both uplifting and perplexing. His family members and his doctors think that his amazing recovery might have been his incredible positivity in his attitude towards both life and death . In 2010, aged ten, he was diagnosed with leukaemia. Eighteen months later, he was told he had  a secondary cancer, the extremely rare Langerhans cell sarcoma. Only 50 cases have been recorded and only five people in the world have it. But no one had ever had the two cancers combined. Doctors told the Blackwell family that the only hope was a bone marrow transplant. The 14-year-old was diagnosed with the condition 18 months after he began battling leukaemia in 2010 . The family moved from their home in Watton, Norfolk, and bounced between temporary hostels in Bristol, the city where Deryn’s transplants took place. The first took place in March 2013 and during the following months three more attempts were made. They all failed. After the final transplant, doctors took Callie and Simon into a small room at a Bristol hospital. With Deryn’s body now in the grip of three major infections (the transplants had stripped him of his immune system), including a superbug that caused three of his fingers to go black and necrotic, they were told: ‘This is the end.’ The teenager underwent four bone marrow transplants - including two using his own stem cells - to try and make his body produce his own blood products again . The cancer survivor had an incredibly resilient outlook, smiling while fighting off infection and undergoing treatment . Before he found out he was going to survive, Deryn had come to terms completely with the prospect of his own death, his family saying that he was 'looking forward to what was coming next' The family thought the painful saga of Deryn’s years of treatment, from dose after dose of vicious drugs, radiation, chemotherapy and more than 300 procedures, was finally over. As time ran out for him, Callie even dyed her hair a vivid pink to cheer up her son. ‘All that was keeping Deryn alive were the antibiotics, which I thought of as a form of life-support machine,’ says Callie. ‘The hospital told us that if we took him off them, his body simply would not be able to fight the three major infections he had. ‘So we took the decision, 50 days after his final bone marrow transplant, when we thought that it  had totally failed, to take Deryn off the antibiotics.’ Many celebrities rallied behind Deryn in order to help him complete his 'bucket list' before he died. (Pictured: Deryn with comedian Russel Howard) As Callie looked at her son – thin, pale and with lips black from infection – she accepted she needed to prepare for his death as he had  now done. ‘Deryn said that when he finally accepted he was going to die, it was the best day of his life because it gave him this calm and peaceful feeling, like he finally had control over his life and where he was going,’ says Callie. ‘He said he was looking forward to see what was coming next – the next adventure.’ Indeed, Deryn’s relentless optimism, even in the face of failed surgeries and devastating chemotherapy, had brought numerous celebrities to his bedside as they helped him tick off his bucket list. TV star Paul Hollywood helped Deryn fulfill a dream by taking him for a spin in a series of fancy cars . Deryn's father Simon had been a contestant on the Great British Bake Off, prompting the judge Paul Hollywood to get in touch with him when he heard the news about Deryn . Simon had been a contestant  on the Great British Bake Off in 2011, and in November 2013 judge Paul Hollywood got in touch to arrange a day for Deryn to ride in supercars, including a Ferrari and Aston Martins. Once off the antibiotics, however, the doctors gave Deryn less than a week to live. The family moved into a hospice on December 11, and he said his final goodbyes. ‘We had Christmas on December 14 because we didn’t think that he would make it to the 25th,’ says Callie. Yet as Christmas rolled into New Year, it became apparent to both Deryn and his parents that his body was not being ravaged by infection, nor were his organs shutting down as  the doctors had  predicted. Deryn remained consistently upbeat until the very point he thought he was going to die, right before his recovery, displaying a relentless optimism in the face of his own mortality . Then, in the second week of January – almost a month after Deryn had been given just days to live – he accidentally tore the bandages off one of his fingers. What emerged was not a finger raw to the bone but one that seemed completely healed. ‘It was a miracle,’ says Callie. ‘The doctors couldn’t comprehend how he had managed to totally fight off the vicious infection in his fingers without any bone marrow, without an immune system and without drugs. They still can’t explain it. ‘All of a sudden, the doctors were saying Deryn could have a chance, though they could offer us no explanation as to how.’Two weeks later, the doctors confirmed that he was producing white blood cells. Some 104 days after his fourth and final bone marrow transplant the cells had finally grafted. It was something that had never been seen before, and was deemed by the doctors as ‘impossible’. ‘Two months ago we were getting ready to cremate Deryn and now they are telling us that his treatment is over,’ Callie adds. Now the Blackwells are forming their own charity, Do Everything, which will run residential camps for young teenagers diagnosed with cancer. Brave cancer sufferer Deryn Blackwell pictured with Birds of a Feather stars Lesley Joseph, Linda Robson and Pauline Quirke during his fight with the disease . Originally intended as a  legacy, Simon says Deryn plans to be the charity’s driving force, putting his experiences to good use. ‘Deryn is finally feeling like he can have a purpose in life,’ says Callie. ‘A few weeks ago he was thinking merely in hours, and now he is thinking in  days and years, about having a career, running  the charity and moving abroad. ‘For the first time in four years, he can picture his own future.’","Deryn Blackwell is one of five people on the planet to get the rare disease .

Cinday Murray lovingly after being apart for 30 years . The happy moment they had waited thirty years for took place at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego on Friday. Williamson was just 6 years old the last time he saw his sister. When their parents separated he stayed with their father, while Murray, 14, moved away with their mother. Friday, the siblings reconnected with an emotional embrace. Williamson gave his sister an honorable Navy salute and hugged her tightly. 'It's my brother!' Murray said with tears in her eyes. Despite trying to find each other for years and years, neither sibling seemed to have any luck. 'I tried looking on Facebook, but there are a million Robert Williamsons. There are a million Bobby Williamsons. Without pictures, I wouldn’t have known what he looked like anyway,' said Murray. Murray is a senior nursing officer assigned to NMCSD's Military Health Center.

Cindy Murray and her brother Robert Williamson, at home, during Easter 1975 before being separated by their parents and reunited years later by the Navy . After the siblings' parents separated, Murray took her mother's maiden name, making it difficult for Williamson to find his sister. Two months ago Murray called her estranged father who told her that her brother was a chief in the Navy. Within only 15 minutes of giving her brother's name to her leading chief petty officer (LCPO),  the pair were on the phone. Chief Petty Officer Hospital Corpsman Jeremy Simon, and he made the siblings’ connection possible. Williamson reported that he was in shock. According to Williamson, Murray's LCPO called saying, 'I'm pretty sure my boss is your sister. Do you have a sister named Cindy?' Williamson replied, 'Yes, I do.' Cheif Aviation Ordnanceman Robert Williamson and his sister Cmdr. Cinday Murray plan to spend more time together after being reunited . After their first phone call, the brother and sister would talk to each other frequently in attempts to reclaim lost time. Even though the two spent years apart, they have a lot of common qualities. 'We both love Goldfish crackers and we both love the same types of TV shows,' said Murray. 'He was like my live doll. I would cook in my Easy-Bake-Oven for him. I remember holding him when he was just a tiny baby,' said Murray. 'Our Navy is awesome and to find out that they are both serving does not surprise me. There is a bond among siblings and where one is serving you can usually find another,' Simon said. Chief Simon said that reuniting the siblings was one of the 'proudest moments' of his career.

"A prized goat has been put up for sale in India with a whopping £128,000 price tag. Islam Bhati, 37, from Rajasthan in India, is trying to sell his finest goat for 11 million rupees to a Muslim family celebrating the Eid al-Adha festival.The two-year-old animal is organic and has the word 'Allah' in Arabic emblazoned on one side of his fur. He also has a crescent and star on the other side. Islam Bhati, 37, from Rajasthan in India, is seeking £128,000 for his prized organic goat, pictured . The two-year-old animal has the word 'Allah' in Arabic on one side of his fine fur, pictured . Mr Bhati said he knew the goat was sacred when he found 'Allah' in Arabic, pictured, on the animal's coat . Mr Bhati said: ‘It’s a miracle animal and I feel blessed to own him. We have looked after this goat like our child and he’s the best goat around. We can easily charge 11 million for such a divine animal, it's pretty reasonable.’ Mr Bhati, who run's the family's marble business, bought the goat from a nearby farm two years' ago. He said: ‘I noticed the inscriptions soon after I bought him. I knew it was sacred. Since we took him into our home we have cared for him and fed him pulses, fresh tree leaves and dry fruit. His meat will be very good.’ Mr Bhati has been offered huge sums for the goat since he posted an advert on the Internet last week. However, no one has stepped forward and paid the asking price yet. Mr Bhati said: ‘The most I’ve been offered so far is 2.5 million rupees (£30,000) but I refused. If anything this goat is a priceless animal. I will only sell it for the asking price. And when I sell it, I’ll give 50 per cent of the money to a local orphanage. We’ll miss him when he’s gone but there cannot be a better occasion to sell him.’ Muslims sacrifice a goat or a sheep on the eve of Eid-al-Adha to commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail on God's command. Thousands of goat farmers from across India have been selling their livestock in Old Delhi, pictured, all week . Thousands of goat farmers from across India have been camping all week in the capital, Old Delhi, selling their livestock. Many average goats of local breeds such as Mewati, Barbari, Desi, Punjabi, Totapuri and Turkish, normally sell for an average 5,000 to 25,000 rupees. Zahir Hussain, 30, a tailor from Lucknow, is selling his black goat for 1.1 million rupees (£13,000). Mr Hussain bought the two-year-old goat from his in-laws and has been feeding him almonds, raisins and pistachios. He said: ‘He is special. He’s one in a million. So far I’ve been offered 500,000 rupees but I refused.

"By Stephen Gibbs for Daily Mail Australia . Victims of crime groups have attacked a call from euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke to let killers serving life sentences choose the timing of their own 'peaceful' deaths behind bars. Dr Nitschke has said Australian inmates facing life in jail should be given the same opportunity as a Belgian rapist and murderer who a court has granted the right to die with the help of prison doctors. Killer Frank van den Bleeken raped and murdered a 19-year-old woman after being released from serving sentences for other sexual offences. Released again, he attacked three more victims, including an 11-year-old girl. Now locked up indefinitely 23 hours a day, van den Bleeken successfully applied to a Belgian court for the right to die at a time of his choosing rather than endure what he describes as unbearable psychological suffering in jail. Murderer and rapist Frank van den Bleeken has been granted permission by a Belgian court to die at the hands of prison doctors. Dr Nitschke said on Monday he believed Australian prisoners facing life in jail without parole should be given the same opportunity as van den Bleeken. Not to do so was 'equivalent to torture'. 'When I first heard that the prisoner was going to be allowed to have his request to have a peaceful death respected, I was very pleased in the sense that it was something that I've believed for some time – that a person who is incarcerated for an indefinite period and that's certainly his case [should be able to have the option of euthanasia],' he told the ABC. 'It looks to me like the state is not only prepared to incarcerate people forever in certain circumstances, but to try and maximise the suffering of those individuals, and I don't think we should have any part of that, at least in these situations, offer these poor people the option of a peaceful death. 'To me, that's equivalent to torture and I think it's something that the state should not be involved in.' Euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke wants Australian inmates serving life sentences to be allowed to choose the timing of their own deaths behind bars. Peter Rolfe, president of the Support After Murder group, was appalled. 'I find it most abhorrent,' Mr Rolfe told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most abhorrent. I just find that unbelievable.' In August 1994, Mr Rolfe's one-time business partner Stephen Dempsey was shot dead with a crossbow bolt by Richard Leonard, who months later stabbed a cab driver to death before he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life in jail. Mr Rolfe said Dr Nitschke's description of convicted murderers as 'poor people' who deserved the option of 'a peaceful death' was offensive. 'What about people like Stephen Dempsey who wasn't offered a peaceful death?' Mr Rolfe said. 'I mean, Richard Leonard is in jail as punishment, as well as for the protection of the community. He wrecked our lives and we just want to see him never get out of jail. We want him to pay the price for it. 'I don't feel for these ""poor people"". They are criminals who have sinned against society, for God's sake.' Killer and rapist Frank van den Bleeken has been granted his wish to be put to death by prison doctors rather than endure 'unbearable psychological suffering' in jail. Howard Brown, vice president of the Victims of Crime Assistance League, said Dr Nitschke's comments failed to recognise the importance of both deterrence and punishment in sentencing for serious crimes. Mr Brown said it would be illogical to allow a convicted murderer the right to take another life, even if that life were their own. 'I still have a huge problem with anyone taking another person's life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Philip Nitschke says keeping killers locked up indefinitely without the right to euthanasia is 'equivalent to torture'. Dr Nitschke is reportedly to be investigated by police forces in every Australian state over his role in almost 20 deaths of the past three years.","'Dr Death' Philip Nitschke says murderers deserve right to euthanasia .

"A heroic mother who had to leave her dead five-month-old baby behind and walk a mile to seek help after a plane crash has told of her 'heartbreak' at her loss of her newborn son. Melanie Coffee told family members she has yet to come to terms with the death of her son Wyatt as she recovers from her own injuries. The 25-year-old is being comforted by the baby's father and her mother as she recovers in an Alaska hospital. Devastated: Melanie Coffee told family members she has yet to come to terms with the death of her son Wyatt as she recovers from her own injuries . Tragedy: Wyatt, Melanie's first child, died in the crash. His mother made desperate attempts to revive him . Her uncle Ayo Coffee said: 'She is heartbroken. This is a tragedy for her and all the family.' Coffee has been hailed a hero for walking over a mile in blizzard like conditions to reach rescuers after the light aircraft she was travelling in plunged to the ground. The young mum had desperately tried to revive her son Wyatt before going for help and guiding rescue workers back to the crash site. Three others, including the pilot, died when the regular shuttle flight from a remote south west Alaska town crashed on Friday evening. She was the only one of six survivors who could make the arduous journey. Coffee is being comforted by her partner Keith Andrew at a hospital in Anchorage where she underwent an operation on her arm. She also suffered chest injuries. Wyatt was the first child for 32-year- old Andrew and Coffee. Crash: The plane plummeted as it prepared to land during short shuttle flight between remote Alaskan vilalges. Four died and six survived . Comfort: Coffee is being supported by partner Keith Andrew - Wyatt's father - at a hospital in Anchorage where she underwent an operation on her arm. She posted this picture on Facebook after the tragedy . 'Melanie is heartbroken and is coming to terms with what's happened. The family are rallying round her,' said her uncle Alo Coffee. 'Her mother is at the hospital and by her side. When we spoke she said she was holding up. 'We are all still trying to take in what has happened.' Coffee's mother Daisy was too upset to talk when contacted on her cell phone by MailOnline. She has earlier told the Anchorage Daily News she was not yet blaming anyone for the crash, adding: 'Because nothing can bring the baby back to life.' Despite her injuries and grief Coffee updated her photograph on Facebook posting a picture of her alongside her partner Keith and another of Wyatt after the crash. Friends posted messages of support, but Melanie did not make any online comment. The vice-mayor of the Mountain Village, the isolated town where Melanie lived, paid tribute to her heroism. Peter Andrew also said her friends were still coming to terms with her son's death and that of three others. Beloved: Vice-mayor of Mountain Village Peter Andrew, said: 'Melanie cherished her son. She must be utterly devastated. But she was a hero. She went to get help even though she must have been distraught' 'Melanie cherished her son. She must be utterly devastated,' said Andrew. 'But she was a hero. She went to get help even though she must have been distraught. 'I cannot begin to imagine what she is going through right now. All we can do is offer our love and support.' Andrew, who was only elected a month ago, said grief counsellors could be sent to the town, about 400 miles from Anchorage, to help the 800 residents. 'Everyone knows each other in Mountain Village,' he said. 'It is a very small community so something as big and tragic as this has a huge impact. 'People are struggling to come to terms with the accident. We are all in shock.No way would we have thought something like this would have happened.' Horror: Wyatt was sitting on his mother's lap and is thought to have been unrestrained when the single engine plane came down about four miles from the airfield at St Marys . Melanie is being treated at the Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage along with the others who survived. Melanie and eight other passengers had been making a ten minute flight from Bethel to to the nearby village of St Marys when the Cessna 208 came down in poor visibility. It was supposed to land at Mountain Village, but for reasons yet to be revealed did not make its scheduled stop. Eye witnesses said the plane had flown low over the airfield at St Mary's and then disappeared. The cause of the crash was unknown and light aircraft like the Cessna 208 do not carry black box recorders that are standard on commercial airliners to record instrument data. Wyatt was sitting on his mother's lap and is thought to have been unrestrained when the single engine plane came down about four miles from the airfield at St Marys. Coffee called A health worker in Mountain Village on her cell phone to ask for help in resuscitating her son while also alerting them to the crash. Pain: the vice-mayor told MailOnline: 'I cannot begin to imagine what she is going through right now. All we can do is offer our love and support' When that failed she set out through fog and freezing rain to try and raise the alarm. Alaska State Troopers said she followed the red flashing light of a beacon to reach the town of St Marys where she was met by rescue teams making their way out into the darkness. She guided rescuers back to the crash site where more than 50 people from St Marys and Mountain Village,who had heard about the crash, and joined in the rescue effort. Many had driven through the freezing conditions on snowmobiles and in their vehicles to try and reach the crash site. Paramedics who arrived were helped by the villagers load the stretchers with the injured. Those who survived suffered broken bones and head injuries consistent with a sudden impact. Alaska State Troopers named the dead as pilot Terry Hansen,68, passengers Richard Polty,65 and his wife Rose,57, and Wyatt Coffee. The survivors were named as Pauline Johnson,37 and her 14 year old son Kylan,Tanya Lawrence,35,Shannon Lawrence and 35 year old Garrett Moses. An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Authority arrived at the crash site. Bad weather had initially hampered their arrival over the weekend as they were unable to fly from Bethel. The crash site remained roped off with Mountain Village Public Safety Office James Sartelle guarding the site. Regular route: The plane, similar to this Hageland Aviation Cessna 208, was making a scheduled flight . The town's vice Mayor said the shuttle flights from the remote village was often the only way for villagers to get around during the winter. Flying from Mountain Village to St Mary takes ten minutes by air but villagers can spend over an hour navigating the small country roads. During the winter month many are impassable. 'The villages rely on the shuttle service. This has had a huge impact,' said Andrews. The flight that crashed was operated by Hageland Air. A statement issued on behalf of Hageland Air President said: 'Hageland is working to gather information to answer questions and do what we can to ease the suffering of those involved in the accident. 'As a family owned business this is an unspeakable tragedy for us.'","Alaska plane crash survivor Melanie Coffee, 25, 'heartbroken' at death of five-month-old son Wyatt .

"It was the DIY project that captured the hearts of space enthusiasts the world over - could a team of scientists really re-gain control of a long-thought dead spacecraft? In late May they wowed us all by making first contact, and now they’ve proven their ambitions yet again by firing the thrusters on the 36-year-old spacecraft. And today they’ll complete the first trajectory change for ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), with the goal of flying past the moon on 10 August and eventually entering orbit between Earth and the Sun. Scroll down for video . A team of citizen scientists has successfully regained control of the once-thought 'dead' ISEE-3 spacecraft (illustration shown). The team made first contact with the probe in late May and has now fired the thrusters on the vehicle, with a view to flying past the moon on 10 August . The initial burn, which took place a few days ago, involved 11 ‘pulses’ of the spacecraft’s hydrazine thrusters. ISEE-3 . was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind . streaming toward Earth from a stable orbit point between our planet and . the sun known as the Lagrangian 1, or L1. Monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the . interconnected sun-Earth system, which at its most turbulent can affect . satellites around Earth. In . 1984, it was given a new mission and called the International Cometary . Explorer. In September 1985, it passed through the tail of Comet . Giacobini-Zinner, making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a . comet. It also went on to . fly by Comet Halley in March 1986. From 1991 until 1997, when it was too . far away for reliable communications, this satellite continued to . investigate the sun. Now it's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to Earth in August. This had the goal of increasing the ‘spin’ of the spacecraft from 19.16 revolutions per minute to about 19.75, almost exactly what the original mission specifications called for. ‘In other words: bullseye,’ one of the lead scientists, Keith Cowing, writes at Space College. The team of scientists were given . the go-ahead by Nasa to crowd-fund the revival of the seemingly 'dead' spacecraft earlier this year. Contact was last made with the spacecraft, called ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), in the late 90s. As it approached our planet, scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36-year-old probe in an . attempt to bring it back to life - which they managed to do in late May. ‘The ISEE-3 Reboot Project is . pleased to announce that our team has established two-way communication . with the ISEE-3 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform . specific functions,’ said Cowing at the time. First contact with ISEE-3 was achieved at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico, which is continuing to be used as a means to communicate with the probe. The . achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations . and people including the staff at Arecibo and a team at the Bochum . Observatory in Germany. In . April the ISEE-3 Reboot Project team - made up of the groups Space . College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef - undertook a successful crowd funding . project to raise £74,000 ($125,000) to rescue the probe. Nasa . also officially endorsed the Virginia-based project and signed a space act . agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s-era . craft. This is the first . time Nasa has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the . agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again. 'We . contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded . by Nasa decades ago using command language that was recreated from old . documents that were sitting in former employees' basements,' Cowan told MailOnline. He also revealed how they intended to use the spacecraft for science again, and to involve citizens in it in a way not attempted before. ‘The intrepid ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent . away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind . extending its mission of discovery to study two comets,’ said former Nasa . astronaut John Grunsfeld. ‘We . have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through . this creative effort to recapture the ISEE-3 spacecraft as it zips by . the Earth this summer.’ In . March, amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and . find out its route, raising hopes that the mission could be revived. The mission's original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. Once proving this was possible, the project is now using the Arecibo Radio Observatory (pictured) in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3 . Launched . in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward . Earth, ISEE-3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981. With remaining fuel and functioning instruments, it then was redirected to observe two comets. Following . the end of that mission, the spacecraft continued in orbit around the . sun. It is now making its closest approach to Earth in more than 30 . years. The goal of the . ISEE-3 Reboot Project is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a . gravitationally stable point between Earth and the sun known as . Lagrangian 1 (L1). Once . safely back in orbit, the next step will be to return the spacecraft to . operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed. ISEE-3's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication. Nasa said it had shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from ISEE-3. The . mission’s original communication hardware no longer exists, so . controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create . virtual software versions of the original hardware. Having done this, the project is using the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3. New . data resulting from the project will be shared with the science . community and the public, providing a unique tool for teaching students . and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering. The data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36-year old spacecraft.","Virginia-based amateur group successfully fired thrusters on 'dead' probe .

"In 1967 British astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell was left stunned by mysterious pulsing signals she detected coming from outside the solar system. For months she suggested the signals could be of an extraterrestrial intelligent origin, but they were later proven to be rapidly spinning stars known as pulsars. However, a new series of mysterious signals, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), has again got astronomers scratching their heads and wondering if, maybe, we’re picking up alien messages. In 2007 a radio burst was picked up by astronomer Duncan Lorimer and his team. The origin of the signal could be colliding neutron stars or possibly an alien message. This image shows the dispersed signal from the original millisecond radio burst that suggests it must have originated billions of light-years away . FRBs are radio emissions that appear temporarily and randomly, making them not only hard to find, but also hard to study. Flaring star . Some . stars are known to suddenly flare up on occasion. It’s possible that . this event could send light through the thick ejected layers of a star’s . atmosphere in bursts, but if this were the cause we would expect to . find FRBs towards variable stars (ones with fluctuating brightness) in our galaxy, which is not the case. White dwarf merger . When . two white dwarfs merge its possible they can combine into a larger, . rapidly spinning white dwarf. This event could emit radiation from the . poles consistent with FRBs and, if this is proved correct, it could . indicate an association between FRBs and supernovae. Neutron star collision . Ultra-dense . stellar known as neutron stars could collide and release huge bursts of . radiation before they merge – this event is already thought to be a . cause of high-energy bursts known as Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and could . also be the cause of FRBs. Blitzar . Some . neutron stars are regarded as being ‘supramassive’, which means they . are so massive they should have already collapsed into a black hole but . their rapid rotation keeps them alive. When they do suddenly collapse . they release an intense burst of radio waves known as a blitzar, and . within this emission FRBs could also be residing. The mystery stems from the fact it is not known what could produce such a short and sharp burst, writes Katherine Mack of The Planetary Society. This has led some to speculate they could be anything from stars colliding to artificially created messages. The first FRB was spotted, or rather ‘heard’ by radio telescopes, back in 2007 - but it was so temporary and seemingly random that it took years for astronomers to even agree it wasn’t a glitch in one of the telescope's instruments. The signal, which lasted just five milliseconds, was named the Lorimer burst after its discoverer, Duncan Lorimer. The radio emission was so dispersed, experts suggested it must have come from a great distance away, possibly billions of light-years. But early estimates said there should be 10,000 of these events a day – so the fact that another wasn’t discovered until 2012 was troubling. This was when data from the Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia suggested it had heard another FRB, along with a handful of others, but the fact that only Parkes had detected the signals had some claiming these were merely instrument glitches. A recent discovery, in April of this year, of an FRB using the giant radio dish in Puerto Rico confirmed to astronomers that these signals are indeed real – but they’re no closer to finding out an answer as to what they are. Theories so far include flaring stars, white dwarfs merging, neutron stars colliding and – most intriguingly – alien signals. A follow-up observation was made by the Parkes Radio Telescope, time-lapse photo shown, in 2012. However it was not until April of this year that the signal was ruled out as an instrument glitch when the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico picked up a similar signal. But the mystery of its true origin persists . Aside from the extraterrestrial origin explanation, another is that it could be caused by the collision of two neutron stars (artist's illustration shown). When neutron stars collide a black hole is normally formed, in addition to a magnetic field trillions of times stronger than that of Earth, in just two milliseconds . ‘This extraordinary finding either indicates an as yet unknown or unusual astronomical phenomenon, or it could indicate that this is a vast alien communication network, and the universe is teeming with intelligent life forms,’ says Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual. ‘Every unusual signal from outer space encourages us to wonder if it is from an alien civilisation. ‘Since this signal seems so elusive and hard to interpret then this should be a candidate for further analysis. ‘It would be fantastic if this was an alien signal as the knowledge that we are not alone in this vast universe would have a dramatic impact on our perception of our place in the scheme of things.' For now, however, FRBs remain very much a mystery. It will take further studies and observations in future to truly determine where they come from, and what is causing them. Until then, it’s difficult to rule any particular theory out of the window.","Scientists are trying to work out what is causing Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)

"Meet the ‘President’. The giant sequoia tree in Nevada’s Sequoia National Park is 3,200 years old, has 2 billion leaves and stands 247 feet (74 metres) tall. The portrait of the giant tree, taken by National Geographic, is actually a mosaic, made up of 126 photographs in order to capture the stunning full-length shot. Giant: A team of scientists and photographers have captured a full-length portrait of the 'President', a 3,200 year-old tree in the U.S. state of Nevada . The President is by no means the tallest tree in the world – that honour goes to a California redwood, which stands 379 feet (116 metres) tall – but in terms of mass, it is one of the largest. ‘We know that there are trees that have bigger trunks, but when you add up all of the wood beside the main trunk – all of the limbs, all of the branches, all of the bio-mass above the ground – this tree is likely the biggest,’ said Steve Sillett from Humboldt State University. The stunning shot of the tree was featured as a five page fold-out in the December 2012 edition of National Geographic. ‘The reason we want to do these portraits – people get it. When they see the tree in its totality without distortion, they gasp,’ said photographer Michael Nichols. The photographic team captured the pictures using an innovative rigging technique, which was pioneered by Mr Nichols in 2009, when created an 84-image composite of a 300-foot-tall redwood tree. Giant sequoias live at high elevations and can endure cold, heavy snow and even lightning strikes. They grow in bulk and not as high as coast redwoods. The President can be found in  Sequoia National Park. It is one of the largest trees in the world, when judged on bio-mass . The tree, which was photographed by the National Geographic, stands at 247 feet high and has approximately 2 billion leaves . 'When they see the tree in its totality without distortion, they gasp': The photographer revealed the motivation for taking the tree's portrait .

"Left to right James Daly, Akash Yashin and Mohammed Aslam arriving at Cambridge Crown Court . A gang groomed vulnerable young girls through Facebook before plying them with alcohol and raping them, a court heard yesterday. Yasir Ali, 28, Daaim Ashraf, 19, Akash Yashin, 18, Mohammed Aslam, 24, and James Daly, 25, were involved in a sex ring spanning five years, it was said. It was alleged that after messaging their eight female victims, who were between 13 and 16 at the time, over social media, ring leader Ali, along with Ashraf, began grooming them. The young white girls, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, were encouraged to meet up with the men - four . of whom are Pakistani - and were plied with alcohol, Cambridge Crown . Court heard. They . were driven around Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, by Ali - who used the . nicknames 'Mr Nice' and 'Sketcher Pidox' on Facebook. Mobile . numbers would then be exchanged and the defendants, primarily Ali and . Ashraf, would continue grooming the girls via Blackberry Messenger and . text. They . would then meet up again and would go to a secluded location in cars or . to a motel where the group of men would sexually exploit them. The . crown say the 'vulnerable' girls were picked out for their 'very . difficult backgrounds' and thought they loved the gang members. But they were 'used as sex objects' and the gang saw them as 'worthless' and 'passed the girls around'. Opening . the case yesterday, Patricia Lynch, prosecuting, said Ali - the oldest . of the gang - was 'undoubtedly the primary offender'. She said: 'The girls were flattered and complimented and if I use the colloquial term, chatted up. 'The girls would be driven from their home towns and villages and taken to Peterborough where they would be plied with alcohol en route and taken to secluded spots. 'The messages by the main two defendants became increasingly sexual. 'This resulted in the girls beginning to really like the defendants they were having contact with. 'The grooming worked and the girls in fact began to love the defendants they were contacting, thinking it was a real relationship. 'They found being driven round in flash cars, driving around Peterborough and being taken to hotels, they found that attractive. 'Because of this grooming they thought these men wanted loving relationships.' She added: 'They thought they were respectful older men who gave them attention and that made them feel special. 'But it was quite the opposite. The girls were being quite deliberately used for sex and passed around. 'Their young age, their vulnerability, the grooming and the alcohol given to them negates any consent they could have given because it was not informed consent. 'The girls were groomed, manipulated and plied with alcohol and they were simply being used as sex objects by these defendants who simply viewed them as worthless.' The case which is expected to last eight weeks is being heard at Cambridge Crown Court . The offences allegedly took place in 2008 and 2013 - with one in 2010. Supermarket worker Ali is charged with six counts of rape, two counts of making indecent photographs of a child, one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and one count of intimidation. Ashraf, who is a student, is charged with one count of sexual assault, three counts of rape, one count of sexual activity with a child, one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and one count of intimidation. Ashraf and Ali are also jointly charged with seven counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation relating to six of the girls and Yashin is jointly charged for two of those offences. Yashin, who is a student, is also charged with one count of sexual assault. Aslam, who is unemployed is charged with one count of rape and one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and unemployed Daly is charged with one count of rape in 2008. All five of the defendants deny all counts. One of the first victims from 2008 said she 'really loved him' in reference to Ali, but the 'relationship' turned sour. He is accused of pushing her to the floor and kicking her before passing her onto Daly to have sex with. Daly, who is accused of raping her in a car 'despite her protestations', shook his head in the dock as he heard the allegation against him. The court heard the victim got out of the car to tell Ali what had happened, but she was just told 'you're a slag anyway' and made to walk home alone. On January 5, 2013, Ali is said to have had sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 in an alleyway while Ashraf is said to have touched a girl's breasts. On February 2, 2013 Ali, Ashraf and Yashin allegedly took two of the girls to Days Motel in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The ring leader allegedly filmed the other two sexually assaulting and raping their victims after giving them vodka. A mobile phone, which was seized in May last year from Ali's home, showed the girls in their underwear engaging in sexual acts. Footage is also said to show one girl drunk on the floor of the motel bathroom, where Ashraf is said to have sprayed her with cold water before urinating on her. On February 16, 2013, Ali, Ashraf, and Aslam, who was known as Mr Teddy, allegedly took three of the girls to the same motel. A 13-year-old girl is said to have watched on as the men raped the other two 14-year-old victims, the jury was told. Cambridge Crown Court is to be shown CCTV images of the group entering the motel with the girls 'extremely drunk.' Ms Lynch told the jury how the accused threatened to firebomb the homes of their victims if they went to police about what had happened. She said that in May 2013, Ali and Ashraf allegedly met up with one of the victims from the incident. They threatened her and told her to pass the message on to three of the other girls. Mrs Lynch said: 'Threats were made by both defendants that if the girls went to court the defendants would ""make their lives hell"" and that their houses would be firebombed.' One of the girls' parents told the police who arrested Ali and Ashraf. The trial continues and is expected to last eight weeks.

"The extreme weather that has blighted Australia in recent weeks took a bizarre twist today as dozens of beachfront towns became submerged in up to four feet of sea foam. Wave after wave of frothy suds, whipped up in storms as powerful waves force air into the water, surged onshore blanketing roads and parks and bringing entire towns to a standstill. But while the rare lather brought hundreds of children out of their homes to play in its bubbles, the bad weather that spawned it also bore tragedy to the region as floodwaters continued to rise, forcing thousands of homeowners to flee for their lives. Four people have died so far, including a three-year-old boy who was struck by a falling tree in gale force winds in Brisbane yesterday as he sheltered with his 34-year-old pregnant mother.

"Four years ago, Dan Black was paralysed in a cycling accident. Ever since, he has been raising money for pioneering stem cell treatment which could one day help him walk again. But now, after collecting £20,000, the  25-year-old has given it all away – so a little boy can learn to walk instead. Mr Black abandoned his own dream after hearing about five-year-old Brecon Vaughan, who lives near him just outside Chepstow, in South Wales. Scroll down for video . Dan Black (right) has given up his dream of walking again to help five-year-old Brecon Vaughan (left) take his first unaided steps . Brecon was born with rare spastic diplegia cerebral palsy which causes stiffness in his legs, poor balance and coordination. He has to use a walking frame to get . around, and his family are desperately trying to raise £60,000 for an . operation in America to help him walk unaided for the first time. Mr Black, who is wheelchair-bound, . said he made the extraordinary gesture because Brecon had a better . chance of walking than he does. ‘I know for me that things aren’t . going to get better any time soon,’ he said. ‘I just wanted to do . something that could help someone whose life could get better. ‘Brecon can definitely walk if he has . the surgery. I wouldn’t wish being paralysed on anyone, so if I can help . someone walk, I will.’ Dan Black (pictured before his accident) was paralysed from the chest down when he was knocked off his bicycle in 2009. He also suffered a stroke which denied him use of one arm . Mr Black raised £20,000 to pay for stem cell treatment but he then gave all of the money to Brecon Vaughan (pictured with his parents Ann and Rob) who has cerebral palsy . He continued: ‘While there is hope for Brecon, I will do everything I can, because I don’t want to see a young boy suffer. ‘I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped me out but this boy needs it more than I do at the moment. ‘It would make me very happy to see . the difference made to Brecon’s life. I just hope when I give the money . it encourages others to [give].’ The treatment Mr Black was hoping to . get is in development. While there has been progress in trials abroad, . it would be at least five years before he could be helped. Mr Black was knocked off his bike by a car in 2009, as he cycled to work at Tesco. He broke a vertebrae which left him . paralysed from the chest down. He also suffered a stroke as he recovered . in hospital, which left him without the use of his right arm. He requires 24-hour care at his home in Llanvair Discoed, near Chepstow, which costs £180,000 a year. The family will use the money to pay for Brecon to have surgery in the U.S. The treatment should allow him to take his first unaided steps and to run around with his friends . Mr Black (pictured before his accident) says that he made the decision because the surgery will make more difference to Brecon that stem cell treatment would to him . Mr Black (pictured before his accident) needs round-the-clock care and knows that stem cell treatment is his only hope of walking. Even if it could help him, he would not be able to have treatment for five years . Brecon was born with two dislocated . hips. He was put in a pelvic harness at five days old, and had had three . operations by the time he was 13 months. Mr Black's mother, Michaela, said: 'That little boy needs to be out playing football with his friends in the sunshine, not at home asking his mummy why he can't. I'm so proud of Daniel' His family, from the nearby village of . Mathern, are desperately trying to find £60,000 to send him to America . for a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy. His mother Ann Drewery, 44, described . Mr Black’s £20,000 gift as ‘phenomenal’. The family had already raised . just over £11,000, so they now have more than half of the £60,000. She said: ‘What Dan has done is brilliant. So many people have helped Brecon and we are grateful to them all.’ Brecon’s father Rob Vaughan, also 44, . added: ‘Dan has given us a phenomenal amount of money. I don’t think it . is even possible to say how grateful we are, or to put into words what . it means. ‘It is incredible. How do you even start saying thank you for something like that?’ Yesterday Mr Black’s mother Michaela . said: ‘It’s heartwarming what Daniel has done. It’s crazy that that . young lad Brecon could be able to walk, if he had the money. ‘Daniel can’t walk, not right now, and . he accepts that. That little boy needs to be out playing football with . his friends in the sunshine, not at home asking his mummy why he can’t. I’m so proud of Daniel.’ To donate to Brecon's charity fund, please visit http://www.justgiving.com/Brecons-SDR-Journey . Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Source: SCOPE .","Dan Black, 25, was paralysed when he was knocked off his bike in 2009 .

"A young mother died less than a month after the birth of her longed-for first child as a result of ‘extremely rare’ complications, an inquest heard. Hayley Constable and her partner Martin Fitzpatrick were thrilled when son Alfie was born by Caesarean section a year after she suffered a miscarriage. But the 27-year-old’s scar became infected after she took him home. Despite being given antibiotics by her GP, her condition deteriorated and she died in hospital. Now Alfie is at nursery and asks his father why he doesn’t have a mother like his classmates. Grief: Martin Constable with son Alfie. Heartbreakingly, Alfie sees other children with their mothers and asks his father why he doesn't have one of his own . Hayley Constable (pictured just after the birth), 27, was said to have been 'absolutely thrilled' when son Alfie was born - a year after she suffered a miscarriage . Mr Fitzpatrick, 31, who gave up his . job as a newspaper sales executive to look after his son – now two and a . half – said: ‘He’s started nursery and asks why he doesn’t have a mummy . like the other kids. ‘He’s a lovely little boy, a normal happy two-year-old, but it’s incredibly sad to hear him asking questions about Hayley.’ Yesterday her family claimed doctors had failed to treat the infection promptly and missed a chance to save her life. But a pathologist told the inquest Miss Constable’s death was due to an extremely rare set of complications that caused respiratory failure and a stroke. Mr Fitzpatrick said: ¿He¿s a lovely little boy, a normal happy two-year-old, but it¿s incredibly sad to hear him asking questions about Hayley' Hayley with her Neice Molly when she was born.  Just one week after she came home with her own baby she was rushed back into hospital in severe pain, caused by an infection from the scar on her caesarean wound . Miss Constable, who had miscarried in February 2010, went into labour in March 2011 and was taken to Fairfield Hospital maternity unit in Bury. After she spent two days in labour, doctors decided to deliver Alfie by C-section. Two days later Miss Constable a claims technician, was allowed to take Alfie home to Ramsbottom, near Bury. Her mother Anne Constable, 52, a health visitor, told the inquest at Heywood, Rochdale: ‘She was thrilled to become a mum. She was so happy, she was breastfeeding and everything appeared fine.’ Five days later Miss Constable texted her mother to say that she had lumps on the sides of her scar. The community midwife reassured her that the wound appeared to be healing. Mr Fitzpatrick gave up his job as a newspaper sales executive to look after his son . Hayley with partner Martin Fitzpatrick in 2010. Hayley died two weeks after the birth with her family at her bedside after suffering a stroke following a series of medical complications . But the following day she began to suffer worsening pain and a GP prescribed painkillers and antibiotics, Mrs Constable said. The . pain continued to worsen and she was admitted to Fairfield Hospital, . where her blood pressure dropped and she was unable to move. Because she was allergic to penicillin, doctors were initially restricted in their choice of antibiotics to treat her. The following day she was transferred to North Manchester General Hospital, where the infection was drained. That afternoon she was struggling to breathe and was put on a ventilator. Doctors told the family she was suffering with acute respiratory distress syndrome. ‘They told us she might have hours to live or days, or she could recover,’ said Mrs Constable. She was transferred to Glenfield Hospital in Leicester but suffered a stroke and died. Pathologist Dr Alan Padwell told the inquest he had never seen a sequence of events where an infected caesarean section wound had resulted in breathing failure in this way. Pictured while pregnant at her baby shower. Her family said 'she was thrilled to become a mum' Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Simon Nelson said Miss Constable died ‘due to a rare but recognised complication of necessary surgical intervention’. Although the coroner did not criticise the doctors who treated her, Miss Constable’s family are taking legal action against Fairfield Hospital alleging that she could have lived if guidelines on identifying potentially serious infections had been followed. Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Fairfield, said: ‘The Trust would like to express its sincere condolences to Miss Constable’ s partner, son and family in relation to these rare, but tragic circumstances.’ An inquest into her death recorded a narrative verdict.

"A baby boy who was born with his bowel, intestines and liver on the outside of his body due to a rare birth defect has inspired his family and doctors with his miraculous recovery. Doctors thought it would be a year before Hayden Hoskins, who was born in January, would be able to have the organs tucked inside his body - but he underwent reconstructive surgery this summer. Hayden's parents, Kelsea and Andy Hopkins, from Quincy, Illinois, revealed their son's amazing recovery as they threw a benefit to help raise funds for his care this weekend. They first learned that something was not right during a routine ultrasound at 19 weeks. Fighter: Hayden Hoskins, propped up on the family dog, shows his amazing recovery just nine months after he was born with his organs outside his body. He has now undergone reconstructive surgery . The ultrasound showed a large sac at his stomach area and doctors told his stunned parents he suffered from a birth defect known as an Omphalocele, where the organs grow outside the body. The condition is a type of hernia that develops in the baby before birth and only occurs in one in 10,000 babies, KHQA reported. It meant that Hayden was growing part of his abdominal organs in a protective sac near his umbilical cord. It affected his intestines, stomach and liver. Kelsea headed to the delivery room ahead . of schedule due to high blood pressure, and she and her husband were . surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses ready to ensure the baby's . survival. Fears: A rare birth condition meant his liver, intestines and bowel were born in a sac outside his body . Fragile: The sac was bandaged and doctors thought it would be a year before he could have surgery . Condition: An Omphalocele is a type of hernia that develops in the baby before birth . To everyone's relief, Hayden let out a few strong screams and showed no signs of the potential heart and kidney trouble that can have fatal results for a newborn Omphalocele. 'Really the test is when he's here how he does, so it's always very reassuring when babies come out and they cry,' his doctor, Dr Allison Cahill, said just after the birth. 'Once he got over here he needed a little bit more help with his breathing so he has a tube down his windpipe.' Hayden was immediately slipped into a medical zip-lock bag to preserve body heat and fluid, and he was rushed to the NICU at nearby Children's Hospital. While doctors had expected to wait a year before putting his organs back inside his body, they discovered he was the best case scenario and he underwent surgery in June. Miracle: But doctors deemed Andy and Kelsea's baby boy, all pictured after his birth in January, strong enough to have surgery after five months and now he is recovering well . Growing boy: Just months later and Hayden is doing well. His parents are raising money for his health costs . Happy: The family keeps relatives, friends and strangers updated with their progress on a blog . 'He's doing fantastic,' Hayden's physician, Dr. Kathy Asbury, told KHQA. 'He's rolling over. He has great head control.' Residents turned out to raise money for the family at Columbus Road Church Kids Zone on Saturday. The funds will go towards his health costs at St Louis Children's Hospital. 'I think one of the things with this benefit and Hayden's journey is the phenomenal faith that Andy and Kelsea have had,' Dr. Asbury added. 'I think Hayden's really a miracle.' The family also writes a blog updating friends and relatives with Hayden's progress. See below for video from KHQA .","Hayden Hoskins was born in January with his organs outside of his body due to rare birth defect that affects 1 in 10,000 children .

"A former Swiss Guard has claimed he was regularly asked for sex by a 'gay lobby' of high-ranking clergy in the Vatican. Cardinals, bishops, priests and other officials in the Vatican had regularly attempted to engage the unnamed man, who was responsible for the Pope's security, in illicit rendezvous, according to new claims. The former guard said he received up to 20 'unambiguous requests' from members of the clergy and was asked for sex by a dignitary close to Pope John Paul II, a Swiss weekly newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag reported. Scandal: The former member of the Swiss Guard, which is responsible for protecting the Pope, alleged an active 'gay lobby' at the heart of the Vatican. (File photo of Swiss Guards who are not connected to the claims) In the latest sex scandal to engulf the Catholic church, the security guard said a senior official fondled him. He also claimed a bishop left a bottle of whisky on his bed with a visiting card placed next to it. During another incident a priest had invited him to dinner saying that the guard would be served after for dessert. He also claimed that he reported the harassment to officials in the Vatican who offered him no support and attacked the Church's 'hypocrisy' of opposing sex outside of marriage and supporting the excommunication of divorcees. Allegations: The former Swiss Guard claims he was asked for gay sex by a senior dignitary close the Pope John Paul II, pictured, . The former guard said his experiences, several years ago, added weight to allegations of a 'gay lobby' being active in the Vatican. Urs Breitenmoser, a spokesman for the Swiss Guard, which numbers 110 men, told Schweiz am Sonntag that 'the rumour of a homosexual network in the heart of the Vatican was not a problem'. Breitenmoser said the preoccupations of the guards were 'above all religious and military'. Intrigue: Alois Estermann, pictured, his wife and another member of the elite corps were found shot dead . In November, current Pope Francis said at a news conference that he wouldn’t judge priests for their sexual orientation. 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?' the pope said. 'We shouldn’t marginalize people for this,' he added. 'They must be integrated into society.' Francis . said that gay priests should be forgiven and their sins forgotten in a . shift from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who ruled that gays should . not be priests. The Swiss Guard was shaken earlier by a gay controversy at the Vatican in 1998 when its commander Alois Estermann and his wife were shot dead by young guard Cédric Tornay, who later turned the gun on himself. According to a book about the Vatican by British journalist John Follain, Tornay and Estermann had a homosexual affair. Estermann . subsequently had a relationship with another guard and refused to award . a three-year service medal to Tornay, which led the guard to kill him, . Follain maintains. Last . July, an Italian weekly reported that Battista Ricca, appointed by Pope . Francis to a top position at the Vatican bank, had had sexual relations . with a Swiss army officer, amongst others. A Vatican spokesman dismissed the report as 'not credible'. The Catholic church has faced a string of lurid claims over the past decades. Last year, a convicted paedophile priest has claimed a rent boy ring operated at the Vatican, pictured below, with clergymen hiring teenagers for sex inside churches. Don Patrizio Poggi, 46, who served a five-year sentence for abusing five boys aged 14 to 15, at his parish outside Rome, has given police a list of nine names. A senior Vatican official has dismissed the allegations, accusing Poggi of seeking revenge because the church refused to reinstate him. Poggi, the former priest at the San Filippo Neri church in Rome, said he made the allegations to 'protect the Holy Church and the Christian community.' The boys were chosen because they were starving and desperate, he claimed, according to Il Messaggero newspaper. Poggi's list of names included two senior church officials and a religion lecturer. Cardinal Agostino Vallini, head of the Catholic Vicariate of Rome, accused Poggi of making false claims out of a desire for vengeance and personal resentment. Vallini said: 'The cardinal expresses his full confidence in the magistracy and declares himself full convinced that this slander will be demolished, demonstrating Poggi's claims to be untrue . 'God will hold everyone accountable for their deeds.' The controversy comes just weeks after Pope Francis confirmed the existence of a 'gay lobby' in the Vatican to a visiting Latin American church group. The apparent network inside the supposedly celibate and staunchly anti-homosexual Church is one reason why Pope Francis is working on a thorough house-cleaning of the Roman curia.","Swiss Guard got upto 20 'unambiguous requests' from clergy members .

"Baby Caralyn will never get to meet her mother, but the actions of the Iowa woman's best friend will leave the little girl in no doubt as to how much she was loved and wanted. When gym instructor Laura Yoho was told she had brain cancer, the 30-year-old and her husband, Nate, were determined to still have a family together. The couple had just got engaged at the end of 2010, when Laura was diagnosed with having brain tumors after she passed out at the gym. Laura had eggs frozen before starting treatment and, when the couple decided they were ready for a baby, her best friend Kara Stetson offered to act as a surrogate. Tragically, Laura died just four months before her daughter was born, but the actions of Kara means that Laura's family and friends have something positive to hold on to as they remember her. New life: Nate Yoho cradles his daughter Caralyn, who was born to a surrogate four months after her mom died . Devoted: Nate with his wife Laura, who lost her fight against brain cancer . 'It's such an amazing gift. There are no words that could possibly recreate what she's done for myself and my family,' Nate said. Kara said: 'I just felt so happy that there was . something I could do for her family and his family, and selfishly for . me, to keep a part of Laura alive on this Earth.' 'Laura and I are very close so I think it came easy to both of us, the idea,' she added. After Caralyn's birth Des Moines Register reporter Daniel Finney wrote an open letter to the baby,  telling her about her mother and how Kara helped bring her into the world. Gift: Best friend Kara Stetson offered to carry Laura and Nate's baby . It starts: 'You’re barely a month old now, too young to read this letter. But one day soon, someone will show you this, and maybe it will help you understand the wonderful confluence of love and hope that brought you into this world.' In the open letter to Caralyn, the baby girl is told how her parents met and fell in love, about their wedding day, and also the moment they discovered Laura had cancer. Laura first learned that she had brain tumors after passing out at a gym in 2010, a few weeks after the couple got engaged. Originally doctors thought she had suffered a stroke, but as the symptoms persisted the couple sought a second opinion. Despite her illness, Laura continued with her active life and never stopped to fell sorry for herself. When she and Nate decided to try for a baby, her best friend Kara didn't think twice about offering to carry it for them. Kara is quoted in the letter as saying: 'It’s hard to explain what having a best friend like Laura for 24 years meant to me. We were different enough and alike enough to get along perfectly. We never argued. We never got sick of one another. We were like sisters, soul mates and a best friend all rolled into one.' The letter recalled the lighter moments of the surrogacy experience, telling Caralyn that Kara's children would get mixed up with the story, telling friends their mom was having another man's baby, which led to 'some fast explaining'. Making it clear that Laura was fighting to keep the disease at bay so she could meet her daughter, the letter recalls the moment Laura died, peacefully, shortly after having her baby shower. Fighter: Laura found out she had brain tumors after passing out at the gym . Hope: A brain scan from December last year showed the tumors, shown as a white mass, had reduced from the previous scan, far right . Memories: Laura and Nate on their wedding day. Despite undergoing several operations Laura still looked radiant and was determined not to let the disease hold her back . 'Everyone was so sad. Your mom was . gone,' he wrote. 'But there was hope. You were coming. Your dad . anticipated your arrival every day. He grieved for his lost love, but he . prepared for his new one - you - just as hard.' After Caralyn was born, Nate and his baby stayed with Kara's family for a few days as he settled into his role as a dad. 'Caralyn's birth was certainly up and . down,' he told the Des Moines Register. 'I wish my wife was here but the joy of having [Caralyn] here, I . know she wouldn't want me to be sad.' He will make sure Laura remains a big part of their lives, and has plenty of photos of videos of the couple, including a reenactment of the moment he proposed to Laura. While still grieving for his wife, who died on July 23, Nate is also able to look to the future thanks to baby Caralyn, who was born on November 26. 'Part of it's having a little bit of my wife back ... I can see her when my daughter smiles,' he said. Focus: Baby Caralyn has given Nate and Kara something to look forward to after they lost Laura . Prepared: Proud dad Nate with his baby daughter, born four months after her mother died . Stories: Laura will still be a big part of her daughter's life thanks to videos of the couple, such as the one above that recreates Nate's proposal .

"When it comes to seduction, French women believe they have it down to a fine art. And now they are set to share the secret of their success as Soft Paris, France's answer to Ann Summers, launches in the UK. The firm, which organises home parties selling lingerie, boudoir accessories and sex toys, say their ethos is to encourage women to explore their sexuality and teach them secrets to rekindle their relationships. Here, in a MailOnline exclusive, Soft Paris reveal ten tips to allow British women to bring sexy French flair to the bedroom... Ooh la la! Opt for stockings or suspenders and let him watch you put them on (and off) Why do English women hunch over, either shuffling or stomping? This is not seductive. Take the time to look around you, proudly, chin up/shoulders back, walking with one foot almost in front of the other, to undulate your hips provocatively. Don't be a slobbery, noisy, bounding English bulldog. Imagine you’re an elegant cat - light, agile, graceful, quiet. Seduction is about understanding the effects of your movements and using them to your advantage. Racy tips: Wear black lace and act feline to seduce your man . Elegance: Walk tall and let a man put your coat on . When a gentleman holds your coat out for you, do not take it from him, let him dress you. Allow doors to be held open and seats pulled out. Be elegant, always. Don’t hold your glass of wine as if it's a pint of beer, French women lightly hold the top of the glass stem. Know how to handle all objects well. Instead opt for stockings and suspenders, but make sure he is watching when you put them on - give him a show. Slip them on slowly with long strokes and finish off by snapping the elastic on the top of your thighs. Although we could reach the zip on the back of our dresses if we really wanted to, allow him the privilege instead. It can be as seductive to dress a woman, as it is to undress her. Get rid of the Bridget Jones knickers and replace with black lace, ribbon trims, suspenders and waist cinching corsets. Your face should reveal what you’re wearing beneath your clothes, creating a subtle smile, the only clue to your your saucy secret. Forget the fleece pyjamas and bed socks. Opt for a sheer babydoll and a satin robe. It won’t stay on for long… . Wear scented and edible crème so your entire body is lickable. He’ll want to make you dessert. Bedroom fireworks: Soft Paris recommend being playful, adventurous and uninhibited . Even though he may be your husband, never stop seducing. At a dinner party, under the table, take his hand and slowly stroke it along your thigh, leading up to your suspenders. Send naughty texts while he is at work. Intimacy doesn’t have to stay at home… . Be playful, adventurous and uninhibited. Start by exploring and learning your own body, before moving on to your loved one.

"A poster encouraging women to travel to Malaysia for breast augmentation surgery has been banned by the advertising watchdog for 'trivialising' the cosmetic procedure. Commissioned by the Malaysian-based Medical Tourism Association, the offending posters were displayed in public toilets at a number of motorway service stations and shopping centres in the UK. The pink and white ad states: 'Did you know ... ""Boob job"" is the most popular cosmetic procedure for women.' The watchdog upheld the complaint as it felt it trivialised breast enhancement surgery by portraying it as a straightforward 'risk-free' procedure that could be incorporated into a holiday . 'Malaysia is proud to be amongst one of the only countries within the region where medical tourism is promoted by the government.' The ad goes on to discuss safety standards of the cosmetic surgery industry in Malaysia, before adding, 'our private hospitals bagged 3 out of 9 awards at the international Medical Travel Awards 2014.' But the posters came under the scrutiny of the ASA following a complaint by a member of the public that they were socially irresponsible. The watchdog upheld the complaint as it felt it trivialised breast enhancement surgery by portraying it as a straightforward 'risk-free' procedure that could be incorporated into a holiday. 'We considered that could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly, without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention,' it said. 'We therefore concluded the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising breast enhancement surgery.' Malaysia has plenty of other assets to draw potential visitors, including gorgeous stretches of beach . Admedia, the media space buyer that booked the ad on behalf of the Medical Tourism Association, defended their client, saying the ad: 'had not advertised a holiday due to the absence of pricing, tourist or accommodation information nor did it include an option to sign up for a cosmetic procedure.' It claims 'the ad was informative and promoted safety and high standards, demonstrated by examples of internationally recognised awards.' However, the ASA didn't agree and ruled that the main focus of the poster was medical tourism for breast augmentation, and this emphasis 'was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered.'","Advert commissioned by Malaysian-based Medical Tourism Association .

"A new photograph of Madeleine McCann – dressed as a pumpkin for Halloween – has been released by a campaign group, with the blessing of her parents. The touching photograph shows a happy and beaming Maddie dressed as an orange pumpkin, wearing white trainers and clutching a cuddly teddy bear, grinning for the camera. The picture – believed to be one of the favourites of her parents Gerry, 45, and Kate, 46 – was taken  months before the then three-year-old went missing from Praia da Luz resort in Portugal in 2007. The new picture, showing Madeleine dressed as a pumpkin, left, has been released by a campaign group, with the blessing of her parents. It was published alongside the more well-known picture of her clutching three tennis balls under her chin, right . The new photo appears on the Facebook page of the Official Find Madeleine Campaign, which is supported by the McCanns. The photograph was released on Friday to mark Halloween, and appears beside three others of Maddie, including the well-known one of her clutching three tennis balls under her chin. A source close to the McCanns said: ‘The photo which hasn’t been seen before has been put out as part of the campaign and is authorised by Kate and Gerry.’ The new picture is accompanied by a plea, saying: ‘Someone, somewhere knows where Madeleine is. A computer generated image showing what Madeleine could have looked like at the age of nine . 'PLEASE come forward if you know anything about her whereabouts.’ Hundreds of well-wishers have left messages of support since the new photo was posted. One well-wisher, Maxine Hilson, wrote: ‘I pray that these lovely brave people will be reunited with Madeleine one day. ‘My husband was killed by a dangerous driver two years ago but at least I know where he is.’","New picture shows the three-year-old dressed as a pumpkin for Hallowen .

"ISIS in Libya have released pictures of armed fighters burning musical instruments as the extremist group continues its propaganda assault in the north African country. Pictures of the heavily armed masked militants watching while a pile of drums burnt in the Libyan desert were released earlier today - purportedly by the 'media wing' of the local group. It is understood the brightly coloured instruments had been confiscated by the religious police, and were destroyed near the port city of Derna, in eastern Libya. 'Unislamic': The group claims it burned the drums because it believes music is against their religion . Seized: A statement said the instruments were 'burnt in accordance with Islamic law' A message released with the pictures explains: 'Hesbah seized these un-Islamic musical instruments in the state of Warqa (we call it the city of Derna). It adds they were 'burnt in accordance with Islamic law'. Whether or not it actually is has been a point of some debate in the Islamic world, but Libya's ISIS recruits are not the first to burn instruments. Earlier this year, religious police were filmed beating musicians and destroying their instruments as punishment for playing an 'un-Islamic' keyboard. The men were pictured being hit across the back and legs with a wooden stick in a public square in Syria after ISIS's fanatical Islamic enforcers ruled the electric keyboard was 'offensive to Muslims'. Another picture shows two keyboards and what appears to be a lute smashed to pieces after raids thought to have taken place in Bujaq, a few miles to the east of Aleppo in Syria. Brand new?: Some of the drums destined for the pyre appeared to never have been used before . Hidden: The ISIS militants were careful not to show their faces in any of the pictures . These latest pictures from Libya are the latest in an onslaught of 'propaganda' being released by the country's local branch of ISIS. The group, and its march through Libya, was brought back into the spotlight with the release of a five minute video showing the murders of a group of Coptic Christians. The men were beheaded by the extremists on the beach at Sirte, allowing them to film the blood running into the Mediterranean. It has since released pictures showing a smart fleet of Toyota Land Cruisers carrying the notorious black flag of Islamic State as they drive in perfect unison through the streets of Libya. Propaganda war: Libya's ISIS fighters came back into the spotlight when they beheaded 21 Egyptian men . Co-ordinated: The group followed it up with pictures purporting to be its own fleet of 4x4s . Land grab: ISIS now controls four major cities along the Libyan coast - including Derna, far right, where the pictures of fighters burning instruments were taken, and Serte, centre, where the beheadings took place . The extremist group has taken control of four major cities along Libyia's coast, joining forces with groups that formed after the fall of Gadafi. Meanwhile, Libya's internationally recognised government has fled to Tubruq, near the Egyptian border, a two-and-a-half hour drive from where the instruments were supposedly burned. It shares control of Tubruq and capital Tripoli with other rebel groups. Libyan forces are working with an international coalition to try to rid the country of ISIS.","Group published pictures of fighters watching a pyre of drums burning .

Anyone interested in downloading the software can register their interest via Pixar’s RenderMan site. Scroll down for videos . The RenderMan software typically costs $495 (£295) and has been used by Pixar to render animations in Toy Story 3 (pictured), Wreck It Ralph and Star Wars. From August, amateur animators can get hold of the non-commercial version of the program for free . Rendering is used in 3D graphics to add the final appearance to computer models and animation. It is also used in video games and simulators. The software uses a combination of light physics and mathematics to plot how the final image will look to make them as realistic as possible. For . movie animations, several images, also known as frames, are rendered, . and stitched together in a program such as RenderMan.

"Phone cases were once simply used to protect fragile phones, but the latest wave of cases are so smart, they can predict incoming messages. The Lunecase uses excess energy, generated when the phone connects to a network, to . show notifications, and can distinguish between the individual . wavelengths created by calls and texts. These notifications appear on the rear of the case, before the phone registers they've arrived, and means alerts can be seen when the phone is face down. Scroll down for video .

"An Ontario teen who made headlines when she fought back against cruel bullies who mocked the disfigurement on half her face now has her own television special. Sarah Atwell suffers from neurofibromatosis, a condition the 17-year-old was diagnosed with at 8 months, and the tumor it caused to grow on just one side of her face elicited cries of ‘fat face’ and ‘slut’ from ruthless schoolmates for years. But in 2012, Atwell fought back. She posted a video to Facebook in which she made her intentions to live a happy life clear no matter what the bullies called her. Emotional: Sarah conquered at least part of the pain associated with her disfigurement with a 2012 YouTube video in which she hit out at her bullies . That remarkable strength first won Atwell droves of fans across the internet. Now it’s gotten her a special on Discovery Fit & Health slated to air December 18. The special documents Atwell, who lives with her family in Nova Scotia, in the weeks leading up to what she hopes will be a life-altering surgery to remove the tumor once and for all. All eyes are on the high schooler and thanks to her video they’re looks of adoration not fear or hate. It wasn’t always like that. ‘I thought I’d make a video and say what’s been going on,’ she told Discovery. Fighting back: Atwell posted a video where she battles back against the people who've made her feel terrible as she struggled with a lifetime of disfigurement caused by the rare disease neurofibromatosis . Revealing her pain: At 16, she'd had enough. 'I was tired of being bullied and I put in on Facebook' she said . Sarah's touching candor won her millions of internet fans almost overnight. 'The next day I got up and my inbox was over 1000 messages or more from people,' she said. Always smiling: Sarah's video was seen by folks at Discovery Channel, who were impressed enough to document her preparations for a final surgery to remove the tumor over the course of several weeks . She’d dealt with bullying all her life and at 16 she was fed up. ‘I was in grade three and people were calling me names like 'fat face' and 'ugly' and were pushing me around,’ Sarah told ABC News. ‘They said I had a disease. Most of the time, I just walked away and didn't say much to them.’ This night in 2012, she decided to say something. Using notecards, she wrote out everything her life with neurofibromatosis, and the bullies who came with it, made her feel. ‘I have a tumor, that’s all,’ says a card the teen holds for the world to see. ‘I wish people could understand there is nothing wrong with me,’ says another. But people weren’t trying to understand, something the video makes heartbreakingly clear. ‘I get called names all the time,’ reads a card. ‘Bitch, slut, fat face, fat, ugly…it hurts.’ ‘Maybe one day the bullying will stop, but until then I’m going to be STRONG,’ one of the last cards says. Satisfied, Sarah posted her video to Facebook and went to bed. ‘The next day I got up and my inbox was over 1000 messages or more from people,’ Sarah said. ‘It felt pretty good.’ Among what was likely the millions who saw her video was someone from Discovery and the channel has documented a very exciting, and scary, part of the young girl’s life. 'I wish people could understand, there's nothing wrong with me': Sarah's special airs December 18 and documents her struggle with everyday teenage issues as she prepares to undergo major surgery, one of many she's endured in her short life . Not only is she at the brink of a new chapter as a senior in high school, the special also shows her preparing to undergo a surgery she hopes will be her last. The footage is from last year. Today, she’s a new woman. ‘It's pretty awesome. I am pretty sure most of it is gone except a little bit around the eyes,’ she told ABC. ‘The doctor said he could not be sure if it would come back or not.’ Sarah says she hopes to find a career where she can work with kids. And she’d give them all the wisdom she wish she’d been given. ‘If I could stand up to bullying, and if another kid who was bullied sees me and thinks they can talk to someone and think, 'I can stand up for myself,' then I have helped,’ she said. No more rainy days: Sarah's special was taped in 2012. She's now undergone her surgery, which left only a small part of the tumor around her eye, and she hopes to now live a relatively normal life . ¿It's pretty awesome. I am pretty sure most of it is gone except a little bit around the eyes,¿ Sarah said. ¿The doctor said he could not be sure if it would come back or not.¿ .","Sarah Atwell, 17, of Nova Scotia, Canada suffers from neurofibromatosis, a rare disease that causes a tumor to grow on half her face .

"Trolls: Cycling hero Sir Chris Hoy has been subjected to vile online abuse after making comments about the prospect of Scottish independence . Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy has been subjected to offensive abuse from nationalist campaigners after he raised concerns about Scottish independence. The Scottish cycling hero was branded a ‘bigoted anti-Scot’, a ‘t*****’, a ‘creep’ and an ‘imbecile’ by the online army of so-called ‘CyberNats’. The disgraceful remarks have sparked fury, with a UK minister calling on Alex Salmond to take action amid fears of ‘lasting damage to damage Scotland’s reputation’. Sir Chris has won legions of fans across the globe with his passion and professionalism on the track. But Britain’s greatest ever Olympian became an enemy for the CyberNats after he warned that Scottish athletes will find it harder to challenge on the world stage if the country becomes independent. The six-time gold medal winner explicitly refused to reveal his voting intention, insisting he did not want to get involved in the ‘hornet’s nest’. But that did not stop the online abuse from pro-independence supporters who use Twitter and news websites to attack Unionists. Twitter user J McG Linklater – whose profile picture includes the SNP logo - wrote: 'I’ve always said Hoy is a bigoted anti-Scot.' Gareth Lewis wrote on the micro-blogging site: 'Naff off Chris Hoy you soft s**.' Others attacked Sir Chris’s upbringing and his schooling at Edinburgh’s George Watson’s private school. One anonymous online comment stated: 'Schooled at an expensive Edinburgh private establishment where pupils were expected to sing God Save the Queen on a regular basis - maybe it got engrained?' Concerns: Gold medal-winning cyclist Sir Chris Hoy warned Scottish athletes would find it harder to compete on the world stage as an independent nation . Last night, Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: 'The negative and personal tone of the attacks on Sir Chris is shameful and casts the referendum debate in a poor light. 'This could deliver lasting damage to damage Scotland’s reputation abroad and lead to unnecessary hostility here at home. Everyone has a responsibility to guard against the independence debate leaving scars that last well beyond [next year’s referendum in] September next year. 'I believe it would be helpful if the First Minister and the Scottish Government were explicit in their condemnation of those trying to shout down the views of Sir Chris and others. The debate on our future must be open to all.' The row comes just weeks after comedian Susan Calman revealed she was reduced to tears by online trolls after she cracked jokes about the independence referendum. UKIP leader Nigel Farage also faced anti-English abuse from a largely pro-independence crowd of protesters on a recent visit to Edinburgh. Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: 'First comedienne Susan Calman, then Nigel Farage, now Olympic great Sir Chris Hoy - the nationalists seek to silence everyone they disagree with. If this is the kind of Scotland we'll get with independence I am sure even more will reject the nationalists' plans. 'When I stood up for Nigel Farage's right to speak I did so irrespective of his views. The same applies to Chris Hoy and anyone else's right to free speech.' Pressure: A UK Minister has called on SNP leader Alex Salmond, left, to condemn the attacks on Sir Chris Hoy, pictured right with wife Sarra Kemp, to ensure the debate surrounding independence is respectful . Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, Sir Chris said: 'I've said numerous times how proud I am to be Scottish and how proud I have been to compete for Britain too, and I don't think these two things necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.' Discussing the prospect of a separate Olympics team in an independent Scotland, he said: 'It would not be quite as simple as just saying, 'there is a Scottish athlete, they have won a gold medal, therefore that's a medal for Scotland'. Most of the athletes have had to move to facilities which are often outwith Scotland.' Last night, an SNP spokesman said: 'Chris Hoy is one of Scotland’s greatest Olympians and we are all proud of his achievements. We join Willie Rennie in condemning these comments regardless of what party political persuasion they come from. Online abuse has no place in the political debate. 'It’s a matter of public record that [Deputy SNP leader] Nicola Sturgeon has been sent death threats on Twitter, a posting on the No campaign’s Facebook page talked about firing bullets into SNP leaders, appalling remarks about Alex Salmond's dad were made on a Labour Party website, and the abuse directed at Susan Calman was disgraceful. 'All of it must stop, because the referendum debate needs to be a positive one with the people about what Scotland can achieve as an independent country.' A Scottish Government spokesman added: 'The debate on the referendum and our nation’s future must be a positive one – the people of Scotland deserve no less. We utterly condemn any forms of abuse either on or offline. 'Scottish Government ministers have made clear said that everyone involved – on both sides of the debate – has a duty to conduct themselves properly.'","Six-time gold medal winner subjected to vile online abuse after airing views .

"A police officer who triggered outrage when he fatally shot a pitbull puppy has received death threats with thousands calling for him to be 'terminated'. Footage from his body camera shows Officer Kevin Dupre calling over six-month-old Maximus with kissing noises before shooting the puppy in a garden in Cleburne, Texas. He has been placed on paid administrative leave until the outcome of the police investigation. A Texas community is outraged over a video showing an officer calling a pitbull over (not the dog pictured) before shooting the dog to death . A petition to terminate Officer Kevin Dupre has attracted 64,800 signatures. It says: 'We are ashamed and disgusted by the cowardly acts of this officer. It's up to us to demand that the police not turn their head from this story. 'This killing is totally unjustified and a vibrant young puppy died a horrible death. This puppy was loved and his owner Amanda Henderson was left devastated.' The officer was responding to a 911 call in August after a woman reported that three pitbulls were menacing a car and keeping people from leaving. He claimed the pitbull was aggressive and began growling when he got within 20 ft of the dogs. In the police report he said: 'I made kissing noises in an attempt to calm the dogs. Owner Amanda Henderson said the footage shows a murder and that every shot makes her cringe . 'I raised my duty weapon to the ready position pointed at the growling dog's head. As soon as I lifted my pistol, the dog began coming up the hill, continuing to growl and display its teeth. 'The other dog began backing away. I fired three shots at it. It rolled back into the ditch and died.' Owner Amanda Henderson said the footage shows a murder and that every shot makes her cringe. 'I see him murdering my puppy, our family...our dog,' she told WFAA. 'Never once did Max stop wagging his tail. Never once do you hear a growl, an aggressive anything,' she said. The city of Cleburne has said that the incident is under investigation and stated: 'The short video does not tell the whole story.' A statement released on October 17 said: 'The officer was attempting to secure the other dogs until animal control arrived when one dog became aggressive.' Cleburne Mayor Scott Cain described the video as 'very disturbing' but said they need to honor the process and complete reviews. Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat . He also said the death threats are being taken very seriously. Footage shows one pitbull running up to one cop with its tail wagging upon the officer's arrival. Another officer, fitted with a body camera, can be seen going behind the house to find two more dogs in a ditch. Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood in Texas . Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat. Residents are not comfortable with how he handled the situation. 'To call the dog and act like you're going to be sweet to the dog, and you just blatantly shoot it, I don't think that's right at all,' says neighbor Virginia Granger. Kristin Dodge, who also lives in the area, told CBS DFW the dogs were well behaved and played with her kids. 'These are people's pets. These are people's family. To see something like that happen wasn't really necessary, I think,' she said. Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood. Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 817-556-8894.","Officer Kevin Dupre is being investigated after shooting a pitbull puppy .

"Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann were hurt by a controversial book about Madeleine, a judge ruled . The former police chief who published astonishing claims that Kate and Gerry McCann faked their daughter Madeleine’s disappearance to cover up her death expects them to lose their libel battle against him, it was claimed today. Goncalo Amaral is reported to have said the early rulings by the judge in the  case suggested her verdict may be 'favourable' to him. The 57-year-old told Portuguese television on Friday that Maria Emilia Melo e Castro’s indications so far led him to believe he would win the case, according to the Daily Star. His comments came as a ruling emerged that the McCanns were hurt by the book written by Mr Amaral, who was tasked with finding the girl. But the pain the couple feel existed before Mr Amaral published the controversial claims, Mrs Melo e Castro said. The finding came out of a key hearing on Wednesday in Lisbon ahead of a final judgement in the long-running £1million libel trial which has pitted the McCanns against the disgraced former detective they accuse of hampering the search for their daughter. The judge presiding over the high-profile case ruled on 37 points she found had been proven and not proven since lawyers started their court battle in October 2013. She said statements made by Mr Amaral in his July 2008 book The Truth of The Lie and a subsequent TV documentary and Portuguese newspaper interview had left the McCanns suffering ‘rage, desperation, anguish, worry, insomnia and lack of appetite’. But she ruled that although the book had affected the couple, those feelings pre-existed the book’s publication three days after the first Portuguese investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance was shelved and the McCanns were told they were no longer ‘arguidos’ (formal suspects). Scroll down for video . Former police chief: The judge said statements made by Goncalo Amaral in his  book The Truth of The Lie and a subsequent TV documentary and Portuguese newspaper interview had left the McCanns suffering 'rage' Mrs Melo e Castro also ruled it had not been proven Kate and Gerry, from Rothley, Leicestershire, were ‘completely destroyed, from a moral, social, ethical, sentimental and family perspective beyond the pain their daughter’s absence causes them’ by statements made in Amaral’s book. She also decided it had been proven the couple felt badly about being considered responsible for hiding their daughter’s body - a thesis which Portuguese police behind a new probe into Madeleine’s disappearance have publicly rubbished - but described those feelings as ‘expectable.’ But she dismissed the idea Mr Amaral’s claims about the McCanns had stopped the Portuguese police investigating Madeleine’s disappearance. Still missing: Portuguese prosecutors reopened their probe into Madeleine’s disappearance last year . The rulings left Mr Amaral confident of court victory next month when the judge is expected to announce her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing. He accused the McCanns of taking him to court so they could exonerate themselves of blame for the disappearance of their daughter, who vanished aged three from their Praia da Luz holiday flat in May 2007 while they were eating tapas nearby with friends. Portuguese papers signalled the outcome of last Wednesday’s hearing as a positive one for heart specialist Gerry and Kate moments after it finished. But as the full findings became apparent they changed their tune to portray the judge’s rulings as a slap in the face for the couple. Leading Portuguese daily Correio da Manha headlined an article on the result of the hearing: ‘McCanns destroyed before the book.’ Rival Jornal de Noticias reported: ‘Judge without proof that the book about Maddie ""destroyed"" her parents.’ The McCanns told the Lisbon court staging the Amaral libel trial last summer they were left ‘devastated and crushed’ by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the British couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine’s twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn’t know the detail. Legal case: The rulings left Mr Amaral (pictured) confident of court victory next month when as expected the judge announces her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: ‘I believe that’s what's in Mr Amaral’s book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. To a child it could be very damaging.’ Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: ‘I was devastated. It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. ‘It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.’ She went on to accuse Mr Amaral, thrown off the Madeleine McCann investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of ‘consistently smearing’ she and Gerry - and claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter’s whereabouts. It has already been revealed Mr Amaral, 56, earned at least £344,000 from his book and TV documentary. The ex-police chief, who is being sued for £1million, is denying defamation. Case: Mr and Mrs McCann arrive for the libel case against Mr Amaral at Lisbon's Palace of Justice last June . His lawyer Miguel Cruz Rodrigues claimed in the last open court hearing in December the McCanns had taken legal action against his client ‘to rid themselves of guilt for their negligent conduct’ in leaving Madeleine and her siblings alone. He also claimed their lack of cooperation with the Portuguese police authorities had led to the archiving of the investigation in 2008. Portuguese prosecutors reopened their probe into Madeleine’s disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard. No date has been set yet for the final judgement in the libel case. The judgement will be read out in court before being released in writing on the same day. A source close to the McCanns said last night: ‘We expect it to be ready for next month.’","Kate and Gerry McCann were hurt by ex-police chief's book, says judge .

"The phones at Red's Trading Post wouldn't stop ringing. Would-be customers from as far away as New York wanted to know if the Twin Falls, Idaho gun shop had firearms in stock. Others clamored to find out if their orders had been shipped. Overwhelmed, gun store manager Ryan Horsley had to do what no employee would ever think of doing just days before Christmas: He disconnected the phone lines for three whole days. ‘We had to shut everything off,’ says Horsley, whose family has owned Red's Trading Post, the state's oldest gun shop, since 1936. ‘We were swamped in the store and online.’ Eager to buy: After the Sandy Hook massacre, sales of the specific weapon used, an AR-15 assault rifle (pictured) rocketed . The phones at gun shops across the country are ringing off the hook. Demand for firearms, ammunition and bulletproof gear has surged since the December 14 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that took the lives of 20 schoolchildren and six teachers and administrators. The shooting sparked calls for tighter gun control measures, especially for military-style assault weapons like the ones used in Newtown and in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting earlier this year. The prospect of a possible weapons ban has sent gun enthusiasts into a panic and sparked a frenzy of buying at stores and gun dealers nationwide. Assault rifles are sold out across the country. Rounds of .223 bullets, like those used in the AR-15 type Bushmaster rifle used in Newtown, are scarce. Stores are struggling to restock their shelves. Gun and ammunition makers are telling retailers they will have to wait months to get more.Store owners who have been in the business for years say they have never seen demand like this before. When asked how much sales have increased in the past few weeks, Horsley just laughed. Gun frenzy: People crowd the RK Gun Show in the Smokies in Knoxville, Tennessee on Friday, December 28, 2012. Sales of high-capacity bullet magazines have also risen . ‘We haven't even had a chance to look at it,’ he says. Horsley spends his days calling manufacturers around the country trying to buy more items for the store. Mainly, they tell him he has to wait. Franklin Armory, a firearm maker in Morgan Hill, California, is telling dealers that it will take six months to fulfill their orders. The company plans to hire more workers and buy more machines to catch up, says Franklin Armory's President Jay Jacobson. The shortage is leaving many would-be gun owners empty handed. William Kotis went to a gun show in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, last weekend hoping to buy a rifle for target shooting. Almost everything was sold out. ‘Assault rifles were selling like crazy,’ says Kotis, who is president and CEO of Kotis Holdings, a real estate development company based in Greensboro. ‘People are stockpiling.’ He left without buying anything. Luke Orlando's parents were able to get him the 12-gauge shotgun he wanted for Christmas to bird hunt, but his uncle wasn't as lucky. ‘At Christmas dinner, my uncle expressed outrage that after waiting six months to use his Christmas bonus to purchase an AR-15, they are sold out and back ordered over a year,’ says Orlando, 18, a student at the University of Texas. No organization publicly releases gun sales data. The only way to measure demand is by the number of background checks that are conducted when someone wants to buy a firearm. Those numbers are released by the Federal Reserve Bureau every month. Data for December is not out yet. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation says that it did 16.8 million firearm background checks as of the end of November, up more than 2 per cent from a year ago. Eager shoppers: People line up to enter the RK Gun Show last year after Obama's speech . The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which handles background checks for the state, can't keep up with the number of requests it is getting. The bureau has pulled staff from other units and increased its hours, says spokesperson Susan Medina. Many firearm dealers and manufacturers say that Obama's comments since the Newtown school shooting are driving demand. James Zimmerman of SelwayArmory.com, a website that sells guns, ammunition and knives, says that sales really took off on December 19 after President Barack Obama held a White House press conference announcing that Vice President Joe Biden would lead a team tasked with coming up with ‘concrete proposals’ to curb gun violence. That day, one customer ordered 32,000 rounds of ammunition from SelwayArmory.com, worth close to $18,000. The order had to be shipped from the company's Lolo, Montana, office to Kentucky on a freight truck. ‘I've done more sales in the week after the 19th than I have the whole year,’ says Zimmerman, who launched SelwayArmory.com in 2009. At Lady Liberty Gunsmithing LLC in Atlantic City, New Jersey, a customer called last week asking if a pistol he wanted was available. When he was told there was only one left, he drove more than two hours from Newark, New Jersey, to buy it that same day. ‘People want guns now even more than ever,’ says Guy Petinga II, whose father opened the store above his home in 1996. Others saw demand immediately after the shooting. Bullet Blocker, which makes bulletproof vests, briefcases and insert panels, saw sales of its children's backpacks suddenly jump. ‘That's how I found out about the tragedy. I saw the sales rise and then turned on CNN,’ says Elmar Uy, vice president of business operations at the Billerica, Massachusetts, company. Bullet Blocker has sold about 50 to 100 bulletproof backpacks a day since the shooting, up from about 10 to 15 in a regular week. The children's backpacks, which are designed to be used as shields, cost over $200 each. ‘I've never seen numbers like this before,’ says Uy.
