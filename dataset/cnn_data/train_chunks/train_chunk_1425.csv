"Five men have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after armed police officers stopped a vehicle at Dover port as it tried to leave Britain. Two men, aged 33 and 43, were arrested in Dover at 11.30pm last night and a 28-year-old man was arrested at the same port this morning. Scotland Yard anti-terror officers, who were supported by Kent Police, also arrested another two men, aged 24 and 40 in east London in the early hours of this morning. Investigation: Five men have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after armed police officers stopped a vehicle at Dover port as it tried to leave Britain . All five were being held tonight at a police station in central London where they were being questioned on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. A 37-year-old man was also arrested last night in Dover on suspicion of people trafficking offences, the Metropolitan Police said. He was also being held at a police station this evening. 'A further 12 men and one woman who were stopped in the same vehicle were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences by Immigration Enforcement officers,' a police spokesman said. He added: 'Four addresses in east London and one in south London are being searched today  as part of the investigation. This operation is not in response to any immediate threat.' It is understood the operation was in connection to Syria-related terrorism. The Port of Dover declined to comment. Threat: Fears of a terrorist attack in Britain have heightened in the wake of the rise of Islamic State (IS), the extremist group that has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria . The arrests were made at the end of counter-terrorism awareness week, which saw increased activity at ports across the country. Britain's chief counter-terror police officer warned the current threat to the UK from jihadists will remain for 'several years'. The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe a few months ago against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'. Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of the rise of Islamic State (IS), the extremist group that has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and attracted thousands of foreign jihadists to its cause, including more than 500 Britons. Last week, a new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament. It will move to a second reading in Parliament tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Two men stopped last night in Dover and a third arrested this morning .

"An ultra-conservative Jewish newspaper has digitally removed female politicians from an iconic image of world leaders marching through Paris, following last week's terror attacks. Israel's The Announcer airbrushed out German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo - and cropped the front-page picture to completely exclude Danish Prime Minster, Helle Thorning-Shmidt. It's believed the women were removed from the historic image, taken on January 11, so the newspaper would not offend its highly devout Orthodox readers. Scroll down for video . Remembrance: The original picture, taken on January 11, shows all three female leaders marching in Paris . Removed: The altered picture on the front page of Israeli newspaper, The Announcer, excludes German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo - while only the hand of Danish Prime Minster Helle Thorning-Shmidt makes the picture . 'Airbrushed out': This before and after picture shows how the three women, Helle Thorning-Shmidt (below, left), Anne Hidalgo (below, centre) and Angela Merkel (below, right) were digitally removed from the photo. Swiss President, Simonetta Sommaru, has been left as a blur behind a crowd of faces, while the EU's foreign affairs and security chief, Frederica Mogherini, was left out entirely. The women were among 40 world leaders who lined arms with their male counterparts to lead a million people through Paris, in a statement of international solidarity following the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Six of the magazine's journalists, killed by two masked gunmen, were among 17 innocent people to lose their lives in a wave of terror attacks in Paris last week. French newspapers have blasted The Announcer's 'hypocritical' front page, which they believe disrespects 'the unity of the march'. One reader in Israel said: 'They are not protecting women from leering men, or men from illicit thoughts. They are telling their community that women have no place in society outside the home. Very sad and very disturbing.' Three years ago, another orthodox Jewish newspaper, Di Tzeitung, sparked anger in the US by removing then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, from a 2001 image of the White House situation room during the raid which killed Osama Bin Laden. While The Announcer - known in Hebrew as HaMevaser - has refused to print the names of female members of the Israeli parliament.

Deleted: Danish Prime Minister, Helle Throning-Shmidt (right) - seen here with French President Francois Hollande - was one of the female leaders digitally removed from the image . 'Hypocrisy': Paris' own mayor, Anne Hidalgo (right), was airbrushed out of the images as her city mourned 17 deaths in a wave of terror attacks . German Chancellor, Angela Merkel (pictured, centre), seen here at a community rally condemning the Paris terror attacks, was removed from the iconic image . It has allegedly defended the removal of Angela Merkel and other women leaders from this week's front page for 'reasons of modesty' and its stance not to depict women in the media. According to another Israeli publication, Haaretz, removing women from such pictures is nothing new. They also claim that Israeli parties representing the ultra-orthodox electorate openly ban women from running for the Knesset - and female images are completely absent from media outlets and advertisements aimed at that demographic. The photograph's manipulation was first spotted by a regional reporter on the Hebrew news website, Walla, who said: 'The paper didn't blur out Merkel's image or white it out, but completely re-edited the photograph and moved the images of the participants around, so that you could never tell that Merkel was ever there.' The Announcer was founded by Meir Porush, a former member of the ultra-orthodox United Torah Judiasm party.","German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, one of the woman digitally removed .

"A 63-year-old American man has died during a flight from Nigeria to New York's JFK after vomiting profusely - but it was only a  'cursory' exam by the CDC that confirmed he did not have Ebola. The unnamed passenger boarded an Arik Air plane out of Lagos, Nigeria, on Wednesday night, but passed away before the plane reached its final destination. Flight attendants called the CDC, Port Authority and customs officials, who then boarded the plane in protective gear as it touched down, forcing 145 worried passengers to remain on board. The authorities then conducted tests on the body and it was only a short evaluation that suggested he did not have the deadly virus, prompting concerns there are still 'vulnerabilities' at airports. Scroll down for video . Scare: The passenger, 63, boarded an Arik Air plane out of Lagos, Nigeria, on Wednesday but passed away before the plane reached its final destination (file picture) According to the New York Daily News, the man, who was traveling alone, also suffered chest pains before he died. This morning, a Port Authority source said he passed away of an apparent heart attack, but this is yet to be confirmed. Following his death, the U.S. citizen's body was  handed over to the Port Authority who removed it from the plane, with the CDC allegedly providing little information on how to deal with the remains. Throughout the 45-minute ordeal, the door connecting the aircraft to the terminal was left open, according to The New York Post . This prompted worries from Republican Congressman Peter King that there are not enough checks in place before reaching the screening process. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, he wrote: 'It was what I was told a cursory examination. The Port Authority cops and personnel from Customs and Border Protection were there, and they were told there was no danger because the person did not have Ebola,' King said. Demonstration: A protester stands outside the White House, urging the Obama administration to ban all flights into the United States to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus . Airport: Flight attendants called the CDC, Port Authority and customs officials, who boarded the plane in protective gear as it touched down at JFK (pictured), forcing 145 worried passengers to remain on board . 'But their concern was, how could you tell so quickly? And what adds to the concern is how wrong the CDC has been over the past few weeks.' His letter goes on to demand that Homeland Security needs to strengthen protocols before reaching the screening location - concerned of what happens to potentially infected passengers in flight and at the terminal itself. He added: 'These individuals transit the airport with the rest of the traveling population, including using the restrooms,' King wrote to Jeh Johnson, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in a letter Thursday. Concern: The scare at JFK involving the passenger from Nigeria prompted Republican Congressman Peter King to write to the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting there are still 'vulnerabilities' at airports . It comes just days after Congressman King claimed that President Barack Obama should suspend travel to the U.S. from West Africa to avoid the spread of the deadly virus. He tweeted on Tuesday: 'POTUS should suspend travel to US from W Africa & visas to citizens of W Africa nations until we get clearer analysis of Ebola transmission.' Nigeria is 1,000 miles east of the three West African countries suffering from an Ebola outbreak, but has had 19 cases of the virus. Action needed: The representative for New York's 2nd District asked if the potential of having isolation zones within the terminal had been looked at . Speaking out: It comes just days after Congressman King claimed that President Barack Obama should suspend travel to the U.S. from West Africa to avoid the spread of the deadly virus . However there have been no new patients in recent months and, according to the World Health Organization, if there are no more by Monday, they will officially be declared 'Ebola-free.' Up to 100 passengers a day arrive at JFK from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three West African countries ravaged by the outbreak King said. A total of 4,493 people have died so far from the Ebola virus according to figures released by the World Health Organization on Wednesday. The first cases were reported in Guinea on March 2.","The 63-year-old, a U.S. citizen, died during flight from Lagos to New York .

"One of Air New Zealand’s two Dreamliners is back in the skies again just days after it was hit by lightning during a fierce spring storm last week. The lightning strike occurred as the Boeing 787-9 landed safely in Perth following a seven-hour journey from Auckland last Thursday afternoon. Aircraft engineers discovered scorch marks on the fuselage, so the aircraft was taken out of service and flown back to Auckland without any passengers for further inspection and repairs. Scroll down for video . One of Air New Zealand's Dreamliners is back in service after it was struck by lightning (file photo) It is carrying passengers again after it was given the all clear over the weekend. An airline spokeswoman told the New Zealand Herald: ‘The incident forced the cancellation of a flight from Perth to Auckland which was due to operate on Thursday evening. ‘The aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, was assessed by engineers in Perth and cleared to operate positioning flight NZ6014 back to Air New Zealand's engineering and maintenance base in Auckland where full engineering support is available.’ In an attempt to ease any fears for nervous flyers, the spokeswoman said such incidents not uncommon and aircraft are designed to withstand lightning strikes. The lightning strike occurred as the plane landed in Perth following a seven-hour journey from Auckland . Air New Zealand didn’t provide statistics on the frequency of lightning strikes involving its planes, but at least 75 incidents have been reported in Australia in 2014, according to the country’s transport safety bureau. Dreamliners have a composite fuselage rather than metal, and its embedded conducting material is designed to absorb a lightning strike. The worst air tragedy related to a lightning strike occurred in the US state of Maryland in December 1963. Eighty-one people died after a bolt of lightning ignited fuel vapours and caused an explosion that brought down a Boeing 707-121 operated by Pan Am.","Plane landed safely in Perth and was taken out of service for repairs .

"NYPD Commissioner William Bratton has warned the city expects an ISIS-inspired lone wolf terror attack after a new video calling for strikes was released by the group. The NYPD have been warned to look out for jihadi attacks after the terrorist group released a call to attack American police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and civilians in a social media video on Saturday. 'As you may recall, there was a similar threat, a Twitter threat, back in September, and shortly thereafter there were a number of attacks in Canada, Australia, also an attack here -- an ax-wielding individual attacked four of our officers,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said Monday on 'CBS This Morning.' Scroll Down for Video . Vigilant: Police in New York City have been placed on high alert for possible attacks from ISIS supporters in the U.S. Above, an NYPD officer patrols Times Square on January 8, 2015 . Following this latest threat, an advisory was issued to NYPD officers urging caution and awareness. 'This one is also very specifically directed at law enforcement personnel, so we're encouraging officers that when they're on these fixed posts, that they be even more vigilant that they might ordinarily be,' Bratton said to CBS News. 'They're there for a purpose, to protect that location, as well as to protect themselves and the public. So if both of them are sitting in the car and they're busy texting away or not paying attention of the surrounding area, they're much more vulnerable to attack.' An internal memo released to officers in the NYPD says that the new threat should be taken more seriously 'in light of the terrorist attacks in France earlier this week' which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people - most of them staff members of the satirical newspaper. Indeed, Bratton said that his biggest concern right now is the threat of lone wolf attacks in the city . Warning: NYPD Commissioner William Bratton has warned the city expects an ISIS-inspired lone wolf terror attack after a new video calling for strikes was released by the group . 'They're continually working to attract new recruits -- not to go fight in Syria as much as to attract new recruits from around the world,' Bratton said to CBS News. 'They're extraordinarily skilled with their public relations campaign, if you will - much more so than the traditional al Qaeda operatives.'

"A nine-year-old girl has reportedly been flown out of Australia to be married in the Middle East. The Immigrant Women’s Health Service, based in western Sydney, claims it learned about the case on Sunday but has no more details. It spoke to the girl's mother after receiving a tip-off, the ABC reports. Scroll down for video . A 9-year-old girl from Sydney has left Australia to be made into a child bride, it's claimed (stock photo shown) Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service, warned that the government is not doing enough to prevent young girls from being married off illegally. She said its strategy to stop child brides would fail because the girls don’t want to implicate their families in the crime. She reasoned: ‘I don't hope and wish to see parents behind bars ... I already tried with many of them to talk about informing the authorities, and as soon as I put that on the table the girls actually turn their back and say “we're not even going to have a conversation with you”.’ Dr  Sharobeem was forced to be a child bride while she was 14 and living in Egypt. 'It's not secret within our communities. It’s maybe secret to the eyes of the rest of the Australian community,' she told 60 Minutes earlier this year. Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the ABC: ‘We're very keen to ... make sure that if somebody is to come across this type of crime that they know how to go about helping that person to report it to authorities so we can do something about it.’ Minister for Women Pru Goward said parents needed to know it was illegal to take their child overseas for a forced marriage. 'Certainly the person who ""married"" the girl can be prosecuted and it is just an unacceptable part of life in Australia,' she told Macquarie Radio on Tuesday. In October, in an unrelated case, a 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence . The latest case comes as the federal government launches an awareness campaign to encourage young women to report child marriages. 'We're making sure that we have materials out there to educate the community about what to look for and so these crimes can be reported and then the appropriate authorities can go and prosecute them,' Mr Keenan said. But Dr Sharobeem, said brochures would have little effect. 'Forced marriage and child brides happen among the culturally and linguistically diverse communities, those communities will not go to the website and will not share glossy papers to see what's written about legislation in the country,' she said. There are currently 70 million child brides in the world. The National Children’s and Youth Law Centre has identified approximately 250 child marriages in Australia over the last two years but many more cases are thought to have gone unreported. In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh and Nigeria, marrying daughters off has been done for generations but in Australia the practice is often used to control children's behaviour, for family businesses, or to meet perceived community expectations. Australia has laws in place to protect children: . In October, a man accused of 'marrying' and having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl, pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse. The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court  to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. He has been ordered not to contact his victim for two years, and a date for sentencing will be decided next week. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier this year. Police in the October case allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier this year . The girl's father will face trial next year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14.

"The Austrian government is looking at ways to expropriate the house where Adolf Hitler spent his early childhood as it seeks to end a dispute with the owner over its use.

The interior ministry has rented the house for years to prevent its misuse, subletting it to various charitable organisations. But the building has stood empty since a workshop for the mentally disabled moved out more than three years ago.

Alderman Harry Buchmayer said officials had 'tried very hard' to find a solution but the owner 'does not seem ready to co-operate'. Mr Grundboeck described expropriation as the 'last option', saying the government hoped the owner would agree to sell. She has reportedly turned down past offers.

"Thousands of rail passengers face Christmas chaos over the busy festive holiday period - and are even being advised not to use a main London to Scotland line – as engineering works cause closures and severe disruption. Repair work on the West Coast main line means it will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Monday December 29. It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Sunday 28 December. Disruption: The West Coast main line will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead . Rail bosses say the now almost traditional Christmas repair closures are vital as work continues on ‘improvements’ in the Watford area and between Stafford and Crewe. To minimise disruption Network Rail and the Virgin Trains and London Midland train companies are advising passengers to avoid the West Coast main line and use alternative routes. The news comes just days after Sir Richard Branson and transport group Stagecoach – which together run the West Coast train operator - last week controversially won the £3.3bn franchise to run the rival East Coast line and means another unwelcome headache for ministers. Jim Syddall, acting route managing director for Network Rail, said: ‘There is never a good time to carry out this type of work and we have liaised closely with the train operators to plan for it to take place at a traditionally quieter time on the railway. ‘We apologise for the inconvenience caused but the work is essential to improve the network and maintain reliable services for the millions of passengers who travel on the West Coast main line every year.’ Another stretch of the West Coast line will be closed between Stafford and Crewe . Travellers are facing a number of disruptions over Christmas and the new year as Network Rail carry out a major engineering programme . The disruption will affect services out of a number of main London stations, including London Bridge, where there will be a 16-day part closure for work involving the £6.5bn Thameslink programme. From December 20 to January 4, Southern and Thameslink trains will not call at London Bridge and cross-London Thameslink Bedford-Brighton trains will not return until 2018. From December 22 to Christmas Eve some Southeastern Charing Cross services will not call at London Bridge in the morning peak. Paddington will also be affected. Engineering work taking place between Southall and Slough, west of London, means some lines will be closed from 5pm on Christmas Eve until the end of December 28.

On December 27/28 engineering work taking place between Edge Hill and Earlestown/St Helens Central is closing some lines in north-west England, while buses will replace Arriva Trains Wales trains between Shrewsbury and Hereford from December 27 to 29. Other areas where engineering work is scheduled over the holiday period include Birmingham New Street and between Cambridge and Ely in East Anglia. BA has 267 flights scheduled on Christmas Day and 37,000 turkey dinners planned for customers . One train company running trains on Boxing Day, and for the second successive year, is Chiltern Railways which will be operating services between Bicester North and London. The Southeastern and ScotRail companies will also be running some services on Boxing Day this year and Gatwick Express and Stansted Express trains will operate as well. Michael Roberts, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators and Network Rail, said: ‘Building a better, safer railway is something we do every day but major holidays are when significantly fewer people travel, and the industry has been working more closely than ever this year to ensure that disruption to passengers is minimised and people are kept on trains wherever possible. ‘Fewer than three per cent of services will be on replacement buses this Christmas, and a number of operators will be running services on Boxing Day in response to passenger demand. ‘Rail staff will be working around the clock through the Christmas break to lay new track, renew signals, repair bridges and build new platforms, to deliver more and better services for Britain.’ Meanwhile, it appears more people are preparing to jet abroad over the holidays, as British Airways expects record numbers. National Express is doubling the number of coach services on Christmas Day as bookings increase . The airline said it will be transporting 2.7 million passengers from December 12 to January 5, including 129,000 on December 19, its busiest day. BA has 267 flights scheduled on Christmas Day and 37,000 turkey dinners planned for customers. And it should come as no surprise that the most popular destinations are mostly warm ones – Dubai, Barbados, New York, Australia and Barcelona. Ryanair is carrying more than 3.5 million passengers between December 20 and January 6, an increase of half a million compared to last year, and its most popular destinations at the Algarve in Portugal, the Canary Islands, Cologne and Prague. On the roads, National Express is doubling the number of coach services on Christmas Day and operating a near-normal service on Boxing Day.

"Doctors have been accused of failing to diagnose a taxi driver's liver cancer on 32 occasions over a two-and-a half-year period after refusing to send him for vital scans. Jean-Robert Chanas, from Mount Vernon, Glasgow, claims he pleaded with doctors repeatedly to send him for a scan, after complaining of crippling abdominal pains. However, the 67-year-old said they refused each time, and insisted he did not have cancer - instead diagnosing him with musculoskeletal pains which they assured him were harmless. He was eventually diagnosed with liver cancer in November last year and has since been admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he was told last week that 'nothing more can be done' for him. Jean-Robert Chanas (pictured with his wife Irene) claims he visited doctors on 32 separate occasions complaining of stomach pains over a two-and-a-half-year period before being diagnosed with liver cancer . He has now hit out at the doctors who 'overlooked' him and said he is 'distraught and angry that I was not listened to'. He believes more than 30 trips to his GP should have yielded 'something', even if it was just the scan he kept calling for to put 'his mind at rest'. 'People should know what is going on in the NHS,' he said. 'How can cancer be overlooked 32 times? 'I'm telling my story because I feel people should be told what is going on. 'If you want a health service you must complain.' Mr Chanas, who was born in France and has lived in Scotland for more than 40 years, was given chemotherapy in a desperate bid to beat the cancer but has been told nothing more can be done. Since he started suffering abdominal pains two-and-a-half-years ago, he has kept a detailed record of his repeated trips to the doctor, during which time doctors examined his stomach, gave him X-rays and carried out a colonoscopy and blood tests. However, he says they failed to send him for the crucial scan which could have spotted his cancer. He was eventually diagnosed with liver cancer in November last year after consulting a different GP. She immediately referred him for the CT scan he had spent so long waiting for, telling him his plight 'had gone on too long'. His wife Irene, 65, (pictured) now fears her husband, who is currently at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, has been robbed of years of his life because he was not listened to. He has been told doctors can do no more for him . His wife Irene now visits him daily in hospital but fears the delays in his diagnosis have 'robbed him of years of his life'. The 65-year-old said: 'When we asked if it was cancer they said ""No, not that"". But we thought the abdominal pains were a sign of something more serious. 'By the time he got treatment we feared it was already too late. 'It had gone on for so long, doctors did not know where the cancer started. 'We are devastated and fear my husband has been robbed of years of his life because he was not listened to.' The couple have logged all their GP and hospital visits and claim they made 24 trips to different GPs at The Cairns Practice in Shettleston, Glasgow, and eight to A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Mrs Chanas said: 'When hospital tests proved negative Jean-Robert would return to our GP and when the pain was desperate we would go to A&E. 'We want to know if those visits were logged.' The couple, who have been married for 41 years, met when Mr Chanas worked as a restaurant manager in Drymen, Stirlingshire. They have one son together, 40-year-old Laurent. The 67-year-old, who is currently at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (pictured), has now hit out at doctors for not giving him vital scans when he initially asked for them. He claims he was 'overlooked' and 'not listened to' Mr Chanas' family now want him to return to his native France for treatment. However, his wife said: 'Sadly, he does not have the strength to do that. 'I feel if we lived there the cancer would not have been missed. I'm embarrassed and ashamed by how he has been treated by the NHS. It used to be the envy of the world.' The couple insist his treatment, when he was finally diagnosed, was faultless but Mrs Chanas added: 'What does it take to be listened to?'. The couple have now complained to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the help of MSP John Mason. Mr Chanas' GP practice has already apologised via Mr Mason for the shocking delay in diagnosing him. The practice confirmed in a letter that he had seen many GPs and hospital doctors and was examined and investigated through blood tests, a chest X-ray and ultrasound scan of his abdomen. However, the practice also insisted their investigations were organised 'appropriately and timeously'. Last night, Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said there was a worrying lack of experts needed to interpret vital scans. 'Scotland, together with the rest of the UK, has fewer CT and MRI scanners than all other Western European nations,' he said. 'Interpretation of complex scans can only be done by a trained radiologist.' According to Cancer Research UK, liver cancer symptoms include a bloated stomach and yellowing of the skin. The most effective diagnosis comes from CT, ultrasound and MRI scans. The Scottish Government has an average six-week maximum waiting time for diagnostic tests and health boards have been issued with local targets of four weeks. Earlier this year it was revealed that the number of patients in Scotland waiting more than a month for potentially lifesaving tests had soared. Mr Chanas claims he made 24 trips to various GPs at The Cairns Practice in Shettleston, Glasgow (pictured), and eight to  Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He has logged all of the visits and has hit out at his diagnosis delay . Figures revealed the number on the waiting list for vital diagnostic tests that can pick up serious diseases including cancer had risen by 15 per cent in a year (2012/13), from 41,340 to 47,248. The number waiting more than four weeks had risen from 4,785 to 6,252. The figures, revealed in a waiting-times report by ISD Scotland, showed the worst hit specialties were CT and MRI scans, barium studies and ultrasounds. An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: 'We carried out a full investigation into Mr Chanas' care and are satisfied he received the appropriate care from his first attendance at our emergency department in May 2013 until his diagnosis in November 2013. 'We understand this has been an extremely difficult time for Mr Chanas and his family but the tests which identified his diagnosis could not have been done quicker.' The GP practice did not respond to requests for a comment.","Jean-Robert Chanas visited doctor 32 times complaining of stomach pains .

"Schoolbook authors have been told not to write about sausages or pigs for fear of causing offence. Guidance from leading educational publisher the Oxford University Press prohibits authors from including anything that could be perceived as pork-related in their books. The bizarre clampdown, apparently aimed at avoiding offence among Jews and Muslims, emerged yesterday during a discussion about free speech on Radio 4’s Today programme. It was immediately branded ‘nonsensical political correctness’. Scroll down for video . Oxford University Press bans authors from including  pork-related material in their books, so stories about sausages (left), pigs (centre) and bacon (right) are prohibited . Presenter Jim Naughtie – whose writer wife Eleanor Updale is in talks with Oxford University Press (OUP) over an educational book series – said: ‘I've got a letter here that was sent out by OUP to an author doing something for young people. ‘Among the things prohibited in the text that was commissioned by OUP was the following: Pigs plus sausages, or anything else which could be perceived as pork. ‘Now, if a respectable publisher, tied to an academic institution, is saying you've got to write a book in which you cannot mention pigs because some people might be offended, it’s just ludicrous. It is just a joke.' Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said: ‘I absolutely agree. That’s absolute utter nonsense. And when people go too far, that brings the whole discussion into disrepute.’ The OUP says its guidelines exist because it needs to make its educational material available to as many people as possible. Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood called the ban on pork-related content 'absolute utter nonsense' A spokesman said: ‘Many of the educational materials we publish in the UK are sold in more than 150 countries, and as such they need to consider a range of cultural differences and sensitivities. 'Our editorial guidelines are intended to help ensure that the resources that we produce can be disseminated to the widest possible audience.’ But last night the publishing rules were ridiculed amid doubts either Muslims or Jews would be offended by mention of farm animals in a children’s book. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘How on earth can anyone find the word “pig” or “pork” offensive? 'No word is offensive. It is the context in which it is used that is offensive.’ He added: ‘On the one hand you have politicians and the great and the good falling over each other to say how much they believe in freedom of speech and on the other hand they are presiding over people being unable to use and write words that are completely inoffensive. 'We have got to get a grip on this nonsensical political correctness. ‘The political correctness brigade appear to have taken control of our schools. 'The Secretary of State needs to get a grip over this and make sure this ridiculous ban is stopped at once.’ He added that perhaps one good thing to come out of the Paris terror attacks was a groundswell of support for freedom of speech. The chief executive of campaigning group Index on Censorship, Jodie Ginsberg, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine any context in which images of everyday objects – like pigs – or the word itself should be banned from being used in a children’s book.’ A spokesman for the Jewish Leadership Council added: ‘Jewish law prohibits eating pork, not the mention of the word, or the animal from which it derives. Authors following the Oxford guidelines would not be able to mention characters from Peppa Pig (pictured)","Ban is apparently aimed at avoiding offence among Jews and Muslims .

"Jihadist Aqsa Mahmood broke her silence yesterday to warn Western Muslims that it's 'us against them' and to 'pick a side' in the war . Jihadist Aqsa Mahmood broke her silence yesterday to warn Western Muslims that it’s ‘us against them’ and to ‘pick a side’ in the war. On the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Mahmood posted her diatribe in a third instalment of her online ‘Diary of a Muhajirah (immigrant)’ – in which she also said she would only come home to raise the black flag of IS over Britain. She suspended her Twitter account after the Scottish Daily Mail revealed her identity as a Glaswegian private schoolgirl who abandoned her university studies to flee to Syria. Yesterday, using a Tumblr blogging and social networking account under her adopted name ‘Umm Layth’, she shunned her Scottish identity and rejected her family’s pleas to return home. The 20-year-old – who married an IS fighter in February – added: ‘The only time we will ever, ever return to those lands beithnillah (if God wills) is to raise our flag.’ She pledged allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and promised the West would be invaded and ‘blood will be spilled’. She also described Prime Minister David Cameron’s call for new powers to stop British-born extremists from returning to the UK as ‘the biggest joke of this week’. She wrote: ‘This is a war against Islam and it is know (sic) that either “you’re with them or with us”. So pick a side. ‘My dear brothers and sisters who are stuck in the west and restrained due to the kufr (infidel) governments know that indeed the help of Allah swt (may he be glorified and exalted) is always near, have Sabr (patience) and know that you will never be tested beyond your ability. ‘And to those who are able and can still make your way, please ittaqillah (fear Allah) and don’t delay anymore, hasten hasten hasten to our lands and live in Izzah (honour) before it is made difficult for you. Know that these trialing times and do not miss out on any of the ajr (rewards).’ Mahmood’s parents, Glasgow businessman Muzaffar and his wife Khalida, last week branded their daughter a ‘bedroom radical’ who betrayed and shamed her family when she joined IS. They condemned her actions and added she was ‘brainwashed and deluded’, but insisted that they still loved her and begged her to come home. In a heartbreaking press conference, they said: ‘You have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. ‘Aqsa, you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.’ The family added that they have not seen their daughter since November last year and had contacted Police Scotland to report her missing after she disappeared. Threats: Aqsa Mahmood. Left: Parents Khalida and Muzaffar say she has 'betrayed' them . But in her latest posting Mahmood claimed that she has now ‘disassociated’ herself from her family and friends in Scotland. She said: ‘The family you get in exchange for leaving the ones behind are like the pearl in comparison to the Shell you threw away into the foam of the sea.’ Now her allegiance ‘is and will only be to our beloved Ameer, destroyer of the enemies, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and to the Islamic State’. She added: ‘All of us disassociated ourselves from our families, friends and societies. ‘We make it known to the world that never has our allegiance been to the Scottish, British, Swedish, American, Canadian etc…. government.’ In a message to Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama, she suggests that Islamic State will bring the battle to the West and adds they will ‘be known and feared’ across the world. She wrote: ‘Know this Cameron/Obama, you and your countries will be beneath our feet and your Kufr (infidel) will be destroyed, this is a promise from Allah swt that we have no doubt over. ‘If not you then your grandchildren or their grandchildren. But worry not, somewhere along the line your blood will be spilled by our cubs in Dawlah (state). ‘We have conquered these lands once Beithnillah (if God wills) we will do it again.’","Aqsa Mahmood warned it’s ‘us against them’

"A hashtag that states 'I am knife' has begun trending on Twitter as hardline users take to social media to heap praise a Palestinian man who stabbed 11 people on a bus in Tel Aviv. The messages are an attempt to reappropriate the hashtag of solidarity - #JeSuisCharlie - which swept the world in the wake of the terrorist massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices. However, the tweets - often accompanied by illustrations which depict the Palestinian flag and a bloody knife - are being posted in support of the stabber, who was shot by a prison officer after injuring 11 people in a brutal act of violence. Scroll down for video . The attacker stabbed nine people, wounding some of them seriously, on a bus in central Tel Aviv before he was chased down, shot and arrested by a passing prison officer. Israeli police described the assault as a 'terror attack' while the Islamic militant Hamas group praised it. It was the latest in a spate of attacks in which Palestinians have used knives, acid and vehicles as weapons in recent months, leaving many dead and injured. Passengers on the number 40 bus en route to Tel Aviv University said the assailant, identified by police as a Palestinian from Tulkarm in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, stabbed the driver and then others at the Maariv junction, one of the coastal city's busiest. 'The terrorist had murder in his eyes,' a passenger identified only as Orly said on Israel Radio. The attacker exited the bus after it slowed to a stop and ran down a street along with panicked passengers and pedestrians.

However, officers from a prison service who happened to be nearby and saw the bus swerving out of control and a man running away, gave chase, shot the man in the leg, wounding him lightly and subsequently arrested him. 'We believe it was a terror attack,' said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. He said four people were seriously hurt and another five sustained lighter wounds. The stabber was in custody and the police are questioning him now, he said. An injured man sits as he is treated by paramedics at the scene of the stabbing in Tel Aviv, Israel . An Israeli police officer secures the scene after the bus stabbing which left many seriously wounded . The prison officer who detained the attacker, Benny Botarshvili, commands officers from the Israel Prison Service's Nahshon unit. He said he heard people screaming for help from the bus while on his way to the courthouse, The Jerusalem Post reported. He said: 'We saw the attacker and chased after him. We first fired in the air and when he didn't stop, we fired at his feet and the attacker fell to the ground. We restrained him on the ground until area police could arrive at the scene.' The stabbing is the latest in a type of 'lone-wolf' attacks that have plagued Israel in recent months. About a dozen people have been killed in Palestinian attacks, including five people killed with guns and meat cleavers in a bloody assault on a Jerusalem synagogue. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Gaza Strip did not claim responsibility but praised Wednesday's attack as 'brave and heroic' in a tweet by Izzat Risheq, a Hamas leader residing in Qatar. The stabbing is a 'natural response to the occupation and its terrorist crimes against our people,' Risheq said. A Jewish cap and headphones lie in blood stains on the floor at the bus stop following the stabbing . Israeli paramedics treat an injured woman. Hamas leaders later praised the attack . An injured Israeli man is treated by police and paramedics after he was stabbed in the 'terror attack' Israeli officials say the attacks stem from incitement by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and other Palestinian leaders. Most of the violence has occurred in Jerusalem, though there have been other attacks in Tel Aviv and the West Bank. In Jerusalem, the violence came after months of tensions between Jews and Palestinians in east Jerusalem — the section of the city the Palestinians demand as their future capital. The area experienced unrest and near-daily attacks by Palestinians following a wave of violence last summer, capped by a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. Much of the recent unrest has stemmed from tensions surrounding a key holy site in Jerusalem's Old City.  It is the holiest site for Jews, who call it the Temple Mount because of the revered Jewish Temples that stood there in biblical times. Muslims refer to it as the Noble Sanctuary, and it is their third holiest site, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Israeli policemen clean blood from the streets where the attack occurred .

"ISIS militants have executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns,  anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently reports. Horrifying: ISIS militants rounded up the 13 teenage boys, whose only crime was watching football on television, and executed then by firing squad in Mosul, and Iraqi city under ISIS control (stock image) 'The bodies remained lying in the open and their parents were unable to withdraw them for fear of murder by terrorist organisation,' the group writes on their website. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently is a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression ISIS has brought to their home city. They said the 13 teenagers were rounded up by ISIS militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul, and executed in public. The boys' 'crime' - breaking religious laws by watching football - was read out on a loudspeaker before their executions. Crime: The teenagers had been watching this game between Jordan and Iraq in the Asian Cup, which took place  in Brisbane, Australia on January 12 . The news of the horrifying execution of the teenagers comes just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Mosul. Charges found against the accused were announced by a masked Islamic State fighter, using a small handheld radio. Reading from a list, he declares the men are guilty of engaging in homosexual activities and should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The Iraq-Jordan Asian Cup game, which took place in Brisbane, Australia last Monday, saw midfielder Yaser Kasim, who plays for Swindon Town in the third tier of English football, give Iraq a 1-0 win.","ISIS soldiers executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup .

"Shocking pictures have emerged on social media showing what could be the Islamic State’s youngest suicide bomber. The boy has been named as Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, a Syrian fighter who appears to be no older than 14 years old. In a photo series, entitled 'Battle of Vengeance for the Mother of the Believers (Aisha)', the youngster is thought to be one of two Syrian fighters, who carried out a suicide truck bombings in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin. Scroll down for video . Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, who appears no older than 14, who is thought to be the Islamic State's youngest suicide bomber . In a series of pictures, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade before the huge explosion of the lorry . He is shown sitting in the driver’s seat of the large lorry filled with barrels of explosives. The vehicle has been reinforced with plated armour, leaving the young driver with only a small rectangular window to navigate the final journey for his deadly vehicle. In his hands, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade and the barrel of his AK-47 rifle can be seen resting near the steering wheel between his legs. Whilst his age has yet to be independently verified, it is possible that  al-Shami could be the Islamic State’s youngest suicide bomber in Iraq. It is unclear whether video footage will be subsequently released with a final testimony of the young fighter. A final image shows a huge explosion after the detonation of the lorry, killing him and a number of Iraqi security forces. The attack happened near the ancient Iraqi city of Samarra, currently still held by the Iraqi army. It also shows a big ball of fire erupting into the orange sky, with pieces of shrapnel flying in all directions across the arid landscape. One ISIS supporter on social media commented: ‘Abu al-Hassan al-Shami the martyr. His youth doesn’t stop him from supporting his religion.’ ISIS also released another video showing what is thought to be a British fighter, known by the nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani, pictured . The news of the Syrian boy’s suicide bomb attack in Samarra comes just hours after ISIS released a new video showing the detonation of a lorry bomb in the same area. Entitled ‘The Chink of Swords’, the video shows what is thought to be a British fighter, known by the nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani, climbing into a heavy armoured vehicle. Taking care to hide his face from the camera, the man, wearing a pair of white trainers, is shown athletically climbing up the side of the armoured plating and jumping into the vehicle via a small entrance in the roof. Upon starting the engine, al-Britani begins to drive off down the asphalt covered road. A lone ISIS fighter, not wearing a full uniform, comes out and begins to wave the Islamic State flag as al-Britani makes his final journey. The footage shows al-Britani climbing up the side of the armoured plating vehicle before he jumps into it via a small entrance in the roof . After the engine starts, a lone ISIS fighter, not wearing uniform, comes out and begins to wave the Islamic State flag . Finally, the footage shows a huge explosion, with a large plume of grey smoke rising from the impact of the blast. It is thought that it could be the same Abu Abdullah al-Britani, whose photo was released in early December stating he had carried out a deadly lorry bomb attack in Samarra. According to Islamic State linked media account at the time, Al-Battar Media Foundation, al-Britani killed ‘dozens of apostates’, thought to be Iraqi police officers manning a roadside checkpoint near Samarra’s al-Mu’tasim district. The footage then shows a huge explosion, with a large plume of grey smoke rising from the impact of the blast . Back in early December, a photo was released showing a fighter, named as Abu Abdullah al-Britani, posing next to an armoured truck bomb distinctively similar to the one in the video. It is likely that the new video footage of Abu Abdullah al-Britani blowing himself up in a lorry bomb is the same man who died in early December. Officials and analysts have been unable to independently confirm the identity of the man in the video or the photo.","New pictures emerge on social media showing young suicide bomber .

"By 2020, our day-to-day lives, relationships and even what to have for dinner could be controlled and run by digital versions of ourselves. According to futurist John Smart, within the next six years many of us could have so-called ‘digital twins’ that schedule our appointments and even have conversations with others on our behalf. And they could one day console loved ones after we die by mimicking our voice, emotions, mannerisms and thoughts. Scroll down for video . According to futurist John Smart, within the next five years many of us could have so-called ‘digital twins’ (illustrated) that schedule appointments, make decisions and have conversations with others on our behalf. They could even console loved ones after we die by mimicking our voice, emotions, mannerisms and thoughts . Mr Smart, founder of the Acceleration Studies Foundation, made the comments during an interview with Business Insider. ‘[Digital twins] will become increasingly like us and extensions of us,’ Smart said. Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, believes that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. Mr Kurzweil also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. The claims made by John Smart regarding 'digital twins' are a step towards this futurist theory of singularity becoming a reality. Technological singularity is the development of 'superintelligence' brought about through the use of technology. The first use of 'singularity' in terms of technological minds was by mathematician John von Neumann in the mid-1950s. He said: 'ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.' The term was then used by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge who believes brain-computer interfaces are causes of the singularity. Ray Kurzweil cited von Neumann's use of the term in a foreword to von Neumann's classic The Computer and the Brain. Kurzweil predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 while Vinge predicts it will happen before 2030. ‘When you and I die, our kids aren’t going to go to our tombstones, they’re going to fire up our digital twins and talk to them.’ He continued there are prediction apps and software that already carry out similar tasks – such as Siri and Google Now – and these services are only going to get smarter as algorithms, interfaces and processing power increases. The software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction. In the case of personal-assistant apps, the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data, taken from the phone or tablet’s GPS unit, as well as posts on social networks, email information and more. It then presents the user with the help it thinks they need. For example, if a calendar on an Android phone contains a diary invite, Google Now will create a reminder. It will then check to see whether the user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder, or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic. Elsewhere, as users pass bus stops, prediction apps can show bus timetables, show the latest deals as they enter a supermarket, or open a digital boarding pass as they approach an airport. Mr Smart believes that digital twins could additionally learn our likes and dislikes from emails, messages and verbal feedback, in the way that machine learning currently does. IBM’s Watson supercomputer uses machine learning, as does ‘Eugene Goostman’ - a computer program that was able to trick users it was a teenage boy, leading to claims it had passed the Turing test. Watson won the TV game show Jeopardy, in 2011, by answering general knowledge questions posed in natural language. More recently it has been used as a customer call centre agent and can learn a customer's needs. Mr Smart continued there are prediction apps and personal assistant software that already carry out similar tasks – such as Siri and Google Now (pictured) – and these services are only going to get smarter as algorithms, interfaces and processing power increases . The Turing Test was introduced by Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in 1950 as part of his paper Computing Machinery And Intelligence in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence. Apple's Siri (pictured) already uses context to answer questions, and digital twins could take this a step further to learn about how a person thinks . He proposed a test called The Imitation Game, which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought. A person, called the interrogator, engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is which. If they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed -  as was the case with Eugene. And as firms such as Google buy artificial intelligence firms, such as Deep Mind, it makes the technology more mainstream. Google’s acquisition of DeepMind in June wasn’t the tech giant’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning. Its Hummingbird search update was created to make Google 'more human', and searches can now understand context, like a human brain. Google also hired futurist Ray Kurzweil as Engineering Director in 2012. Kurzweil has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. He also believes the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. The claims made by John Smart are a step towards this futurist theory of singularity becoming a reality. Andrew Sheehy from Generator Research told MailOnline: 'We can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in existing Google products like Google Now, the search function that forms part of Google+ Photos and Google’s self-driving car project. 'A string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence, along with the recent hiring of Ray Kurzweil as a director of engineering shows that Google is by no means done with machine learning: it is clear that the company is just getting started. Mr Smart believes digital twins could learn our likes and dislikes from emails, messages and verbal feedback, in the way that machine learning currently does, such as ‘Eugene Goostman’ - a computer program that was able to trick users it was a teenage boy, leading to claims it had passed the Turing test (pictured) Futurists believes that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. This chart plots the exponential growth of computing. Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, claims singularity will become reality as soon as 2045 . Mr Smart (picutred) is a futurist and founder of the Acceleration Studies Foundation . ‘Taking into account the present scale of Google’s computer network, the size of its user base and its capital reserves, Google is well placed to take on something as ambitious as machine consciousness.’ Machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence. There are already intelligent machines that can learn from their mistakes and fix errors, but many of these are programmed to do so. For example, world chess Grandmaster, Gary Kasparov, was defeated by IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’ supercomputer in 1997. ‘To make wise decisions in the present, we must strive to deeply understand where we are in relation to both the known past and our probable futures,’ explained Mr Smart. ‘This will require the support of global communities, which make the disciplined development of the field of foresight their top priority. ‘In particular, one of my long-term professional goals is to find passionate financial sponsors interested in the development of more world-leading academic programs in technology foresight, acceleration studies, and evolutionary development studies.’","The claims were made by futurist and system theorist John Smart .

"The Canadian woman who was reportedly kidnapped by ISIS has said she is fine, and that rumors of her capture spread on jihadist websites are untrue. Gill Rosenberg, 31, joined the ranks of the Kurdish peshmerga fighting force this year, which has elite all-female units. ISIS sources reported Sunday that Rosenberg was captured in the contested town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, and were gleefully debating whether to execute her or try to negotiate a prisoner swap. But now Rosenberg, who leaves sporadic updates about her campaign against extremism on Facebook, has posted to clarify that she is in fact alive and well. Scroll down for video . Military history: Rosenberg, pictured in uniform, was formerly a member of the Israeli Defense Force . On the attack: Rosenberg uploaded pictures of herself, left, dressed for war in Syria in recent weeks . 'Captured': Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian with dual Israeli citizenship, was reportedly captured - but took to social media to dispell the rumor . Before: Rosenberg, who went to Syria earlier this year, is pictured above before she left . She wrote: 'Guys, I'm totally safe and secure. I don't have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security. 'I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bu*****t news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured.' Sources in the Kurdish militia also confirmed that she is unharmed and was not captured. Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane, said he had been told by peshmerga members she is fine, and dismissed the reports of propaganda.. Even when the initial reports came out, some sources were sceptical and said Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobane in the first place. Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border. She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault. Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role. After the reports over the weekend of her capture, Canadian and Israeli government sources said they were investigating the possibility. IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq. At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.

The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who wed in their thirties earn an average of 56per cent more than those who get married a decade earlier. Conversely, men who settle down in their twenties have higher incomes than those who wait until after 30, no matter their education. The National Marriage Project's study, entitled Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America, examines the consequences of marrying later, a growing trend in the U.S. It notes that the average age of marriage is at an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men, compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26 for men. But while women have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages, men who wed earlier in life tend to be more successful later on. The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results. Around two-thirds of lifetime income growth takes . place during the first ten years of a career, according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay. Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier, forcing them to take a break from their careers, they can take longer to climb the corporate ladder. But getting hitched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men, perhaps because married men 'are more sure of themselves compared to single men,' leading to more productivity, suggests Business Insider. Not all women who wait until their thirties to get married reap the benefits, however. The study also found that while college-educated women profit from delayed marriage, those without a degree do not. One reason for this discrepancy is that among less-educated women, the average age of first birth has not risen in correlation with the age of marriage. Women's income: The graph shows that college-educated women who marry in their thirties earn significantly more than those who wed in their early twenties . Gender discrepancy: Conversely, men who marry between the ages of 24 and 29 have higher incomes than those who wait until their thirties . In fact, among women who drop out of high school, 83per cent of first births are to unmarried mothers,  according to The Atlantic. A woman without a college education therefore has less time to advance her career during its vital first decade. Delayed marriage is also a factor in the . decreased divorce rate the country has seen since 1980, since couples who wed . in their early twenties are statistically more likely to separate than those who marry . later. The graphs from the study also show that men who never marry earn significantly less than those who do, while the opposite is true for women.","The average age of marriage in the U.S. is at an all-time high, at 27 for women and 29 for men ."
"A gay married couple from Florida have sued the motor vehicle agency for not allowing them to change the last names on their driver's licenses - the latest challenge to the state's ban on same-sex unions. Daniel DeSousa, 40, and Scott Wall, 37, married in New York on December 6 2013 and legally changed their last name to Wall-DeSousa through the federal Social Security Administration.

"The birth of a baby boy from a womb transplant could bring an end to the woes of women unable to have children naturally, doctors have said. The world's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of the child in Gothenberg, Sweden, last month after years of tireless research. His birth was only revealed by doctors yesterday as both he and his 36-year-old mother are in good health. And with British experts planning to carry out the procedure as early as next summer, a leading gynecologist has said the revolutionary surgery could become as popular as surrogacy among infertile women. The mother and the baby boy pictured just after his birth. He was born weighing 4lbs after his mother received a womb transplant . Mr Richard Smith, of the UK Womb Transplantation Team, celebrated the birth of a little boy in Gothenberg last night, congratulating the doctors who performed the pioneering operation nine months ago. And the gynaecologist, who works at the West London Gynaecological Cancer Centre, Queen Charlotte's & Chelsea Hospital, said the surgery could become a possibility for British women as soon as next summer. 'We're almost ready to go, we are applying for ethics committee approval in the next few weeks at a national level,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Smith said the medical breakthrough in Sweden could bring about a new era of childbearing for women with fertility problems. 'The great big unknown always was could a transplanted uterus carry a baby and have a successful live birth and that's why what's happened here is so exciting. 'The great unknown is now answered which is that it is possible - it's the proof of purpose.' The doctor added the procedure could become as popular as surrogacy, which 'carries as many risks if not more'. 'It would reduce the demand for surrogacy however there are still plenty of women who will prefer to go down that route and avoid major surgery. 'But there are many, many women who would prefer to carry a baby themselves. There's also a bit of a legal minefield around surrogacy, and to avoid all of that and to have their own baby is incredible important (for some women).' Unlike the Swedes' project, his team would harvest the wombs of cadaveric donors - patients whose hearts are still beating but they are brain dead. Doctors in Gothenberg used the wombs of six women for the transplants. 'Some of our research shows you can retrieve the uterus at the back end of the queue after all the vital organs, so that would be the source of those organs for women in the UK. 'We hope, subject to funding, to get going next year - next summer.' Speaking of the 'breathtaking' birth of the baby in Sweden, one  doctor said that it was so emotional, it was like having her own child. The boy, who is in perfect health, was born to a 36-year-old  woman who had been born without a womb. She carried her baby in the womb of a 61-year-old woman. Last night, the Lancet medical journal released details about the remarkable birth. The little boy, whose arrival has remained secret until now, was born by Caesarean section a month ago. Project leader Professor Mats Brannstrom, of Gothenburg University, said: ‘The baby screamed right away and has not required any other care than normal clinical observation at the neonatal unit. ‘The mother and child are both doing well and have returned home. The new parents are of course very happy and thankful.’ Liza Johannesson, a surgeon at Gothenburg University, who was present at the boy’s birth, said: ‘It was breathtaking. It was like having your own child. Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant on a woman earlier this year. Another six women given new wombs are also said to be pregnant . The team behind the womb transplants who are, from left - surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson . 'It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ Professor Brannstrom said: ‘There was fantastic happiness among me and the whole team. 'But at the same time, the sensation was also a little unreal because we really couldn’t believe we had reached this moment.’ The baby is breastfeeding and growing well. His mother may decide to keep the new womb until she has a second child. Unlike other transplant organs, donor wombs are unlikely to remain in their recipients indefinitely. The baby was born two months early after his mother developed pre-eclampsia – a life-threatening condition. He weighed just under 4lb and although this may seem small, it is normal for a baby so premature. It isn’t known why the woman’s pregnancy became complicated. It may have been due to the strong drugs she was given to stop her rejecting the new womb. Or due to her underlying health problems; she only has one kidney. Another six women who took part in the groundbreaking project at Gothenburg University are pregnant – and their doctor says their chances of giving birth are good. The boy’s mother, who has not been named, was one of nine women to be given a new uterus. In five cases, the donor was the woman's mother – meaning the same womb could carry two generations of the same family. In this instance, the new womb came from an unrelated woman, a mother of two, who was long past the menopause. Professor Brannstrom, who has spent more than a decade perfecting the complex gynaecological techniques needed, said: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility.’ A woman’s own eggs are used in the procedure meaning the baby will be genetically her own. Critics of the procedure include fertility expert Lord Winston, who says the risks are too great and some women should accept they can’t bear children. The world’s first womb transplant was in Saudi Arabia in 2000 but the woman’s body rejected the organ after four months.

"Theme park thrill-seekers were left shocked when the rollercoaster they were riding hit and decapitated a deer that had strayed too close to the tracks. Passengers on the Ultimate at Lightwater Valley - the longest rollercoaster in Europe - slammed into the animal  in a collision that reportedly decapitated the deer and left passengers covered in blood. The deer was hit by the train at the amusement park near Ripon, North Yorkshire, as the train rocketed along the track reaching speeds of up to 50mph. Scroll down for video . The Lightwater Valley theme park  is home to the Ultimate (pictured), which is Europe's longest rollercoaster . The Ultimate rollercoaster at Lightwater Valley also hit a deer in 1994 - ripping off the animal's legs and trapping its antlers in the safety bars . A father-of-two from Howden, Darlington, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I knew there was something wrong. 'There was a bit of screaming but not too much. The maintenance men came and seemed to turn it off and on again and then it was fine.' The incident happened at around 11.15am on Saturday  and visitors to the park arriving were told by staff that there had been a problem involving a deer and it was being cleared away. A spokeswoman for the theme park, one of the region's biggest attractions, said: 'We can confirm a young deer did unfortunately get hit by the Ultimate train yesterday and was killed instantly. 'There is a large perimeter fence surrounding the theme park but occasionally wild animals do manage to stray onto the park during the night. 'After the incident the Ultimate was closed for 30 minutes while the ride was thoroughly checked and then normal operation resumed.' It is not the first time a deer has been killed after getting to close to the Ultimate rollercoaster. The deer was decapitated on Saturday when hit by the rollercoaster at a speed of 50mph . In 1994 the rollercoaster hit a deer, ripping its legs off and trapping its antlers in the safety bars. Passengers were covered in the animal's blood and a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital as a precaution. Also in 2004 a train full of passengers on the Ultimate came to a halt when an axle fault led to two wheels falling off. The fail-safe system meant the following train also came to a standstill leaving its 38 screaming passengers stranded 100ft above the ground. All were safely evacuated and no one was seriously hurt but the ride had to be closed down until the cause of the fault was traced and rectified. The ride opened in 1991 and is one of the most popular rollercoasters in the world. The 1.5mile track features drops of up to 100ft.","Passengers on the Ultimate train in Lightwater Valley hit the animal at 50mph .

"Bryn Parry-Jones was given a £90,000 Porsche as part of his contract with Pembrokeshire County Council . A shamed council boss at the centre of a row over misuse of public money drove a taxpayer-funded Porsche that his employers kept secret for eight months. Bryn Parry-Jones, 62, was provided with the £90,000 sports car to drive to and from work despite massive cuts to public services in his area. But the council refused to reveal the perk, despite repeated information requests by journalists, for eight months – citing ‘privacy’ reasons. Last night the former chief executive was facing a growing row over his use of public money after details of his lavish lifestyle were exposed. Mr Parry-Jones, whose £195,000-a-year salary made him the highest-earning official in Wales, has been repeatedly accused of abusing taxpayers’ money while heading cash-strapped Pembrokeshire County Council. Earlier this year he was handed a £280,000 ‘golden goodbye’ despite the fact he had been forced to quit over an unlawful payments scandal. Details of his car, a perk which cost around £900 a month to lease, only emerged this week after a long Freedom of Information battle with the council. Insiders said the extravagant expense had ‘stuck in the craw’ of cash-strapped council workers who knew about it for months. Yesterday, campaigners and politicians hit out at the ‘offensive waste of money’ at a time when the council was making cuts to local services. Earlier this year, Pembrokeshire Council revealed it would have to make savings of £20million over two years. Proposed measures include closing public toilets, charging for social services and increasing parking fees. Council tax rose by 3.4 per cent this year. Stephen Crabb, Welsh secretary and Pembrokeshire MP, said: ‘These kinds of lavish car deals for council officials, alongside salary and other perks, stick in the throats of people – especially at a time when there is huge pressure on spending.’ The average salary in the county last year was £21,587. Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, added: ‘At a time when the council is trying to find savings, it’s particularly galling that local residents have been taken for such an extortionate ride.’ Mr Parry-Jones, who led the council for 18 years, was given an allowance to run a company car as part of his generous remuneration package. It is understood he took out a lease on the hybrid electric Porsche Panamera in March this year. Journalists first began requesting details of the car under the Freedom of Information Act in April, but the council said it must be kept secret because it was ‘private’. The expensive sports car was part of the 62-year-old's 'remuneration', according to county officials . It was leased by the council and has been returned since Mr Parry-Jones left his position earlier this year . It was only this week, after he left with his enormous pay out, that the council, run by the Independent Plus Group, revealed details. Conservative councillor David Bryan said the Porsche was known about within the council and had ‘stuck in the craw’ of council workers facing ‘drastic pay cuts’. Paul Miller, who leads the opposition Labour group on the council, added: ‘He was a dictator and it got to the point where he thought he could do whatever he wanted.’ A council spokesman said: ‘Mr Bryn Parry-Jones was entitled to a lease car as part of his remuneration package.’ Mr Parry-Jones quit his post as chief executive in October, ten months after it was revealed he received more than £45,000 in cash payments in lieu of pension contributions. The Wales Audit Office said the payments were ‘unlawful’, although a police investigation concluded that no further action should be taken. Mr Parry-Jones finally stepped down after a vote of no confidence from the council – though councillors voted through a sizeable severance package. Mr Miller applied in vain for a High Court injunction against the pay-off. The council also said it would not be trying to reclaim the £45,606 cash payment. Mr Parry-Jones, who lives in Letterston, Pembrokeshire could not be contacted for comment last night. '","Bryn Parry-Jones oversaw thousands of cuts at Pembrokeshire Council .

"Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham said he was looking at mandatory maximum levels of  fat, salt and sugar in foods . Labour was accused last night of trying to 'ban mince pies at Christmas' over plans to put draconian legal limits on sugar, fat and salt in food. The party's health spokesman Andy Burnham said he was looking at mandatory maximum levels of the amount of fat, salt and sugar in foods specifically designed for youngsters. He also said GPs should be sending obese patients for exercise classes to help them lose weight. But last night one Tory MP accused Mr Burnham of behaving like 'the Grinch who wants to ban mince pies at Christmas.' Conservative MP David Morris said: 'Conservatives are taking common sense steps to help people lose weight, but Labour just want to ban things. 'Andy Burnham is turning into the Grinch who wants to stop mince pies at Christmas. It's the same old we know best approach from Labour.' The plan was welcomed by anti-obesity campaigners but was also branded 'ridiculous' and 'interfering'. Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham told Sky News preventing health problems occurring in the first place was needed to help make the NHS sustainable. Currently there are some referral schemes allowing patients to be sent to subsidised gym sessions. But Mr Burnham said physical exercise should be available more widely. 'Personally I would like to look more at exercise and physical activity - making referrals for physical activity from all GP surgeries,' he said. 'If people become more physically active, then they get more control over what they're eating and what they're drinking and all the other things.' 'The time has come to look at the food industry. I've said many times, I cannot defend the amount of sugar that children are eating. 'We've seen more and more sugar built into our food over time. I'm looking there at a mandatory maximum limit on fat salt and sugar in children's food. The status quo simply isn't working. We need to consider more radical action.' The proposal was welcomed by Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum, who said: ' Mr Burnham is absolutely right. It's probably the most important thing for the next government. He said 'runinous' levels of sugar, especially in fizzy drinks, were doing huge damage to children's teeth, as well as causing obesity.' Doctors said Britain is 'the fat man of Europe' and problems have set in among some children by the age of nine . But Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'It's completely ridiculous. It is absolutely nanny state and basically the Labour Party want to use anything as an excuse to interfere in everybody's lives, and ban them from doing anything they don't personally approve of. 'It's a pretty good taste of what we could expect to see if we had the misfortune of a Labour government.' The proposal would be an effort to combat obesity levels among children. A report last month found childhood obesity in the UK is at 'alarming' levels with up to one in three being dangerously fat. Doctors said Britain is 'the fat man of Europe' and problems have set in among some children by the age of nine. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which represents doctors specialising in children and young people, said 26 per cent of boys and 29 per cent of girls are overweight and obese 'storing up serious health problems for the future'. Mr Fry speculated that the food industry could be given several years to reduce the sugar and fat content in food voluntarily. If they did not comply then the law could be changed, he said. In March UN health chiefs warned that children should not be give fizzy drinks because they contain dangerous amounts of sugar.","Labour's health spokesman wants to put legal limits on sugar, fat and salt .

"Bill Clinton flew more than ten times on the private jet of an American billionaire former friend of Prince Andrew who went on to be accused of having sex with underage girls . Bill Clinton flew more than ten times on the private jet of an American billionaire former friend of Prince Andrew who went on to be accused of having sex with underage girls. Newly disclosed flight logs show that between 2002 and 2005 the former US President travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein while his wife, Hillary, was a senator in New York. Among the stops were Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James, where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves. Clinton, who flew on the jet more than ten times, was deemed to be so close to Epstein he was nearly forced to give a statement during the investigation into the latter’s paedophilia, US legal documents also reveal. Epstein was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution. More than 40 women have come forward claiming he abused them, with most settling out of court. The 61-year-old’s fall from being one of the most well-connected men in America caused acute embarrassment to Prince Andrew, who was at one point photographed with Virginia Roberts, one of  the girls Epstein is said to have used as a sex slave. The Duke of York also stayed at Epstein’s home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet. In a further embarrassing twist, it also emerged Epstein had bailed out his ex-wife the Duchess of York with £15,000 when she got into debt. The flight logs reveal Mr Clinton’s friendship with Epstein may have been closer than previously thought. Before the billionaire’s dark secret was revealed Epstein also counted Woody Allen and several New York society figures among his friends. The latest details are hugely embarrassing at a time when Mrs Clinton is considering a run for the Presidency in 2016. The papers and flight logs were filed as part of a complicated and acrimonious dispute between Epstein and Florida lawyer Brad Edwards and disgraced attorney Scott Rothstein, who is serving 50 years in jail for an £800million Ponzi scheme. Clinton’s name appears dozens of times, although there is never any suggestion that he was involved in any wrongdoing. Newly disclosed flight logs show between 2002 and 2005 the former President travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein (pictured with Prince Andrew) while his wife, Hillary, was a senator in New York . One section includes what purports to . be a transcript of a telephone interview which refers to him. An . unidentified woman asks: ‘When you were present with Jeffrey Epstein and . Bill Clinton on (Epstein’s) island, who else was there?’ Another woman . says: ‘And there was two young girls... at about four or five different . villas’, along with a ‘main house’. The same woman is asked if ‘sexual orgies’ were a ‘regular occurrence on the island’ and she replies that they were. Another phone transcript also includes references to ‘favours’ Mr Clinton owed Epstein. The lawsuit states Mr Clinton’s trips on Epstein’s plane ‘suddenly stopped’ thus ‘raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to Epstein’s abuse of children’. Before that, they were so close Epstein had email addresses for Mr Clinton and 21 numbers for him. Mr Edwards now represents some of Epstein’s alleged victims and in the lawsuit states that he felt he had a ‘legitimate basis’ for taking Clinton’s legal statement, which ultimately did not go ahead. This photograph shows Little St James, where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves . The lawsuit states: ‘With regard to former President Bill Clinton, Edwards had sound legal basis for believing that (he) had relevant and discoverable information.’ Mr Clinton is already in hot water with his wife after being photographed grinning with two prostitutes whilst at a humanitarian gala earlier this month. The National Enquirer said her opponents will ‘have a field day’ with the latest disclosures. Miss Roberts, who claimed she was recruited at 17, has previously spoken about Mr Clinton’s visit to Little St James. She claimed he ‘must have known about Jeffrey’s girls’ but she was never ‘lent out’ to him. Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party, also flew with Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.","Newly disclosed flight logs show that between 2002 and 2005 the former President travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein .

Now, Kirkby-born Lambert will discuss the situation with manager Brendan Rodgers and decide between them if the extra significance of the jersey will work for both sides. However, it is unlikely Lambert would want to turn down such a historic opportunity having made an emotional return to Merseyside this summer after coming through the ranks at Blackpool, Macclesfield, Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton, and going on to play for England in the World Cup. Barca bound: Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona has freed the No.7 shirt at Anfield . Following the sale of Suarez, Rodgers is looking to  strengthen his squad in a number of areas ahead of the club’s Champions League campaign for five years. Swansea City’s Wilfried Bony is just one of a number of options being looked at in attack with Belgian World Cup striker Divock Origi still to decide whether he wants to sign for Liverpool from  Lille, though he would be loaned back to the French club right away. Southampton and Croatia defender Dejan Lovren remains a target too, though his club are so far refusing to sell. Rodgers also wants a left-back with Ben Davies from Swansea among his options. Meanwhile, Suarez may not even set foot in England again following his move to Spain. Banned from any training ground for four months following his bite on Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup, there are no plans yet for the player to say farewell in person to his former team-mates. Suarez lived in a plush rented home next to Strawberry Fields - made famous by The Beatles - in south Liverpool but could arrange for the removal of all his belongings without going back in person. Ironically, Barcelona are preparing for their pre-season at England’s HQ in St George’s Park but Suarez can not play until October and is prohibited from taking part in any football activity until then.","Suarez's £75m move to Spanish giants has freed the No 7 jersey at Anfield .

"This is the moment police arrested a woman after she allegedly went on a knife-wielding rampage, threatening neighbours and smashing up luxury cars outside her home. The 43-year-old woman was Tasered and subsequently arrested after allegedly going 'berserk' outside her £220,000 home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. She allegedly threatened neighbours with a kitchen knife before causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to a number of expensive cars, including a Porsche, Jaguar and BMW. The 43-year-old woman was Tasered and subsequently arrested after allegedly going 'berserk' outside her £220,000 home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. She has since been bailed and sectioned . The woman allegedly threatened neighbours with a knife before causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to a number of expensive cars, including a Porsche, Jaguar and BMW. Pictured: Police arresting her . Police were called to the Four Oaks area, which is home to several millionaires and Premiership footballers, following frantic reports from residents at about 10am on Saturday. It is believed the woman's husband,  a doctor, was away with the couple's children at a dance class at the time. One witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'It was a surreal situation. There were rocks and dirt from the plant pots on top of the cars and she was pacing around. 'I know that the bodywork of the Porsche and BMW cars were damaged particularly badly, and the back windows had also been smashed. 'The Jaguar XFs body also looked to have been badly damaged. 'One person ran in the house and there was damage to the front door. 'Obviously the kids were off school as it was a weekend and it's lucky nobody was injured. I don't know the people or even her name, but they have always seemed very pleasant and quiet.' Jeremy Franklin, 34, who lives nearby, added: 'When police arrived she just wouldn't cooperate. 'After a little bit of shouting and nothing happening one of the officers I think was authorised to get the woman under control. The incident occurred in the Four Oaks area of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, (pictured) which is popular with millionaires and Premier League footballers. Neighbours were said to be shocked by the alleged incident . 'They fired a Taser, I don't know where it hit her but she went down like a sack of spuds.' Another resident added: 'The woman just went berserk and came out wielding a knife. It was pretty scary stuff to be honest. 'She was trying to get into the home of a Chinese lady and stabbed at the door. 'My friend had his BMW damaged, he was gutted as he spent about £50,000 on it and it was his pride and joy. 'People are worried this might have an impact on the house prices around here. 'It might not be such a desirable place to live now after this but it's just a one-off thing.' West Midlands Police confirmed the woman had been arrested in connection with the incident and sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983. A spokesman said: 'Police were called to Crofters Lane just after 10.15am on Saturday to several reports of a woman in possession of a knife and damaging cars. 'A 43-year-old woman who was still believed to be armed with a knife, was Tasered after refusing to comply with officers' requests. 'She was arrested on suspicion of affray and has been bailed and sectioned under the mental health act. 'Several cars were damaged by no-one was hurt in the incident.'

"Arrest: Former Montgomery County DA Bruce Castor said he wanted to arrest Cosby - but there was not enough evidence . The former District Attorney who decided not to charge Bill Cosby with rape today revealed to MailOnline that he wanted to arrest the star - but had insufficient proof. Bruce Castor was the DA of Montgomery County at the time that Andrea Constand claimed Cosby, now 77, drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania home in January 2004. Miss Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team and college basketball star, launched a legal suit against Cosby, a man she called her 'mentor', in March 2005. She was the first - and only woman - to press charges against the comic legend. And today, Mr Castor, who is now Montgomery County commissioner, told MailOnline exclusively: 'I wanted to arrest Bill Cosby because I thought he was probably guilty, but being able to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking he's probably guilty are two different things. 'We knew back then that other woman had come forward, but even if they did it didn't mean anything for our case as none of those cases resulted in charges and were remote in time.' Commissioner Castor, a former two-term DA of Montgomery County and a private lawyer at the Bryn Mawr law office of Rogers and Associates., added: 'The lady who was allegedly attacked waited a year before she reported it. As a result of that delay, any possible corroborating physical evidence was unavailable to us. 'We couldn't test for hairs, fibers, DNA and drugs in her system that might match those at Mr Cosby's house. We didn't have any corroborative evidence. Scroll down for video . Happy, now: Andrea Constand pictured beaming while on a hike. She claimed in court papers she was attacked by Cosby at his Philadelphia home in 2004 - having previously considered him a friend and mentor . Post-traumatic stress disorder: Andrea Constand, former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team, sued Bill Cosby for rape in 2005. They settled out of court in 2006 . 'Impish': NPR host Scott Simon said that when he asked Cosby about allegations of sexual assault, the star - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille - shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile' 'There was almost no evidence on which to base a criminal case. The lady could not remember what happened with any detail, and she didn't report it for a year, all this made the case very difficult. 'I thought the failure to report the alleged incident would create a high hurdle to jump over. It was not like she could say what happened.' In her civil suit, Miss Constand, now 41, said she first met Cosby, a Temple University alum, in November 2002 and the pair became friends. She considered him a 'mentor' and was a frequent guest at dinner parties at his home. However, in court papers, she claims that after arriving at Cosby's house on an evening in January 2004,  the comic legend gave her three blue pills when she said she was stressed over work, which he described as 'herbal medication' to help her relax. Then, the suit states, her 'knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious.' Alum: Bill Cosby poses with Cheerleaders at the Philadelphia Premiere of Fat Albert at the Liacouras Center of his alma mater, Temple University, in December 2004 - a month after his alleged assault on Andrea Constand at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Sports fan: Bill Cosby takes up the trumpet as he joins the Mississippi State band before the start of the first game of the NCAA Final Four in March 1996, in East Rutherford, N.J. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. 'When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,' the suit said. Miss Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police in January 2005. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but in February 2005, they declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Commissioner Castor said: 'All she could say is that she was there (at Cosby's house) and then something might have happened due to how she was when she next remembered something. 'I also knew she had a civil court remedy with a much lower standard of proof, and in fact, she had initiated such a case. 'So this lady was going to get a measure of justice in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower: just more likely than not that Cosby had done it. 50 per cent plus a tiny bit. A far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which, essentially, is just shy of proof beyond any doubt. As a result of the alleged incident, Miss Constand claimed she had suffered 'serious and debilitating injuries, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, physical and emotional upset, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleeplessness, isolation, flashbacks, anxiety, the full extent of which injuries are not yet known and some or all which may be permanent in nature.' The suit also said she had been 'caused to suffer and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment and financial loss.' Miss Constand sued Cosby for more than $150,000 in damages. Thirteen other women were claimed to be supporting witnesses in her suit and she settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006. Today, Miss Constand declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. However, she seemed to make her feelings clear on the overwhelming publicity surrounding Cosby and his alleged sexual offences. She tweeted a saying from Dr Seuss: 'My heart goes out to you:Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.' Statement: Bill Cosby, pictured in April, broke his silence amid the allegations of sexual assault on his website. The post thanked fans for their 'outpouring' of support . Paid out: Bill Cosby and Andrea Constand came to an out of court settlement in 2006 . When asked about the rape charges by NPR Weekend Edition host Scott Simon last week, Cosby - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille -  shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile. A day later the comedian's lawyer called the charges 'discredited' and said the 'fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. The star would not 'dignify' the allegations with a response, he added.. 'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives.' However, this was later taken down and today, a joint statement from Dolores Troiani, counsel to Andrea Constand, and John P. Schmitt, counsel to Bill Cosby.statement was posted on billcosby.com saying:  'The statement released by Mr. Cosby's attorney over the weekend was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand. 'As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago. Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter.' Keeping quiet: Andrea Constand declined to comment on the latest allegations of sexual assault made by women against Bill Cosby . Support:  Andrea Constand has been posting a series of supportive messages on her Twitter feed . Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, is now the latest to accuse Cosby of rape, claiming he assaulted her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19. Joan wrote an essay for Hollywood Elswhere, published on Sunday, saying that she felt she could not come forward because Cosby was idolized - but said she was going public in the wake of accusations made by other women. 'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap. Allegations: Barbara Bowman claims years of hell at the hands of Bill Cosby . And Barbara Bowman, who last month described her years of hell at the hands of the comic legend exclusively to MailOnline, is now asking him to acknowledge her claims. She said: 'I understand why more women have not spoken up. But my plea is that ANY women sexually abused by Bill Cosby come forward now and speak out. You have an obligation to survivors. If you don't speak out, you're helping no one, including yourselves. If nothing else, don't you deserve closure yourselves? Your daughters are not immune to this if we all stay silent. What kind of message are we sending to our own children?' 'This is why I'm speaking out. Wouldn't you like your daughters to learn how to stay safe from sexual predators? That's why I'm pushing so hard.' Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him.","Andrea Constand claimed Cosby drugged and attacked her at his Philadelphia home in 2004 .

"Please save this bear: The spectacled bear, which lives in South America and is the real-life Paddington, is in danger of becoming extinct . They’re bears all right, and they come from darkest Peru — but they’re very seldom found on Paddington Station wearing a luggage label that says: ‘Please look after this bear. Thank you.’ Spectacled bears seem to be specially equipped for hard stares of the kind that Aunt Lucy taught Paddington — the children’s favourite, based on them, who’s now a movie superstar. Their eyes tend to be surrounded by pale or gingerish markings that exaggerate the facial expression. These marks vary — you can tell one individual bear from another once you get to know them — and they often take the appearance of lavish spectacles, so they look like a bearish Elton John or Edna Everage. They’re the only species of bear in South America, and they’re found all over the Andes wherever wild places have been allowed to remain: a range that goes from Peru to Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and (just) into Argentina. The corner that links Colombia, Ecuador and Peru is where the best habitat remains. And the best bears. When Michael Bond wrote the first Paddington stories, he had Paddington stowing away from darkest Africa. On learning there are no bears in Africa, he shifted the action to darkest Peru and put Paddington’s Aunt Lucy — his only known relative other than an uncle who gave him his hat — in a Home for Retired Bears in Lima, from where she shipped Paddington to England. What Bond would not have known is that, today, Peru’s real-life Paddingtons are in danger. Spectacled bears have been classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Hunters, poachers and habitat destruction mean their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 or so just a few decades ago. Which is a sad thing, for they are bears as eccentric as Paddington himself. They’re much more Teddy-like in appearance than the great bears from the north of our planet. If you ever look at a black bear or a grizzly face to face, then from the side, you will have a very strange experience. Head on, it has the round friendly face of your childhood comforter: little snub of a nose, big warm eyes, and two daft ears that looks as if they had been stuck on as afterthoughts. But in profile, the face isn’t flat and round and chubby after all: it has a long muzzle sticking sharply from its face, and it’s obviously full of teeth. When a spectacled bear shows you its profile, though, it’s as if you are meeting your childhood Teddy for real, octupled in size. Paddington bear starring in new movie - but the number of real-life bears living in deepest Peru are dwindling . Pandas apart, there are two types of bears in the world. The fierce-looking, long-muzzled group, and a short-faced variety — of which the only surviving species in the world is the spectacled bear. So if Bond was seeking the Teddiest kind of bear, he couldn’t have chosen better. Not that all short-faced bears were necessarily gentle. The long-extinct giant short-faced bear was able to look down on a man when on all fours and capable of standing 12ft high. But the spectacled bear is just 3ft at the shoulder fully grown. Pandas apart, it is the least ferocious bear. Paddington’s favourite food was marmalade sandwiches: that’d be right up the spectacled bear’s tree. They hardly touch meat. All bears (apart from the exclusively carnivorous polar bear) take a wide range of food, but spectacled bears are as close as bears get to being vegetarian. They have powerful jaws, but that’s so they can eat tough, fibrous plants, not you. They go for cactus, palm heart, palm nuts and orchid bulbs, and they strip tree bark to get at the nutritious second layer. They do take small mammals and birds, but catching them is not what they’re best at. What they’re really good at is climbing. With front legs longer than back, non-retractable claws and a terrific grip, they are designed to live among the branches. Their best habitat is the cloud forest of the Andes, where they roam, content and solitary, high above the ground, only coming down when they choose. They're the only species of bear in South America and found all over Andes but their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 in a few decades . They build platforms up there for rest: they’ve been seen camping out for days, waiting for the fruit to ripen and give them a great binge. They love heights. They’ve been found at 14,000ft in the Andes and their heartland. But they’re adaptable: they can cope with grassland, dry forest and even semi-desert. And as human populations grow, they’ve shown that they can adapt to farmland pretty well: though it’s yet to be shown that farmland can adapt to bears. But these bears are hard animals to get close to: they’re mainly nocturnal, preferring to keep out of the way of humans. When they do come up against people, they’re seldom aggressive unless you threaten them or their cubs. There’s only one record of a human getting killed by a spectacled bear: it had been shot by hunters and was wounded and angry. The bears are surrounded by threats from humans. The most serious is the destruction of habitat: only a small proportion of the once great Andean cloud forest remains. It’s been replaced by farmland, some of it illegal, but the bears can make a living here: maize cobs and sugar-cane are very acceptable to them. Naturally, this sort of behaviour is resented. But what’s hated even more is the loss of cattle and horses. When Michael Bond, creator of the Paddington bear series, first had the idea he had Paddington stowed away in Africa before he learned there are no bears in Africa and so chose Peru . It’s widely believed among local people that the bears kill them: even though killing large mammals is not their way. But when they find dead livestock, they will accept a protein bonanza. So they get shot for things that they didn’t do. And there is money in it for the shooter — a bear’s gall bladder is valuable in the Chinese medicine trade and so are the paws. So the life of the bear is complex and the future uncertain. But there are some excellent conservation projects in place. One is an area of cloud forest that belongs to the Segundo y Cajas community in — where else? — darkest Peru. It’s run by Naturaleza y Cultura Peru, with support from the British-based World Land Trust. Here there is important work on looking after the cloud forest and its inhabitants. And the spectacled bear is probably the star. Paddington Bear is voiced by British actor Ben Whishaw, in the new computer-generated big-screen movie . Following a terrible earthquake, Paddington is sent across the high seas and eventually finds himself on a platform at Paddington station with a label round his neck, imploring some kind stranger to look after him . But it’s not vastly well-known. It has always lived in obscurity, and it’s possible it will die out in the same way. Unless we do something about it (and one way to do that is to support the World Land Trust). Here we have a fascinating beast whose life is being compromised by the relentless pressure exerted by humans. Like so many others. And because of this, I sometimes feel myself transported back to the Paddington Station of my childhood, but there is no longer just one small bear looking for protection. No: I seem to see the station packed with animals, the spectacled bear among them, each one wearing a luggage label that reads: please look after this bear, this rhino, this tiger, this whale, this eagle, this frog, this shark, on and on across the platforms endless rows and ranks of animals that desperately need our protection. Please look after this bear. Please look after this planet. Thank you.","Spectacled bears have been classified as vulnerable to extinction .

"Beyoncé's Grammy Awards performance was slammed by concerned parents on Sunday as they deemed the incredibly risqué routine too explicit for children to watch.

"Luminita Perijoc, 31, forced her victim at knifepoint to perform sex acts . A sex-crazed Angelina Jolie lookalike has been handed a suspended jail sentence after a taxi driver claimed she had tried to kill him when he refused to perform a sex act on her for a third time. Nicolae Stan, 35, told police Luminita Perijoc, 31, had already forced him at knifepoint to have intercourse and perform oral sex during the incident in 2012. He claims he met Perijoc while he was hired to deliver some bags of shopping to her apartment in the city of Tulcea, in eastern Romania, and when he turned up at the door she had asked for his phone number so that she could engage his services again. He said several hours later she called and asked him to pick up some bottles of wine and come back to her apartment to deliver them. When he turned up at the door, she had grabbed him and dragged him inside and demanded sex. When he refused she pulled out a 10cm knife and forced him to undress, he told the court. Mr Stan says he only escaped when he managed to barricade himself into a bedroom and dial 999 on his mobile phone. Police confirmed that they had rescued him from the flat of the half-dressed young woman and that he had been taken to hospital with more than half a dozen stab wounds. She was initially jailed for five years after a court rejected her claim that she was really the victim. Friends told local media that Perijoc is a huge fan of actress Jolie and models herself on the Tomb Raider star . But an appeal court has now confirmed that the jail sentence be suspended for four years after experts testified that Perijoc's behaviour may have been down to the fact she was on medication at the time. She had apparently been taking high strength painkillers following an operation. Mr Stan complained that while she had been let off with a suspended sentence, he had been given a life sentence as he had become miserable due to his friends teasing him. He said: 'It is terrible. I am now a local celebrity, everyone is talking about me. 'They don't understand why I refused her, but they do not know what it is like to have a mad woman yelling at you at knifepoint. 'They look at her, then look at me and laugh. But I think anyone would find it impossible to perform with a knife at their throat even if they were with Miss Romania.' The married father-of-three added: 'I think she wasn't used to anyone saying no because she flew into a rage when I declined. 'She took out a knife and forced me to undress and have sex with her. 'But she wasn't satisfied and wanted sex again. 'When I refused she attacked me with a knife, and forced me to have oral sex with her but she still stabbed me,' he added. Friends told local media that Perijoc is a huge fan of actress Jolie and models herself on the Tomb Raider star.","Luminita Perijoc, 31, forced Nicolae Stan, 35, to have sex with her .

"A bomb strapped to a girl aged 'no older than 10' exploded in a busy market place in Nigeria, killing at least 20 people and injuring 18, security sources said. The powerful explosion rocked the market in Maiduguri, which lies in the heartland of an insurgency by Sunni Muslim militant group Boko Haram, and was hit twice by female suicide bombers last year. A Red Cross official said the blast split the young suicide bomber in two and flung one part across the road. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Boko Haram militants have increasingly used women and young girls as human bombs in their six-year quest for a hardline Islamic state. Scroll down for video . A bomb strapped to a girl aged 'no older than 10' exploded in a busy market place in Maiduguri, Nigeria, pictured is an explosion at the same market in July . Civilian vigilante Ashiru Mustapha said the explosives detonated as the girl was being searched at the entrance to the market. 'The girl was about 10 years old and I doubt much if she actually knew what was strapped to her body,' he told AFP. 'In fact, she was searched at the entrance of the market and the metal detector indicated that she was carrying something. 'But sadly, the explosion went off before she was isolated, killing at least 10 people and injuring many others.' The bomb went off at 12.15pm (11.15am GMT) today when the market was packed with traders. The bodies of at least 16 bomb victims were counted in one hospital by mid-afternoon, civilian joint task force member Zakariya Mohammed told Reuters. Boko Haram militants have increasingly used women and young girls as human bombs in their six-year quest for a hardline Islamic state, pictured is burnt Bama market destroyed by gunmen in April 2013 . 'Right now, there are 27 injured people in Borno Medical Hospital, while more were taken to other hospitals,' he said. The market in the Borno state capital was cordoned off as health officials began the grim task of sifting through the wreckage and collecting body parts. The northeast states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa are bearing the brunt of a five-year-old insurgency by the Boko Haram, which wants to revive a medieval caliphate in Nigeria. Last year more than 10,000 people died in the bloodshed. Hours later, a suspicious vehicle that had been stopped at a checkpoint outside the city of Potiskum, in neighbouring Yobe, exploded at a police station as its driver was being taken in for questioning. A police officer accompanying the car and the driver were killed, an officer said. Potiskum has been a repeated target for militant violence. Both blasts came a week after a major Boko Haram attack on the fishing town of Baga in northern Borno State, which is believed to be the worst in the bloody six-year insurgency. Zahra'u Babangida, 13, was arrested in December with explosives strapped to her body and told journalists that her parents volunteered her to take part in a suicide attack in Kano. Boko Haram launched its first female suicide attack in June last year in the northern state of Gombe and there have been a spate of bombings since, including four in a week in the city of Kano in July. The same month a 10-year-old girl was found in Katsina state wearing a suicide vest, prompting fears that young girls were being forced into becoming human bombs rather than through ideological motivation. Forced conscription of young men and boys by Boko Haram has been well-documented. Last July, three women said to be 'female recruiters' for Boko Haram were arrested. An alleged trainer of women bombers was also detained in Kano in August with up to 16 'trainees'. On Friday, militants fought running battles with troops in the Yobe state capital, Damaturu, leading to the destruction of a mosque, shops and a market. The attack was said to be a reprisal for an offensive by civilian vigilantes and local hunters against a Boko Haram enclave in southern Yobe on Tuesday.","Bomb worn by female suicide bomber, aged 10, exploded in busy market .

"A British jihadist, known as Abu Abdullah al-Britani, who previously called on fellow UK Muslims to travel to Syria to fight for ISIS, has reportedly been killed. Al-Britani, who is believed to have been called William Hasmou Clinic, was reportedly killed in Hawigat Saqr, near the eastern Syrian city of Deir ez-Sor, in a Syrian government airstrike. He is believed to be the eighth Briton killed in the conflict between Islamic State militants and forces resisting the group's advances in Iraq and Syria. Abu Abdullah al-Britani, pictured,  has reportedly been killed while fighting for ISIS in Syria . Al-Britani was very active on social media and wanted fellow Britons to join him in jihad. He said: 'I'm sure we have more lions roaming around the UK. Get yourself over here.' In July, he appeared in a video claiming to have witnessed a 'miracle' during a battle in which he saw angels. He claimed that during a 22-hour fight, 'Allah sent his angels upon angels upon angels to aid the believers in battle.' In one of his Tweets, al-Britani said: 'From the streets of London to the dirt roads of Jihad.' It appears he might have got married in Syria and had a daughter, whom he referred to as his 'little princess mujahidah'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is currently investigating reports of al-Britani's death. A spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria. 'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.' It is understood that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's airforce bombed Deir ez Zur earlier today. It has been reported that al-Britani was killed alongside a fellow fighter called Ahmad Bakir. The British born jihadist was reportedly killed in the town of Deir ez-Zur and is being 'mourned' by ISIS . A Tweet claimed that Al Britani was killed in fighting the Hawigat Saqr district of Dier Al-Zour . Charlie Winter, a researcher with anti-extremist think thank the Quilliam Foundation, tweeted: 'Multiple (as yet unconfirmed reports that another Briton - Abu Abdullah al-Britani - died fighting for IS in #Syria.' Shiraz Maher, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation in London, added: 'Unconfirmed reports that a British foreign fighter, William Hasmo Clinic, aka Abu Abdullah, has died while fighting for IS in Syria.' Another Twitter account, @Raqqa-SI, which is anti-ISIS, posted: 'Today #ISIS mourns William Hasmo Clinic a British known as Abu Abdullah in Hwejet Saqer area Dier AlZour #Syria'. Other British fighters who have been killed in the fighting include teen-aged brothers Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes from Brighton, East Sussex. Family: Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) left his family for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brothers Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) have both been killed in the fighting . Spotted leaving Gatwick Airport: Three other men from Portsmouth - including Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (right) - have also been killed after travelling to Syria last year . Jaffar, 17, is believed to have died last month trying to overthrow dictator Assad's government. His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with al-Nusra. Their older brother Amer Deghayes, 20, is fighting for al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affliated group, against the Bashar al-Assad regime. He said his brothers' deaths had made him more determined to carry on fighting until he is killed, revealing that he has no desire to return to the UK. 'I have promised Allah that I will stay on the way of jihad until I get killed,' he told ITV News. Gone: Muhammed Mehdi Hassan, 19, died fighting in Kobane, the scene of fierce fighting between Kurds and the militant group . He describes martyrdom as the 'greatest success a person can attain', adding: 'It [his brothers' deaths] makes me more determined to get what they got.' The Deghayes brothers are the nephew of Omar Deghayes, who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 after he was arrested in Pakistan. It emerged this month that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - died fighting in Kobane, the scene of fierce fighting between Kurds and the militant group. Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October last year. In January alone, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences related to Syria compared with 24 arrests in the whole of last year. Others who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The 41-year-old married father-of-three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.","ISIS said it was 'mourning' British jihadist Abu Abdullah al-Britani .

"Police had to get physical with a number of Black Friday shoppers who refused to let go of discounted Samsung televisions during a fight at a Walmart in Texas. Cell phone footage of the brawl has gone viral after it was posted on YouTube and shows authorities having to forcibly remove shoppers who were lying on top of the giant 50 inch TVs. On sale for $218, the televisions were part of the Stafford store's One Hour Guarantee Promotion on Thanksgiving. Scroll down for video . Police had to get physical with a number of Black Friday shoppers who refused to let go of discounted Samsung televisions during a fight at a Walmart in Texas . Once the giveaway began customers rushed the display and started grabbing the televisions. Several people got heated as the number of TVs began to dwindle, said police. Witnesses said people tried to claim the items by lying on top of them and wrestling each other off. It got so rough that police had to jump in to sort things out. Stafford police said law enforcement in the video were off-duty police and sheriff's deputies hired to provide extra security for Walmart. In the end, no was hurt and no one was arrested. Ironically the One Hour Guarantee Promotion ensured that even if the store ran out of the item, it would be shipped to the customer's store for them to collect before Christmas. Cell phone footage of the brawl has gone viral after it was posted on YouTube and shows authorities having to forcibly remove shoppers who were lying on top of the giant 50 inch TVs . 'It doesn't surprise me. The way people are acting to save money and you can't blame them. They are just trying to save some money,' shopper Lorranie Henderson told Click2Houston. Early discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said on Sunday. Overall, 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four-day weekend, down 5.2 percent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group. Total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year, the trade group estimated. Part of the reason is that Target, J.C. Penney, Macy's, Walmart and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as Halloween. Some opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving. All that stole some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend. Crazy: Discount store shoppers were prepared to wait in long lines on Black Friday - but the decision of many retailers to open on Thanksgiving has affected the sales figures for the busiest shopping day of the year . Still, the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices. Matt Shay, the trade group's CEO, said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas. And shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages. 'While they're more optimistic, they're very cautious,' Shay said. 'If the deals are not right for them, they're not going to spend.' Bottom line: Expect more deep discounts, all season long. 'Every day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday,' he said.","On sale for $218, the televisions were part of the Stafford store's One Hour Guarantee Promotion on Thanksgiving .

"Early sketches of some of the breakthrough moments in popular culture - from Superman in flight to the creation of Hello Kitty - have been revealed. The collection of drawings, which also include the original Dennis the Menace comic strip drawn on the back of a cigarette packet, have gone on display at the O2's Eureka! Gallery in  east London. It also features some more modern illustrations including the plans for the Covent Garden Christmas decorations, drawn up in 2010, and this year's Serpentine Pavilion. The original sketch by special effects supervisor Andrew Ainsworth shows how he planned to make Superman 'fly' whilst being attached to a wire in the 1978 movie . Christopher Reeve played Superman in the 1978 movie, which left filmmakers struggling to decide how best to make the actor look like he was really flying . The theme for the collection is the moment of 'eureka' experienced by some of the world’s greatest creative visionaries including designers, architects and animators. Andrew Ainsworth drew up with the first ever sketch showing Superman flying on 'wires' for the groundbreaking 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve. He unearthed the 1977 sketch while sifting through his attic earlier this year and found it buried in the bottom of a suitcase. Producers for the movie version of the comic had been struggling to come up with how the Man of Steel would fly on-screen logistically. Early sketches of Hello Kitty, who was created by Yuko Yamaguchi, which was first displayed in 1974 . The character's first appearance was on a vinyl coin purse in Japan and brought to the United States in 1976 . The modern day Hello Kitty is white and wears a pink dress and top with a matching flower in her hair . They tried firing a crash test dummy from a cannon, using a remote control to fly the dummy around and 'high quality animation' before realising that none of them produced the required 'flying' effect. Producer Ilya Salkind said at the time the film 'lost about $2 million on flying tests' before getting it right. Mr Ainsworth said his 'eureka' moment came a year after the script was submitted when he showed how he envisaged Superman being suspended form a rail with a pulley-system. He drew the superhero with a fan blowing in his face to 'give the illusion of movement to his hair and cape'. Mr Ainsworth, who was the special effects supervisor on the Superman movie, said: 'Back then I only had pencil and paper to work out how the vision in my head could be made a reality on the screen. The first drawing of Dennis the Menace on the back of a cigarette packet by Ian 'Chiz' Chisholm - a leading member of The Beano editorial team - in 1950 at a meeting with bosses in a pub in Dundee . Dennis the Menace, who first appeared in the comic in 1951, became the Beano's longest running and most popular comic strip . Two months after his first appearance in The Beano he was given his familiar black and red jersey . 'Today, we have the wonders of technology to be able to play with and see whole scenes come to life before a frame has been shot.' The artist, who also created the Stormtrooper helmet for the Star Wars movies, added: 'I put this picture away in a drawer at the time and then it must have been filed away with some papers before it finally made its way to the loft. 'When I was approached to take part in this exhibition, I felt that it was time to look it out. 'A couple of days later, just when I was convinced it was lost forever, it turned up in a suitcase in a cupboard in my loft.' In the end, producers used rolling riggings suspended from cranes and studio ceilings, with Christopher Reeve or his stunt double attached by wires. The movie cost £35 million ($55m) to make in the end and reaped huge success at the box office, pulling in a massive £190 million ($300m). This sketch shows the initial design for the three metre Christmas bauble decorations in Covent Garden . Plans for the 2014 Serpentine Pavilion, designed by Chilean architect Smiljan Radic, which occupied a footprint of some 541 square metres on the lawn of the Serpentine Gallery this summer . Radic's early plans depict a semi-translucent, cylindrical structure, resting on large quarry stones (above) Mark Champkins, inventor in residence at London's Science Museum and who has worked with O2 on the exhibition, said: 'We were blown away when Andrew said he'd rediscovered this image and we knew we had to include it. 'Superman: The Movie was an iconic piece of film-making and so much of today's superhero cinema - the likes of X-Men, Thor, the Avengers - can still trace a direct line of descent back to it. 'This sketch - which shows the Eureka! moment when the film-makers worked out how to make superhuman powers appear real on film - is an important and breakthrough moment in cinema in a pre-digital age. 'Displaying this image on the latest and greatest digital technology is a sign of how far we've come when it comes to the tools of invention.' These drawings show the early concept development for an extreme environment technical jacket system, Life Tech, for outdoor sportswear brand Kolon Sport . The clothing, which is designed for the most extreme environments, hit Korean stores in December 2013 . Among the other exhibits at the show of 'cultural breakthroughs' on show at the gallery include the original sketch of Dennis the Menace, drawn on the back of a a cigarette packet. The sketch, on the back of a packet of Player's Navy Cut cigarettes, was knocked up in 1950 by Ian 'Chiz' Chisholm, a leading member of The Beano editorial team at a meeting with bosses at a pub in Dundee. Dennis the Menace, who first appeared in the comic in 1951, became the Beano's longest running and most popular comic strip. Other sketches on show include Hello Kitty, created by Yuko Yamaguchi in 1974, the lead designer at Japanese company Sanrio. These early sketches show drawings by Leonardo da Vinci of parachute experiments in the 15th century . Images of the first prototype for the Articulate Board Game in 1992., The packaging initially featured a square patch in the centre of the box, but subsequent designs led to the explosion style imagery . An unreleased version of the cover of the debut 2002 album by 'rock supergroup' Audioslave . Ms. Yamaguchi has spent the past 30 years leading the evolution of the beloved global icon and Hello Kitty is now available on over 50,000 products available in over 130 countries worldwide. She also came up with the designs for Hello Kitty's 'boyfriend' Dear Daniel in 1999 and her pet cat Charmmy Kitty in 2004. Da Vinci's parachute from 1501 and Elizabeth Emanuel's sketch of Princess Diana's Wedding Dress from 1981 are also included in the rare collection, which is being shown on Samsung Galaxy tablets.","Collection has gone on display at the O2's Eureka!

"Senior MPs, lawyers and campaigners yesterday called for an end to the bail system which can leave someone languishing on police bail for months without being charged. They said the use of pre-charge bail was a 'perversion of justice' which has left more than 70,000 on police bail as suspects without knowing if they will ever be charged. Pre-charge bail was introduced in 1984 under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to allow police to put restrictions on individuals before they have enough evidence to charge. Comedian Jim Davidson (left) spent eight months on bail before being told he would face no charges over separate sex abuse allegations and broadcaster Paul Gambaccini (right) was on bail for nearly a year . Among those who have been left in limbo by the system have been broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, on bail for nearly a year before being told there would be no action against him, and comedian Freddie Starr, 19 months on bail before the case against him was dropped. Both were arrested under the Operation Yewtree sex abuse inquiry. Comedian Jim Davidson spent eight months on bail before being told he would face no charges over separate sex abuse allegations. Last week former Sun journalist Clodagh Hartley was cleared by an Old Bailey jury of making unlawful payments to a tax official after spending two-and-a-half years awaiting trial, 12 months of them on pre-charge bail. A letter signed by 25 figures, including one of the country's most senior judges and a cross-party group of MPs, called for Home Secretary Teresa May to change the law to limit pre-charge bail. Comedian Freddie Starr was bailed for 19 months before the case against him was dropped . They say police should not be able to put someone on bail without charge for more than 28 days without applying to a magistrate for an extension. The signatories included former Appeal Judge and President of the Family Division Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss; Tory MPs David Davis, Dominic Raab, Nigel Evans and Sir Edward Garnier; LibDem MP John Hemming and peer Brian Paddick; and Labour peer and civil rights lawyer Baroness Helena Kennedy. Other supporters included campaigner Peter Tatchell; prison reformer Frances Crook; Green MP Caroline Lucas and military author Andy McNab. Mr McNab said: 'The police can hold people on pre-charge bail forever. The mental and physical effects can be huge. I know a lot of people who have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. This can be even more stressful than the effects of war. 'Soldiers are trained to take action. If you are in operations you are in control. But in this situation you can't take any action. You just have to sit there waiting. It is madness. If the police want more than 28 days they should go to a judge to ask for it. If someone has done something wrong then they should be charged and if they are guilty then they should be punished. But to be left dangling is just wrong.' The letter says it is a scandal that 72,000 people are on pre-charge bail and more than 5,000 of them have been on bail for more than six months. Mrs May opened a question over pre-charge bail in October when she told the College of Policing conference that the Government would consider a statutory time limit. The longest time anyone is thought to have been held on pre-charge bail is three-and-a-half years while the Metropolitan Police delayed a decision to bring charges.","MPs and campaigners have called pre-charge bail  a 'perversion of justice'

"A rare emerald, pearl and diamond necklace fit for royalty is being  sold by auction house Bonhams. The unique gems are expected to fetch between £120-000 to 180,000 after being put on sale by an anonymous seller. The rare item of jewellery dates back to 1911 and is believed to have been worn at the Delhi Durbar, meaning 'Court of Delhi', a glittering event held in India to celebrate the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary as Emperor and Empress of India. Rare sale: Divya Pande from Bonham's jewellery department models the rare diamond and emerald necklace . The necklace dates back to 1911 and would have been worn by an Indian prince or other highly ranked VIP . A spokesman for Bonhams said they do not know who wore the stunning necklace but it would have either been a member of royalty or a VIP with a high enough status to attend such a lavish event. They added: 'We feel very privileged to be selling a remarkable and rare piece linked to historic days of Indian Royalty.' The one of a kind necklace is part of Bonham's fine jewellery sale on the 4th of December at their Bond Street salerooms. The chain of the necklace is made up of multiple small diamonds and emeralds which support a pendant dominated by a central fluted emerald of approximately seven carats. Strings of pearls dangle from the back of the necklace where it is clasped. Decadent: The necklace has strings of pearls at the back even though they would not have been that noticeable when worn . Unique item: The jewels are expected to fetch £120-000 to 180,000 . Bonhams said the addition of the pearls at the back, which would not have been very visible when worn, show how the necklace is an 'unmistakeable statement of wealth, bejeweled on every bit of its surface'. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery UK and Europe, said: 'This necklace provides us with a unique insight into the levels of opulence and display at the 1911 Delhi Durbar and it is extremely rare to have such a magnificent jewel survive intact. 'The necklace is not only fascinating historically but is also in superb condition. This is a singular opportunity to purchase a beautifully made historic jewel, the quality and lavishness of which we rarely see in jewellery nowadays.' King George V and Queen Mary at the Delhi Durbar in 1911: The queen wore her own emerald and diamond necklace to the historic event . Paying homage: Every ruling prince, nobleman, landed gentry and other persons of note in India attended - and one of them would have been wearing the necklace that is now being auctioned . The briolette cut style of the necklace with a pear shape pendant was popular in Indian jewellery during the time of the British Empire.

"A protruding belly, high blood pressure and intense sugar cravings. This is what happens to the body after  drinking 10 cans of Coca-Cola a day, according to one man who took up the challenge. George Prior, 50, decided to embark on a 'Coke diet' in order to show the harmful effects of the high levels of sugar found in the world's most popular drink. In just 30 days he saw drastic changes to his formerly healthy and muscular physique. He developed a protruding stomach and waistline and his weight ballooned from 12 stone (168lb) to 14 stone (192 lb). His blood pressure soared from 129/77 to 145/96. This is way above the ideal level of 120/80 - and above this level, the risk of heart disease or stroke is greatly increased. Scroll down for video . George Prior, 50, put on two stone in weight and gained a protruding belly after drinking more than three litres of Coke a day for a month. He is pictured before (left) and after (right) embarking on the challenge . Mr Prior also saw his blood pressure soar from 129/77 to 145/96. High blood pressure is linked with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke . 'The most dramatic change was in weight: 23lb of gain over thirty days,' Mr Prior said. His weight is pictured rising throughout the experiment (left). After a month he weighed almost 14 stone (right) As well as the fast weight gain, Mr Prior, a father-of-two, said he feared he was becoming addicted to Coca-Cola after experiencing intense cravings. While he tried to stick to his normal Paleo diet – a low-carbohydrate diet which focuses on eating lean meats, vegetables and berries – he began experiencing sugar cravings that were difficult to ignore. 'The most dramatic change was in weight: 23lb of gain over 30 days,' Mr Prior, who lives in L.A., said. 'I also seemed to develop a craving for Cokes, or other sugars, during the time I was drinking Cokes.' '[As a result], I'm urging people to examine the amount of sugar in their diets. 'People need to be aware of the real and powerful damaging effects of sugar on their health. Mr Prior's experiment comes shortly after New York assemblyman Karim Camara said fizzy drinks 'are the new smoking' and called for sugar-laden beverages to carry warning labels similar to those found on cigarette packets. Mr Camara said the aim of his bill, which would introduce warning labels on drinks, is to educate the public, and lower the consumption of the drinks. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than five cubes of sugar a day. The guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50 billion a year. The WHO said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. However, low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative. WHO also said children should try for less than five cubes of sugar a day and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven cubes. Instead five cubes is the ideal figure that people should aim for. In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the recommended daily intake of sugar to be slashed from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day. A regular can of Coke contains 35g of sugar, the equivalent of seven cubes, so that alone would exceed this limit. As part of his challenge, Mr Prior drank 10 cans of Coke a day - a total of 350g of sugar - the equivalent of around 70 cubes. Experts warn fizzy drinks contain sugar but have no other nutritional value, and Mr Prior said he found it hard to eat as much food because the Coke left him full at lunch and dinner times. The BBQ accessory entrepreneur said he wanted to stir up debate: 'I did the experiment to get people thinking and talking about how much sugar they eat and how unhealthy it is. 'I would prefer not to do it again. 'I don't like being this heavy. 'The actual drinking of the 10 Cokes got to be an irritating chore every day. 'There were a lot of visits to the restroom, a feeling of constant fullness, and a clutter of cans everywhere.' After Mr Prior stopped drinking the fizzy soft drink he lost 5lb in four days. He now concerned about the effect of sugar can have on children. He said: 'Kids shouldn't drink Cokes. 'But then kids shouldn't drink juices, either, and that's going to be a very hard sell to parents who believe that juice is ""natural"", or even ""organic"". 'It's sugar, and not only do kids not need it, it's bad for them. Indeed, past research has found sugary drinks are a primary contributor to type 2 diabetes and tooth decay, especially in children. As part of his challenge, Mr Prior drank 10 cans of Coke a day - a total of 350g of sugar - the equivalent of around 70 cubes. Pictured are the cans left over from his experiment . A 330ml can of Coke contains 35g of sugars, the equivalent of sevent cubes. This is more than the recommended daily intake of 25g, or five cubes, set by the World Health Organization (WHO) A 500ml bottle of Coke contains even more sugar- 53g or almost 11 cubes. This is twice the WHO's recommended daily allowance for a normal adult . And experts warn that fizzy drinks are also fuelling the obesity epidemic - and, in turn, other serious illnesses, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. Mr Prior added: 'I think there are a lot of people suffering health problems like diabetes and heart disease, who aren't aware they could help themselves by just stopping sugar.' He also blasted Coca-Cola for their marketing techniques to make consumers believe 'they care' when they are just creating more products to sell.' The latest member of the Coca-Cola family, called Coca-Cola Life, is marketed as having less sugar than regular Coke but none of the artificial sweeteners that increasingly worry Diet Coke drinkers. The new naturally sweetened drink - which contains a third less sugar and calories than regular cola - has been created amid calls for the company to do more to tackle the global obesity epidemic. Sold in a green can or a recyclable bottle, it is already available in the UK, U.S., Chile, Argentina and is due to hit Australian shelves in April. Bur Mr Prior said: 'Sugar's legal, soft drinks are legal,' he said. 'The responsibility is with consumers. 'Coke's genius plan is ""reduce"" the amount of sugar in their drinks. 'It's genius because it makes them look like they care, but still continue to sell sugar. 'I'd like to see controls on the lobbying and spending of big corporations who sell sugar and don't want the government to tell people how bad it is.' MailOnline has approached Coca-Cola for comment.","George Prior, 50, from Los Angeles, had a fit and healthy physique before .

"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola. According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul,  250 miles north of Baghdad. While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help. Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reports . UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could  be carried out. Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.' The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever . Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters. According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa. The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those  of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed. In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease. The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine. It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease. ISIS fighters pictured in June 2014, when the extremist group swept through Iraq seizing territory including the city of Mosul . Yesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said. The action in Syria included 17 strikes near the cities of Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani. A variety of Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units were hit. In Iraq, 12 strikes targeted Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units near the cities of Mosul, Fallujah and Sinjar. Fighters, bombs and remotely controlled aircraft were used.","Militants allegedly attended hospital in Mosul showing signs of disease .

"Football is not always as glamourous as some might imagine, as the story of the first time I signed Marouane Fellaini perhaps illustrates. The serious negotiating began in smart enough surroundings; the Les Ambassadeurs Club in Mayfair. But it wasn’t long before the Everton club secretary and I were jumping on a four-seater prop plane and making a crazy dash to Brussels with only a few hours left of transfer deadline day. And that was only the beginning of our problems. Our European scouts had been aware of Marouane for some time. He was doing well in what was a very good Standard Liege team. They had some decent players. Steven Defour and Axel Witsel in a midfield three with Marouane. Dante, a fine Brazilian centre half now at Bayern Munich. And a good striker in Dieumerci Mbokani. I liked the way they played. Marouane Fellaini is now showing why David Moyes signed the midfielder to Everton and Manchester United . Fellaini breaks his goal duck at Man United with this strike in their 2-2 draw with West Brom . The Belgian international celebrates the goal in a match that for many marked his true arrival at United . This was August 2008, and Liverpool were drawn against them in the qualification round of the Champions League. So I went along to Anfield to watch, and then flew out to Belgium that weekend to see Marouane in action again. He was excellent. Perfect for us at Everton. But not until transfer deadline day did we get to sit down with Standard Liege. It was Bill Kenwright and myself, a couple of agents and these guys from Belgium. Eventually Dave Harrison, our secretary, joined us as well. We went in there at around 2pm wanting to spend no more than £11million or £12m. But hours went by and we were getting nowhere, and the price was slowly creeping up. Bill kept having to check if we were still doing the right thing; if as a club run very prudently we could actually afford it. By 7pm we were still at a stalemate, but by 9.30pm we had a deal - £15m. I’m always very careful when I’m spending the club’s money. I treat it like it’s my own and I always try to sign players for what I feel is the right price. We had spent decent money on Yakubu the year before but most of our signings — players like Phil Jagielka, Joleon Lescott, Mikel Arteta and Leighton Baines — came for fees closer to three, four or five million. A year later we signed Seamus Coleman for 60 grand from Sligo Rovers. Fellaini evades Jon Obi Mikel in an impressive performance for United in their 1-1 draw with Chelsea . The 6ft 4in star troubles the world class defence of Premier League leaders Chelsea on October 26 . Marouane’s fee took Everton out of their comfort zone. It was big money for the club. But I knew he was what we needed. I wanted him. And I was so determined to get him I made damn sure we signed him that night by going to Brussels myself. It was an insane race against time. First in the car from Mayfair to Luton Airport, then this bumpy, terrifying ride across the English Channel in this tiny aircraft and finally the hunt not only to find Marouane but a hotel fax machine that actually worked. When we arrived at a hotel that still seemed to be under construction it was chaos. We couldn’t find the lad. And when we eventually did — he was with his dad and an agent — we discovered the fax machine in the hotel business centre didn’t work. I remember Dave screaming down the phone to the FA, trying to explain that the bloody thing was broken. It was a complete car crash. We were rescued by someone in the hotel who then said there was a machine in one of the executive rooms that worked, and with minutes to spare the paperwork was faxed through and Marouane was ours. He arrived at Everton and, of course, the first thing everyone clocked was the hair. I’ve always been quite strict when it comes to the appearance of my players. I don’t want to see earrings in training, things like that. With Marouane’s hair, I actually wondered if it might take a bit of the pace off the ball when he went up for a header. But I soon realised it was part of his personality. Part of who he is. Moyes signed Fellaini, here after a match against Liverpool in 2012, from Standard Liege to Everton in 2008 - it was a fee that took the club out of their comfort zone but, Moyes writes, 'I knew he was what we needed' The qualities that made Moyes sign Fellaini to Everton when the same reasons he brought him to Manchester United for £27.5m on a five-year contract - the midfielder was Moyes only signing of the summer window . When we signed him he was still very young and very slightly built. But he worked incredibly hard to develop his upper body and gain the strength you need in the Premier League. In fact, he worked hard at all aspects of his game, and he became a real asset for us. He could score goals. He has great energy. He’s a terrific runner and, while he’s not the quickest player in the Premier League, he will cover as much ground as anyone. Moyes and Fellaini embrace after Everton beat Man United in the 2009 FA Cup semi-final on penalties . Technically he’s very good. He has fantastic chest control, for instance. And he’s very professional; hard working with a great attitude. He will do anything you ask and all you’ll ever hear from him is a ‘thank you, coach’ at the end of a training session. He’s a very quiet lad. If anything a little shy. It was all these qualities that convinced me to bring him to Manchester United, and he was very excited to come. It was a big move for him. I remember his father, a former professional player and a huge influence on Marouane, being in tears at Carrington on the day we signed him. He was so proud his son was joining this great football club. Just like the first time I signed him, the deal was done right on deadline. But, of course, he wasn’t meant to be our only signing at United that summer. He was brought in to compliment the squad and the other players we were hoping to bring in; to do a certain job in certain games. Unfortunately for Marouane, he was the only player we brought in and because of that he was seen as the big signing. It meant he was under more pressure than he perhaps should have been. And when the season didn’t start the way we all wanted it to, he came under a great deal of scrutiny, even if most of the attention was on me. I felt it was unfair that he was having to carry that extra pressure and expectation, and deal with extra criticism, simply because David Moyes had signed him. I think he’d be the first to admit he maybe didn’t always play as well as he could have done when he got the chance. But it was a big change for him, even if he did have previous Premier League experience, and he had come into a team that wasn’t playing with as much confidence as we would have liked. I think that affected him as well. Moyes finalised both deals at United and Everton for Fellaini right on the stroke of the transfer deadline . On their return to Goodison Park with United, posters marking their achievements adorned the stadium . It’s also true that players can take time to settle at a new club. I remember people telling me it took Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic a while. Players who became great players for United. Marouane should have been given time too, because he’s now proving what I always believed; that he can be an important player for United. I’ve watched him in the last two games and he has been first class. He’s had an influence on the games, which is what you look to your bigger players to do. And I think he’s played an important part in helping United gain some momentum going into today’s Manchester derby. There were times last season, when things were tough, when we spoke. But I told him then that he would become a top United player if he continued to work hard. Fellaini has helped United take some momentum into Sunday's Manchester derby with City . Moyes says Fellaini's last two games have been 'first class' and he's 'proving what I've always believed' It was hard when I left, because we had a great relationship and I think he was upset. I did feel bad, responsible even. I’d convinced him to come across in the belief that was I going to be there for a long time, and now suddenly I was leaving. But in football everyone realises these things can happen, and Marouane knows his job is to deliver for United. He can perform several jobs in a team but I think it helps him to have someone like Daley Blind sitting there in that more defensive midfield role. At Standard Liege he had Defour or Witsel sitting deeper and allowing him to get further forward, and at Everton he had players like Phil Neville. At United last season we lacked that kind of midfielder, and while Marouane has the physical ability to cover the ground he’s definitely more effective in a game if he’s accompanied by a defensive midfield player. So I’m delighted he’s settled down now and he’s beginning to be appreciated for what he is; a damn fine footballer who was definitely worth the effort as well as the money. Like our Manchester United Facebook page. Marouane Fellaini suffered the harshest criticism as Manchester United’s form crumbled last season. But, after a steady World Cup in Brazil and an injury-hit start to life under Louis van Gaal, the Belgian is looking the real deal again. He scored a good goal in a decent performance at West Brom, but topped that with an all-action display against Chelsea, as shown in his touch map.","David Moyes first signed Marouane Fellaini from Standard Liege in 2008 .

"A murder investigation has been launched after an American mother was stabbed to death during a clash with a burqa-clad 'woman' in shopping mall toilets in Abu Dhabi. The 37-year-old kindergarten teacher, who has 11-year-old twin boys, was stabbed with a knife in the altercation in the ladies' toilets a supermarket in Boutik Mall on Reem island in the United Arab Emirates capital. She was taken to be treated at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City but died later from her injuries in the incident on Monday afternoon. The victim - who is divorced from the father of the twins - has not been identified. Her initials are only known as ABR. Police say they do not know if it was a woman or a man in the burqa. Witnesses told police the pair had been embroiled in an argument in the public toilets, which are beside a branch of Waitrose, an upscale British supermarket chain which has a presence in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Assailant: Local police released this picture of the attacker fleeing the scene . Escaping: Police released this image from CCTV of the woman making her way from the crime scene . Officers are still trying to determine the reasons for the attack and the identity of the suspect, who fled the scene wearing an abaya, black gloves and the face-covering veil known as a niqab. The victim's ex-husband was said to be overseas but was flying back to comfort his sons. They were being looked after by community police officers. Colonel Rashid Bourshid, director of the criminal investigation department of Abu Dhabi police, said: 'Police found the woman lying on the floor bleeding. 'She had serious wounds after being stabbed with a knife during a brawl with the attacker. 'No reason has been established yet as to why the woman was murdered. The attacker fled the scene after stabbing the woman.' The victim worked at a private school in Abu Dhabi and lived with her sons in the city. Mall employees witnessed the altercation with her attacker. Col Bourshid said a murder investigation had been launched and police were searching for the suspect. The suspect - apparently a woman - was described as wearing an abaya, black jacket and gloves. New: The mall where the attack took place opened in 2011 and has 50 shops and restaurants. It caters for a mix of expatriates and wealthy locals . Glitzy: The scene of the murder was the Reem island mall development, which sits between two towers and was opened in 2011 . He added: 'Community policing is now taking care of the two boys and will provide them with shelter and all necessary support until their father, who stays outside the UAE, arrives.' It was not known whether the boys were with her at the time of the attack. Reem island is a residential, commercial and business development connected to Abu Dhabi city centre by a bridge. It was built as the city center became over-populated. It is mostly inhabited by expatriates and boasts the upmarket Boutik Mall, which opened in 2011 and has 50 shops and restaurants, including the capital city's first Waitrose, Leopold's of London and La Brioche. The mall bridges two residential buildings, Sun and Sky towers. Its website says it 'offers the best of everything that anyone needs to lead a stylish life. 'Serving the vibrant and cosmopolitan community of Shams Abu Dhabi and beyond, Boutik is an oasis of independent retailers, brand outlets, comfortable cafes and day-to-day services. 'For busy professionals living and working in the adjoining towers and for students at the Sorbonne, it is a welcome social centre and cornerstone of the community.'

"A Saudi female activist has been arrested after mounting a brave one-woman protest against the country's female driving ban. Loujain Hathloul, 25, from the country's capital of Riyadh, spent 24 hours at the border after she had her passport confiscated and was blocked from entering her own country - all because she got behind the wheel. This afternoon she was arrested and taken for interrogation at Hofuf prosecution office, in the desert kingdom. Scroll down for video . Loujain Hathloul, 25, has spent 24 hours at the border of Saudi Arabia as she tries to drive herself home . She started her journey from the United Arab Emirates, where she holds a driving licence and where it is legal for women to drive, and tried to cross its border into Saudi Arabia yesterday . The female activist has been tweeting regular updates from the border with pictures of her inside her car . The French literature graduate started her journey from the United Arab Emirates, where she holds a driving licence and where it is legal for women to drive, and tried to cross its border into Saudi Arabia yesterday. But border officials refused to let her cross and took away her passport. She spent a cold night sleeping in her car. This morning she was taken away be police and was held at Albatha port police station. She was arrested and is now being questioned at Hofuf prosecution office. She was brought supplies from Saudi journalist and presenter Maysaa Al Amoudi, who had her ID confiscated and is now also being questioned. Ms Hathloul's fiance Fahad Albutairi said he was heading to the police station where she is being held. He said: 'She is a smart woman. She is holding up very well, as is her companion. Hopefully things will be over very soon. 'I am heading over to see what happened although I am not sure I will be able to see her because of operation hours. 'When she left Abu Dhabi, she was prepared for all scenarios and for something like this to happen or more. 'She is a very smart, strong, intelligent woman and I know her for a fact to be a person who does not do anything without thinking it through thoroughly.' Ms Hathloul is protesting against the oppressive rule where woman are barred from driving in Saudi Arabia . Pride: Hathloul posted a picture of her United Arab Emirates driving licence earlier this year . Fame: At Abu Dhabi Film Festival in September this year, Hathloul announced her engagement to Saudi stand-up comedian Fahad Albutairi (pictured) Last night, Ms Hathloul tweeted regular updates from the border with pictures and a video of her driving to the border, which has already been watched by nearly 200,000 people. This is not the first time Ms Hathloul has stirred up controversy. Last year she posted videos online with her face and hair uncovered and poked fun at the conservative society in her native country. Those videos have been watched nearly 35 million times. Her brave actions have sparked a wave of protests across the country, where women in the country are not afforded the basic right of driving a car. Last night, women in the country came out in force and drove cars around Riyadh in a show of support for Ms Hathloul. They posted videos of themselves on YouTube driving while wearing the full face-covering niqab. Saudi Arabia is unique in being the only country in the world where women are forbidden to drive motor vehicles. Women have been barred from driving since the establishment of the state in 1932 and earlier this year, a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel. Protests and acts of defiance against the ban have grown in recent years, with women posting videos of them behind the wheel to social media. Ms Hathloul has been at the forefront of women's protests against the driving ban in the desert kingdom . Women in Saudi Arabia have begun to use social media to post videos of them driving in protest at the ban. There are reports that one woman was given 150 lashes for being caught behind the wheel . Dozens of women first defied the ban in Riyadh in 1990 but were arrested and had their passports confiscated. In 2007, Wajeha al-Huwaider, an activist and writer, and other women petitioned King Abdullah for women’s right to drive. A film of al-Huwaider, who is the co-founder of the Association for the Protection and Defence of Women’s Rights in Saudi Arabia, driving on International Women’s Day 2008 attracted international media attention. Then in 2011 a group of women, including Manal al-Sharif said a campaign called ‘Women2Drive’. A video was then uploaded up al-Huwaider filming al-Sharif driving a car. She was detained and released on the condition she would not speak with the media. Her actions led to a wave of people driving cars in the country during the summer of 2011. Manal al-Sharif filed charges against the decision to the reject her application for a driver's licence. Al-Sharif had applied for a licence in May 2011. The lawsuit was transferred to the Ministry of Interior. But in response, a member of the Consultative Assembly, submitted a report to the Assembly saying that lifting the ban would cause prostitution, pornography, homosexuality and divorce and the 'end of virginity'. Manal al-Sharif was named as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people for the year. In October 2013, there was a campaign calling for women to defy the ban in a protest drive. Four women successfully drove, defying the ban, despite warnings from police officers and ultraconservatives in the Arab state. The 'women to drive movement' is a long-standing campaign by women in Saudi Arabia to defy the ban. The most recent campaign was launched on October 26, 2013. On that day, 60 women took to the streets of Saudi Arabia driving cars and posting videos of themselves doing so online. They uploaded videos of them singing to Bob Marley's hit 'No Woman No Cry' with the words 'No Woman No Drive'. In response, the group's website was blocked within the country and one of Saudi Arabia's top clerics said women who drive risk damaging their ovaries and bearing children with clinical problems. Ms Hathloul was at the forefront of the October 26 2013 protest and her role was praised by fellow campaigners. Eman Al Nafjan said: 'When we at the October 26 campaign were looking for a celebrity [last year] to announce the campaign, we contacted people we knew were pro-women driving. 'They all refused because they feared they would lose followers, fans and might have trouble at their places of work or study. 'Then someone suggested Loujain…when we explained the campaign to her, she instantly and boldly agreed to announce it. 'She got everything from death threats and insults to false rumours of her arrest and ban from travel. 'Instead of backing down and staying in Canada where she was studying, Loujain booked a flight home to Riyadh and then drove herself from the airport while her father filmed her. 'It drove her opposers crazy - so crazy that the ministry of interior called her father in and made him sign a pledge not to allow her to drive again. 'Despite all of that, she still stands her ground…she really is like a breath of fresh cool air in this hot desert climate.' Journalists and campaigners tweeted messages of support for Ms Hathloul as she defied the driving ban . Glamorous Princess Ameerah told MailOnline that she thinks the  right for women to drive a car 'would happen very, very soon but nobody can anticipate when' Ameerah said: 'Saudi women are doing incredible things – we're making progress all the time' Last week, at the 5th Abu Dhabi Media Summit in the United Arab Emirates, Princess Ameerah, the former wife of a multi-billionaire Saudi Arabian royal, told MailOnline that she is very optimistic that women in the kingdom will win the basic right to drive. She said: I think it would happen very, very soon but nobody can anticipate when. 'I don't believe the ban will go on indefinitely. It will be like the decree calling for 20 per cent of Parliament to be made up of women – a surprising development, but one which happened very rapidly. 'I believe that it is the generation of young people in Saudi Arabia which is going to accelerate change in the country.'","Loujain Hathloul, 25, is trying to drive across the border into Saudi Arabia .

"A year ago, Amazon.com workers walked for miles scanning aisles in huge warehouses to pick up items ordered by online customers. But now 15,000 robots have taken over the tiring task to boost efficiency and give workers’ legs a break, by criss-crossing the floors of the firm’s largest warehouses to deliver heavy stacks of toys, books and other products to employees to pack. Amazon unveiled its next generation warehouse technology to coincide with Cyber Monday – which is typically the busiest day of the year for online shopping, with UK consumers expected to spend £600 million in 24 hours, which works out at £7,000 a second. Scroll down for video . Around 15,000 Kiva robot drive units (pictured) are working in 10 of Amazon's massive warehouses to boot efficiency. One of the squat robots is seen, foreground, before it moves under a stack of merchandise pods, seen on a tour of one of Amazon's newest distribution centres in Tracy, California . ‘We pick two to three times faster than we used to,’ 34-year-old Amazon worker Rejinaldo Rosales said during a short break from sorting merchandise into bins at Amazon's massive distribution centre in Tracy, California, about 60 miles east of San Francisco. ‘It's made the job a lot easier.’ The Seattle-based company now has 109 shipping centres around the globe, 10 of which – including Tracy – has robotic workers. The squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems in 2012, according to Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president for operations.

A Kiva robot is shown moving goods (left) and another robot unloading them (right) The squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems in 2012. They navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor, following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer. Each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that's four feet (1.2 metres) wide and holds up to 750 lbs (340kg) of merchandise. The system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf, so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in. Because the robots travel underneath, the shelves can be stacked closely together, which means the warehouse can hold more goods. The Tracy centre has 1.2 million square feet of space - the equivalent of 28 football fields – which are tended by 1,500 full-time employees and 3,000 Kiva robots, gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse.

The Tracy centre (pictured) has 1.2 million square feet of space - the equivalent of 28 football fields – which are tended by 1,500 full-time employees and 3,000 robots, gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse . Amazon is to run trials on drones that will deliver parcels by air at a testing facility in Cambridge. The company is advertising for a flight operations engineer who will test how the drones would work and ensure they are safe. The job advertisement says the engineer would operate as a safety observer for a service the company calls Prime Air flight, which would be an extension of its Prime delivery service. When Amazon first suggested the idea of using drones, rather than couriers or the postal system, to deliver purchases many people dismissed it as marketing hype. While the company has not discusseed the UK trials, it is also running tests on Prime Air drones in the US. The company said: ‘The goal of this new delivery system is to get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles. Putting Prime Air into service will take some time, but we will be ready as soon as the Federal Aviation Agency grants permission.’ ‘One day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today.’ Mr Clark said it can ship 700,000 items in a day, but will hold more and ship more by next year. The robots will cut the Tracy centre’s operating costs by 20 per cent, he said, before quickly adding that they won't eliminate human jobs. ‘Our focus is all about building automation that helps people do their jobs better,’ he said. Mr Clark explained that workers are needed for more complex tasks such as shelving, packing and checking for damaged items. The system takes the complexity of different tasks into account, rather than forcing employees to work at an inhuman pace, he said. Mr Rosales explained that the robots ‘actually adjust to your speed. If you're picking slower, they slow down.’ Amazon has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding its distribution network, adding new technology, opening more shipping centres and hiring 80,000 seasonal workers to meet the coming onslaught of Christmas shopping orders. The company said it processed orders for 36.8 million items on the Monday after Thanksgiving last year, and it's expecting today to be an even busier ‘Cyber Monday’ this year. Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said that one day Amazon orders will be delivered by drone, but the technology is not ready yet.

"Conservative plans to tackle the deficit without increasing taxes are 'complete and utter nonsense', Nick Clegg claimed today. The Deputy Prime Minister hit out at his coalition partners for insisting the nation's finances can be fixed through spending cuts alone. He accused the Tories of trying to balance the books 'on the backs of the working-age poor' ahead of George Osborne's Autumn Statement on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, at Stonehenge today, hit out at his coalition partners for insisting the nation's finances can be fixed by taking the axe to public spending and not by increasing some taxes . Ministers are braced for official figures showing a further deterioration in the public finances after sluggish earnings growth meant tax revenues came in lower than expected. Mr Clegg today insisted the deficit would be 'more or less' halved by the end of this parliament, despite having promised to eliminate it altogether when the coalition was formed in 2010. The Tories have committed to £7 billion in tax cuts - raising personal allowances for basic and higher-rate taxpayers - after the election. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned of a new round of austerity after the election, with some Whitehall departments set to lose around a third of their budgets. But Mr Clegg rejected the Tory approach to cutting the deficit without further tax rises: 'My view is what the Conservatives have said is a complete and utter nonsense. 'There is not a single developed economy anywhere in the world that has balanced the books and only done so on the backs of the working-age poor,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Labour has accused the Government of costing the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds in lost revenues through the 'abject failure' of its economic policies. Mr Clegg insisted the deficit was coming down, but accepted progress could be knocked off course by lower-than-expected tax receipts. 'We should be able to see the deficit more or less halved by the end of this parliament,' Mr Clegg said. 'What I accept, of course, is if tax receipts are not as buoyant as predicted, then of course that has an effect. Time will tell whether that is a semi-permanent effect or a temporary blip, but it means that it comes down a little less than originally projected.' Labour's Ed Balls and Chancellor George Osborne clashed yesterday over plans to tackle borrowing . He said the coalition had been flexible in its approach to eliminating the deficit, having originally hoped to balance the books by the election. Mr Clegg said: 'I think it is right that this Government hasn't been dogmatic about our deficit reduction plan. 'We have been firm, we have been consistent but when it became obvious ... that the structural deficit was not going to be eliminated by the end of this parliament, far from doing what some people urged me to do - which was to chase our tail, cut even more, implement even more stringent cuts - we said no, we are going to stick to the plan but we will accept that it will take a little longer and it will be three years into the next parliament before you wipe the slate clean and balance the books for future generations. 'I think that combination of pragmatism and consistency is the right approach to something as grave as the black hole in our public finances.' He said the Government was right to continue spending on policies to 'renew the economy', with further announcements on housing investment due to be set out by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander tomorrow. Labour leader Ed Miliband said millions of families had been left trapped in 'the most prolonged cost-of-living crisis for a century . Mr Clegg acknowledged that further austerity measures would be needed after the election, but rejected suggestions that cuts would have to be even deeper than in this parliament. 'Whoever is in power next year - whether it is Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour or any combination of those three - will have to make further substantial savings. 'There is a major difference of opinion between myself and the Conservatives about the role of taxation. The Conservatives, and George Osborne said this yesterday, they will only balance the books on the backs of the working-age poor. 'That is the only part of the population they will ask to make additional sacrifices. 'My party believes you have got to finish the job, but finish the job fairly.' He continued: 'We have made about £100 billion of savings during this parliament. We need to make additional savings, whether it's spending reductions or tax increases, in the next three years of the next parliament. 'But the total amount that will need to be done is substantially lower than what we have done during this parliament.' Mr Osborne acknowledged that he faces 'tough decisions' if he is to balance the books by 2018 as promised and he signalled a fresh squeeze on benefits if the Conservatives regain power in May. Labour said that ordinary families were paying the price for the Chancellor's failure to fulfil his promise at the last general election in 2010 to clear the deficit and start paying down Britain's debt by the end of the current parliament. The party said that figures calculated by the independent House of Commons Library showed that over the course of the current parliament, income tax receipts were £66 billion lower than originally forecast and national insurance contributions were down £25.5 billion, while social security spending is £25 billion higher than planned. It said the loss was the equivalent of almost £4,000 for every taxpayer - resulting in persistently higher borrowing than the Chancellor had forecast. Labour leader Ed Miliband said millions of families had been left trapped in 'the most prolonged cost-of-living crisis for a century'. 'For them, this is a joyless and payless recovery,' he said. 'The Government's failure to build a recovery that works for everyday people and tackle the cost-of-living crisis isn't just bad for every person affected, it also hampers our ability to pay down the deficit. 'Britain's public finances have been weakened by a Tory-led Government overseeing stagnant wages which keep tax revenues low. 'The result has been David Cameron and George Osborne missing every single target they set themselves on clearing the deficit and balancing the books by the end of this parliament.'","Lib Dem leader hits out at coalition partner's plans for dealing with deficit .

"City centres aren’t the most obviously place to go skiing. But for urban skiers Cam Riley and Clayton Villa, buildings, lamp posts and railings are more of a help than a hindrance.

"Released: Wilson was freed at Cardiff Crown Court today after serving 23 days of a 16-week jail sentence that was handed to her last month . A besotted nurse tricked a man into believing that he had fathered a child with her during a one-night stand. Charmaine Wilson, 25, borrowed a friend’s toddler who she passed off as her own. She used her hospital role to fake DNA test results and even forged a birth certificate to convince Liam Griffiths the boy was his. Mr Griffiths and his family lavished her and the child with gifts. He did not discover the deception until months later, when he posted pictures of himself with his ‘son’ on Facebook. But yesterday a judge took pity on Wilson, freeing her from a jail sentence imposed last month. Instead she was ordered to go on a ‘thinking skills’ course. Wilson and Mr Griffiths met on a drunken night out in 2012. They had sex but afterwards he said he did not want to see her again. Unwilling to accept this, she first lied to him that she had become pregnant but had had an abortion. Despite his refusal to maintain contact, Wilson persisted and Mr Griffiths eventually had to change his phone number and block her on social media. But in December last year, Mr Griffiths and his mother visited his dying grandfather at The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, where Wilson worked. She approached Mr Griffiths with the toddler in her arms and announced the boy was his. When he demanded proof, she faked a birth certificate and DNA test. Unaware of the deception, Mr Griffiths developed a deep emotional bond with the baby he believed was his. Wilson’s plot was so convincing that his family gave her and the child gifts – including a new car. Mr Griffiths, 31, had even planned to build a home in his parents’ garden to support Wilson and the boy. But he was left heartbroken when the nurse’s grand lie unravelled in May. A doting Mr Griffiths posted a picture of himself with the boy on Facebook, only for a relative of the two-year-old’s real parents to reveal the truth – that Wilson had been borrowing the baby from an unwitting friend. When she was arrested, Wilson told police: ‘It was a lie that snowballed out of control and I did not know how to stop it.’ Obsessed: Charmaine Wilson, 25, used a friend's baby to convince Liam Griffiths of her deception . Wilson was jailed for 16 weeks last month after admitting two counts of fraud realting to the birth certificate and DNA test. Her solicitor told Brigend magistrates that ‘she felt she had a connection with Mr Griffiths and wanted to be with him’. At the time Mr Griffiths said: ‘I am devastated and heartbroken to have lost a child that I thought was my son and had bonded with this child. Everything I see now reminds me of the child and what I have lost.’ His mother Catherine Thomas, 54, said: ‘I feel we have had a family bereavement having lost a child that I honestly thought was my grandson. I cannot think of words to say about how awful it is that a human being could deceive another in this way and cause the hurt and upset it has done to our family.’ Obsessed: Charmaine Wilson, 25, abused her position as a nurse to forge a birth certificate and DNA test . But after serving only 23 days in jail, Wilson won an appeal at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday to have her sentence reduced. Instead, Judge David Wynn Morgan sent her on a ‘thinking skills’ programme to help her realise how her appalling behaviour had affected Mr Griffiths and his family. He criticised Wilson’s ‘immature and self-centred attitude’, adding: ‘The discovery of the child’s real identity has left them with a feeling of loss similar to bereavement. ‘You failed to recognise the emotional impact of your forgery – your own hurt feelings took priority in your mind. After the totally wicked thing you have done, no one feels sorry for you.’ Judge Wynn Morgan replaced the 16-week jail term with a 32-week sentence suspended for two years, conditional on Wilson, who has been suspended from her job at the hospital, completing the victim awareness course. Heartbroken: Wilson, who pleaded guilty to two counts of forgery, said that her lie had snowballed out of control and that she didn't know how to stop it. She maintained the con for six months . Fling: Wilson first met Mr Griffiths on a night out in 2012 when the pair ended up having a one-night stand.

"Ashya King's father claims he was 'treated like a criminal' when he returned to Britain for the first time three months after fleeing the country with his cancer-stricken son. Brett King, who has been by Ashya's bedside while he receives proton beam therapy in the Czech capital Prague, said Border Force officials took his and his older son's passports at Gatwick Airport. They then made the pair wait in a holding area while they phoned other authorities and called in two uniformed police officers - who later decided to let the father and son go. Scroll down for video . 'Treated like a criminal': Ashya King's father Brett (pictured) was stopped by border agency staff at Gatwick Airport on Saturday as he attempted to return to the Britain for the first time since fleeing with his son . Argument: Footage of the encounter was posted on YouTube by Mr King's older son Naveed. He said both of their passports (bottom right) were confiscated by staff who called police before letting them walk on . Treatment: Ashya (pictured) has now returned to his parents' home in Spain and is said to be doing well . The incident was filmed on a smartphone on Saturday by Mr King's older son Naveed and uploaded to YouTube today. The two-and-a-half minute clip began with an angry Mr King, 51, sitting in a holding area at passport control. He told how he and Naveed had their passports seized when they arrived and were asked to wait in a holding area while police made 'phone calls and that sort of thing'. 'I was told that there would be no problem if I came back to England,' he told the camera. 'But already... I'm having problems.' When he was called to speak to two police officers, he told them: 'How would you feel, coming back into your own country and you are treated like a criminal? 'What have I done except help my son?' Giving up: Mr King, 51, tried to look at border force computer records on him before walking off to arrivals . Followed: Mr King headed for an escalator (left) where the officers told his son to stop filming them (right) A police officer told him he would not be arrested, but Mr King demanded to see what information was held about him on the Border Force computers. 'I'm not going to follow you, you'll have to arrest me,' he told the officer. 'I want to see what's on the computer screen first. I don't like to be treated like this in public'. 'You're not making demands', the police officer replied. 'It's not my computer system.' The father and son then walked off, continuing to film the two police officers as they ascended an escalator towards baggage reclaim. One of the two officers then asked: 'Can you put that away?' 'What's your name sorry?' asked Naveed. The police officer said again: 'Put your camera away.' Family: Mr King, 51, and his wife Naghmeh (right) sparked an international manhunt in August after removing Ashya (pictured) from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of medical staff . Mr King and his wife Naghmeh sparked an international manhunt when they removed five-year-old Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent. Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly five-year-old in their care. Police traced the couple to Malaga and arrested Mr and Mrs King, holding them in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities. Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days. Then, in a dramatic turnaround amid a national outcry, the parents were told they would not face charges. Brave: Ashya King pictured at the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech capital Prague at the end of October . Their son was taken for 30 rounds of experimental treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and is now recuperating with the family in Spain. Two weeks ago Mrs King said said her son was 'improving every day'. She told ITV: 'He’s so much, so much better now and we’re really happy with him, the fact that he’s saying a few words as well.' A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Two uniformed constables who were on routine patrol in the airside area were called by the UK Border Agency to advise on an issue relating to a passport held by an arriving passenger in immigration arrivals on Saturday 29 November. 'When the officers arrived they quickly confirmed to border staff that police had no interest in the matter. One of the officers spoke briefly to [Mr King] and he walked through to landside. 'The officers made it clear to the man that they did not intend to arrest him. We have received no complaint about the actions of the police, and media enquiries about the reason why border force called police will need to be made to the Home Office.'

"A New York man who spent years caring for his ailing 88-year-old mother before strangling her with a necktie while she slept — and later tried to kill himself — was sentenced on Monday to 17 years to life in prison. James Olsen, 60, was sentenced in a Long Island courtroom for the 2011 killing of his mother, Ruth, who suffered from several illnesses, including dementia. 'This tragedy isn't over Mr. Olsen, but I hope that you find some peace,' Nassau County Court Judge Angelo Delligatti said after imposing the sentence. Law enforcement officers escort James Olsen, center, into Nassau County Court in Mineola, N.Y., Monday, Dec. 1, 2014. Olsen was sentenced to 17 years to life in prison for the 2011 strangulation of his mother. (AP Photo/Frank Eltman) Olsen did not speak during the hearing and declined to comment to reporters while leaving the courtroom. Prosecutors said Olsen methodically planned the crime in their comfortable Garden City home, even picking out the necktie the night before she was killed. A jury in May rejected an insanity defense and convicted Olsen of second-degree murder. Defense attorney Paul Delle said he plans to appeal. The judge on Monday denied a defense motion to set aside the verdict. Delle said his client had been hearing voices for several weeks before the killing telling him to commit suicide. He said his client had spent years caring for the elderly woman and thought he had to kill her first because he perceived there would be no one to care for her after he died. Delle previously said his client 'lacked the capacity to appreciate his conduct.' Home: This is the Garden City home that James Olsen shared with his mother Ruth before her death in 2011 . After killing his mother, Olsen attempted suicide before calling 911, authorities said. A recording of the call was played for jurors. 'I'm just crazy. I have to be crazy,' Olsen told an operator. Ruth Olsen was found in her bedroom, with the tie still around her neck, prosecutors said. James Olsen, who was unemployed at the time, was found in another bedroom with self-inflicted slash wounds to his neck and wrists. Delle said because he has filed an appeal, he asked relatives of his client to not attend the sentencing. After the guilty verdict was announced in May, Olsen's brother, Steve, said their mother would have been 'horrified' by the jury's decision. 'I believe my mother forgave him as it was happening,' he said.

"A record number of people used their mobile phones and tablets to shop for Christmas gifts on Cyber Monday yesterday. More than one third of purchases - 37 per cent – are expected to have been via smartphones or tablets as people browsed at the breakfast table, as they travelled to work, or enjoyed a lunchtime sandwich. This represents an increase of some 4,000 per cent in terms of market share compared to 2010, according to the web retail trade body, IMRG. The group said some £25.1billion was spent online during August to October, with £9.3bn spent via smartphones and tablets. And this pattern is predicted to continue through to Christmas. More than one third of purchases are expected to have been via smartphones or tablets on Cyber Monday. This represents an increase of some 4,000 per cent in terms of market share compared to 2010 . Total online spending over the weekend, taking in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, is expected to top £1.32billion, according to industry analysts. IMRG’s Tina Spooner said: ‘Mobile continues to take a larger slice of the UK online retail market. Sales via smartphones and tablets have recorded almost 50per cent year-on-year growth during 2014.’ Adgild Hop (correct), of webtech experts Capgemini, added: ‘We can see just how much influence smartphones and tablets now have on our shopping behaviour. It’s convenient, it’s quicker and with the ability to easily browse between retailers, it can also be cheaper.’ Some 25 million are believed to have logged on to websites in search of festive bargains on Cyber Monday with spending predicted to hit £650million – up 26per cent on the same day last year. The promise of big price cuts over the weekend, both in the high street and online, triggered a collective frenzy, with some people fighting over flat screen TVs and coffee machines. While, it is clear that many shoppers were excited by the price cuts, the pressure will now be on retailers to maintain the promotions all the way through to Christmas. Industry figures measuring shopper numbers show there were more people in the high street on Black Friday, however numbers then fell away. Experts at Springboard said there were 7.2per cent more people in the high street on Friday compared to last year, however the figure was down by 8.8per cent on Saturday and 0.1per cent on Sunday. By contrast, figures in the big retail parks were up on all three days. Springboard’s Diane Wehrle (correct) said: ‘With the Christmas season in full flow following the last payday weekend, shoppers were definitely ready to spend this weekend. ‘The sheer scale of the discounts that were available on big ticket electrical items inevitably meant that out of town retail locations where the best offers could be found were favoured as opposed to the high street.’ Retail analyst, Natalie Berg, said stores are creating a rod for their own back with their price cuts. She said: ‘This is probably going to pull forward spending, and retailers are going to find the first half of December slower too as a result. ‘Once this extended weekend is over, it will be very hard to persuade shoppers to pay full-price for anything, after they have seen the extent to which retailers are prepared to cut prices to get people to spend money.’ Amazon.co.uk held hundreds of limited ‘lightning deals’ which offer discounts for a specific period in an attempt to maintain the hype. Last year’s Cyber Monday was Amazon UK’s busiest day of sales ever, with more than 4.1 million items ordered at a rate of around 47 per second, with sales peaking at 9.22pm. Sage Pay, which monitors online payments, said it expected purchases to peak at noon. Chief executive Simon Black said: ‘With just four weeks until Christmas, Cyber Monday is traditionally the day when consumers rush online to do their festive shopping.’ Retail experts Mintel are predicting a three per cent increase in spending this December compared to a year ago – taking the total to some £36.5billion. Its researchers forecast that nearly 13per cent of all retail sales will involve a mouse rather than a till, with £4.7bn spent online this month.","Figures show increase of some 4,000 per cent compared to 2010 .

"Freddy, Sina, Finn, Morta Boy, Tinkerbell, Silly Billy, Annie, Gregory, Mama, Barbie, Kim, Pappa, Don, Derrik, Tess and Long Grass, who's always outside – these are just a handful of Gloria Morales' 30-odd dogs. The Chilean-born migrant who moved to the remote Aboriginal community of Yuendumu in Central Australia 10 years ago, is one of the 85 women that feature in photographer David Darcy's new book, A Girl's Best Friend. The 42-year-old photographer from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, whose favourite sight is the face of dog hanging out of a car window, told Daily Mail Australia that he spent half a year travelling around the country to document the stories and happy moments between women and their dogs for his new book. Scroll down for video . Gloria Morales currently lives with about 32 dogs in her outback home in the remote Aboriginal community of Yuendumu in Central Australia . The Chilean-born migrant has dedicated her life to saving the seven hundred or so stray dogs in the area by implementing health programs and educating locals on how best to deal with the problem while maintaining respect for the animals . 'There are about 85 women in the book from all walks of life - some of them are living on the streets, some of them are millionaires and celebrities as well,' he said. Amongst them is Christine, from Alice Springs, who adopted her dog Bill after finding him  abandoned and stranded in the flood waters following Hurricane Katrina in the United States. 'He was using this car as like an island, but because of the heat at the time, all his feet had become blistered from the roof and Christine found him over there and brought him all the way back to Australia,' Mr Darcy said. Meanwhile Linda, who lives in Penrith with her beagle, Sam, spent over $50,000 to save her dog's life from numerous health conditions including lymphoma and epilepsy. She’s one of the 85 women and their dogs, from all walks of life, whose stories feature in photographer David Darcy's new book, A Girl's Best Friend . Christine, from Alice Springs, adopted Bill after finding him abandoned and stranded on the roof of a car with blistered feet amongst the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina, bringing him back with her from the US . But it's Gloria, with her Land Cruiser over-flowing with canines, that has dedicated her whole life to saving the seven hundred or so stray dogs in her local community. She has dedicated her time to implementing health programs and educating locals on how best to deal with the strays, while maintaining respect for the animals. 'Ten years ago I arrived here in Yuendumu to work as the assistant art manager, and I discovered that the dogs in the community were in really bad condition. There was no vet coming here, no animal welfare people,' Gloria told Darcey. 'Most people in the community didn't realise that if you had a sick dog, you could do something about it—like if you take medication for yourself you're going to get better. If you do it for the dogs, they are going to get better also.' Linda, who lives in Penrith with her Beagle Sam, spent over $50,000 to save her dog's life from numerous health conditions including lymphoma and epilepsy . Camille adopted Bella when she was still a veterinary student. 'Bella's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that Camille can't fix; she's learnt all the skills in the world but she can’t save this dog from her heart condition,' Mr Darcy said . Gloria began by feeding the dogs with her own money and eventually, after holding talks with the local council, managed to arrange for a vet to come out to the remote town to help manage simple health problems like ticks, start a temporary sterilisation solution and offer the option of euthanasia. 'Many of the dogs were unwanted, but it was very difficult for the people to say that because the police would come round and shoot the unwanted dogs,' Gloria said. 'The locals didn't want to see the dogs shot, so the vet showed them how she could put them to sleep in a very comfortable manner, without any screaming, fighting or bloodshed. Margaret and her greyhound Gertie on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula – Gertie saved Margaret from an intruder entering her home . Karen is the president of the Shenton Park Dogs' Refuge Home in Perth. She credits her beautiful Pitbull Homer (right) as the instigation for getting involved in the shelter in the first place . 'When the community saw this option they surrendered 174 dogs for euthanasia. It was very sad, but it was also amazing because these people were being educated and were able to manage an animal health problem for the first time.' Gloria was also responsible for the adoption of over 250 dogs that were sent out to various new homes across the country through the Desert Dogs program. 'When I arrived here, people told me that these Aboriginals don't care about the dogs. That was bulls***!' Gloria said. She recalled unforgettable moments of compassion from the locals, including one family who waited until their dog was under anaesthetic and unable to hear them during its sterilisation, before admitting they didn't want to keep him. Three-legged Lester, the jack russell cross fox terrier, was lucky enough to find a home with former athlete Giaan after having his leg amputated following an accident with a bike . Hannah met Axel after moving from Sydney’s northern beaches to Alice Springs, where she turned her life around by beginning work on a camel farm and forming a relationship with a camel stockman . 'That showed me that they really did respect the dogs, because they didn't want the dog to know it wasn't wanted,' Gloria said. She also remembered an Aboriginal family that had dug a specific grave for their dog, which had passed away, so that his head would be pointing towards his home, and held hands to pray following his burial. But it's her own dog family that makes Gloria love her life. 'Over the ten years I've been here, I've probably had more than 1000 dogs living here. At the moment I have 32 dogs. They are all different and they all have their quirky behaviours.' David Darcy and his own loved pets: A Girl's Best Friend is the photographer’s fifth book entirely dedicated to dogs . 'People always ask if I have a favourite, but I love them all. Some people might look at me and think I'm crazy, because the situation might look overwhelming…, but the other day I was thinking just how lucky I am to have all these dogs. I really love my life.' One of the most memorable characters Mr Darcy met on his travels, was Camille and her dog Bella. The duo met while Camille was a vet student, practising operations on dogs that had to be euthanised. But the bond between Camille and Bella became too strong, and the student felt compelled to save her life and adopt her. Years later, with the growth of her own veterinary business, Camille is coming to terms with letting Bella go. 'She's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that Camille can't fix; she's learnt all the skills in the world, but she can't save this dog from her heart condition,' Mr Darcy said of the heart-wrenching duo. 'For me it's about those little moments – I see a lot of photos of dogs that are staged, but if you are a dog lover, you know and understand them and that little moment of interaction, when the dog is doing something beautiful and you get joy from it, that gives me a great happiness.

"Hundreds of stroke patients die each year due to a lack of doctors and nurses at weekends. Patients are a third more likely to die if admitted to units which are poorly staffed on Saturday mornings, a study found. The few doctors who do work weekends are ‘firefighting’ in A&E, leaving stroke patients at risk of being neglected, researchers said. Stroke patients are a third more likely to die if admitted to units which are badly staffed on Saturday mornings . Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, is leading a major review of how hospitals can encourage senior staff to work at weekends. It follows a series of studies suggesting that patients admitted on a Saturday or Sunday are up to 16 per cent more likely to die. But the doctors’ union, the British Medical Association, has described the plans as ‘unworkable’ as the NHS cannot afford to employ more senior staff at weekends. Research led by Professor Anthony Rudd, a stroke consultant at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, looked at 56,666 patients admitted to 103 hospital stroke units in England from 2011 to 2012. Because so few specialist stroke doctors work at weekends the researchers looked at the number of nurses on wards at 10am on a Saturday. They found the chances of stroke victims dying within 30 days of being admitted on a Saturday were a third higher on wards where there were an average of three nurses for every 20 beds compared to those with three nurses to 10 beds. The few doctors who work weekends are ‘firefighting’ in A&E, and stroke patients at risk of being neglected . NHS guidelines state there should be at least three nurses for every ten patients on a stroke unit at all times. But figures show that only 27 per cent of the 183 NHS hospitals with stroke units have at least three nurses for ten patients at weekends. Professor Rudd said: ‘Even really big hospitals have very few staff at nights and weekends and most of those are going to be firefighting admissions down in the emergency department. ‘Patients sitting on a ward – there’s less observation 20 or 30 years ago when every ward would have had their own doctors on 24 hours a day. ‘When I was training, whether you were doing urology (kidneys and bladder) or neurology (the brain), every team would have had their rota. That’s all gone now. ‘In that situation, we are very dependent on skilled nurses to recognise when someone might be on the brink of developing a chest infection or a blood clot on the lungs or any other complication that can happen with stroke. ‘If those conditions do get picked up early, they are much more effectively treated. ‘Nursing levels can make a big difference to whether or not you survive after a stroke.’ Around 125,000 patients suffer a stroke in England every year and they cause 40,000 deaths . The study – published in the journal PLOS One - did not calculate exactly how many of these can be directly blamed on a lack of weekend staff. Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, is leading a major review of how hospitals can encourage senior staff to work at weekends . The study found that the risk of patients dying within 30 days on units which did have three nurses for every ten patients was 11.2 per cent. But this rose to 15.2 per cent on units which had half the safe level of nurses – three for every 20 beds. Jon Barrick, Chief Executive of the Stroke Association said: ‘Stroke is an emergency and it can happen at any time. Patients should receive specialist care around the clock and a lack of staff will mean they will suffer unnecessarily. ‘There is a considerable body of evidence showing the level of care you receive in the first few hours after your stroke, as well as in the longer-term, can make a big difference to your recovery.’ Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘It’s unacceptable that so many hospitals are still failing to make sure they have enough nurses on duty to care for stroke patients. ‘If a hospital has enough nurses in place, stroke patients are more likely to survive and to recover.’","Major review into how to encourage staff to work weekends is underway .

"Furious St Louis cops have demanded that NFL players who made the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture in solidarity with Ferguson protesters are punished by their superiors. Officials from the St Louis County Police Association - the police union for the area including Ferguson - said that it was 'profoundly disappointed' in the five players who made the gesture. Officers released an angry statement saying the players 'ignored mountains of evidence' vindicating Darren Wilson over the shooting of 18-year-old Micheal Brown, for which a grand jury recently declined to indict him. Scroll down for the full statement . Solidarity: St. Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Bailey (12), wide receiver Tavon Austin (11), tight end Jared Cook (89), wide receiver Chris Givens (13) and wide receiver Kenny Britt (81) put their hands up to show support for Michael Brown before Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders at the Edward Jones Dome . The statement, given to the KSDK TV station, described the gesture, which protesters have adopted across the nation, as: 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory'. It is a reference to witness accounts of the shooting, some of which claim Brown was raising his hands in surrender when he was shot 12 times by Wilson. The accounts have been disputed. Attack: The police association, whose president Gabe Crocker is pictured above, said the gesture was 'unthinkable' from a hometown team . One member of the association was quoted saying: 'It is unthinkable that hometown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over-and-over again.' The gesture was made by five members of the team: wide receiver Stedman Bailey, wide receiver Tavon Austin, tight end Jared Cook, wide receiver Chris Givens and wide receiver Kenny Britt. The statement went on: 'All week long, the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted, looted, and burned buildings in Ferguson. '...As the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer, that is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance. The lengthy message concluded by saying: 'The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology' and threatening to rally police in their condemnation of the team. A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders. Symbolic: The gesture also made another appearance after the Rams' Tre Mason, left, scored a touchdown and was congratulated by Kenny Britt . Tensions still high: Police and Missouri National guard stand outside the Edward Jones Dome before the start of Sunday's game between the St. Louis Rams and the Oakland Raiders . Injustice? St. Louis Rams wide receiver Tavon Austin (11) puts his hands up to show support for Michael Brown before a game against the Oakland Raiders . Flare-up: Police arrest a protester in St. Louis following an NFL football game between the St. Louis Rams and the Oakland Raiders on Sunday as protests continued following a grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson . Dragged away: The female protester is removed from the scene by police offers before the St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders played on Sunday . The St. Louis Police Officers Association is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive and inflammatory. Five members of the Rams entered the field today exhibiting the 'hands-up-don't-shoot' pose that has been adopted by protestors [sic] who accused Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson of murdering Michael Brown. The gesture has become synonymous with assertions that Michael Brown was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when Wilson, according to some now-discredited witnesses, gunned him down in cold blood. SLPOA Business Manager Jeff Roorda said, ""now that the evidence is in and Officer Wilson's account has been verified by physical and ballistic evidence as well as eye-witness testimony, which led the grand jury to conclude that no probable cause existed that Wilson engaged in any wrongdoing, it is unthinkable that hometown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over-and-over [sic] again."" Roorda was incensed that the Rams and the NFL would tolerate such behavior and called it remarkably hypocritical. 'All week long, the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted, looted, and burned buildings in Ferguson. 'Our officers have been working 12 hour shifts for over a week, they had days off including Thanksgiving cancelled so that they could defend this community from those on the streets that perpetuate this myth that Michael Brown was executed by a brother police officer and then, as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer, that is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance,' Roorda said. The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology. Roorda said he planned to speak to the NFL and the Rams to voice his organization's displeasure tomorrow. He also plans to reach out to other police organizations in St. Louis and around the country to enlist their input on what the appropriate response from law enforcement should be. Roorda warned, 'I know that there are those that will say that these players are simply exercising their First Amendment rights. Well I've got news for people who think that way, cops have first amendment rights too, and we plan to exercise ours. 'I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play. 'If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters.' Detained and cuffed: Police arrest protest organizer Derrick Robinson as demonstrations against the failure to indict Officer Darren Wilson continued in St. Louis . Help: A clergy member assists a protester as he is arrested and left on the ground near to the St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders game on Sunday . Protests inside: Ferguson protesters also made their feelings known in a Walmart in St Louis County . What's in store: Protesters inside marched under the flags of Missouri and the United States as they were addressed at a gathering . Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium. Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens - all of whom are black - then came out and stood together with arms raised. After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together. There was disruption around the country from other Ferguson protests today as well, after a group of demonstrators blocked off the I-395 highway in Washington, D.C., Sunday afternoon. A human chain blocked the road in both directions for about 40 minutes, according to the Washington Post. Calls for justice continued to be made from the Missouri town itself today, as Rev. Al Sharpton gave a service at the Flood Christian Church, of which Brown's father, Michael Brown Snr, is a member. Blockade: Protesters in Washington, D.C., held up traffic on the I-395 for around 40 minutes . Speech: Civil rights activist Sharpton spoke at a church in Ferguson today in support of the protests .

Protest: St. Louis Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt (81) puts his hands up to show support for Michael Brown before a game against the Oakland Raiders at the Edward Jones Dome . Activism: Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance . There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since Monday’s grand jury verdict. Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance. Protesters chanted ‘Hands up, don't shoot!’ ‘No Justice, No Football!’ ‘This is what Democracy looks like,’ and ‘We're here for Mike Brown.’ The Rams had additional security measures in place for the game, including armed personnel from the National Guard. The team has wanded fans outside entrances all season. Earlier in the week there had been reports that the game might be moved because of the protests. In the end, the game remained in St. Louis giving the Rams the opportunity to show a sign of solidarity to the hometown crowd.

Ms Boyd was flown from Wellington to Christchurch Hospital where she spent a week in ICU. She is now recuperating in a rehabilitation centre in Christchurch. A fundraising page set up by Ms Boy'd friend Nikki Farrell says the young mother is working hard to get the movement back in her body. Former captain of the New Zealand women's under-19 volleyball team, Teina Boyd, was celebrating Labour weekend with friends, when she dived onto her bed and broke the C5 vertebrae in her neck . So far the page has raised $9,882.00 NZD, which will go towards Ms Boyd's rehabilitation and to ensure Ms Boyd can spend time with her 4-year-old son, who is currently with his father in Auckland. 'At the moment she can move her arms and her head,' she said. 'You will all be pleased to hear that her sense of humour and positive nature is still present!' 'You all know her as an outgoing, bubbly, enthusiastic, incredible friend and mother so help us show how much we care for her by donating to this page,' she said.

"David Barrow has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for repeatedly stabbing Jason Earle in Bristol, who was having an affair with his wife of 19 years . A jilted husband repeatedly stabbed his wife's lover in front of crowds in a shopping centre after she told him his love rival was better in the bedroom. David Barrow, 46, had followed Nicolette Barrow, his wife of 19 years, to a secret rendez-vous with her lover Jason Earle at a shopping centre in Bristol. He confronted the pair and was about to walk away when Mrs Barrow said 'He's better in bed that you, deal with it.' Barrow then repeatedly stabbed Mr Earle, causing damage to his liver. Onlookers at the busy shopping centre in Cribbs Causeway said Barrow appeared to be punching Mr Earle and to have forgotten he had the knife in his hand. After the attack he was seen repeatedly headbutting a wall. At a hearing at Bristol Crown Court, Barrow, who has two teenage children with his wife, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The court heard the Barrows had been married for 19 years when Mrs Barrow, 43, met Mr Earle over the internet and the pair started an affair. They met in secret, sometimes even at the family home in Patchway in Bristol. Peter Coombe, prosecuting, said on one occasion the Barrows, Mr Earle and his wife met at Strensham services on the M5 in Worcestershire to discuss what had been going on. During this meeting Barrow said to Mr Earle: 'It's a good job this wasn't two hours ago. 'I would be banged up by now because I had a knife. 'If I found you in my house you'd have been dead. I know everything about you. I know where you live.' The Barrows decided to go to marriage counselling and Mrs Barrow agreed not to see Mr Earle while she and her husband tried to repair their marriage. But the affair continued. Barrow found out and bought a satnav and block of knives as he planned to warn off his wife's lover. He hired a car and on July 12 drove to Mr Earle's home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to confront him. Barrow lunged at Mr Earle in The Mall shopping Centre in Bristol in July when it was busy with shoppers . But he changed his mind on the way and began to make his way back to Bristol, the court heard. As he drove home along M5 he saw Mr Earle's van overtake him and he decided to change course again and follow him. Barrow called his wife to ask where she was and found he was at The Mall shopping centre at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol  - where Mr Earle was also heading. When the trio arrived at the busy shopping centre Barrow confronted Mr Earle who admitted he was meeting Mrs Barrow. Barrow phoned his wife and she joined the two men before they each 'exchanged words'. He was just about to walk away when his wife insulted his prowess in the bedroom and he attacked Mr Earle. At a hearing at Bristol Crown Court Barrow admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . Barrow lunged at his wife's lover outside a Marks and Spencer store and plunged the knife into him. Some of the wounds were so deep his liver was injured and blood was found in his lungs. Mr Earle was given life-saving treatment by a number of firefighters who were doing a charity event at the shopping centre before police and paramedics arrived. Ian Kelcey, mitigating, said: 'This is a truly tragic case. 'Clearly this was an act completely out of character for this man, a man with no previous convictions who had led a blameless life. 'He had been a hard worker within a major institution within this city, where he had been positively vetted to a high degree. 'He was a family man, dedicated to his children and his wife. He had been told a tissue of lies. He was desperate to save his marriage and his family life with his children.' Mr Kelcey added: 'This [the comment about his bedroom prowess] really was what broke this man on that fateful Saturday morning. 'He has lost everything that he strived for throughout the years. In short, he is a broken man who appears before you today.' As well as the prison sentence, a three-year restraining order was imposed.","David Barrow and wife Nicolette were married 19 years when she had affair .

"Afghan police  shot dead a bird which had been equipped by the Taliban with an explosive pouch, GPS tracker and detonator. Alert officers spotted the suspicious bird in the Faryab province in the north of the country, near the border with Turkmenistan. The bird had several wires protruding from its feathers, a mobile phone detonator and a specially designed 'suicide vest'. Scroll down for video . Afghan police shot dead the suspicious-looking large bird, pictured, in the north of the country . After killing the bird, soldiers found what appeared to be a GPS transmitter, pictured, . Afghan soliders claimed the bird was also carrying an explosive device when it was shot . Police were also suspicious about the large bird, because it was not native to the area. Major General Abdul Nabi Ilham told NBC News that the bird exploded when it was shot and 'suspicious metal stuff' was scattered around. Ilham added; 'We are gathering all the stuff, but found parts of what looks to be GPS and a small camera.' The success in Faryab Province comes as the Afghan district police chief in Helmand Province, Ahmadullah Anwari, complained that his officers are suffering from major weapon and equipment shortages. Anwari said despite his officers facing constant attacks from Taliban insurgents, he can only supply each checkpoint in his district with just three hand grenades. He said: 'Sometimes up to 200 Taliban attack our checkpoints and if there are no army reinforcements, we lose the fight . 'It shames me to say that we don't have enough weapons and equipment. But this is a bitter reality.' As most foreign combat troops prepare to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 after 13 years of war, the experiences of Anwari and other police chiefs and army commanders across the country are NATO's biggest worry. One of the electric components found strapped to the dead bird was from Uzbekistan . Afghan police found the suspected bomb after they shot the suspicious-looking bird dead . The United States, which provides the bulk of NATO troops in Afghanistan, has poured some $61 billion into training a 350,000-strong security force. U.S. and Afghan commanders have praised the bravery and effectiveness of local soldiers, police and others in the face of a Taliban onslaught that has killed more than 4,600 Afghan security force members already this year. When insurgents attacked a foreign guest house in central Kabul last Thursday, Afghan commandos killed the attackers, but international helicopters and special forces helped in the mop-up operation that lasted hours. Taliban fighters also entered Camp Bastion, a large base in the southern Helmand province handed over to Afghan troops a month ago by withdrawing U.S. and British forces. It took Afghan soldiers three days to drive the insurgents out. The Taliban launched a suicide bomb attack on a compound used by the US-based charity PAD, pictured . Well-equipped members of the Afghan National Army, pictured, have been training in Kabul . However, local police chiefs complain that their men are being starved of equipment and weapons . In the capital Kabul, the local police chief resigned yesterday after  Taliban gunmen killed three members of a South African family in the capital. The guest house attacked by the Taliban in Kabul on Saturday - the third attack on a foreign guest house in 10 days - was home to staff of the U.S.-based charity Partnership in Academics and Development (PAD). PAD said on its website that three people were killed by insurgents who used guns and explosives. They were identified as members of the same South African family - a father and his two teenage children - by a colleague of the mother, who was not in the compound at the time. The family had lived in Afghanistan for nearly 12 years, with the father running the charity and the mother working as a doctor at a Kabul clinic, the colleague said. NATO troops are due to pull out of Afghanistan by the end of December leaving the Afghan National Army with responsibility for the country's security, although limited NATO air support will be made available . The Taliban said on Saturday they had attacked the foreign guesthouse because they believed it to be a Christian centre. This was the second time this year the Taliban targeted a group that it said had links to Christianity. Violence across Afghanistan has surged this year as the Taliban and their allies have stepped up their activities ahead of the scheduled withdrawal of most international troops by the end of next month. Over the past 10 days, three compounds used by foreign organisations have been hit by armed attackers. In separate attacks in Kabul, two American soldiers, two British embassy workers and dozens of Afghan civilians have died.","Afghan police have shot dead a large bird carrying a suspected bomb .

"It's like a scene from a movie. This classic log cabin could easily be crowned the best in the world as it looks like something straight from a nostalgic family film. The traditional wooden hut ticks all the boxes with its quaint characteristics and idyllic surroundings, cloaked in a glowing magical mist. The idyllic Headwaters Camp Guest Cabin looks as though it belongs in a nostalgic family film . Designed by architect Daniel Turvey, the wooden hut is a five-bedroom dwelling with traditional interiors . The Headwaters Camp Guest Cabin's natural features include a stair bannister created from elk horns, furniture crafted from locally-sourced wood, and beams made from entire timber logs. And in a stark visual contrast to the traditional interior, a pool table sits proud of place in the cabin's living area, bringing a touch of the modern world. The hidden gem in the Yellowstone Park in Big Sky, Montana, US, is a five-bedroom yesteryear dwelling, which gives guests the opportunity to relax among exquisite surroundings, deep within the Madison Mountain Range. The premium cabins at Headwater from from $270 (£171) a night and are the perfect spot to get away from it all. Decor accents have been crafted from elk horns and furniture was built from locally sourced wood . The fully-insulated cabin, which has a floor space of 1800 square feet, has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open kitchen and dining area as well as a coat and boat room for coming in from the great outdoors. Inside, the walls disappear seamlessly into a structure that appears to be built 100 years earlier, with reclaimed finishes of dove-tailed timber planks and dry stacked stone - completed by talent sourced from artisans and craftsman who live throughout the region. Four ponds each connected by man-made streams, accommodate heat exchange plates that serve the heating of the cabin, while Lone Mountain looms overhead, sheltering those inside from visual and weather extremes. The 1800 square foot home is the perfect for any season - from a festive holiday house to a summer getaway . 'Really what makes this project so special was the commitment on behalf of all the parties to push Headwaters Camp to a level that currently has no equal,' architect Daniel Turvey wrote on his website. 'In the big picture of things, the end product is a reflection of an owner’s exceptional vision and directive.' The low-energy design has resulted in a unique, sustainable and one-of-a-kind LEED Platinum dwelling - the third home in the State to receive any form of certification. The guest cabin has won an array of awards, including Mountain Livings 'Most Responsible Project of the Year' award in 12 US states, Respect for Cultural Heritage, Utilization of Historic Architecture, Natural Beauty and the incorporation of Sustainable Design Principals.","Architect Daniel Turvey designed the traditional, yet low-energy home .

"The mother of a four-year-old boy struck by a car on a family holiday said she was forced to sit in the middle of the road nursing her dead son while paramedics 'looked the other way'. Thomas McLaughlin died after he was hit by a car  as it reversed out of a driveway at McMasters Beach on the NSW Central Coast on January 6. At an inquest on Monday into Thomas' death, his mother Michelle, a registered nurse, said the day she lost her middle child was 'crystal clear', the Daily Telegraph reports. Scroll down for video . Thomas McLaughlin died after he was hit by a car as it reversed out of a driveway at McMasters Beach on the NSW Central Coast on January 6 . Family: Thomas with his father David, mother Michelle and siblings Hugh and Sopie . 'I sat in the middle of the road with a dead child (and they were) watching me,' she said. 'Every time I looked up, they looked away. No one came over to me on the roadway.' Police say Thomas ran from behind a parked car and into the path of the four-wheel drive driven by a 64-year-old woman in front of his family's holiday rental property. He was getting ready to go for a swim while on holidays with his family when the accident unfolded. The inquest heard the driver 'didn't have time to react' and his death appeared to be 'an extremely tragic accident'. Thomas' parents, Michelle and David, have set up a road safety foundation in their son's name titled the Little Blue Dinosaur. They are currently championing the review of road safety within holiday town where infrastructure doesn't cater for tourist spikes. The foundation also hopes to introduce safety improvements to holiday town roadways. The inquest into Thomas' death continues. For more information, visit the Little Blue Dinosaur Facebook page.

"It might not look like your standard hotel, but this 18 square metre (194 square feet) container has everything that a guest would want. There is a double bed, a sitting area, a bathroom with shower, a veranda and even breakfast served in the morning. What it not normal, however, is that it is moveable. Hotel chain, Scandic, has just introduced their portable hotel room: the Scandic 'To Go' The moveable hotel room was first launched in June 2014 and has visited locations all over Scandinavia . The portable hotel is the latest marketing gimmick by Swedish hotel chain, Scandic. Scandic 'To Go' was launched in June 2014 and has so far visited locations all over Scandinavia. It has stood in central Stockholm, in Trondheim in central Norway, on a beach in Southern Sweden and by a lake in Finland. Today it's being positioned onto a marina in Djurgarden, a leafy green island in central Stockholm. The sheer logistics of putting the container in place does limit location options somewhat. Scandic says guests' preferred spot has to be accessible by road or by boat - and of course be big enough to accommodate the room. So a request for the top of a high mountain is unlikely to be approved. Potential guests can request where they would like the hotel to be set up, but certain locations may not be possible . So far, the hotel has stood in central Stockholm, in Trondheim in central Norway and on a beach in Finland . Eva Zall, a 33-year-old property developer, applied to stay in the hotel several months ago. In her application she said that she would be happy with any central Stockholm location. Scandic then found the Djurgarden location and asked whether she was happy to spend a night there. Keen to have a night away from the children with her husband she agreed. The room costs 2500 kronor per night (£220), which places it in the middle to high end price range of Stockholm hotel rooms. But Zall says the view of central Stockholm and the waterfront from the veranda is priceless. 'I don't think you will get this view in any other hotel room. It is really a once in a lifetime opportunity.' After looking through the container she says she is also impressed by how the room looks. The room itself costs about USD $347 or £220, putting it on the higher side of hotel prices in Sweden . Room with a view! There is a sitting area, a bathroom with shower, and even a veranda to enjoy . 'First I had a look at the back before coming around to check it out. And it exceeds all expectations.' The container has a water tank and a sewage tank. In most locations Scandic plugs it in to a local electricity source, but for remote locations there is a generator that can be used. 'This is really a combination of two trends that we have seen developing,' says Johan Michelson, Scandic Vice President of Brand and Products. 'The first is the 'To Go' trend. You take things with you wherever you want to go. You take your coffee and your sushi to wherever you want. And the second large trend is the pursuit of experiences. People have already experienced so much so just checking in to a regular hotel room is not enough anymore. So this is an answer to that particular trend, this is an experience beyond the regular.' Recent locations where the room was placed include a theme park in central Sweden in September and at a golf course in Southern Sweden in early October. But there are still some days available where guests can apply for their own preferred locations. In even more remote locations, a generator can be used to provide electricity to the pod . There are still some dates available where guests can apply to have it set up in their own preferred locations . While it may be a brilliant marketing gimmick for the hotel chain, there's no denying it's also a fantastic idea . Michelson says that they do get some unorthodox requests, some of which they have to reject for logistical, or legal, reasons. 'The strangest request we have had was from a prisoner. He wanted to put it up in the prison. That would have been a rather strange place for it. But I guess it could also be some sort of advanced escape attempt, I guess he could have tried to go out with it when we removed it.' Breakfast is delivered by Scandic staff each morning and for some locations, such as central Stockholm, Scandic also provides security guards to keep an eye on the container. With all the additional expenses Scandic does not make much profit on the project, but profit was never the idea according to Michelson. 'Of course we won't make much money out of this project. But we learn a lot about our guests and we are at the cutting edge of the expansion of available offers. That also means a lot,' he says. According to a 2013 report by the Stockholm Visitors Board, Stockholm is the Nordic region's most popular tourist destination with 11-million overnight stays in 2013, an increase by 2.5 percent compared to 2012. The majority of people visiting Stockholm are domestic tourists and business travellers followed by tourists from Germany, the UK and Norway. There are currently nearly 300 hotels in greater Stockholm with a capacity of around 30,000 rooms a night. Eva Camel, marketing manager for Visit Stockholm says that the Scandic 'To Go' concept is a marketing gimmick for the Scandic hotel chain. 'This is a clever piece of marketing of course. They want people to talk about them. But of course, it is also very exciting. 'It is like a caravan but without wheels - you decide where you want to go. I've seen pictures and it looks great and of course it is fantastic to be able to choose where you live and wake up in the morning.'

"London Mayor Boris Johnson cut a puzzled expression as he poked nervously at a dissected cow as he stopped off in Malaysia as part of his whistle-stop Far East Tour. Mr Johnson nervously dug his hands in to the dissected animal to celebrate the opening of Epsom College in Kuala Lumpur, sister school of the prestigious independent Surrey school. The school hopes to cater for just under 1,000 pupils aged 11 to 18 and will follow a British curriculum. Scroll down for video .

Prior to his fumble with the cow, the Mayor of London had travelled cattle class with Kuala Lumpur mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib where he mingled enthusiastically with bemused commuters. He had kicked off the day with a meeting at city hall with the mayor and enjoyed a hearty local breakfast, before touring the sites of Kuala Lumpur. The cow dissection is the latest in the serious of peculiar photographs that have emerged of Mr Johnson on his six-day tour. He has also been snapped in a tight-fitting 'London is Great' T-shirt that showed off his portly frame, as well as chasing a lizard during a visit to Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Mr Johnson has visited the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission to boost trade and investment between the UK and Far East. The senior Conservative has already met politicians, including Indonesian president Joko Widodo, and a raft of business leaders in four days spent in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia. He was the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration.

The Southeast Asian country now has an economy worth $241bn (£153bn) and is predicted to reach developed economy status within the next six years. Following newly introduced legislations which liberate Malaysia's architecture and engineering sectors, Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer. 'This fast developing nation is awash with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities crying out for London's great minds and expertise,"" he said. 'From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.' Mr Johnson also defended the levels of affordable housing in the Malaysian-backed Battersea Power Station redevelopment. He said the 'affordable' element of the project, 15 per cent of the 3,000-plus properties, represented a gain of 600 discounted homes for Londoners. Mr Johnson said: 'It's with that spearhead of Malaysian money coming in and redeveloping Battersea Power Station that we are able to get on and build 25,000 homes, the majority of which will be for people in the UK and loads of which will be affordable. 'Plus we are able to get the extension of the northern line...don't forget that out of this development we have got to fund the first extension of the tube we have seen in 25 years, it's not a cheap thing to do. 'We have to build two new stations and it will produce as I say overall in the area 25,000 new homes. 'I think 600 affordable homes is better than no affordable homes.' Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer in Malaysia . Mr Johnson's defence of the project came as he met prime minister Razak in Kualar Lumpur to unveil Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as the architects designing Malaysia Square, the £8bn main public space at the power station project. Mr Johnson said: 'We are now celebrating the arrival in London of Malaysia Square. 'If you think back 30 years ago or so, it was the Royal Bank of Ontario enabled the creation of Canada Square that led to what was then the greatest regeneration project anywhere in Europe - Canary Wharf. 'Nobody thought that could be done and now 30 years later it is another great Commonwealth country, Malaysia, that is allowing us to go ahead with an even more spectacular regeneration project. 'One no one ever thought could conceivably be done. Virtually all my life that site has been a shell, a ruin, a mockery of urban regeneration projects. 'You have pulled this off.' British firms have already made their mark in Malaysia with goods and services exports from UK companies worth about £3bn every year.

"Avoided punishment: The BBC will not take disciplinary action against Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has escaped disciplinary action over his alleged use of the n-word while filming the hit BBC series. In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Despite the media storm surrounding the video, which was leaked in May, the BBC Trust has ruled out taking further action against Clarkson as the material had not been broadcast. Several viewers have complained to the BBC Trust and asked it to review its decision not to take their complaints any further - after its senior complaints adviser said there was no case for the controversial presenter to answer. In a report published today, the Complaints and Appeals Board agreed that the 'incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast' and noted the BBC had left Clarkson 'in no doubt about how seriously we view this'. It stated: 'The panel concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of success for an appeal.' Shortly after the tape was made public, the BBC put Clarkson on a final warning and he wrote in his newspaper column that he believed he would be sacked by the broadcaster if he made another offensive remark. Immediately after the video's release, Clarkson took to Twitter to deny he used the racist term and released a video statement saying he was ‘mortified and horrified’ that it sounded as though he had used it. The TV presenter told his 3.3million Twitter followers that he had made every effort to make sure he did not use the slur, but realised it might have sounded as though he had. In the video message posted on his official Twitter account he said: 'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe. Scroll down for video . Complaint: In the leaked video the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe' The presenter touched down in Vancouver, Canada, last week to film an episode of Top Gear . 'Now, of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. 'The full rushes show that I did three takes. In two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third, I replaced it all together with the word ""teacher"". 'Now when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. 'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception.

Is there another take that we could use?"" 'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word. 'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough. 'Thank you.' 'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loath.

'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word. 'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough. Following Clarkson's frank video message, the BBC also released a statement which described the incident as 'regrettable'. It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. 'We have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the BBC expects on-air and off. 'We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.' It was alleged that Mr Clarkson uttered the n-word during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount. Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme. Audio forensic experts studied the clip and suggested that, in their view, the presenter had used the word, which is deemed highly offensive. In the version of the show which aired in February 2013 he was heard to say 'teacher'. Despite his show of humility, some of Clarkson’s critics said the apology was ‘insufficient’ and demanded he be sacked. Solicitor Lawrence Davies, who runs the Equal Justice law firm, responded to Clarkson's apology video by saying: ‘This explanation is just not credible. If he really wanted to avoid saying the N-word, he could easily have avoided reciting that rhyme altogether. ‘He deserves to be sacked for this. But the BBC have clearly brushed it under the carpet. They are too afraid to lose him.’ Controversial: The Top Gear host, appearing with co-presenters Richard Hammond (L) and James May, has been caught up several race rows during his television career .","Clarkson allegedly used the racist term while reciting rhyme during filming .

"An Adelaide mother, who says her one year old daughter was scarred for life after being badly burnt on some play equipment, has taken to social media to warn other parents against the dangers of unprotected play equipment. One year old Ella Brooks was at the new playground in Semaphore, north west of Adelaide,  on the morning of November 13, with her grandma when she suffered severe burns to her right left after sitting on the 'hurdy gurdy' merry-go-round. Her mother Amanda Hann, who was clearly distressed by the incident says the 'pictures of the horrific burn speak for themselves'. Scroll down to video . One year old Ella Brooks was at the new playground in Semaphore, with her grandma when she suffered severe burns (pictured) to her right left after sitting on the merry-go-round . On a 26/27 degree day this merry-go-round at a Semaphore playground got so hot it badly burnt a one year old girl . Ella (pictured) had several trips to the hospital for treatment and constant dressings after she was badly burnt at Semaphore playground . In a Facebook post she said the day was only about 26 or 27 degrees but the equipment clearly hadn't been made to withstand warm days, 'let alone the Australian sun'. 'Several trips to the hospital for treatment and constant dressing, not to mention the care and strain on us at home to keep the area clean and dressed 24/7 with a highly active toddler,' she said. 'She is only one year old and is now scarred for life and this has ruined her whole summer as she cannot do water activities or play in sandpits etc. because the area is so sensitive'. In her post she has warned other parents to be 'Beware of the new Semaphore playground' claiming they are a risk to any child who climbs/falls/sits onto the checkerboard surface. 'I don't want any other child to suffer the way mine has,' she said. The post went viral and has been shared more than 14,000 times, with a variety of comments from concerned and angry parents. Ella's parents Amanda Hann (pictured right) and Dylan Brooks (pictured left) say it has ruined their daughter's summer as she cannot get the burn wet and the dressing has to be changed constantly . Amanda Hann (pictured with Ella) took to social media to warn other parents about the dangers of an unprotected playground . The post went viral and saw a number of comments from concerned and angry parents . The post was shared nearly 14,000 times and incited plenty of comments who were worried about the one year old . Some users gave some advice about what to do when at a playground . Some were angry the play equipment wasn't checked before kids were able to use it . One mother wondered why they didn't have shade over the playground while another commented that parents should check the playground by feeling equipment, just to be over cautious. Many felt very sorry for little Ella while others felt Ms Hann should look into claiming compensation after the incident. Following the overwhelming response, Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned off the piece of play equipment. Acting technical services director, Robert Tiggemann said the playground was upgraded this year and opened to the public early September. 'The playground is compliant with Australian Standards and has shade over parts of the playground and cost approximately $480,000 and was manufactured by a German Company,' he said. 'We understand the Company supply playgrounds all over the world.' Ella (pictured) suffered a severe burn after sitting on a piece of playground equipment at Semaphore . Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned the play equipment off after complaints after hearing of the incident . Mr Tiggemann said the council were alerted to the incident on Tuesday, November 25 following the information being posted to Facebook. 'We understand the incident occurred on 13th November and we believe the child was about 1 year old, the forecast on the 13th November was 38 degrees in Adelaide,' he said. 'Neither the parents of the child or anyone else has contacted the Council regarding the matter.' But council took action and closed down the 'Hurdy Gurdy' and organised a spongy rubber coating to be installed and it is now open again for kids to use. Port Adelaide Enfield council installed a spongy rubber coating on the 'hurdy gurdy' (pictured right) and it has now been re-opened . A local mum who has taken her kids to the playground on many occasions told Daily Mail Australia she believes there are a couple of really poor designs within the park. 'There's a flying fox that most kids can't reach and the bigger ones that can swing so low their legs touch the ground,' she said. 'There's also a great climbing wall but it's positioned in a spot so that it blocks a lot of your view which means you can lose sight of where your kids are.' 'You'd think if you were going to pour so much money into a playground in such an important location for the suburb they'd get it right!'","Ella Brooks, 1, suffered severe burns to her right leg after sitting on a hot merry-go-round at a Semaphore playground .

"Teenagers will be able to study 2,000 years of immigration to Britain as part of plans for a new history GCSE. Those studying the module will learn about the reasons for immigration, the experience of migrants and their impact on the country. The OCR exam board, which has drawn up the proposals, said pupils would discover parallels to the modern day. Melting pot: GCSE students will learn about how London has been a destination for migrants for hundreds of years. Pictured, a 17th Century image of arrivals on the River Thames by the Tower of London . They may be ‘surprised to learn’ that the black population of London potentially numbered up to 15,000 in the 1750s, and that at least ten languages were used across medieval England. Pupils will study the history of immigration to Britain from Roman times to the modern day, including arrivals from Syria and eastern Europe. They will be expected to demonstrate that they understand the reasons people migrated to Britain, the experience of migrants in Britain and their impact on Britain. OCR said a ‘migration into Britain’ module would be an optional part of a new GCSE history course being introduced in 2016. It aims to reinvigorate interest in GCSE history amid claims from historians that growing numbers of teenagers are not being taught the subject beyond the age of 14. The GCSE is being reformed in line with changes brought in by the Coalition, which aim to make exams more rigorous. New courses will be submitted to the Government next year and then taught from 2016 subject to approval from Ofqual, the exams watchdog. Mike Goddard, OCR’s head of history, said: ‘Migration is an ideal history topic for GCSE students to study, allowing them to consider fundamental historical concepts such as continuity, change and significance, rooted in the major events of England’s history. Mike Goddard, OCR’s head of history, said the module would require pupils to explore and understand ‘the constant shifts in the British population’ - including the arrivals of invaders such as the Romans and Vikings . ‘Doing this through the lens of the movement of diverse groups of people has the added benefit of contemporary relevance and will make for a rigorous, stimulating and enjoyable course.’ He said it would require pupils to explore and understand ‘the constant shifts in the British population’. They would study invaders such as the Romans and the Vikings, the effects of the British Empire and immigration arising from attempts to flee persecution including the Huguenots, Jews and, more recently, the Syrians. The GCSE is being reformed in line with changes to qualifications ordered by the Coalition, which is attempting to increase rigour and depth of knowledge. OCR is currently developing two new GCSEs in response to the reforms. One will focus on the ‘modern world’ and the second will put more emphasis on a range of historical periods. The proposed new GCSEs will be submitted to the government next year and will be taught from 2016, subject to approval from Ofqual, the exams watchdog. Mr Goddard said: ‘Migration has been a constant and, in many important ways, a defining feature of our history. 'Tracking it thematically over time makes for a complex and fascinating study, will build on recent academic research, and will reveal many new and enlightening aspects of our past.’","OCR module will be about history of migrants dating to Roman times .

"A senior Lib Dem who promoted two girlfriends in succession to £7,500-a-year council roles has been condemned as a ‘liar and cheat’ by the first. Keith House, 49, who earns almost £90,000 in public money every year, is said to have caused a major rift on the council by dumping one female councillor and striking up a relationship with another one seven years her junior. The first councillor is now said to be refusing to attend meetings and failing to monitor constituents’ emails, despite her generous taxpayer-funded allowance. Keith House and Louise Bloom were together for 14 years before he dumped her on election night in May . She has also attacked council leader Mr House for taking her ‘replacement’ on romantic holidays. Mr House dumped Louise Bloom, 50, his girlfriend of 14 years, on election night in May, leaving the divorcee in tears at the count. He then struck up a relationship with married councillor Tonia Craig, 43. Mrs Craig, who is separated from her husband, was then rapidly promoted to join Miss Bloom in Mr House’s eight-strong ‘cabinet’ at Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire in June. Its members decide council policy and are paid an extra allowance of £7,500 a year. But Miss Bloom is apparently so upset by the break-up that she has not attended any of the five cabinet meetings held since. His new girlfriend, Tonia Craig, has quickly been promoted to his eight-strong ‘cabinet’ at Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire . Sources say she feels unable to ‘play gooseberry’ to her ex-partner and his girlfriend. But she still draws her allowance. Meanwhile Mr House has neglected to declare formally his new relationship with Mrs Craig. Miss Bloom is said to have been furious last month when Mr House took Mrs Craig on holiday to the US and Canada and posted pictures online. One featured Mrs Craig at Niagara Falls, and another showed the pair knocking on doors for Democratic Party campaigners in America. Miss Bloom wrote on Twitter: ‘Ex seems to be taking my replacement to all the places we went to. Should I send him a list to help? #LiarandCheat.’ She told a friend: ‘I was in tears when Keith dumped me on polling night in May – and was upset again when I saw on Facebook that she was touring America with him at his expense.’ Mrs Craig, meanwhile, announced the end of her relationship with husband Gordon on Facebook on April 7. Mr House has told locals he is ‘just good friends’ with Mrs Craig, but Mr Craig, 46, said she had been entirely open about Mr House being her new partner. Mr Craig, an asset manager, said he had left his wife in 2013, adding: ‘Tonia’s relationship with Keith House started some time after I left the family house.’ As well as being leader of the borough council, Mr House – a divorced father of four – holds a number of other public roles including leader of the opposition on the county authority. Mr House, Miss Bloom and Mrs Craig had last night not responded to repeated detailed requests for comment. Eastleigh Borough Council said it would not comment ‘on a private matter’.","Keith House, 49, has caused a 'major rift' at Eastleigh Borough Council .

"A Florida woman is accused of using a stun gun on her three-year-old nephew. But the woman and her family are denying the charges and claiming  the incident was a misunderstanding. Ramona Braswell, 30, of St Petersburg, Florida was arrested and charged with felony child abuse Saturday after police responded to a 911 call from her sister, Karen Braswell, saying Ramona had used a Taser on her son, according to CBS Tampa Bay. The boy's mother told police that she heard her son crying from another room and found her sister laughing and activating the stun gun near him. Stun Gun: Ramona Braswell, 30, of St. Pete, was arrested and charged with felony child abuse Saturday for allegedly using a stun gun on her three-year-old nephew . Laughing: Braswell was reportedly laughing and activating the stun gun near the three-year-old in the living room of her home when the boy's mother entered the room after hearing her son begin to cry . Authorities say the boy told his mother that Braswell used the device on his arm. Officers say the three-year-old had marks on his arm consistent with those caused by a stun gun. Braswell told authorities that the stun gun belonged to a friend and denied using it on the boy but did admit to placing the stun gun's handle on the boy's arm; she said she was 'just playing' with the device, WFLA reports. Braswell has been released from jail on $5,000 bail. Initially, the boy told police that Braswell used the stun gun on him and his mother claimed the same. But now, both have changed their stories. Stories: The three-year-old and his mother initially claimed that Braswell used the stun gun on him, but have since changed their stories and claim the situation was a 'misunderstanding' Facebook: Braswell has repeatedly claimed that she did not use the stun gun on her nephew and has even taken to Facebook to claim her innocence . The boy's mother said that her son was just scared and confused and insists that Braswell did not harm him, according to WTSP. In her initial 911 call, Braswell's sister spoke through tears as she told the dispatcher what she believed happened to her son, she repeatedly told the dispatcher that she didn't want anyone to get in trouble. 'I don't want nothing to happen to [Braswell], I'm not going to have nowhere to stay,' the boy's mother said. 'I called you guys because [Braswell] said we 'don't have any proof.' Marks: Authorities say that the boy had marks on his arm consistent with those that would be made by a stun gun (above is the stun gun Braswell was accused of using to harm the boy) Braswell told WTSP that she loves her nephew and said 'everybody knows that I would never hurt a child.' She admitted that playing with the stun gun around the three-year-old was a 'mistake' but said she would never touch a child with it. Braswell even took to Facebook and, in a post, wrote that she is 'not crying' because she did nothing wrong.","Ramona Braswell, 30, is accused of using a stun gun on her three-year-old nephew .

"The family of a serial party pest could lose their home, after an out-of-control party was shut down by police who were attacked with bottles by upset revellers. Perth Now reported riot police were forced to break up an out-of-control party in Bentley on Saturday night when 200 people spilled out into the streets. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan has suggested that the mother of the teen who threw the party, Martin Fulton, 16, could face up to $12,000 in fines. Scroll down for video . Martin Fulton threw an out-of-control party and could be fined up to $12,000 . Martin Fulton, 16, said he arranged the party, but neighbours labelled him a serial party pest as he was always having parties there. Fulton had invited over 500 people on Facebook to the party. He even charged an entry fee – $5 entry before 8pm, $10 anytime after this, plus ones $10. When 30 police officers moved in to shut the party down they were bottled by revellers. 'It was fine until the cops showed up, then they ruined it,' Fulton said. Commissioner O'Callaghan has now said that the family must pay for the cost of the operation, reported 9 News. Legislation introduced in 2012 allows for those found guilty of throwing parties which require police control to be fined up to $12,000. An out-of-control party was shut down by police. This photo shows his Halloween party . Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan has suggested that the mother of the teen who threw the party, Martin Fulton, 16, could face up to $12,000 in fines . 'It was fine until the cops showed up, then they ruined it,' Fulton said . When 30 police officers moved in to shut the party down they were bottled by revellers . The Fultons' house is a welfare property owned by Foundation Housing, complicating the situation further as the incident could mean eviction for the family. Representatives of the body visited Mr Fulton and his mother on Monday morning to speak with them about the possible consequences of the party. As Mr Fulton is a minor, his parent or guardian is held responsible for the party, meaning that the fine of up to $12,000 could fall squarely on the shoulders of his mother. 'We're actually sitting at the Midland Police Station this morning collating the cost of that operation because it's likely his mum will have to pay for it,' said Commissioner O'Callaghan. Mr Fulton's mother Michelle said that the party had nothing to do with her, and that she hadn't organised the party. The teenager has said that he intends to pay for the fine, should it come to his mother, though he insists he did nothing wrong and said that he registered the party online, told neigbours and hired bouncers. When asked why the police were bottled, Fulton replied it was because they were trying to 'shut down a good party' The Fultons' house is a welfare property owned by Foundation Housing, complicating the situation further as the incident could mean eviction for the family . When asked why the police were bottled, Fulton replied it was because they were trying to 'shut down a  good party'. He said that what happened would not stop him from holding other parties in the future, and the next one would be on New Year's Eve. Police Minister Liza Hardey said that it had been Mr Fulton's responsibility to manage the party properly. 'If he can't and the police are called, they will use our out of control party legislation to prosecute him to the full extent they can,' said Minister Hardey. Mr Fulton still plans on hosting a New Years Eve party despite the legal problems his family is facing. On Saturday evening, police were called to the scene on Gambar Court just before midnight following reports of people fighting. When officers arrived, there were an estimated 200 people at the address. Police entered the property and removed several people, while declaring it an 'out of control gathering.' A 20-year-old man allegedly refused to comply with police instructions and he was charged with obstruct police and disorderly conduct. Another 20-year-old man received facial injuries after being involved in an altercation with another party guest. A Nollamara man, also aged 20, was arrested at the scene and subsequently charged with two counts of assault occasioning bodily harm. Police detained 16 juveniles and two other men were also issued move on notices. Mr Fulton said police were bottled because they shut the party down .

"Anderson Cooper has explained his mysterious disappearance from the air on Monday night, explaining that he had to undergo emergency surgery. The 47-year-old was absent from his show Anderson Cooper 360 yesterday, but there was no explanation as to why. The popular anchor took to Twitter to clear the air and calm his fans, posting that he had undergone surgery to remove his appendix on Sunday. In recovery: Anderson Cooper underwent emergency surgery to remove his appendix on Sunday night . The New York-born journalist was nowhere to be seen during Monday night's show, and had been substituted for John Berman. Despite Anderson Cooper's notable absence, Mr Berman made no mention of him during the show's opening or closing. Instead, the anchor himself explained on social media: 'I'll be back on air tomorrow. 'Had an appendicitis and had to have sudden surgery last night.' Appendicitis can become life threatening if the appendix bursts, which is why surgery is carried out urgently once the condition has been established. Appendectomies are the most common emergency operation performed in the US, with more 300,000 per year undergoing the surgery. Meanwhile, the surreal feud between Anderson Cooper and Billy Corgan has been taken to the next level by the Smashing Pumpkins singer. Last month, Mr Cooper made a joke about Mr Corgan losing his rocker credentials by posing on a cat magazine with his pets, a pair of Siamese called Sammi and Mr Thom. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman did not take the joke lightly, calling Mr Cooper a 'globalist shill' in a tweet. But it seems Billy Corgan was not satisfied with a tweet, making his feelings about the news anchor clear via merchandise sold at his concerts. At Smashing Pumpkins's show on Wednesday night, a T-shirt on sale featured a picture of Corgan's pet cats, captioned: 'F*** You Anderson Cooper.'","Anderson Cooper unexplained absence from show cleared up .

For two hours, the demonstrators had peacefully marched down the main thoroughfares of central Brussels to protest government policies that will raise the pension age, contain wages and cut into public services. But violence broke out at the end of the demonstration as police fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to clear the streets. No casualties were immediately reported. 'Metal barriers were thrown at the police, together with stones, and then the situation rapidly got worse,' said demonstrator Gilles Broussard. 'Hundreds of riot police were involved in trying to bring the situation under control - it all got very nasty.' A new government was elected in Belgium last month and immediately pledged to raise the retirement age, cancel wage rises and cut social security benefits. This was all in line with strict guidelines from Europe, which views austerity as the key to the trading bloc's future.

Smoke rises from firecrackers as groups of protesters are pushed back by the black-clad armed police . Belgium has a long postwar tradition of collective bargaining between employers and workers, and successive coalition governments representing a full scale of public opinion often have been able to contain social disagreements. But the current coalition, made up of three pro-business parties and the centrist Christian Democrats, is the first in decades that has been able to set such a clear neoliberal free-market agenda. Marchers said the government, which hopes to save the equivalent of more than £10million, was attacking ordinary people, while avoiding higher taxes for businesses. 'They are hitting the workers, the unemployed. They are not looking for money where it is, I mean, people with a lot of money,' said Philippe Dubois, who came from the industrial rust belt of Liege. The government says it has been forced to push through stringent austerity measures to keep the budget deficit within European Union constraints and insists that businesses need more lenient tax policies to become more competitive in the global market. The trade unions object to government policies that promise to raise the pension age from 65 to 67, freeze the automatic link between wages and inflation, and cut public services in a way that would affect the entire population.

Slogans on banners included: 'Eliminate the causes of the crisis, not the poor', 'Hands off the pension age', and 'human need not corporate greed'. By late afternoon cars and other vehicles could be seen burning in the centre of Brussels. There were also reports of buildings being set on fire, and other property being damaged. 'There are disturbances in the centre of the centre,' said a Brussels police spokesman. The unexpectedly massive march opens a month-long campaign by the trade unions against the business-friendly governing coalition and is to be capped with a nationwide general strike on December 15. Despite the opening of government-led talks with employers and unions later Thursday, Socialist trade union leader Rudy De Leeuw vowed to continue the protests for weeks on end.","Fighting broke out after the end of largely peaceful trade union march .

"A new garden city is to be built in Oxfordshire as part of the Coalition's plans to deal with the housing shortage, Nick Clegg has confirmed. Bicester has been chosen as the site for the new town, which will have up to 13,000 new homes. The proposals will be outlined in the National Infrastructure Plan being published tomorrow when ministers are also set to announce a range of other housing measures. The £100m new garden city, with 13,000 new homes  will be developed in Bicester, pictured, . Earlier this year, the Government announced that Ebbsfleet in Kent had been picked to become the first modern garden city. Bicester expressed an interest in following suit and is in line for a new railway station to serve the expanded population as part of rail plans previously announced by the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Clegg told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Liberal Democrats have long argued that garden cities are an idea whose time has come again. 'I am delighted that Bicester can now be confirmed as a pioneer in what I hope will be another wave of garden cities in this country. 'This is a significant victory for the approach championed by the Coalition Government - where local areas put their hand up and say we want to become a garden city or garden town.' Earlier the Government announced that Ebbsfleet in Kent, pictured, would be the first modern garden city . In the 1920s, the then government created so-called garden cities such as Welwyn Garden City, pictured, to create high quality homes in locations within a relatively short distance from London on major rail links . He added: 'Bicester will get help from the Government with both significant capital investment and in helping developers build the amenities that are required to be a true garden town. 'I hope many other towns will follow Bicester's lead and we will see more garden cities spring up that have the affordable, well-designed homes with proper transport links; services and amenities, which our young families want and need.' Under the garden city initiative, a series of new communities with green spaces, sustainable transport and spacious homes will be built. Mr Clegg has previously claimed the Conservatives 'held back the development of garden cities on the scale necessary' and promised at least ten will be created if the Liberal Democrats are part of the next government. Welwyn Garden City, pictured, was second garden city after Letchworth and one of the first new towns .","Nick Clegg announced the plan for 13,000 new homes in Oxfordshire .

Standing down: Today Gordon Brown (left), joined by his wife Sarah and sons John, 11, and Fraser, eight, said it was time to let a 'new person with new ideas' take over - and he will not return to frontline politics . Emotional: Gordon Brown told supporters he would continue to campaign on issues close to his heart . In a highly personal speech, he told of the pain the couple suffered when they lost their first child, Jennifer, shortly after her birth. He also revealed that problems with his eyesight in Downing Street were more serious than previously admitted. The former Labour leader suffered a serious rugby accident at the age of 16 which blinded him in one eye, and he required lengthy treatment to save the sight in the other. In 2009, Downing Street confirmed that medical checks had picked up minor retinal tears in Mr Brown’s good eye – but at the time he said there had been ‘absolutely no deterioration’ in his eyesight. Traditional: Mr Brown spoke in the Old Kirk in Kirkcaldy, the oldest church in his constituency town . 'Although I'm standing down from public office I want to renew my commitment to public service,' he added . Support: Mr Brown hugging his wife Sarah ahead of the speech, which drew praise from former opponents . Yet last night Mr Brown revealed that surgeon Hector Chawla, who saved his eyesight as a boy, came to his aid. He said: ‘When I was in Downing Street and he was retired and they discovered there were tears ... he came to help me again.’ He told 200 assembled friends and Labour Party members at the Old Kirk church: ‘I will not forget, Sarah will not forget, the strength you gave us when our daughter Jennifer was born and then died.’ As his wife looked on, he added: ‘For her love and for her support in every campaign we’ve done – national elections, local elections – Sarah was incredible in giving me support and supporting the Labour Party.’ Friends said Mr Brown wanted to go out on a high, just weeks after making a critical intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to secure the future of the United Kingdom. David Cameron, who replaced Mr Brown in May 2010, said: 'Gordon has given a huge amount in terms of public service and his contribution in government and in Parliament' Family portrait: Mr Brown said he would remain in Fife, adding: 'It is Fife where our home is and where we will be, where our children John and Fraser, who are here tonight, are happily at school' Then and now: Mr Brown leaving Downing Street with his wife and two children after his defeat in May 2010 . They also said the former prime minister still harbours ambitions to take on one more major international role, such as leading the International Monetary Fund, before he retires for good. According to Labour sources, Ed Miliband approached Mr Brown in the immediate aftermath of Scotland’s referendum to see if he would consider taking over the moribund Scottish Labour Party. But Mr Brown declined, saying publicly that he was ‘too old to be the comeback kid ... and I’m too young to be an elder statesman as well’. Mr Brown, who has served in the Commons for over 30 years, will not take a seat in the Lords. Instead, he said he will focus on his role as a UN ambassador for education, as well as his and his wife’s other charity work. Mr Brown married his wife Sarah in 2000 and they have two sons, John and James. A baby girl, Jennifer, was born prematurely and died in January 2002 . Mr Brown served as Chancellor under Tony Blair for 10 years, during which the two men repeatedly clashed about when the Prime Minister would step aside to make way for his old friend . However, he indicated he would return to front-line politics to keep Britain in the EU, should a referendum take place, adding: ‘Although I’m standing down from public office, I want to renew my commitment to public service.’ Mr Miliband last night hailed his predecessor as a ‘towering figure’ in the Labour Party and British politics. David Cameron, who defeated Mr Brown at the last general election, said he ‘wished him well’. Mr Brown, 63, had been widely expected to step down from Parliament in May. He has made only fleeting appearances at Westminster since leading Labour to a crushing defeat in 2010. When he left office Britain had one of the biggest budget deficits in the developed world, which politicians on all sides are still grappling with. However, friends insist that history will be kinder to a man who helped broker a rescue package for the world economy when it stood on the brink of collapse. Mr Brown entered the House of Commons in 1983 when he won a majority of 11,000 in Dunfermline East . After Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer . After years of waiting to become Prime Minister, Mr Brown finally entered No 10 on June 27, 2007 . The second son of Rev Dr John Ebenezer Brown, a Church of Scotland minister, Gordon Brown was brought up in Kirkcaldy, a small coastal town north of Edinburgh in Scotland. At the age of 16, he joined Edinburgh University to study history becoming the youngest undergraduate there since the war. He became a Labour MP for Dunfermline East at the second attempt in 1983 with a majority of 11,000, after briefly working as a lecturer and TV reporter, and began forging an alliance with fellow MP Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. Gordon Brown enjoyed a mixed relationship with Tony Blair and craved the leadership for many years . He was made chancellor in 1992, choosing not to stand for leadership thereby clearing the way for Blair, on the understanding he would retain power at some point. After Labour's 1997 landslide victory, Brown became the most powerful chancellor in modern times. But he never stopped coveting the top job and  spend much of the next 10 years pushing Blair to make good on their deal. When Blair finally stood down in 2007, after winning three Labour election victories, Brown was made party leader, and prime minister, without a contest. While on the campaign trail in Rochdale ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' when she quizzed him about immigration . However he found the job he had so craved more difficult than he envisaged and he struggled, particularly with the onset of the global recession in 2008. After a disastrous showing in the local and European elections in 2009, he lost the 2010 general election campaign after losing more than 90 Labour MPs in what was Labour's worst electoral performance since Michael Foot in 1983. Mr Brown returned to the front line political stage for the Scottish referendum and played a crucial role in keeping the Union with a barnstorming speech in Glasgow the day before votes were cast.","Gordon Brown formally announced plans to stand down tonight .

"Gerard Depardieu shocked an audience at what was meant to be a solemn First World War commemoration by turning up ‘scandalously drunk’. The 65-year-old movie legend’s shambolic performance follows his admission that he sometimes drinks up to 14 bottles of wine a day. On Sunday evening Depardieu was due to read out poetry by the French poet-singer known as Barbara – who survived France’s wartime Holocaust – at the event in Brussels. Scroll down for video . Gerard Depardieu shocked an audience at what was meant to be a solemn First World War commemoration by turning up ‘scandalously drunk’ Depardieu was due to read out poetry by the French poet-singer known as Barbara – who survived France’s wartime Holocaust – at the event in Brussels. But he shocked audiences by gesticulating and swearing . Within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language . The solemn words and music recital at the historic Flagey venue was also due to include the work of Depardieu’s late son, Guillaume, who died tragically in 2008. But within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language. A translation reveals what he is saying. He told the audience: 'I will tell you that I am helping you here, here and elsewhere, and elsewhere . 'I see there are people who say aaaaah da da da . 'My god what do they know? what do they know about love for Europe? 'I would like... to be strong... I think it can be done... I think it can be done . 'Stop Gerard! But I do nothing, I am doing nothing. I am not a politician. 'They are sh**, they are sh** . 'I am going to finish with a Flemish poet who is extraordinary.' Although some members of the audience appreciated the change in tone, and clapped and laughed, others were far from impressed. 'Gerard Depardieu was visibly drunk to say the least,’ one spectator told Brussel’s La Capitale. ‘He started off by finding it difficult to find words of welcome. ‘Then, he read the same sentence once, twice, and then three times! Then he left the text that he was reading to digress on to the subject of politics in Belgium.‘Then, a little later, he asked what page he was on. Although some members of the audience appreciated the change in tone, and clapped and laughed, others were far from impressed‘ . Audience members said he left the text that he was reading to digress on to the subject of politics in Belgium, then had to ask what page he was on . Finally, the show had to be stopped after half-an-hour, with other audience members tweeting words such as ‘scandalous’ and ‘shame’ He also called for a chair,’ said the spectator, who provided a video of part of the debacle. Finally, the show had to be stopped after half-an-hour, with other audience members tweeting words such as ‘scandalous’ and ‘shame’. In September, Depardieu told an interviewer: ‘I can’t drink like a normal person. I can absorb 12, 13, 14 bottles per day. 'In the morning, it starts at home with champagne or red wine before 10am, then again champagne.' Depardieu was last year banned from an Air France flight for urinating in the aisle as it prepared to take off, forcing the plane to turn back. A passenger on the flight said Depardieu appeared to be drunk and insisted he be allowed to use the bathroom during takeoff, when passengers must remain seated. Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the rich, underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation 14 years ago.

Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the rich, underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation 14 years ago . He recently revealed he was once a rent boy, a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car and also turned his hand to grave robbing before being saved from destitution by a gay theatre talent spotter who paid for him to study French drama. The 65-year-old award-winning actor makes his confessions confessions in his autobiography, called 'it happened like that' (Ca c'est fait comme ca) in which he also tells of his unexpected friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president and the death of his son Guillaume in 2008. Depardieu, who became a household name in Britain for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy Green Card alongside Andie MacDowell, reveals as a toddler he became accustomed to hearing his mother tell him about her attempts to abort him using knitting needles adding: 'And to think I almost killed you.' His family was so poor that as a child he helped deliver his siblings as his parents could not afford a midwife. Depardieu writes he began to wander the streets when he was just 10 but could easily pass for being 15 - and quickly realised he was attractive to men. He said: 'I've known since I was very young that I please homosexuals' and added when men approached, asking for sex, 'I would ask them for money'. He also admits he occasionally helped a man to dig up newly buried bodies in the cemetery and steal jewellery and shoes from them.","Depardieu was due to read out solemn poetry at the event in Brussels .

"A 'mysterious' militia group that appeared on rooftop patrols in Ferguson pledging to protect private property has been ordered to stand down. Oath Keepers, a vigilante organization consisting of former and current military, police and firefighters, abandoned their posts on Saturday night after being threatened with arrest. Equipped with militia-style clothing and firearms, the Oath Keepers had been offering free security for businesses at risk of looting and arson in Ferguson. Scroll down for video . John Karriman, a volunteer from vigilante organization Oath Keepers, stands guard on the rooftop of a  business  in Ferguson, Missouri . Nick Nesbitt watches from a snowy rooftop near the Ferguson Police Department. He and a group of volunteers watch and protect local businesses from getting vandalized as protesters gather in the neighborhood . They took up positions on rooftops after the St Louis suburb erupted in an orgy of violence and destruction following the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police questioned group members early last week and initially allowed them to stay. But as tensions remained high in Ferguson over the weekend, St. Louis County police officers ordered the Oath Keepers to leave the rooftops, threatening them with arrest for operating without a licence. 'When we hear information that someone, or a group, is providing security without a license, our department has to investigate the issue,' police spokesman, Shawn McGuire, told the New York Times in an email.

Nick Nesbitt watches from a snowy rooftop near the Ferguson Police Department. The Oath Keepers focused their efforts on a strip of South Florissant Road that includes a Chinese restaurant, dentist office, bakery and number of apartments . Since being shut down, the group have now turned their efforts to conducting their own protests. More than a dozen local businesses were razed to the ground last Monday, while many more were looted in a night of arson, random gunfire and pitched battles, with heavily armed riot police unable to cope with the scale of the mayhem. By Tuesday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon had sent more than 2,200 National Guard members to the Ferguson area to support local law enforcement.

Victor Clark, a dentist at Ferguson Dental on South Florissant Road, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he was happy to have the Oath Keepers' free assistance. On Monday, rioters shattered the business' front door and window, and stole dental needles and anesthetic. Mr Clark said that when the Oath Keepers turned up they gave them their keys. 'We didn't know that much about them, but we got a feeling of trust,' he told the local paper. 'You have to do something to protect our building.' Equipped with militia-style clothing and firearms, the Oath Keepers offered free security for businesses at risk of looting and arson in Ferguson . Nick Nesbitt patrols a snowy rooftop. Oath Keepers leader Sam Andrews declined to say how many people were assisting in the effort, saying only that the number was 'more than five, less than 500' 'When they're here, there's definitely a weight lifted off of our shoulders,' Davis Vo, whose family owns New Chinese Gourmet on the street, told the New York Times. 'I'd be lying if I said otherwise.' Oath Keepers leader Sam Andrews declined to say how many people were assisting in the effort, saying only that the number was 'more than five, less than 500'. 'It's really a broad group of citizens, and I'm sure their motivations are all different,' Mr Andrews told the newspaper. 'In many of them, there's probably a sense of patriotism. 'But I think in most of them, there's probably something that they probably don't even recognize: that we have a moral obligation to protect the weakest among us.'

"Villagers have complained after a Christmas tree made from scaffolding and tinsel was constructed on their green. Residents branded the tree an 'eyesore' after it was erected next to the main road in the Cambridgeshire village of Haddenham. The tree has been put together using metal scaffolding poles, with tinsel twisted around the structure to form star-shaped branches. Eyesore: The tree has been constructed by wrapping tinsel around a structure made from scaffolding poles . Picturesque: Residents of Haddenham, Cambridgeshire, (pictured) have described the tree as 'disapponting' Matthew Hannigan, 52, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw the Christmas tree, it's a real eyesore right in the centre of the village. 'I don't understand why other villages have real Christmas trees with lights and yet our tree is constructed out of metal and tinsel, it's really disappointing. 'It's on the main road through the village so everyone who drives through will see it and wonder why it's not real.' But resident Miranda Pratt, who helped to construct the tree, said it was meant to be 'conceptual' and 'exciting.'

A new father is on a life support machine after he was savagely beaten up while 'wetting the baby's head' on a night out with friends. Martin Catterall, 30, had been celebrating the birth of his child on Saturday night when he was set upon by a gang in Chorley town centre, Lancashire. The midnight attack left him with severe head injuries and he is currently in a critical condition at the Royal Preston Hospital. Police say his injuries are life-threatening and that he is currently on life support.

Detective Superintendent Eddie Thistlethwaite said: 'The victim of this assault was knocked unconscious and has been operated on at the Royal Preston Hospital, but he remains critically ill, with life threatening head injuries. 'He has just become a father for the first time to a young baby which makes this incident all the more tragic. 'We do need people to come forward and tell us what they may know or have seen. 'One witness that we asked to come forward has done so and we are grateful to him for doing so. 'But we still need to hear from whoever was in the beer garden of the White Hart public house in Chorley just after midnight in the early hours of Sunday morning and may have seen this assault. 'We are looking at CCTV in a bid to identify potential witnesses. 'This CCTV includes a number of vehicles driving past the immediate aftermath of the incident.

"The Tate Museum has worked with computer game makers to recreate some of its classic paintings and sculptures in Minecraft. Players can download the worlds to their computer to explore, and even play games as they move through the world. The first two maps are inspired by André Derain's 1906 painting of London, The Pool of London, and Christopher Nevinson's 1920 painting of New York, Soul of the Soulless City. Taking inspiration from Derain's painting of 'The Pool of London', the Minecraft version of the painting shows a section of the river Thames where ships unloaded cargo and goods were traded. The map allows users to explore London along the Thames as Fauvist painter André Derain did in 1906 to create the original painting . Minecraft was created by Markus Persson in 2009, before releasing it widely in November 2011. Players of the game, which is available on PC and Xbox can walk around different terrains, fly and build models using little pixelated blocks. It's the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years - and almost 17 million copies sold in total. Earlier this year, Microsoft snapped up Mr Persson's company, Mojang - and the game - for an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). He said the decision to sell the company was 'not about the money. It's about my sanity.' Jane Burton, Creative Director, Tate Media said: 'Minecraft is a wonderful game which embraces imagination and creativity. 'It has captivated millions of children and young people across the world. 'In playfully reimagining art in Tate Worlds for Minecraft we hope to introduce a new generation to inspirational works from Tate's collection.' The virtual environments or 'maps' known as Tate Worlds are based on paintings and sculptures in the Tate Collection. Players of the video game can explore and undertake activities and challenges that relate to the themes of the art work, or explore how they were made. The first Tate Worlds maps are already available to download for free.

Painted in 1920, the Tate says of the painting: 'New York in the 1920s was a bustling and fast-changing place. 'Its emerging skyscrapers and railways epitomised the dynamism of the modern metropolis, inspiring British artist Christopher Nevinson to paint his Futurist-style painting Soul of the Soulless City in 1920.' Six more Tate Worlds maps will be released over the coming year on the themes of 'Play', 'Destruction' and 'Fantasy', inspired by well-known artworks including John Singer Sargent's, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, 1885-6; Peter Blake's, The Toy Shop, 1962; John Martin's, The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum, 1822; and Cornelia Parker's, Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View, 1991.

"Tony Abbott has been asked if he's concerned about being a 'one term wonder' as the latest opinion poll shows his approval rating has hit its lowest point in five months. The Prime Minister appeared on Channel Nine's Today show on Tuesday morning and faced a barrage of questions from host Karl Stefanovic over his controversial budget decisions.

'With respect you were fairly feral in Opposition weren't you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and ... why would (Bill Shorten) do anything different when it worked for you?' Stefanovic asked. 'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse. 'No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.' Mr Abbott defended his government's budget saying it wasn't in 'shambles' and said the budget has been under control since the Liberal party were elected to government. 'The carbon tax has been successfully repealed, the mining tax has been successfully repealed, the boats are stopping, free trade agreements are being negotiated,' he said.

"A woman who gave birth to a severely premature baby has created a petition seeking to have medical guidelines changed after doctors refused to treat her child. Grieving mother Emma Jones gave birth to her son Riley at just 22 weeks and three days in December last year. However, current medical guidelines issued by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine recommend that doctors do not attempt to resuscitate babies born before 24 weeks, due to the extremely high risk of developing serious disabilities. Grieving mother Emma Jones with her partner Chris Goodger. Emma gave birth to their son Riley Goodger at just 22 weeks and three days in December last year . Riley died in the early hours of December 29, 2013, just 93 minutes after Ms Jones had given birth to him at Cardiff’s University Hospital of Wales. Ms Jones, from Cardiff, claims that he was breathing on his own and would have survived had medical staff intervened. But doctors and nurses refused to treat the 480g child because he was born nine days before it is considered acceptable for doctors to try and keep premature infants alive. She has now collected thousands of signatures on a petition calling for a change medical guidelines so babies born 22 weeks into pregnancy are not left to die by hospital staff. She told Wales Online: 'He wasn’t crying but I could see he was breathing – and his heart was beating through his chest wall. 'But no care could be provided for him even though he was living. 'I was incredibly tired after just going through labour but my mother, father and partner tried everything they could to get the staff to change their minds. 'They were begging because they knew what had happened with my previous son and they felt it couldn’t happen again. It was heartbreaking.' ‘In fighting this, I’m also conflicting with abortion guidelines, which makes things even more difficult.’ Ms Jones has handed in the 2,759-signature petition into the National Assembly of Wales' Petitions Committee to demand changes are put in place to help babies showing signs of life. Riley died in the early hours of December 29, 2013, just 93 minutes after Ms Jones had given birth to him at Cardiff’s University Hospital of Wales . The 23-year-old supermarket worker said she wants paediatricians to review and weigh every baby born after 22 weeks so parents and clinicians can make informed decisions based on their chance of survival. Ms Jones had an operation in May on her cervix to improve her chances of giving birth after the 24-week cut-off period. She added: ‘I don’t want any blame on the hospital for what they did. ‘My anger lies with the guidelines. Every baby should be treated on their individual condition. I believe if staff had treated my baby he’d still be alive today.’ The latest set of guidelines drawn up by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine in 2008 state that if a child is born at any stage less than 23 weeks, it is 'considered in the best interests of the baby, and standard practice, for resuscitation not to be carried out.’ The guidelines are based on a 1995 EPICure study of all babies born in the UK during that year, which reported that only two children born at 22 weeks survived, with one going on to develop severe disabilities. The BAPM guidelines go on to state that should a baby be born between 23 weeks and 23 weeks and six days ‘a decision not to start resuscitation is an appropriate approach’, although this may be re-considered in exceptional cases. There were 241 babies born prematurely at 23 weeks in 2000, with only 26 surviving. Of these, one later died and fourteen were reported to have disabilities by the age of five. Doctors and nurses refused to treat the 480g child because he was born nine days before it is considered acceptable to try and keep prematurely-born infants alive . However, babies born at 24 weeks had a higher chance of survival, and guidelines recommend that ‘resuscitation should be commenced unless the parents and clinicians have considered that the baby will be born severely compromised’. In the 1995 study, 66 per cent of the 313 babies born at this age died, while half of the survivors were found to have a moderate or severe disability at six years old. Disabilities often include cerebral palsy and an inability to walk, low cognitive scores, blindness or profound hearing loss. Those babies born at 25 weeks had considerably greater chances of survival and it is considered ‘appropriate to resuscitate babies at this gestation and, if the response is encouraging, to start intensive care’. Of the 424 babies born at this gestation period in 1995, 48 per cent later died, although 27 per cent of the survivors had no identifiable impairment. Along with a steady rise in birth rates, there are increasing numbers of older mothers and those using fertility treatments – two groups of women who are more likely to have premature babies. Current medical guidelines issued by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine recommend that doctors do not attempt to resuscitate babies born before 24 weeks . According to data from 2011, those born alive at 27 weeks have an 87 per cent chance of surviving, at 28 weeks it is 92 per cent and at 29 weeks, 95 per cent. However, Lindsay Whittle, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales East, said: ‘Emma’s baby son was breathing for 93 minutes on his own and I believe every effort should have been made to give him a chance of life. ‘I admire Emma’s courage and back her campaign to help others in the future. ‘I will be writing to the Health Minister Mark Drakeford to ask for a meeting to discuss the current regulations concerning the cut-off period following a birth.’ Riley’s death was the second time Ms Jones has lost a child. He son Tyler was stillborn in 2012. The Welsh Government said the care of extremely pre-term babies is ‘extremely challenging’ and reviewed regularly as medical advances are made. A spokesman said: ‘Health boards follow guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine. ‘The current guidance does not prohibit resuscitation of babies at any age. ‘The decision to attempt resuscitation should be made by the clinical team in partnership with the parents, informed by the overall clinical situation and not just the gestational age of the baby. ‘But the guidance does reflect the sad reality that babies born under 23 weeks have very low chances of disability-free survival and this knowledge is a key part of the clinical decision-making.’ A spokesman for the University Hospital of Wales declined to comment.","Emma Jones gave birth to her son Riley at just 22 weeks and three days .

"Corporal William Savage was one of three British soldiers killed instantly when their Mastiff 2 vehicle was destroyed by an IED on April 30, 2013 . Three British soldiers were killed instantly when their armoured personnel carrier was destroyed after it struck an improvised explosive device (IED), their inquest has heard. Corporal William Savage, 30, from Penicuick, Midlothian; Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, from Edinburgh; and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, from Edinburgh died after their  Mastiff 2 was destroyed on April 30, 2013. Senior coroner for Oxfordshire Darren Salter, said the men were killed on Route 611 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district. A post-mortem on the three men concluded that they would have been deeply unconscious virtually instantly and virtually unaware of what had happened to them. Mr Salter said the Mastiff was designed to resist attacks from IEDs. The hearing heard that he trio, whe were all from B Company, 2nd Battalion, Scottish Regiment, were the first people to be killed inside the second evolution of the Mastiff since it was deployed in theatre in 2009. The inquest heard that the vehicle the three men died in had been damaged in another IED attack in May 2009. Despite the earlier damage and an ongoing problem with the locks on the rear of the vehicle, it had been declared battle-worthy shortly before the . Mr Salter said he would consider the level of protection afforded by the Mastiff when subjected to such an attack; whether there were any defects with the vehicle on the morning it went out on patrol; whether it should have been possible to detect he IED before it exploded and whether there was any intelligence available before the attack. The Royal Military Police made inquiries to the Afghan National Police about this incident, but no one was arrested over it. The Mastiff, a protective patrol vehicle, had been from Forward Operating Base Ouellette to another base at Lashkar Gah Durai and was on its way back again when the attack happened. It was one of four vehicles in the patrol. The driver of the Mastiff, Fusilier Paul Howell, said in a statement that the regular locks to the rear doors had been faulty, and he had reported them twice. He told the inquest that on the day in question, though they were stiff, they were fully sealed when closed. Fusilier Samuel Flint, left and Private Robert Hetherington, right, were singing the Dizzee Rascal song Baseline Junkie in the moments before their vehicle was destroyed by the powerful blast . The three men were the first to be killed in the Mastiff 2 vehicle, which had been first deployed on the battlefield in 2009. The men's inquest heard that the vehicle, pictured,  was designed to withstand IED attacks . Extra battle locks were not deployed, but they were not supposed to be when the vehicle was in open desert, only when there were potential public order situations, he said. He said in his statement that there were 20 ammunition tins under the seats in the rear, which was normal. Shortly before the blast, two of the dead men had been singing a Dizzee Rascal song as they sat at the rear of the vehicle. The three men were all flown to Camp Bastion followed the blast but they were all decalred dead shortly after arrival. The inquest heard that the dead men, were those who were sitting nearest the rear doors of the vehicle at the time of the explosion. They were travelling between Forward Operating Base Ouellette and Patrol Base Lashkar Gah Durai, when the bomb struck. The four-vehicle column had been told the night before the patrol that the road they were travelling was relatively quiet with normal civilian activity. Friends and relatives of the three soldiers stood silently as their bodies were brought from RAF Brize Norton . Members of Cpl Savage's family, including his wife Lyndsey (holding a red rose) stood as his body and the body of this two comrades were repatriated after they were killed in Afghanistan in April 2013 . Blast survivor Fusilier Scott Bell told the hearing Fusilier Flint and Private Hetheringgton were singing the Dizzee Rascal song Baseline Junkie moments before the blast, which occurred some time in the late morning. Fusilier Bell said: 'I felt a really hard thud like I had been in a car crash. 'There was a lot of dust everywhere.' The soldier noticed Fusilier Flint was still in his seat, Private Hetherington was slouched forward and Corporal Savage, aged 30 years, appeared to be sitting up. Fusillier Paul Howell, who was driving the Mastiff, said his 'mind went blank' for a while before waking up to see the front wheels blown off the vehicle. He said: 'I noticed the back doors were open. It was then that I noticed I was in pain.' Several other soldiers who were injured in the explosion recalled hazy memories of the incident. Sergeant Saiasi Vono, who was in a Husky vehicle ahead of the Mastiff, said he saw a 'thick cloud of dust and smoke' behind them. Sergeant Vono lead a team back to the damaged vehicle and climbed inside, calling to Corporal Savage, who did not respond. The three fatally injured soldiers and their colleagues were pulled from the wreckage as the convoy waited for a helicopter to take them to hospital at Camp Bastion, where they were declared dead. Post-mortem examinations revealed all three died from blast injuries caused by an explosion. Two forensic pathologists who carried out the examinations said there was nothing that could have been done to save the men, who would all have been unaware of what happened. The inquest continues and is expected to last a further two days.

"The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has pocketed nearly £25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms. The government quango passed on the private information of 8.7million drivers to dozens of companies so they could be pursued relentlessly over alleged unpaid fines. The latest twist in the ‘cowboy’ parking scandal shows the agency even divulged names and addresses of innocent people to ‘rogue firms’ that they knew had been convicted of criminal offences. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has pocketed nearly £25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms . The Mail, which highlighted the outrage during the summer, has demanded action after revealing the practice had turned into a multi-million-pound industry dubbed ‘legalised mugging’ by motoring groups. According to the DVLA, which holds details of all registered vehicle keepers in the UK, the amount it collected from parking firms more than doubled from £2.9million in 2010-11 to £6million in 2013-14. So far this year, it has raked in £4.3million from the lucrative private parking business and forecasts this will rise to £7.3million by the end of March 2015. That would make a total of £24.7million. Details are sold at £2.50 a time, often to firms levying parking charges on drivers using privately-owned car parks at NHS hospitals, supermarkets, shopping centres and even tourist attractions. The increase in income from parking companies seeking drivers’ details follows the ban on clamping, introduced in October 2012, and a change in the law which allows parking operators to pursue motorists for the payment of tickets rather than having to identify the driver at the time. The latest twist in the ‘cowboy’ parking scandal shows the agency even divulged names and addresses of innocent people to ‘rogue firms’ that they knew had been convicted of criminal offences . Official DVLA figures reveal 31 companies have paid for personal data, despite several receiving stinging criticism – and even criminal convictions – over their behaviour. Observices Parking Consultancy, for instance, spent more than £66,000 buying sensitive information of more than 20,000 motorists. Yet the firm and one of its directors had pleaded guilty in March 2011 to breaching trading standards by being ‘recklessly unfair’. The company, which operated in Wolverhampton, admitted 36 offences, including displaying 15 misleading signs at and sending letters from a debt recovery firm without revealing it was the same company as OPC. Meanwhile, Parking Eye, which has forked out more than £7million in five years, lost a court battle this year after trying to fine a motorist £100 for circling a car park - without stopping. Dave Hotchin, 49, spent half an hour waiting for a space without success before driving away from Fistral Beach car park in Newquay, Cornwall. Tory MP Michael Ellis said he was ‘worried’ about how the DVLA was selling drivers’ details . But two months later he received a demand for £100 saying the couple had been caught without a ticket by an automatic number plate reader. Parking Eye sent four further warnings to Mr Hotchin and his wife before launching a court action to get the money, but the judge threw out the claim because the pair had never parked. Tory MP Michael Ellis, who in 2011 supported the ban on private wheel clampers and sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said he was ‘worried’ about how the DVLA was selling drivers’ details. He said: ‘They have raked in a fortune. I think the DVLA has a duty and a responsibility to make sure they protect the personal and private information that they hold. ‘Part of that responsibility is to ensure they don’t give details to unscrupulous firms who make the lives of innocent motorists a misery and who should not be trusted with it. The DVLA must urgently review its practices. In the summer, the Daily Mail has revealed the aggressive tactics used by firms to coerce hundreds of thousands of drivers into paying inflated charges. Parking squads issue official-looking £100 tickets, often to drivers just a few minutes late returning to their cars. Rogue wardens working on hospital grounds have allegedly been ordered to focus on cancer wards because patients are likely to be distracted – and therefore late returning to their cars. Private parking companies also hit hundreds of thousands of drivers with ‘fines’ for minor infringements outside shops and fast-food chains. After issuing so-called penalty notices, they then use threats to terrify motorists into paying up. The campaign prompted Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to warn ‘bully boy’ tactics would not be tolerated and rogue firms could be prosecuted. The DVLA insisted it has strict of criteria for those using its electronic database, including valid data protection registration, probation periods and audits to monitor behaviour and use of data. The agency also denied profiting from the sale of personal information. It said: ‘The fees are set to recover the related administrative costs and this means that it is the applicant and not the taxpayer who funds this activity. ‘Landowners would have great difficulty in enforcing their rights if motorists were able to park with impunity on private property. ‘If it is alleged that the terms of the contract are breached, it is considered reasonable that vehicle keeper details may be released in order to enable the landowner or his agent the opportunity to pursue their legal rights. ‘If this were not the case, motorists would be able to park with disregard for the law or the rights of landowners, with no prospect of being held to account for their actions.’","Government quango passed on the private information of 8.7million drivers .

"The average father suffers 22 injuries a year caused by 'rough and tumble' while playing with the kids . The average father suffers 22 injuries a year caused by 'rough and tumble' while playing with the kids, it emerged today. A study of 2,000 parents revealed the wear and tear on Britain's fathers takes its toll from accidental kicks to the face - or worse - to bad backs from being a human climbing frame. In fact, the average father of school-aged children experiences 22 injuries per year - eight of those while playing with the little ones. He also bashes his shin three times on something the kids have left lying around the house and steps on a toy or plug four times-a-year on average. The research, commissioned by new family-focussed insurance brand There, found 40 per cent of fathers felt walking across a toy covered floor was the most dangerous aspect of being a parent. While those with cats or dogs can expect to trip over or have the family pet get under their feet a further four times per year. Fathers stumble on an item of clothing or other belonging that's been left out four times a year, while the dreaded prospect of an accidental hit to the crotch faces hits men twice a year. Clive Allison, Head of Member Recruitment for There, said: 'Every father wants to be able to play with their kids and make the most of enjoying those early years before the children quickly grow up. 'Clearly that comes with a few inevitable knocks and injuries when playing around outside or on the sofa or even trying to keep up with them in a football match. 'More often than not a knock or bash to the shin can be shaken off but the results show more serious injuries can happen and have even led to fathers taking time off work which can cause families problems financially.' The study also found a fifth of fathers have had to take time off work because of an injury picked up after doing everyday activity with the family. In these instances, the average time father was off work was for 10 days, most likely through injury to the back results showed. There's no let-up for fathers as just under a third have been head-butted by their young child while a quarter said play-fighting with the kids regularly saw them tweak something. Surprising result: The study found that 40 per cent of fathers felt walking across a toy covered floor was the most dangerous aspect of being a parent . Other areas of parenting where men have had a brush with injury were when having to play goalie kicking a ball around with the kids or when climbing trees with them. And a young at heart one in five have picked up an injury doing something which they confessed 'I should know better than to attempt at my age'. Few fathers have illness cover in place to protect in case they are too ill to work. In fact fathers are much more likely to have insurance to protect their mobile phones, pets, and holiday bookings than to protect themselves. 3 x back pain while playing . 3 x bashing shin or elbow on toy/coffee table . 2 x balls or whacks to the crotch . 4 x treading on a toy left out . 3 x accidental knocks to the face . 3 x trip over the pet . 4 x tripping over child's belonging . Fewer than one in five fathers polled had any illness cover in place and fewer than half the fathers polled had life insurance, with a fifth saying they just never had time to sort it. But when quizzed on how long the family could cope if the breadwinner was no longer able to work, results showed the average family would struggle to pay the rent or mortgage after only three months. Clive Allison added: 'Sometimes it's best for fathers to know your limits when it comes to trying to keep up with the children. Inevitably having fun with the kids and that desire to get involved in the games wins out and sometimes the wear and tear take its toll. 'Given the bashing that fathers get in their 'line of duty', it's surprising that so few think about how they would manage if a more serious injury were to happen. 'In fact the research shows that they're more likely to financially protect their phones and pets than they are themselves. 'We know that insurance drops down the priority list because it can be full of jargon or complicated and life just gets in the way. 'Having the proper protection in place to help ensure that the family won't be put under financial strain should an illness or injury mean they're unable to do their job for a number of months, can really help give peace of mind'.","Study of 2,000 parents revealed most common injuries to British fathers .

"Lee Osler, pictured leaving Hull Crown Court, admitted poisoning his partner's vodka with bleach in revenge after she dumped him . A jilted boyfriend poisoned the mother of his two children at a family party in revenge for the break-up of their five-year relationship. Lee Osler, 35, mixed 10ml of Mr Muscle bleach into Sarah Sutherland's vodka drink which she drank believing 'it tasted funny.' She put it down to a cheap orange mixer. The court heard he blamed Miss Sutherland, 34,for the break-up of their five-year relationship in which they had two children and told police he wanted 'revenge'. Osler had been handing his victim the drinks spiked with bleach during the children's party, two months after their break up. The mother-of-two woke the day after the party with a banging headache. The following two days she fell ill suffering from diarrhea not knowing she had been deliberately poisoned. When the truth emerged she began having panic attacks and sleepless nights. Osler a factory agency worker, of Portobello Street, Hull, pleaded guilty to a charge of administering poison with intent to injure Sarah Sutherland under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act and appeared for sentence at Hull Crown Court. Principal Crown advocate Philip Evans said the couple had been in a relationship for five years until it came to an end in October 2013. Osler had to move out of the family home to live with his sister and blamed Sutherland from the break-down in their relationship. He said they shared contact with their children Grace, 5, and Thomas, 4, but Osler - described by his partner as a loner - suffered from anxiety and depression and was referred to his doctor who advised him to seek counselling. During the course of the first telephone conversation with a counsellor Osler admitted he had been following Sarah Sutherland with a view to finding out where she lived and who she was seeing. 'He said he had put a chemical in her drink,' said Mr Evans. 'He told her that it did not work and that she was ok. The counsellor told Mr Osler she had to report the matter to the authorities. He agreed and was subsequently arrested by Humberside Police. Osler was handed an eight-month jail term suspended for two years at Hull Crown Court (pictured) as well as a three year restraining order . 'During the course of the police interview he said his ex-partner had a three-quarter litre bottle of vodka that was one quarter full. He said he had put 10ml of Mr Muscle bleach in her vodka. He said he did this to Sarah Sutherland as an act of revenge for the ending of the relationship when Osler went to her home for a children's party. 'Miss Sutherland recalls him pouring her vodka in a glass and he mixed it with Coca Cola. She said he then poured her a vodka and orange which she said tasted funny. She put that down to the cheap orange juice mixer. She said she recalled the peculiar taste. She recalled the next day she had a headache. 'By the Monday and Tuesday, because this happened on Saturday, she was experiencing diahorrea.' In a victim impact statement,  Miss Sutherland said since the poisoning she had experienced panic attacks and lost her self confidence. Mr Evans said Miss Sutherland wanted a restraining order to keep Mr Osler away. Defence barrister Robin Smith said: 'He accepts this was a wretched and dangerous thing to do to someone he loved and still loves. He believed the relationship did not break down because of his own problems, but that in some way it was her fault. 'He irrationally thought he should take revenge on her. He said it was not pre-planned. He is entirely remorseful. He is grateful it has not lead to more severe health problems. She recognised there was not something right with the drink but put it down to a cheap mixer. Any thoughts of a reconciliation with his partner, he recognises, are now over. 'He has not seen his children at all since the start of proceedings.' He said had it not been for the counselling telephone call, the authorities and his ex would never have known about the poison. Sentencing Judge David Tremberg said: 'Lee Osler, you are 35 and you have pleaded guilty to administering poison with intent to injure your former partner. It is said in the reports you are willing to accept any advice from people prepared to give it to you. Well here is a piece of advice from me: If you do anything like this again you are going to get locked up for years.' Judge Tremberg said he accepted at the time Osler was suffering mental health problems and was at the end of a relationship. 'You put a small amount of bleach in a bottle of alcohol which you encouraged your former partner to drink. While she was not immediately affected, she woke the next day feeling poorly and suffered a stomach upset. Mercifully the physical affects were not great, but the psychological affects have been significant. She has been losing sleep and experiencing panic attacks. This is akin to causing actual bodily harm.' He said the offence clearly crossed the custody threshold, but he had to take into account his guilty plea, that he was working, and that he was an isolated individual with no record of previous convictions. He said: 'This is your first and last chance.' Osler was handed an eight-month jail term suspended for two years and  a three year restraining order banning him from contact with Ms Sutherland unless through child and family services. He was also ordered to attend a building better relationships programme.","Lee Osler, 35, admitted putting bleach into his ex girlfriend's drink .

"Judge Douglas Moore told the teaching assistant there had been a 'gross breach of trust' before jailing him for 18 months . A shamed Commonwealth Games athlete has been jailed for 18 months after he admitted indulging in sexual activity with a schoolgirl. Decathalete Kevin Sempers, 29, molested the 14-year-old on two consecutive days - once after she called him in tears when she was been bitten by a dog. Sempers, a teaching assistant at a high school in west London who competed at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, was first contacted by the girl on Facebook 'as a dare'. They began messaging, innocently to begin with but became sexual and they exchanged mobile phone numbers, Isleworth Crown Court heard. Sempers suggested they meet up on 26 April last year and they went to a car park in Ealing where they kissed and touched each other. When the girl said she did not want sex because she was too young, Sempers replied: 'I'll wait.' The next day the student messaged Sempers saying she had been attacked by the dog, and the two met again - this time at an easyHotel carpark at Heathrow airport. They ended up in the the backseat of his car where Sempers assaulted her. After the girl confided in her friends, her school and social services received anonymous phone calls from a worried parent expressing concerns about Sempers' relationship with the girl. Last month Sempers pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child under 16 just a day after a jury had been sworn in to try him. Jailing Sempers, Judge Douglas Moore said: 'It's important to understand that you have a position of responsibility as a teaching assistant. 'I bear in mind the fact that initially in 2011 you had been involved involved in, and I accept that there was no ill will, Facebook contact with several girls. The Commonwealth Games athlete, pictured speaking after the European Cup Combined events in Hengelo, admitted indulging in sexual activity with a schoolgirl . Sempers, pictured competing at the European Cup Combined where he finished in 6th place with a score of 7503 points, was initially contacted by the girl on Facebook as a dare . 'It is also accepted that the complainant contacted you as a dare, but it is perfectly clear you had opportunities to say to her do not contact me again. 'Instead you carried on and entered in a conversation over a period of time which led to the contact with this young girl. Meeting one was arranged and ended with what can only be described as a passionate kiss. 'The young girl said that she didn't want to have sex but you, in text form, and in my judgement very arrogantly, said 'I'll wait.' 'The second occasion I accept you did not initiate. You went into the back seat (of your car) at your behest, you took off her shirt and lay on the top of her. But the  29-year-old, pictured in 2010 at the European Cup Combined events in Hengelo, arranged to meet up with the girl and went onto molest her over two days . 'I accept to a limited degree that you may have taken the matter further. There was a gross breach of trust here - this girl was undoubtedly highly vulnerable and impressionable. 'You knew full well you should not have contacted her and in my judgement there was an element of grooming. Perhaps your vanity and desire encouraged you to go ahead. Sempers had narrowly missed out on a bronze when he represented England at the Delhi Commonwealth Games in 2010 . The decathlete managed a personal best of 3,968 points on the first day of competition, which put him into fourth place going into the final day . But the second day, Sempers performance dropped and he eventually came in fifth place . 'It is perfectly clear that this is entirely of your own making. Those who prey on young girls will undoubtedly receive an immediate custodial sentence of some duration.' The court heard Sempers was deeply remorseful for his 'awful and damaging' choices which had damaged both his and the student's families. He claimed he admitted the offence so his victim would not suffer the ordeal of testifying in court, it was said. Sempers, of Ferndale Crescent, Uxbridge, west London, admitted two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child under 16 years. He was jailed for 18 months and will remain on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.","Decathalete Kevin Sempers, 29, molested the 14-year-old over two days .

"This Christmas a new campaign has been launched  with the aim of doing away with traditional 'girls' and 'boys' toys, instead encouraging children to play with gender-neutral items. The 'No Gender December' movement was kick-started by grassroots organisation Play Unlimited, and argues that subjecting children to strict gender stereotypes can perpetuate discrimination. They have called on consumers to boycott the aisles of pink and blue merchandise which line shops across the country, and avoid stereotypes during this year's Christmas shopping. Scroll down for video . A new campaign called No Gender December by group Play Unlimited has been launched asking people to boycott gendered presents this Christmas . Australian Greens spokesperson for women Larissa Waters has thrown her support behind the campaign, encouraging friends and relatives to make informed decisions when purchasing gifts this festive season. Australian Greens spokesperson for women Larissa Waters has thrown her support behind the campaign . 'Out-dated stereotypes about girls and boys and men and women, perpetuate gender inequality, which can feed into very serious problems such as domestic violence and the gender pay gap,' Senator Waters said. 'The separate aisles of pink and blue common in many stores might seem harmless, especially to well-meaning relatives and friends, who are buying plenty of children’s gifts at this time of the year. 'However, setting such stark gender roles at such an early age can have a long-term impacts on our children, including impacting self-perception and career choices later in life,' she added. Play Unlimited co-founder Julie Huberman, based in Queensland, hopes the campaign will prompt toy companies to become more inclusive in their marketing. 'We don't to stop girls from playing with dolls or boys playing with trucks,' Ms Huberman told Daily Mail Australia. 'We want kids to be able to choose rather than being told what to play with. There are plenty of little girls out there who want to play with trucks. 'It’s 2014 – women mow lawns and men push prams but while we've moved on, many toy companies haven’t,' Ms Huberman said. 'It's not doing away with anything but just making it a choice.' She argues that gender stereotypes instilled in kids from a young age can lead to more complex problems like domestic violence later in life . However the campaign has already come under fire from one child psychologist, who argues that the link between gender stereotyped toys and domestic violence is 'a stretch'. 'These gender differences are hard wired, and while I’m sure socialisation plays a role, to argue that toys in any way relate to domestic violence is, I think, too far a stretch,' Dr Michael Carr-Gregg told News Corp. On its website, Play Unlimited makes the argument that continuing to abide by 'old-fashioned' gendered stereotypes could be damaging for young children. 'Listing toys as being either for girls or for boys could have the effect of alienating a boy from feeling okay about showing interest in say ‘crafts and arts’ and vice-versa for a girl who may otherwise have gravitated towards a remote control helicopter. Child psychologist Dr Michael Carr-Gregg said the link between toys and domestic violence is 'a stretch' Play Unlimited co-founder Julie Huberman said 'We don't to stop girls from playing with dolls or boys playing with trucks' 'Both labels ‘boys/girls’ and gender stereotyped packaging (pink/blue or darker colours), inform children and others “this toy is/is not for you”,' the website reads. The campaign calls on people to take the pledge not to purchase gendered toys this Christmas, and also urges supporters to sign a petition with the aim of getting the Australian government to legislate against gendered marketing. 'By standing together we can send a strong message to toy companies that that there is no place for toys perpetuating outdated gender stereotypes under our Christmas trees or in our homes,' Ms Huberman said.","A new campaign has been launched aiming to do away with gendered toys for children .

"Fishermen in one corner of China face an official crackdown on their technique of using home-made bombs to blast fish out of the water. So-called 'blast fishing' is outlawed in many countries because of the destructive and unpredictable effect it can have on the marine ecosystems that support fish stocks. But the practise is nonetheless thriving in Dayawan Bay, by the city of Huizhou, on the South China Sea coast of Guangdong province, south-east China. Visitors there can even pay to go out with the fishermen and throw a few bombs in the water themselves. Scroll down for video . Ka-blooey: An explosion in Dayawan Bay, south-east China, sends spray up into the air . Easy catch: The fishermen then simply net all the dead or stunned fish that have risen to the surface . Big haul: Yet the number of fish that rise to the surface is apparently far fewer than sink right to the bottom . These pictures, taken in an area described by travel guides as 'an unpolluted, quiet paradise for sea-lovers', show fishermen hurling explosives into the water to stun or kill fish. Their target in these snaps are yellow croakers that they head out to catch every November. But the explosions also kill other sea life in the area and severely damage the underlying habitat. Underwater shockwaves from the explosions stun fish and rupture their swim bladders - the tiny gas-filled organs that help fish to control their buoyancy. The rupturing causes an abrupt loss of buoyancy, so while a small number of fish float to the surface, many more sink to the sea floor, where they join any other marine organisms indiscriminately killed by the blasts. Controversial: Blast fishing is outlawed in many countries because of the damage is cases to marine life . Sledgehammer: The fisherman are after yellow croakers but end up killing many more creatures as well . Taking a break: These pictures show fishermen who allegedly use blast fishing to make their catches . Poor living: A Chinese Fishery Bureau spokesman said the fishermen make more from tourists than fish . Now the irresponsible practise has also become a tourist attraction. Horrified angler Liau Xiou, 32, who unwittingly signed up to a trip in Dayawan Bay, said: 'We saw an advert promising 'fishing action'. 'We assumed it meant fun and paid the 30 GBP to have a go. 'We'd been out for about 30 minutes when the men told us they were going to feed the fishes. 'They were laughing and stuffing the bottles with powder and what looked like stones. 'They then threw them overboard and just seconds later there was a huge serious of explosions. 'And then all these dead fish appeared floating on the surface which the fishermen hauled in with nets. 'I was absolutely disgusted and shocked beyond belief.' A spokesman for the Chinese Fishery Bureau said: 'These fishermen make most of their money from taking tourists out to watch them at work. 'We are attempting to crack down on it though.'","Blast fishing outlawed in many countries because it damages environment .

"Four family members have died in a tragic crash when their car was involved in a three-vehicle collision in South Australia. The group of five were travelling in a black four-wheel-drive Ford Ranger after a Nissan utility and a flatbed truck collided at about 11.45am at an intersection of the Princes Highway and Main Road at Hatherleigh, just north of Millicent on Monday. Four people - Josh Doyle, 22, his sister Jessica Doyle, 16, and mother Michelle Doyle, 45, from Mount Gambier and grandmother Bev Khan, 68, from Victoria - all died at the scene. The fifth person in the vehicle, the male front seat passenger, was taken to Mt Gambier Hospital with minor injuries. Josh Doyle, 22, and his sister Jessica Doyle, 16, died at the scene after a car collision on Monday morning . Mother Michelle Doyle, 45, also died in the horror car accident after the 4WD collided with the truck and ute . Four members of a family have died in a three-vehicle crash in South Australia's south-east on Monday . It is believed that the family were returning home after working at the family-owned business 'Waves of Robe' in Robe in the Limestone Coast of South Australia. A family friend, Wendy Zadow, from Mount Gambier told Daily Mail Australia the town has been shaken up by the tragic news and thoughts are with the kids' father and Michelle's husband, Darren. 'We were neighbours for many years and our children played together a lot and I knew them very well,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They used to own one of the Mobil Service Stations here in Mount Gambier and so everyone knew the family very well. 'Josh has a restaurant 'Waves of Robe' at Robe, so they would've been travelling home to Mt Gambier. 'It's bad any time when an accident happens but this close to Christmas - it's extra sad.' Jessica Doyle and her grandmother Bev Khan, 68, both died after a horrific car accident at Hatherleigh . The family were believed to be returning home from Robe, where Josh Doyle runs a restaurant . Community member Josh Lynagh told Daily Mail Australia: 'When something like this happens, it's shocking for the whole community. 'Today locals are mourning the loss of a local family, tragically killed as the result of a horrible accident just north of Millicent. 'These were people many of us knew, and I'm sure those who knew them well could tell you more about just what our community has lost. 'In times like this, in the midst of mourning and trying to come to terms with everything, we must also take the time to cherish the lives of those important to us, and to remember all aspects of safe driving - especially coming into the holiday season when our roads will be busier than ever. 'Rest in Peace to those we have lost, and my personal condolences to those who have a long recovery ahead of them, both physically and emotionally.' The collision occured at an intersection of the Princes Highway and Main Road at Hatherleigh, north of Millicent . The community and friends have taken to Facebook to share their grief and pay tribute to the family. 'Oh Josh you were such a great kid. We will never understand why this tragedy occurred. We think of your father during this distressing time. RIP now Josh x' 'R.I.P beautiful people you'll never be forgotten' 'Beautiful babies. Forever young. RIP x' 'it's heart wrenching to know the family that was lost due to what seems to be careless driving. I can't fathom the pain that family is going through right now. To bury your wife and your only 2 children anytime let alone just before Christmas is something that no one ever should have to go through. R.I.P ' 'Sad day for the southeast, sending prayers to all those effected by yesterday's tragedy' Police say a ute and a truck collided, followed by a four-wheel-drive at about 11.45am on Monday . The fifth person in the vehicle, the front seat passenger, was taken to Mt Gambier Hospital with minor injuries . The two male drivers of the utility and truck were taken to Millicent Hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Traffic Support Branch Officer in Charge Superintendent Bob Fauser told Daily Mail Australia that police are currently investigating the crash site. 'Four people, all from the same family have died. An event like this will impact the family, their friends and the close-knit community of the South-East forever. 'I ask everyone to pause for a moment and put yourself in the position of this family and consider whether even one death on our roads is acceptable. And if for even a moment you think that it is acceptable - then ask yourself, would it be acceptable if it was your family?' Two other drivers from the utility and truck were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries . Police are currently investigating the crash scene but all roads have reopened again . Police Commissioner Gary Burns told ABC Radio it was a real tragedy for a whole family to be killed at any time, but particularly in the lead-up to Christmas. Mt Gambier Senior Sergeant Chris King told Adelaide Now that it was too early to determine what had caused the accident. 'It’s a tragic scene, terrible, it’s a great loss of life,' he told Adelaide Now. 'Country roads are inherently dangerous places to drive and we urge anyone driving on country roads not to be complacent and to drive appropriately to the conditions. 'Any of these incidents are terrible because you know there is a family that is going to be destroyed over Christmas and for a long time on.' The four tragic deaths bring the States' road toll to 92 compared to 91 at the same time last year . Police Major Crash Investigators were called to the crash site, with the Princes Highway closed for several hours to all traffic. A South Australian police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that police are currently investigating the scene but all roads have reopened again.

"Rare pictures showing three of the four Beatles on holiday before Beatlemania took hold have emerged for sale and serve as a 'time capsule' before they shot to super stardom. The colour photographs of a youthful looking Paul, George and Ringo, were captured in Tenerife by Astrid Kirchherr - who's fiancee and 'fifth Beatle' Stuart Sutcliffe had tragically died a year before. In April 1963 the band's manager, Brian Epstein, told them to take a holiday after a tough year of recording, touring and recovering from Sutcliffe's death. Scroll down for video . Posing up: Rare pictures showing Paul, George and Ringo from the Beatles on holiday in Tenerife before the band became world famous are to be sold in the U.S. on Friday . Casually unaware: Paul, 20, sports a plaster on his nose to protect against the harsh sun while photographer Astrid Kirchherr and George look cool for the camera . Close: One image shows Kirchherr canoodling with George who wears a dress shirt and swimming shorts . Nothing to see here: In one picture a sunbather is seen strolling past without batting an eyelid at the musicians who were already well on their way to super stardom . The band that made her name: Kirchherr is still the photographer most readily associated with the Beatles, according to Eric Bradley, of Heritage Auctions in Dallas . Taken on the first anniversary of his death, Paul and George are seen wearing formal, long-sleeve shirts over skimpy swimming shorts as they relax by the seaside while smoking cigarettes. One image shows Kirchherr canoodling with George while in another Paul, 20, wears a plaster on his nose to protect it from the sun. Despite having already tasted success with their  hit 'Love Me Do' six months earlier, the band were relatively unknown at this time. In one picture a sunbather is seen strolling past without even batting an eyelid at the musicians. John Lennon was also on holiday at the same time, but chose to go to Spain with Epstein. The holiday came just weeks before 'Beatlemania' took off in the UK following the band's second number one song 'From Me to You' in May 1963. Kirchherr was meant to have produced 100 portfolios of prints from her Tenerife negatives but she only ever made 15. Almost famous: Paul looks far from a super star, pictured in a buttoned-up shirt and short swimming shorts . The start of things to come: George strikes a pose behind black wayfarers, as Kirchherr sits behind him . Three's company: Paul and Kirchherr cuddle-up as George clowns-about with a sticker on his nose . More than a band: Mr Bradley said the pictures capture the Beatles as friends, rather than stars in the making . Back to back: Paul and Ringo take a seat and pose for a picture beside the pool in Tenerife . One of these images is now coming up for public auction for the first time at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, U.S. Eric Bradley, of Heritage, said the pictures capture the Beatles as friends, rather than stars in the making. He said: 'These pictures are simply photos of good, close friends. It is clear they are quite relaxed in each other's company. 'They capture the Beatles just before the onset of Beatlemania. They are still able to be in unguarded in public, something they weren't able to do ever again, anywhere in the world, just a few months later. Kirchherr took the photos with her portable Rolleicord camera and each print is numbered and signed . Mr Bradley said of the collection: 'These photos are a lovely time capsule of a quiet moment just before the most intense explosion of fame the world has ever witnessed' Mr Bradley said: 'Once the fame occurred, the Beatles were not allowed to be private citizens ever again. These photos are a lovely time capsule of a quiet moment just before the most intense explosion of fame the world has ever witnessed.' The Beatles were very popular in Germany during their early days and Kirchherr became friendly with them, in particular Sutcliffe who died of a brain haemorrhage. Mr Bradley said: 'It is not an understatement to say that Astrid Kirchherr is still the photographer most readily associated with the Beatles - not just because of the powerful images of the group. 'Sutcliffe, influenced by Kirchherr, was the first Beatle to adopt the 'moptop' haircut.' Kirchherr took the photos with her portable Rolleicord camera. Each print is signed by her and numbered 11/100. The 11 prints, that measure 11.5ins by 8ins, are being sold by a private collector. They are expected to sell for £6,000 when they are offered for auction on Friday. Mr Bradley said: 'We are not aware of any other Tenerife '63 portfolio having been offered at auction, ever.","The pictures were taken six months after their hit 'Love Me Do'

"A judge has ruled that parts of Utah's law banning polygamy are unconstitutional, effectively decriminalizing the practice, in a victory for the family that appears in the reality TV show 'Sister Wives'. Kody Brown, who stars in the TLC reality show with his four wives, filed a lawsuit against the state after leaving Utah fearing prosecution after the programme aired. Now a federal judge has issued his final ruling in the case that strikes down parts of the state's anti-polygamy law. Scroll down for video . Kody Brown poses with his four wives, back Janelle and Christine, front Meri and Robyn, who appear in the TLC reality TV show 'Sister Wives'. A judge has ruled that banning in polygamy in their home state of Utah is unconstitutional . U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups has ruled that a provision of Utah's law forbidding cohabitation violated the Browns' freedom of religion. He ruled in favour of the family in December and has now said that Mr Brown and his wives can collect attorneys' fees. It caps a landmark decision for the family that sued Utah in 2011 after a county prosecutor threatened to charge them following the premiere of the TV show. The Emmy-nominated series had brought Mr Brown and his wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn to the attention of the authorities in their home town of Lehi, and police were considering a bigamy charge. It wasn't immediately clear how much the Browns could collect in attorneys' fees. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in February he intended to appeal the ruling once it was made final. Kody Brown, pictured with his children, was threatened with prosecution after the programme aired . On Wednesday, his office said in a written statement that it was reviewing the ruling and 'will make final determination of whether or not to appeal one or more of the issues in the decision within the coming weeks.' Meanwhile the Brown family attorney Jonathan Turley said they were overwhelmed and thankful for the ruling. 'This was a historic ruling that I believe will stand the test of time,' Mr Turley said. He added the family would continue the legal battle to an appeals court or even the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The Browns said they were forced to leave Utah for Las Vegas in 2011 in fear of prosecution, however Mr Turley said he didn't know if they would return in the wake of the ruling. The Browns said they were forced to leave Utah for Las Vegas in 2011 in fear of prosecution but have yet to decide if they will return to Utah . 'The important thing is that they now can move back to Utah,' he added explaining that the family has missed the state. 'They now have the choice.' Fundamentalist Mormon polygamists believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. The mainstream Mormon church strictly prohibits the practice. The bigamy law in Utah is stricter than the laws in 49 other states - most of which prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. Utah makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together.","Judge rules banning cohabitation violated religious freedom of the Browns .

"Almost 1,000 students from mainland Europe falsely claimed more than £5million in taxpayer-funded loans and grants amid lax controls on private colleges, spending watchdogs revealed today. The students – mainly from Romania and Bulgaria – were handed nearly £5,500 each on average to study in Britain after officials failed to make proper residence checks. The revelation prompted accusations that the Government had presided over an ‘incredible’ misuse of public funds after failing to control a huge expansion in private providers of higher education. Almost 1,000 students from mainland Europe falsely claimed more than £5million in taxpayer-funded loans and grants amid lax controls on private colleges, spending watchdogs revealed today . Ministers allowed private colleges greater access to public money in the form of loans for tuition fees and living costs but failed to prevent taxpayers’ money being used for ‘private gain’, it is claimed. Some colleges were found to be recruiting students with ‘limited’ English and barely any checks of capability or motivation. There are suspicions that, once tuition fees had been paid to the college and student loans or grants paid to the student, large numbers simply dropped out of their courses. Drop-out rates at some private colleges were found to be running at 20 per cent. Some colleges have been dubbed the ‘cashpoint’ by students because they gave them easy access to student finance. Critical: Labour MP Margaret Hodge has called the £5.4 million agreed in loans to ineligible students ‘incredible’ One - the London School of Science and Technology, which is located above a tile depot in Wembley, north London and was highlighted by whistle-blowers earlier this year – was found to have 273 ‘potentially ineligible applicants’ for financial support, 36 of whom had already been paid before stricter checks were introduced. Details of the wrongful payments to overseas students emerged today in a report by the National Audit Office. Suspicions the system was being abused were first raised by a surge in applications for financial help with living costs from European Union nationals, many from Romanians. It also emerged that more than 80 per cent of new students at some providers were of Romanian or Bulgarian origin. Further concerns were sparked by bulk applications from the same internet location – in some cases 50 per day. Until September last year, the Student Loans Company (SLC) relied mainly on the word of students that they had lived in the UK for three years needed – the residence criteria for help with living costs. An emergency review of more than 11,000 applications found that half – 5,548 – were potentially false. These applicants could or would not provide proof - such as bank statements, payslips or utility bills – of three years’ residence. Of these, 992 of those had already been handed the money they applied for. As of the middle of November, only £350,000 of the £5.4 million had been recovered by SLC, the NAO said. Of the potentially ineligible claims, 84 per cent came from students registered for courses at just 16 alternative providers. In its report, the NAO also drew attention to high drop-out rates at nine alternative providers. At these colleges, one in five students dropped out part-way through the year – five times the average for higher education. But BIS had not set any threshold for what was an acceptable rate where students are receiving support from public funds, it noted. In further findings, the said that up to 20 per cent of students at alternative providers may not even have been registered for a qualification with an awarding body. Following Coalition reforms, students at alternative providers – which are mainly for-profit private colleges – are allowed to claim maintenance loans and grants worth up to £11,000-a-year. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union, believes it has taken far too long for the issue to be addressed . Colleges themselves can be handed £6,000 in tuition fees for each student they enrol. The shake-up was aimed at driving up standards and challenging existing universities by increasing competition. Between 2010/11 and 2013/14, the number of students from EU member states claiming public money to study at alternative providers ballooned from 7,000 to 53,000, with the associated bill rising from £50million to £675million. Officials from BIS, SLC and the Higher Education Funding Council for England face a grilling by MPs over the problems later this month. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said the expansion had been allowed without proper safeguards against abuse, branding the £5.4 million agreed in loans to ineligible students ‘incredible’. ‘The Department went ahead with its reforms to expand the role of private colleges without ensuring there were controls in place to ensure that taxpayers’ money was used for its intended purpose of supporting higher education and not for private gain,’ she said. ‘This extraordinary rate of expansion, high drop-out rates, and warnings from within the sector ought to have set alarm bells ringing. ‘As Government hands more and more taxpayers’ money to private companies and institutions to deliver services for the public good, we have to be able to follow the taxpayers’ pound wherever it is spent.’ Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union, said: ‘While we are pleased the misuse of public funds is finally being brought to light, we remain angry that it took so long to happen. We raised the issues of for-profit colleges’ access to taxpayers’ money time and again with ministers, but we were ignored at every turn.’","Government accused of ‘incredible’ misuse of public funds .

"A slimming advert featuring former Loose Women star Denise Welch has been banned after a watchdog said her two-stone weight loss in two months was too fast. The 56-year-old's before and after photos sparked a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after they featured in a social media campaign for diet firm LighterLife. Today Ms Welch hit out at the ruling - and said watchdog officials 'need to get out more'. Scroll down for video . Weight loss: The Advertising Standards Authority has banned a slimming advert which showed before (above) and after photos of Loose Women's former star Denise Welch . Online: The disputed adverts appeared on the Facebook page for slimming firm LighterLife . The Facebook page for the slimming firm, for whom the former Coronation Street actress is an ambassador, featured her pictures with the boast: 'Denise lost two stone in just two months.' It sparked a complaint which challenged whether the ad complied with rules on weight-loss advertising, which say a loss of more than two pounds a week can be unhealthy. Ms Welch's weight loss was around four and a half pounds a week. The ASA said claims of exact weight loss had to be 'must be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice'. Backlash: Ms Welch said officials needed to 'get out more' and her weight loss was totally healthy . So it banned the advert from appearing in the same form again, despite acknowledging Ms Welch had faced potential health problems from being overweight. 'We understood that Denise Welch had been classed as overweight when her weight loss programme began and also that her waist circumference was very high, which put her at high risk of health problems,' the ruling said. 'However, the code specified that for those who were normally overweight, a rate of weight loss greater than 2lb a week was unlikely to be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice. 'While we understood that LighterLife had given an account of the actual rate of weight loss experienced by Ms Welch, we noted the rate advertised was greater than 2lb per week. 'We had not seen evidence to demonstrate that the rate of loss experienced by Ms Welch was compatible with code requirements. 'We told LighterLife to ensure that rates of weight loss were compatible with good medical and nutritional practice and that treatments for obesity were not advertised to the public without suitably qualified supervision.' The actress hit out at the ruling, saying: 'The Advertising Standards people need to get out more. 'Weight loss companies are trying to help people, and yet they aren't even allowed to tell us what they can do for us. 'And LighterLife has been prevented from using my weight loss before and after photos as the ASA says I lost weight too quickly. How can that be right, when the Foodpacks comply with all the nutritional rules, including Trading Standards, and I did exactly what I was supposed to do with them. 'I felt better than I had for ages, and those are genuine before and after pictures. 'Meanwhile obesity is increasing [and] people are dying from cancer, heart disease and diabetes.' In its submissions to the ASA, LighterLife said Ms Welch's weight loss was in line with expected results for those on a very low calorie diet (VLCD) programme. A spokesman for LighterLife said Ms Welch had eaten more than 600 calories a day to meet guidelines . It added that while the rate was greater than 2lb a week, this did not mean that it was incompatible with good  practice. Ms Welch also ate more than 600 calories a day, in accordance with guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). LighterLife medical director Dr Matt Capehorn said: 'This shows just why Britain is in its current mess, with one of the biggest obesity problems on the planet. 'There is something wrong when weight loss companies are trying to help dieters, and bureaucracy gets in the way.'","Facebook image showed before and after shots of former Corrie star .

"A team of diggers has started removing 2,500 tonnes of waste from a 40ft-high rat-infested rubbish pile which has blighted the lives of residents for the past three years. The towering mountain of putrid rubbish sits at the end of cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, and is laden with everything . imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges . to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles. The stinking mound - which residents say 'smells like rotting corpses' - is also prone to catching fire, as 'hot spots' smoulder deep inside the 60-ft wide pile of rubbish. Fire crews have now been called to 23 fires at the site - one of which lasted ten days - which has cost the taxpayer £650,000. Scroll down for video . This 40ft pile of stinking rubbish has blighted the lives of . residents living in a cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, since . 2011. Now, experts from the Environment Agency are starting to remove . some of the waste . The Environment Agency, which has been locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site, has called in experts to remove 2,500 tonnes of rubbish from the 20,000 tonne pile . The towering mountain, which sits at the end of cul-de-sac, is laden with everything imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles . Now the Environment Agency - which is locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site - has ordered experts to remove some of the mess so the pile is at a 'safe' level and stops spontaneously catching fire. But fed-up locals in Cornwall Drive, St Paul's Cray, say the action is not enough - and have called for the entire 20,000-tonne mountain to be removed. Jan Watkins, 60, a grandmother-of-two, said: 'It is a plague. It is a living nightmare. It is really, really horrible. You can't open your doors or your windows. The smell that comes through is like rotting corpses. 'You can't go out, it is in your clothes, in your hair, because the smell gets in them. You can't use your garden. Many residents have sore throats and coughs. Anybody who has a breathing problem suffers greatly.' Ms Watkins said residents had been campaigning to clear the site for three years and accused the EA of allowing the mound to spiral out of control by failing to take swift action. She said she feared the frequent fires . were belching toxic fumes which could be endangering the health of her . two young grandchildren, whom she looks after during the day. She said: 'If the Environment Agency . had taken action when we wanted them to two and a half years ago it . would be half the size. We feel very, very let down.' The mountain of garbage has been a problem for residents since rubbish disposal . company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011. Fire crews have been called to 23 fires at . the site, mostly during the hot summer weather, costing the taxpayer £650,000 and taking up 2,000 hours of firefighters' time . But residents say efforts by the EA to remove some of the waste - which includes rotting industrial waste, tyres, scrap metal and even excrement - is too little too late. They are campaigning for the entire tip to be removed . According . to its website, the firm’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . and it ‘specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that . can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity.’ It charges people to dump rubbish at the site during the day and the night, which it then sorts, treats and sends on for disposal elsewhere. But residents say this practice does not happen and instead, over the past couple of . years, Waste4Fuel has simply taken the money and let it stack up into a . monstrous pile. Resident Denise Clark, 34, a mother-of-two, said : 'The smell, especially when it's hot, is repugnant, disgusting. It makes you feel sick to the stomach. It's like living next to a sewage . works. 'We have a real rat . problem. The size of the rats are massive - up to 2ft with their tails. I . have a three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter and it makes me . fear for their health. My son has eczema and it is not good for him.' Diggers working on the site is the first sign of any tangible action . being taken to free the residents of the rat-infested rubbish mound, which regularly catches fire . Waste4Fuel uses the site as a waste transfer site where it 'processes . general non-hazardous waste'. It is allowed a maximum of 5,500 tonnes on the site at . a time - but has almost four times that amount . She said local schools do not allow children out in the playground at break when the rubbish pile is on fire because of health fears. She added that residents fear the pile will one day cause a fire that gets out of control and spreads. She said: 'About 18 months ago there was a fire that lasted 10 days and that was pretty scary. If the wind was blowing the other way it could have taken the whole street out.' Ms Clark also blamed the unsightly 'scourge' for sending house prices in the street down, saying house prices had plummeted by £100,000. The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council. But . its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the . Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site ‘as a waste . transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste, from commercial . operators with [a maximum] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time.’ The pile is often seen emitting steam, as . rubbish smoulders deep inside the mound, pictured left. It is that which . has forced the EA to send in workers, pictured right, in a bid to take . the mound to a 'safe' level . The height and width of the giant mound mean most residents can see the rubbish pile from their window. Resident Denise Clark, 34, said the smell is 'repugnant, disgusting' and it is 'like living next to a sewage works' The . Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm, claiming it has not been paying for . the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere. Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April. But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order. The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson. The charges were in relation to . Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire . breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site. Resident Jan Watkins, 60, said she cannot open her doors or windows because the smell comes through like 'rotting corpses'. She said the smell even gets in her hair and on her clothes when she steps outside . Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents . But, in July this year, the High Court dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal. Talking about the team of diggers, the EA said: 'Environment Agency contractors have entered the Waste4Fuel site in Orpington in an operation to lower the illegal waste pile to a safe level. 'The Environment Agency's battle to ensure that the site operator and landowner clean up the site is continuing, but is taking this rare step to reduce the blight on the local community.' Rob Wise, environment manager at the EA, said: 'We understand the frustration of local residents and we will continue our fight against Waste4Fuel. 'It is not right that taxpayers should pick up the bill for this operation when it remains the responsibility of the site operator and landowners, but the priority is to make the site as safe as possible. 'We are committed to working with our partners, including the London Borough of Bromley, to find a long-term solution.'","The 40ft tip, which is also 60ft wide, has 20,000 tonnes of rubbish which towers above street near Orpington, Kent .

"Losing a treasured item can leave you feeling sick, so spare a thought for Francesco Plateroti. The art collector from Italy left a 13th century piece by Chinese painter Wang Zhenpeng called The Banquet of Immortals on the Terrace of Jade on a high speed TGV train from Paris to Geneva. Mr Plateroti got off the train in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, a French town close to the Swiss border, before realising the artwork - worth €1million (£800,000) - was still in his briefcase in the carriage. Train: An art collector  left a 13th century piece on a high speed TGV service (file photo) from Paris to Geneva . He alerted staff who searched the train upon its arrival at the next stop of Geneva last month, but nothing was found, and Mr Plateroti is now offering a reward for the safe return of the painting. He said that despite the painting’s high value it was unsaleable without the cultural certificate of authenticity he still had in his possession. He had been showing the work at an exhibition in Paris. Mr Plateroti told The Local journalist Simone Flückiger: ‘I was crushed when I realised I didn’t have it with me. It was a massive shock. People take advantage of my misfortune. ‘They are calling me to say they have the painting and that they will send it once I put the reward money in their bank accounts. This all makes having lost the painting a lot worse.’ Station: Mr Plateroti got off the train in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, a French town close to the Swiss border . But he said: ‘You have to be optimistic. After all, a positive attitude can overcome many obstacles.’ All lost property items on the TGV are sent to a central office in Berne, Swizerland. But there has been no sign yet of the painting, which dates from the Yuan dynasty of 1280 to 1329. Mr Plateroti added: ‘Anyone who finds and returns this will be well compensated. I am hopeful that I will have it back soon.’ The collector had been travelling on the 9789 TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) train from Paris to Geneva on November 21, which left the French capital at 8.11pm local time (7.11pm GMT).","13th century art called The Banquet of Immortals on the Terrace of Jade .

"David Cameron and Nick Clegg were accused of 'doing an Obama' after making separate whistle-stop visits to Stonehenge today. The Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader stopped for photos at the world famous site to highlight a £15 billion road expansion. It comes after the US President stopped off at Stonehenge on his return home from the Nato summit in Newport in September. David Cameron visited Stonehenge today to highlight a tunnel passing Stonehenge, which is among dozens of new road schemes announced by the government . Mr Cameron arrived at the Wiltshire site to welcome the £15bm investment into Britian's roads . Mr Cameron's visit came after Nick Clegg visited the World Heritage Site earlier this morning . Mr Clegg was first to arrive at Stonehenge – trumpeting the Government's announcement that the A303 close to the famous stones will be put into a tunnel, thus easing conditions at a notorious bottleneck. The Prime Minister then arrived at the Wiltshire landmark claiming there was now an 'unstoppable momentum' behind the scheme. He said: 'I think we are both delighted that it is going ahead because it's been the work of our Government to get the Government's finances under control. 'But frankly the more politicians that come here and say it's good that we are building the roads the country needs, frankly the happier I will be.' Asked whether the project would go ahead even if there was a change of government in May, Mr Cameron said: 'It has unstoppable momentum now, because the plan for the tunnel is robust, the money in the national budget is there, the vital importance of infrastructure is now accepted by everybody. I think this is now unstoppable.' The tunnel is part of a £2 billion scheme to dual the entire A303 and A358 to the South West. This will allow road users to drive on a dual carriageway from London to within 15 miles of Land's End. But MPs tonight accused the the Tory and Lib Dem leaders of a cynical bid to drum up votes ahead of the next election. Labour's Grahame Morris said: 'This is a blatant political stunt that would make US President Obama blush. 'The British public see through these stage managed photograph opportunities. The fact that Cameron and Clegg are going round the country attempting to cast themsleves as a cross between Braveheart and Swampy is laughable and faintly ridiculous.' Mr Obama visited the stones in his presidential helicopter Marine One, which flew to Boscombe Down Airbase, Wiltshire, before his motorcade drove to the ancient monument. The president was then given a guided tour by curator Heather Sebire. English Heritage, which manages the site, said it was 'an honour' to host the president. President Barack Obama visits Stonehenge after leaving the NATO summit in Newport, Wales, in September . General manager of Stonehenge, Kate Davies, said: 'His office told us the president was very interested to see the iconic monument for himself. 'Every day people from all over the world make the trip to the ancient stones but this visit was a particularly special one.' Ms Sebire said Mr Obama 'was fascinated by the story of the stones, what we know about them and the mysteries that have yet to be solved'. She went on: 'He described the atmosphere around the stones as 'really special' and his visit to Stonehenge as 'a highlight of my tour'. Mr Obama described seeing the monument as 'cool' and said it was something he could tick off his 'bucket list'.","David Cameron and Nick Clegg turn up at Stonehenge to hail new tunnel .

"This is the 22-year-old Nordstrom worker who was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend on Black Friday. Nadia Ezaldein was gunned down on the store floor by Marcus Dee, 31, on the manic shopping day, which was also her birthday. The killing came seven months after she applied from a protection order after he allegedly broke her ribs, fractured her jaw and tore her clothing in a vicious attack. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: Nadia Ezaldein, pictured, was killed while working in a Chicago branch of Nordstrom on her 22nd birthday by her ex-boyfriend, against whom she had filed for a protection order . Court struggle: Ezaldein, left, asked for court protection from Marcus Dee, 31, right, after he allegedly broke her ribs and jaw and put a gun in her mouth in a fight . Dee, who killed himself before police could move in on the store, also put a gun in Ezaldein's mouth during the confrontation, according to the court documents, filed in April. Her twin sister told a judge on April 8 that Dee, 31, also 'stabbed her jacket with a switch knife, ripped her boots and bruised her lip. [He] threw her clothes out the window and put [a] gun in her mouth'. The application was filed a day after Dee applied for protection against Nadia's twin sister, who he claimed was trying to get him arrested and kicked out of the Army. Both applications were denied. Worker: Ezaldein had taken on seasonal work at the retailer in order to pay her law tuition fees . Scene: A man shot his ex-girlfriend in the cosmetics section of a Nordstrom in Chicago before killing himself in an attempted murder-suicide . Corden: Chicago police secure the entrance to The Shops at North Bridge  that leads to the Nordstrom store in downtown Chicago, where the two people were shot . Ezaldein, a seasonal worker at Nordstrom's downtown Chicago branch, was fatally gunned down by Dee at the store on Friday - her 22nd birthday - before he turned the gun on himself. She was rushed to hospital and placed on life support, but died on Saturday at 3:43pm, a day after her family had planned a surprise dinner for her birthday. Dee was declared dead at the scene. Ezaldein's relatives had flown in from Florida especially to surprise the University of Chicago law student for her birthday. She had taken the job so she could afford her tuition fees. Today, a friend posted a tribute on Facebook to her. It said: 'RIP my sweet beautiful beam of light. I won't ever forget our beautiful and pure last moment Thursday morning. You got me. You are my angel forever. 'Fly on my angel. You are the prettiest one I bet. I will miss you until I see you again. How could he take you away from me? The world needed you, I needed you. I still need you.' The victim started dating Dee in August 2012 after meeting him through her older sister's roommate, her family members, who wished to remain unnamed, told the Chicago Tribune. However, in the 14 months that followed, she was repeatedly abused and beaten up, they said. She was allegedly hesitant to report abuse because his parents were Chicago police officers. 'She thought his parents could cover it up,' one of Ezaldein's sisters said, adding that the entire family would receive constant phone calls and texts from Dee following the pair's break-up. The store's management decided to close the branch today following the 'tragic situation that occured' She was hospitalized after Dee shoved a handgun into her mouth in December 2013 following months of 'psychological torment' and physical abuse, her family said. Although she subsequently ended the relationship, she and her siblings then received threatening calls from Dee on a regular basis, forcing her to change her number three times, they said. Speaking of Friday's shooting through tears, her sister added: 'It is the worst situation ever. Our sister came up to visit her in Chicago from Florida. We made dinner. We were supposed to have fun. 'She’s the smartest person I know. She didn’t deserve to die.' The victim's brother told the Chicago Sun-Times that Dee used 'a lot of emotional traumatizing phrases and words' to his sister during their relationship, saying: 'It was a very strange circumstance.' A spokesperson speaking outside on Saturday said: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees' On Saturday, Nordstrom posted on its Facebook page: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that our employee who was injured in Friday evening's tragedy at our Michigan Avenue store passed away this afternoon' At one point, Dee tried to file a restraining order against Ezaldein - who had moved to Chicago from Florida in 2009 to start studying law - but the request was denied by a judge, it is reported. On Friday, crowds in the upscale department store off North Michigan Avenue were sent into a panic as they heard gunshots on the second floor at around 8.30pm and hurried out of the building. Hundreds of shoppers were inside at the the time for the Black Friday sales. Ezaldein, originally from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was reportedly shot in the head and neck area. The company decided to close the store on Saturday, meaning many customers hoping to catch the sales were turned away. It was due to reopen at 11am on Sunday. A spokesperson said on Saturday: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees'. Panic: The store was filled with customers at the time during the Black Market sales. Shoppers ran to all exits of the building when they heard the shots ring out . A sign in the windows said the branch would not be opening its doors due to the 'tragic situation that occurred'. Michelle Smith, 47, was buying purses with her daughter Krystal, 25, when they heard two gunshots. She told the Chicago Tribune: 'It was a pow and a pow. It was a stampede coming down the escalator. Authorities reiterated that no one else was in harms way and that the suspect entered the store with the intent to hurt his ex-girlfriend. However they stressed that the store was an active crime scene. Suzanne Nanos-Gusching was on the third floor with her daughter who was trying on a dress for a sorority formal at the University of Michigan when shots rang out. 'We just saw people running out and they (the employees) rushed her to get dress,' he told the paper. 'They were adamant about getting us out of the building.' Janis Tillman who was in the store at the time told NBC Chicago: . 'I was right around the corner when an eyewitness came out. I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'I saw somebody.. I saw the guy pull out a gun, shot her, and then he then shot himself.' She was shaken. Very shaken.'

"Joan Rivers could have been saved following her medical procedure gone wrong if doctors had headed signs the comedian was going into shock, claims new report. Rivers' doctors ignored her dropping blood pressure and pulse and even failed to call 911 for 10 precious minutes as they attempted to resuscitate her once they realized she was dying, according to Page Six. Prior to that, insiders, outside experts and the findings of a federal report reveal that Drs. Lawrence Cohen and Gwen Korovin--along with an unnamed anesthesiologist--carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with Rivers. Drs. Lawrence Cohen (left) and Gwen Korovin (right) were part of a small team of medical care providers that a state report says 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention' in the late Joan Rivers' routine procedure gone wrong . But something was wrong at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28 and the trouble started after 9am, when Rivers was put under with normal vital signs. Fifteen minutes later, Rivers started showing signs of shock as her blood pressure  dropped to 92/54 and her pulse fell to 56. 'At this point, something has gone wrong, the procedure must come to an end, and she needs to be resuscitated,' a veteran paramedic not involved in the case told the Post. The doctors failed to act when Rivers' vital signs dropped even further, reports the Post. Instead, with the 81-year-old's blood pressure at 89/44 and her pulse at 54, the doctors administered propofol--the powerful anesthetic that led to the death of Michael Jackson. 'That doesn’t make any sense,' said Page Six's paramedic. 'You’re sedating someone who’s going into shock.' Even as she began coding, with her bp at 84/40, and her pulse at 47, the examination reportedly continued. That was at 9:28am, 12 minutes after Rivers' vital signs should have first caused concern. Still, the examination continued, with just an increase to her oxygen flow. 'Routine': Rivers, 81, was put under anesthesia for a routine procedure on August 28 from which she would never wake up . The tragedy occurred at Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan. Investigators say the doctors who performed the procedure failed to act as Rivers showed signs her condition was deteriorating . Two minutes later, the examination was stopped and records show the doctors began trying to resuscitate Rivers with life-saving drugs. They wouldn't call 911 for another ten minutes. And records indicate they did not administer CPR as they awaited the paramedics. By the time they arrived at 9:47, paramedics found Rivers' turning blue form lack of oxygen. A state report released early in November said the clinic 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention.' Rivers died September 4 of brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The federal Department of Health and Human Services has given Yorkville Endoscopy until January 7 to correct deficiencies to avoid losing Medicare accreditation. The clinic said it has submitted a plan to state and federal accreditation agencies addressing all issues raised. It said the physicians involved no longer provide services there. Also among the series of blunders reported by the New York Post's Page Six, was that staff at the Manhattan clinic failed to weigh Joan before sedating her with Propofol. Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, (seen left with Joan at a red carpet event and right with her son more recently during a shopping trip after her mothers' death) will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz . Melissa Rivers is preparing to launch legal action against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. She will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother's personal ENT doctor Gwen Korovin as well. A source told MailOnline: 'Melissa is undaunted, she's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved. These doctors will rue the day they went near Joan.' Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz.

Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.'","Reports and insider accounts reveal doctors at the Manhattan clinic where the comedian died ignored signs that Rivers was in trouble .

"Ouija boards are flying off the shelves. Not in the super- natural sense — but the commercial one. The device, said to be a method of contacting the spirit world, is experiencing an unexpected renaissance. Google reports that sales of the board are up 300 per cent, and it is threatening to become a Christmas ‘must buy’. The culprit is Hollywood, and a new horror film titled Ouija. Low-budget, lowbrow, it tells a familiar story — of kids dabbling with the ‘other side’ and coming off second best. The critics hammered it, but cinema-going teens, looking for something scary in the Halloween season, loved it. Scroll down for video . Spooky: The device, said to be a method of contacting the spirit world, is experiencing an unexpected renaissance . Cue big box office takings and huge demand for Ouija boards, many manufactured by the American toys giant Hasbro. Being a canny company, Hasbro even helped finance the making of the film Ouija, which has put new life into the business of talking to the dead. All rather amusing. Or not, depending on how one views this strange product, named after the French and German words for ‘yes’. To some, the Ouija board represents a harmless form of enjoyment, a pretend-scary rite of passage for teenagers in search of thrills on a stormy night. But to others, churchmen included, it is a danger to be avoided, a trigger for psychological harm — or something worse. ‘It’s like opening a shutter in one’s soul and letting in the supernatural,’ says Peter Irwin-Clark, a Church of England vicar who has witnessed the dark side of Ouija. ‘There are spiritual realities out there and they can be very negative.’ Players are told to sit around the board, each place two fingers ‘lightly’ on the pointer, and concentrate . And he is adamantly opposed to the sale of Ouija boards as toys. ‘It is absolutely appalling. I would very strongly advise parents not to buy Ouija boards for children.’ The board itself is a simple thing, combining the letters of the alphabet and the numbers 0 to 9 with the words Yes, No and Good-Bye. With it comes a planchette or pointer. Players are told to sit around the board, each place two fingers ‘lightly’ on the pointer, and concentrate — before starting to ask questions in turn. ‘Ask your questions slowly and clearly,’ read the instructions. ‘And wait to see what the planchette spells out for you.’ The planchette then ‘moves of its own volition’ towards specific letters and numbers, according to Christina Oakley Harrington, proprietor of Treadwell’s, a London bookshop specialising in the esoteric and the occult. ‘You feel it pulling away from the fingers. I’m not dim — I have a PhD — but it’s not being pushed. It’s mysterious.’ An American invention, the board was a child of the spiritualist craze of the 19th century when mediums proliferated and seances were common in well-to-do homes. Ouija took off again in the Sixties, outstripping sales of Monopoly in its best year. Cash-strapped teens made their own versions, using an upturned glass and paper scribbled with letters . Ouija took off again in the Sixties, outstripping sales of Monopoly in its best year. Cash-strapped teens made their own versions, using an upturned glass and paper scribbled with letters. But the age of the Ouija board’s innocence was about to end. The year 1973 saw the release of hit film The Exorcist, in which a young girl takes to communicating with an unseen being by means of such a board. The being is a demon that goes on to possess her, before being exorcised by priests. William Peter Blatty, author of the novel on which it was based, was inspired by a tale from the Forties, about Roland Doe. The teenager was said to have become possessed after playing with a Ouija board for long spells, his spiritual infestation manifested by scratches, levitation and poltergeist activity. Only after he was exorcised by Catholic priests did he return to normal life. ‘The horror film shifted the focus of Ouija to the idea of lost or malevolent spirits,’ says Miss Oakley Harrington. ‘That was where the culture of danger came in. Once you have something said to be a way of consorting with malevolent spirits, you get the Church involved.’ An American invention, the board was a child of the spiritualist craze of the 19th century when mediums proliferated and seances were common in well-to-do homes . But the Reverend Irwin-Clark does not doubt that the threat is real. ‘I would hugely recommend people not to have anything to do with the occult,’ he says. ‘People find they are having strange dreams, strange things happening to them, even poltergeist activity.’ Anthony Hayne is a Catholic priest who specialised in exorcism before his retirement. Interviewed a few years ago, Father Hayne said he had dealt with a few teenagers who ‘had been using Ouija boards and had let the darkness into their lives’. And the late Reverend Tom Willis practised as a Minister of Deliverance — jargon for an exorcist — for the Anglican Archdiocese of York for half a century, advising Archbishops on the occult. He, too, saw the board as a source of danger. ‘A lot more people are dabbling in the occult and having seances, and that is causing a lot of problems,’ he said in 2012. ‘In the Sixties, the Ouija board caused so many problems — people ending up in mental hospitals because of what they have experienced.’ The year 1973 saw the release of hit film The Exorcist, in which a young girl takes to communicating with an unseen being by means of such a board . An unseen force spelling out messages, he explained, may have sinister motives. ‘It may pretend to be your grandmother you’re in contact with, but it might be something more evil that suddenly gives you some bad advice.’ On one occasion, he remembered, he was contacted by three dockers from Hull who had used a Ouija board the previous evening. ‘They just sat there shaking,’ he said. One person not scared by Ouija is Terence Hines. He is a professor of psychology at Pace University, New York, and has written about them in his debunking study Pseudoscience And The Paranormal. Like many sceptics, he believes the participants are themselves pushing the planchette to spell out messages. But, curiously, he does not attribute this to dishonesty. It could be entirely subconscious control, he believes. In support of this theory, Canadian paranormal investigator James Randi once blindfolded people taking part in a Ouija session. The result was nothing more than gibberish — talkative spirits appeared to be silenced when the players couldn’t see the board’s letters. Perhaps all this will leave only one section of British society taking Ouija boards seriously this Christmas — the retailers cashing in on the sales boom.","The device is said to be a method of contacting the spirit world .

The one page letter, obtained by Daily Mail  Australia, was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk. Written on November 11,  exactly a week before he was granted bail on strict conditions including not drinking alcohol, Tostee's note specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27. Less than two weeks before the 28-year-old allegedly murdered Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony, police detected Tostee at 3am  on the highway across the NSW border. 'It was a wake up call"" : Gable Tostee claims getting caught by police for high range drink driving on July 28 was the 'wake up call I needed ... before something worse happened'. Twelve days later Warriena Wright (pcitured) fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony after a night of serious drinking . 'I am dangerous and drowning in alcohol': Gable Tostee's handwritten note, penned in prison, confesses his serious binge drinking problem and the fact he has endangered people's lives while drinking excessively . He was 'travelling at high speed' and when eventually he was stopped, in Queensland, was charged with high range drink driving in an incident Tostee describes in his handwritten note as 'immature and dangerous'. 'I am completely ashamed of myself,' he wrote, 'I ... put the lives of my friends, other road users and yourselves as officers at risk. 'I have disappointed myself and my family who have done their best to raise and support me. Since then I have finally come to accept that I have a problem with binge drinking and I am taking measures ... to deal with my issues in ways that do not involved drowning myself with alcohol. 'Wittier on alcohol': Gable Tostee thinks he is wittier on alcohol but admits he has been binge drinking to ease social anxietties for 11 years since Schoolies . 'My foolish and immature attitude has cost me ... being stopped that night was the wake-up call I needed and I am thankful that it happened before something potentially much worse happened.' Twelve days later, following an alleged drinking session at his Surfers Paradise apartment, 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright died at around 2.20am. The note is among several court documents filed by Tostee's lawyers to gain freedom on bail while he awaits his murder trial, which is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017. In an affidavit  filed by Tostee in the Queensland Supreme Court, he says he recalls 'being in a state of panic' during the July police pursuit and that 'I 100% accept I screwed up' and had been 'so reckless'. He also claims he is 'wittier' when drinking alcohol and admits he has been a 'danger to the public' while binge drinking since the age of 17. Both he and his father, Gray Tostee, admit his extreme alcohol problem began at Schoolies 11 years ago and continued as he tried to cope with his 'social anxieties'. Now on bail and living at his parents' house at Carrara on the Gold Coast, Tostee says he still intends to 'go out' and has applied for his curfew to be reduced to just six hours, from 10pm to 4am and he only wants to be alcohol tested on Sundays. In the affidavit he says, 'I have a problem with excessive alcohol consumption. 'I commenced my consumption of alcohol socially on the Gold Coast when I was 17 years of age at Schoolies. I found that it helped me resolve my anxieties in interacting with others by improving my confidence. 'Since that time  I have relied on alcohol to deal with my social anxiety. When I drink alcohol socially I feel at ease with people. 'Without alcohol I am quite reserved and less talkative. I find that I am slow to think and do not feel as witty when I am sober. A danger to the public: In applying for bail on a charged of allegedly murdering Warrien Wright (pcictured), Gable Tostee has admitted he is a danger to the public while binge drinking and then driving . 'When intoxicated I feel wittier, more relatable and confident. I accept that I have a problem with drinking to excess (binge drinking) and that I use alcohol as a crutch'. In his affidavit, Gray Tostee says it was a shock when he and wife Helene discovered their son had 'consumed alcohol to excess' since the age of 17. 'Gable and I are very close and I love him very much ... unfortunately since the age of about 23 1/2 onwards Gable's social anxieties were largely addressed by him in a destructive fashion with alcohol. 'Gable seemed to get into some difficult situations due to alcohol, and sometimes legal issues arose.' In his affadavit, Gable Tostee admits he was drunk when he allegedly resisted police during another incident on January  27 after he allegedly refused to pay a tuk tuk driver. Tostee 'was heavily intoxicated', police told the court, between 2am and 3am on January 27, when he was arrested after allegedly insulting officers. His lawyers have tendered in evidence a transcript of the CCTV of the incident, in which police allegedly say they are charging him 'for being a d***head'. Tostee, 28, left prison on a $200,000 surety put up by his parents on November 18, three months after he was arrested for Ms Wright's alleged murder. His bail conditions include not using the mobile dating app Tinder, and other social media sites including Facebook. The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee arriving at his parents' home in Carrara home after his release from prison. He will spend at least the next two years there while on bail as long as he doesn't breach his conditions not to drink or use Tinder . Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, under six hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via Tinder. Gold Coast Police Prosecutions legal division sergeant Michael Campbell labelled Mr Tostee's contact with 'persons over the dating site' as 'substantial'. In an email to Mr Tostee's lawyers tendered as part of the bail proceedings, Sergeant Campbell said that 'Police conducted extensive inquiries in relation to the defendant's' actions on Tinder. Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright, following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in  Surfers Paradise,but admits he has had a binge drinking problem since Schoolies . Sergeant Campbell noted that while the majority of witness statements for the case had already been collected, police were still chasing 50 outstanding statements from witnesses interstate and overseas. At Tostee's bail hearing last month, prosecutors alleged he locked 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony and that was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Accused murderer Gable Tostee (pictured, walking from a Brisbane prison on bail last month) has admitted he feels 'wittier' while on alcohol which he has been abusing for the last 11 years . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . Eased conditions: Gable Tostee is living at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail, not drink alcohol, not use dating app Tinder but wants to 'go out' and have his curfew eased tom 10pm to 4am . Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing. ‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said. Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming. Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment . But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. The prosecution claimed Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.

"Police have come under fire after using one of their official riot vans to give Father Christmas a lift as part of a festive parade. Crowds looked on in disbelief when Santa climbed inside the police van  in Aberdare town centre, Cynon Valley, rather than taking his sleigh. Police used the vehicle to give him a taxi ride away from the event in what has been described as an 'ill-judged' stunt. Father Christmas gave a cheery wave to the people of Abadare before being taken away in the police van . Father Christmas disappears inside the police van. Police later clarified that he had not been arrested . Officials said transporting Father Christmas in a police van had always been part of the plan .

"A group of female NYPD officers are facing disciplinary action after photos of them in uniform were posted on sexy Instagram account. The policewomen posted photos of themselves posing away from work alongside images of them wearing their badges - allegedly violating the department's social media policy. The collection of shots, which have appeared alongside other officers from around the country, are then turning up on sites such as Blueline Beauties which describes itself as being: 'Dedicated to Law Enforcement Women'. One of the female officers posted a picture of herself with Santa Claus pin above her badge alongside one of her on a night out. They could face disciplinary action for violating NYPD social media policy . The policewomen involved are allegedly breaking the department's social media regulations because they are uploading photos of themselves away from official ceremonies . Those who want to be featured on the profile have to send in their pictures. One of officers had a Santa badge pinned above her suit with an accompanying snap of her wearing a tiny black dress, showing off a tattoo on her thigh. Another took a selfie while wearing uniform and sent it in along with a shot flaunting her cleavage and another pursing her lips while preparing for a night out. The New York Daily News reported that cops are not allowed to take photos of themselves in uniform and post them online unless they are at official ceremonies. The force began issuing guidelines for how officers should use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites in 2013. An internal order revealed members of the nation's largest police department to be careful with what they reveal online. It includes being vigilant when identifying themselves with the force. The document stated that officers 'are to exercise good judgment and demonstrate professionalism expected of them while performing their official duties.' It also warns that 'personal social media sites may be used against them to undermine the credibility of the department, interfere with official police business, compromise ongoing investigations and affect their employment status.' The cops could be punished as a result of the actions, with the severity ranging from the loss of vacation days to termination from the force . The same year, Mail Online revealed that an investigation had begun into NYPD officers posing alongside force patrol cars and motorcycles on their dating profiles. In a statement in response to the probe, John J. McCarthy, NYPD Deputy Commissioner, said: 'Members of the Police Department are prohibited from posting photographs of themselves in uniform without the prior authorization. 'This does not include photographs taken during official department ceremonies. This directive is in compliance with the New York City Social Media Policy and is in part intended to protect officers from divulging identifying information on social media sites that may endanger officer safety. Breach of these guidelines can result in harsh disciplinary action including termination. However sources told the Daily News that the female officers involved could lose 10 days vacation. It is unknown whether officers from other departments around the country could be punished as the policies vary between forces. According to the Baltimore Sun the city's police department do not regulate their use of social media. Cops from around the country, including this one from Baltimore PD, have also sent their pictures to the profile for them to be uploaded.

"Martin Litton, pictured in 2012, was a  fierce wilderness advocate involved in some of the 20th century's biggest conservation battles. He died on Sunday aged 97 at his home in California . Fierce environmentalist Martin Litton, a bold whitewater navigator and even bolder advocate for preserving the wildlands of the American West, has died at age 97. Litton had been in hospice care and died at his home in Portola Valley, California, on Sunday, said Alison Sheehey, programs director at Sequoia ForestKeeper, where Litton was president. Litton was 'active in protecting the environment until just a few days ago,' Sheehey said. Litton fought his way to the center of some of the biggest environmental battles of the last century, fiercely opposing the damming of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon — a fight he would win — and the building of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant on the California coast — a fight his side would bitterly lose. He was an unapologetic extremist for environmental causes, saying in one 2012 interview that if he could issue royal decrees, he'd take down the Golden Gate Bridge. 'I never felt it did any good to be reasonable about anything in conservation,' he was quoted as saying in a statement on his death from Sequoia ForestKeeper, 'because what you give away will never come back — ever.' He also opposed the building of a ski resort in Mineral King Valley in California's Sierra Nevada and spearheaded the creation of Redwood National Park. A California native who spent childhood summers camping in Yosemite National Park, Litton made his name and his legend as a guide on the Colorado River, pioneering and popularizing oar-powered recreation through the Grand Canyon and eventually earning a spot in the International Whitewater Hall of Fame. He first made the trip down the river in 1955, always preferring wooden boats to inflatable rafts, and kept making it into his 90s. He ran his last river trip in 2009 at the age of 92, during a fundraiser for Sequoia ForestKeeper. He would go on to found several environmental organizations but also served on the board of the more mainstream Sierra Club from 1964 to 1972, when he was a loud voice for taking hard stances, making sure the club didn't acquiesce to a pair of federal proposals to erect dams in the Grand Canyon. 'If I hadn't done what I did, I think it's very likely at least one of those dams would have been put in the canyon,' Litton said in a 2011 interview with the Los Angeles Times, which first reported his death Monday. 'I was the only one screaming about them.' Scroll down for video . Martin Litton, pictured in 1991, rowing a dory in the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. He was active in protecting the environment in the days before his death . Born in Los Angeles, California, on February 13, 1917, Martin was the son of veterinarian and the eldest of four children his parents raised during the Great Depression. His father, Clyde was originally from Tennessee and his mother, Elsie came from San Francisco. Litton graduated from Inglewood High School in 1934 and entered UCLA where he graduated in 1938 with a degree in English. During college he enrolled in the mandatory two-year ROTC program and then continued onto the optional officer training program, becoming a reserve officer after graduation. During World War II he joined the Army Air corps, but due to color blindness was disqualified from flying P-40 fighters, but convinced doctors that he could still become a glider pilot. In 1942 he married Esther Clewette, but their honeymoon was cut short by his immediate deployment to the 82 Airborne’s 325th Glider Infantry Wing to fly sorties over Europe. After the war he and Esther raised  their four children in Bel Air until 1961 when they moved to northern California. In 1942 he married Esther Clewette, with whom he had four children, John, Donald, Kathleen and Helen . During World War II, Litton (left) flew sorties over Europe as part of the 82 Airborne’s 325th Glider Infantry Wing . In 1952, Litton took his first raft ride through rapids and joined the fight to protect Dinosaur National Monument from proposals to dam two nearby rivers. His first trip down the Grand Canyon was in 1955, and he subsequently pioneered a huge victory against damming the Colorado, which would have backed up the Colorado River, flooding the Grand Canyon and making it a lake. Continuing to make trips down the river he founded the Grand Canyon Dories in 1971. He owned that commercial rafting company until 1990. Serving as the Travel Editor for Sunset Magazine from 1954-1968, he wrote passionately about the grandeur of western landscapes. In 1960, the magazine ran a cover story by Litton entitled 'The Redwood Country', which is credited with launching a campaign that eventually led to the establishment of Redwood National Park along the northern California coast. After many years of battling Sequoia National Forest’s non-stop logging program, a slight victory was achieved with the U.S. Forest Service signing the 1990 Sequoia Mediated Settlement Agreement to restore the logged sequoia groves to their natural condition and by the Presidential Proclamation in 1992. However logging continued. In early 2000, President Clinton created the 327,000-acre Giant Sequoia National Monument protecting the sequoia groves in perpetuity, but four years after the creation of the monument, the Forest Service returned to business as usual with even more logging proposed. In response, Martin and many more alarmed activists helped create the non-profit organization Sequoia ForestKeeper in 2001 to become the “eyes, ears, and voice of the forest” of the southern Sierra Nevada. Litton is survived by his wife, Esther; children John, Donald, Kathleen and Helen; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

"As a fashion designer her clothes sell for thousands of pounds, but fans of Victoria Beckham will now be able to own one of her pieces for for just £90. The 40-year-old is turning her creative skills to a more philanthropic cause in support of World Aids Day 2014, and has created a limited edition T-shirt featuring a screen printed campaign ribbon logo. Scroll down for video . Victoria Beckham has design a T-shirt in support of World Aids Day 2014 . The T-shirt costs £90 and will be sold at the Victoria Beckham London store and online . The T-shirt will be sold at the chic minimalist Victoria Beckham Dover Street Store in London as well as online at victoriabeckham.com. Having recently been appointed as UNAIDS Global Goodwill Ambassador, Victoria is donating all proceeds from the sale of the t-shirt and pin  to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS) to support their efforts in ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. 'My personal commitment to raise awareness and resources to end the AIDS epidemic is one that is shared by my brand and we wanted to mark World Aids Day with an initiative that my customers could also participate in,' the former Spice Girl said of her charitable venture. Victoria  made her debut on the political world stage back in September when she was formally named as a goodwill ambassador . Speaking at the United Nations building in New York upon the announcement of her new role she said was ‘honoured’ to be made an ambassador for their UNAIDS campaign. Beckham – who missed the opening of her London store to be there – said she was inspired following a recent trip to South Africa, where she met with children stricken by the deadly disease. The fashion designer visited Cape Town in February as part of the Born Free initiative, which tackles the issue of HIV being transmitted from mothers to their children . In August, Beckham hosted an online sale of 600 items from her wardrobe to raise money and awareness for mothers living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. However this T-shirt represents the first marriage between Victoria's lucrative fashion label and her UN work. Beckham – who missed the opening of her London store to recieve a certificate marking her role as a UN Goodwill Amb ambassador in September– said she felt her public profile meant she had a duty to do more . She said: 'I recently visited South Africa and was so touched by the women I met and felt inspired. I came home and I knew I had to do something' 'I am so pleased that Victoria is choosing to mark World Aids Day 2014 with this excellent initiative bringing together the worlds of fashion and activism. 'Thanks to her commitment as UNAIDS Global Goodwill Ambassador, we will raise awareness and much needed resources to get closer to our shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths,' said Michel Sidibé Executive Director of UNAIDS. The Victoria Beckham Jeans white T-shirt, £90, will be available from December 1st, through to December 31st. In addition, all those who purchase the t-shirt will receive a small red World Aids Day ribbon pin which is also available for purchase for £1 at the store. Both the store and the website will also mark the day with a red tint takeover in both the window and on the homepage. The UN is working towards the goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. The most recent figures, collected in 2013, revealed 35 million people were living with HIV - an estimated 0.8 per cent of the world's adult population. There were 2.1 million adults and children newly infected with HIV last year. 1.5 million adults and children died of HIV in 2013. Just 15 countries account for more than 75 per cent of the 2.1 million new HIV infections that occurred in 2013. Nine are in Africa: Cameroon, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. But the spotlight is also on Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States. The burden of HIV varies from country to country, as does each country's resources for treating the disease. One of the key problems is that 19 million of the 35 million people living with HIV today do not know that they have the virus. HIV is more prevalent among people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have gay sex and transgender women, than among the rest of the adult population. Michel Sidibé, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids said: 'If we accelerate all HIV scale-up by 2020, we will be on track to end the epidemic by 2030. 'If not, we risk significantly increasing the time it would take - adding a decade, if not more.'","Victoria Beckham's T-shirt features a simple World AIDS Day ribbon logo .

"Two women are facing prison after they admitted this week to encouraging their friend to run over and kill a black man with his pick up during a deliberate mission to target and attack African Americans. James Anderson, was run over by a Ford F250 truck outside a hotel in Jackson, Mississisppi, after being brutally beaten and robbed in 2011. His assault was caught by a hotel surveillance camera – which has already resulted in the conviction of driver Deryl Dedmon who boasted afterwards to his friends - ‘I ran that n***** over.' Now two 21-year-old women who were in Dedmon’s truck and encouraged him to finish Anderson off are facing prison sentences after pleading guilty on Friday in connection with not just Anderson's death but a whole series of attacks on African-Americans in Mississippi.

Sarah Graves, left, and Shelbie Richards, right, are facing prison after pleading guilty in connection with a series of attacks including the 2011 death of James Anderson in Jackson, Mississippi . The death of James Anderson, pictured, sparked a broader investigation into reports that young white men and women were driving from mostly white Rankin County into majority-black Jackson to assault African-Americans . Shelbie Richards and Sarah Graves, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the federal hate crime law. Anderson's death sparked a broader investigation into reports that young white men and women were driving from mostly white Rankin County into majority-black Jackson to assault African-Americans. Richards and Graves admitted that on June 26, 2011, they encouraged their co-conspirators to leave Brandon with them to assault 'n******,' in Jackson. Richards further admitted that she encouraged her co-conspirator Deryl Dedmon to hit Anderson with his truck. In addition, Richards admitted that she falsely told law enforcement officers that she did not remember a fight between Dedmon and Anderson, and that she did not encourage Dedmon to strike Anderson with his truck. The two women from Brandon face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for breaking the hate crime law, while Richards faces an additional three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for concealing information about Anderson's death from investigators. Anderson, was run over by a Ford F250 truck outside a Jackson hotel in 2011. His assault was caught by a hotel surveillance camera . Richards further admitted that she encouraged her co-conspirator Deryl Dedmon, pictured, to hit Anderson with his truck . Dedmon was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Anderson in March 2012 . 'No person should have to fear that they will be attacked because of the color of their skin as they walk the streets of their own city,' said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division, reports The Clarion-Ledger. Apart from Anderson's death, prosecutors say at least two other assaults occurred, in addition to an attempted assault. Other victims have not been publicly identified. Prosecutors said the suspects usually sought out people who were homeless or drunk. Prosecutors said assailants used their fists, beer bottles, sling shots and vehicles in the attacks. Six others - Dedmon, John Rice, Dylan Butler, William Montgomery, Jonathan Gaskamp, and Joseph Dominick - have also pleaded guilty. They have yet to be sentenced. 'This investigation started with the tragic death of James Anderson, ' said Special Agent in Charge Donald Alway of the FBI Mississippi Division. 'Since then, the FBI has continued its efforts to identify and bring to justice all those individuals who conspired to deprive Mr. Anderson and other African-American citizens of their civil rights simply because of the color of their skin.' Dedmon was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Anderson in March 2012. He was part of a group of white youths from largely white Rankin County who decided to ‘go f*** with some n******,’ after a night of partying and drinking, law enforcement officials have said, quoting some of the suspects in the case. According to investigators, they drove 16 miles in two vehicles from Rankin County to Jackson, where after exiting the highway, they found Anderson alone in a parking lot about 4 a.m. on June 26. The white men allegedly beat Anderson repeatedly, yelling racial epithets including ‘white power’. After the beating, Dedmon drove his Ford F-250 truck over the man, leaving him to die. Shortly afterward, Dedmon boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. 'I ran that n***** over,' he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the youths in the other car. Six others including Deryl Dedmon, John Rice, Dylan Butler, William Montgomery, Jonathan Gaskamp, and Joseph Dominick have also pleaded guilty .","Shelbie Richards and Sarah Graves, both 21, have pleaded guilty in connection with a series of attacks on African-Americans in Mississippi .

"The father of a suspected teenage jihadist has reportedly staged a daring mission to rescue his son from the clutches of Islamic State fighters in Syria. After learning that 19-year-old Ahmed Mohammadi had left his home in Cardiff, Wales, allegedly to join ISIS fighters, his father Karim journeyed 2,000 miles to bring him back to Britain. He is believed to be the first British father to have successfully rescued his child from the forces of the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Influence: Ahmed Mohammadi, 19, (not pictured) was friends with Nasser Muthana, 20, (right) and Reyaad Khan, 21, (left) who appeared in an IS recruiting video in June. Ahmed's father has travelled 2,000 miles to Syria to bring his son back to the UK . Ahmed was friends with Nasser Muthana, 20, and Reyaad Khan, 21, two jihadists from Cardiff who appeared in an IS recruiting video in June, urging other young Britons to join the fighting. It is not known if Ahmed had travelled to Syria with Muthana and Khan, but it is thought he had spent time with Muthana before leaving for the war-torn country, where Islamist groups are fighting President Bashar Assad's forces. Mr Mohammadi, who is of Kurdish-Iraqi descent, has insisted that his son had visited Syria as part of a humanitarian mission to help refugees,  had nothing to do with terrorism and had not joined in with fighting. However, he reportedly decided to travel to Syria himself after becoming fearful that the teenager was falling under the influence of other UK jihadists. Mr Mohammadi is thought to have been supported in his mission by acquaintances in Cardiff, who put him in touch with contacts in Turkey. Once there, he was helped across the border into Syria by guides from the Kurdish community and was eventually able to track down his son, and convinced him to return home. Risk: Mr Mohammadi was able to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Kobane, pictured, which is close to the Turkish border . 'There is a great sense of honour and family value in what Mr Mohammadi did,' a police intelligence source told The Sunday Times. The source also said that more parents were expected to make similar journeys to bring their own children home. On his return to the UK in July, Ahmed was arrested under the Terrorism Act, but was released without charge. He was instead referred to the government's counter-radicalisation scheme, known as the Channel programme, which has been offered to many of the 300 young Britons who have arrived back from Syria and Iraq. Programme: Ahmed was instead referred to the government's counter-radicalisation scheme, known as the Channel programme, which has been offered to many of the Britons who have returned from Syria and Iraq . His father has said Ahmed has now  returned to university to study civil engineering. The scheme has seen a 58 per cent rise (from 748 to 1,281) in the number of referrals in the past year as the crisis in the Middle East grew. Evidence of the softer approach comes despite assurances from Home Secretary Theresa May that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law. She said new legislation should be ready by the end of this month as David Cameron insisted returning jihadis should face ‘criminal investigations and prosecution’. But Whitehall sources say securing evidence of terrorist activities committed 2,000 miles away in Syria is proving difficult. An assessment of Ahmed and another suspected jihadist Shahid Miah, 23, by the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit in August found that the pair were susceptible to ‘indoctrination’. Fighting: At least 500 young British Muslims are thought to have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria, of which around 300 are thought to have returned to the UK. Pictured are fighters holding a flag with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant written across it . Miah was also referred to Channel. The Government raised the national security threat level in August to ‘severe’ amid warnings of the threat posed by returning jihadists. At least 500 young British Muslims are thought to have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria, of which around 300 are thought to have returned to the UK. It is claimed that at least 24 British jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other terror groups in the region. Some disenchanted travellers have asked for an amnesty after discovering the dangerous reality of infighting among Islamist groups on the frontline. Police chiefs have insisted that every case of a returning jihadi will be treated ‘on its merits’ with some offered support by mental health experts or social services. They are closely monitoring the progress of a Danish programme for rehabilitating jihadis which offers a wealth of support and counselling.","Ahmed Mohammadi, 19, left home in Cardiff to travel to Syria .

"It's one of the biggest dates on the party calendar and one of the few which sees fashion heavy-hitters such as Natalie Massanet and Sir Philip Green hobnob with the A-list and models alike. With so many style setters in one room, competition for the title of best dressed is fierce with party-goers pulling out all the stops to ensure they make headlines for all the right reasons. But not everyone gets their look spot on. From the highs (Tamsin Egerton's glorious red skirt) to the lows (Courtney Love and Rihanna), FEMAIL reveals which BFA guests deserve a sartorial round of applause - and those who need to go back to style school. Scroll down for video . LOOKING GOOD . Perfect 10: Model Suki Waterhouse (left), actress Tamsin Egerton (centre) and Tali Lennox (right) got their outfits spot on . Miss Perfect: Emma Watson has mastered the art of red carpet dressing and looks wonderfully understated in this elegant ensemble . Tamsin Egerton was the standout success of the night, with her chic red skirt and white top combining to make everyone else look a trifle over-dressed - but she wasn't the only one to shine. 'Tamsin Egerton looked gorgeous,' says fashion expert Simon Glazin. 'I always love red on a red carpet, and this mermaid skirt looked great on her. She's not the biggest star here, and she knows it, hence, she didn't try and compete with a gown. I admire that.' Others to come top of the class included Emma Watson, who, as usual, offered a masterclass in low-key red carpet dressing and the night's big winner, Victoria Beckham. 'Emma Watson looked every inch the young starlet,' comments  Glazin. 'She loves to work the masculine look, and this is a masterclass at how to do it but still remain girly and current. 'This is actually a wide-leg jumpsuit, and the addition of the oversized Dior blazer is just perfect for her.' Equally gorgeous were the two Delevigne sisters, Cara and Poppy, who both chose sequins in simple black and shimmering gold. Models Karlie Kloss and Erin O'Connor also pulled off glamorous gowns - leaving Glazin impressed. Style sisters: Both Delevigne sisters know a thing or two about fashion and, as usual, looked immaculate on the red carpet . Pretty dramatic: Pixie Geldof picked a figure-flattering prom shape in on-trend snake print while Kate Moss opted for a signature boho dress . Long lines: Olivia Palermo and Victoria Beckham can always be relied on to get it right and they didn't disappoint at the BFA's . 'Leave it to the super models to show everyone how it's done,' he says. 'Karlie Kloss has everything to smile about in her gorgeous, sexy gown. It's like liquid silver has been poured and draped all over her. 'Erin O'Connor is equal parts drama and romance in Emilia Wickstead. I love how she always embraces her height and with the bold red lip, she looked devastatingly good.' And O'Connor and Kloss weren't the only models to give the actresses a run for their money. Perennial fashion favourite Kate Moss proved that while she might be 40, she's certainly not over the hill when it comes to fashion. 'Leave it to Kate Moss to parade around in something fun, flirty and retro,' says Glazin. 'Her Alexander McQueen bat-wing mini dress was a welcome relief from to all the long, floor-length gowns too. Big hair on Kate is brilliant.' Short and sweet: Proving that red carpet doesn't have to mean floor-length are Laura Carmichael, Tanya Burr and Anna Kendrick . Hollywood glamour: Victoria's Secret Angel Karlie Kloss and model Erin O'Connor wowed fans in sweeping floor-length dresses . Looking good: Model Laura Bailey was gorgeous in a fabulous floor-length pink gown while the ever-dapper Tom Ford sharpened up in a suit . Impressively pulled together though Moss and the model posse were, not all of them got it right, among them Naomi Campbell, whose dress was one of two halves - both ill-fitting. 'I love Naomi Campbell, but this is not OK,' says Glazin. 'It doesn't scream supermodel - more Morticia Addams on a bad day. The bottom half is creased, and for me, there's no excuse for that, especially early in the evening. 'She should always stick to Versace for events like this. Donatella would have done her proud.' Lily Donaldson, usually a classic dresser, attempted to inject a shot of sex appeal via a long, sheer skirt but ended up looking a little frumpy as a result of her Bridget Jones style underwear. But while Donaldson and Campbell failed to set the red carpet alight, Courtney Love and Rihanna did, although for all the wrong reasons. ' Where to start with Courtney?' says a horrified Glazin. 'Well, actually, from the beginning: whose idea was it to match your eye shadow with the dress and with the shoes? Good God, it looks awful. But that's Courtney's thing, ugly clothes work for her.' MUST TRY HARDER . Dreadful: Courtney Love needed a bra to make her pink dress work, while Rihanna would have looked better if she had found an outfit to wear . Step down! The skirt was nice but Rita Ora's sparkly crop top was more school disco than awards show - as were her awful platform shoes . Try harder: Alexa Chung was swamped by her dress while sandals would have improved Daisy Lowe's dress. Ellie Goulding looked like a bride . Love, at least, did bother to wear some clothes, unlike Rihanna who opted for an ill-fitting oversized tuxedo jacket and very little else. Despite a huge diamond necklace, all eyes were on the huge tattoo on her breastbone, while the opaque black tights seemed strange given all the flesh being flashed elsewhere. 'At first glance, I loved Rihanna's Stella McCartney get up, but the more I look the more I hate it,' says Glazin. 'And I cannot abide tights, especially dark tights, with sandals.' Equally dreadful was Rita Ora, who managed to ruin her pretty black skirt by adding a crop top and pair of platforms that looked as if they had been hired for a school disco. Others opting for fancy dress included Ellie Goulding, who appeared to have come as a bride, and Laura Haddock who was channeling the Regency period in a flowing silk and lace gown that came in a jarring shade of pistachio. 'Who told Laura Haddock this was a good look? It's frumpy and completely the wrong shape for her,' insists Glazin. 'Leave this kind of thing for Strictly Come Dancing contestants. Or a poor bridesmaid.' Too much: Pretty print, pretty ruffle, pretty neckline - but too much together  Nicole Scherzinger.  Singer Ella Eyre had a similar problem . Oh dear: Naomi Campbell's frock was a dress of two halves - both ill-fitting - while Lily Donaldson's dress erred on the frumpy side . Not so clever colour: Katie Denham and Laura Haddock both suffered from bad colour and poor fit, while Lily Allen was crumpled in blue .","Tamsin Egerton looked wonderful in her white skirt while Suki Waterhouse shone in delicate blue .

"Tourists are finding themselves in a sticky situation in Seattle, where they have covered a wall entirely in used bubble gum. The colourful work of art – which some passers-by may find revolting – was created by thousands of holidaymakers in an alley near one of the oldest farmers’ markets in the US. David Fulmer, 37, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took these pictures of the gum wall while on holiday with his girlfriend in the Pacific coast city. The brick wall is decorated with thousands of pieces of colourful bubble gum, stuck on by tourists who have passed the wall over the years. It is believed the first pieces of gum were stuck to the wall around 20 years ago, and the so-called ‘bubble gum alley’ eventually became a tourist attraction as visitors added to it. The sticky attraction was once named one of the ‘germiest’ tourist attractions in the world by TripAdvisor, with some layers several inches thick or as tall as 15ft. David was hoping to visit three National Parks as part of his trip but took a pit stop in Seattle to explore the Pike Place Market. It was under the market that he discovered the alley where the Gum Wall can be admired, adorned in chewed gum from thousands of different mouths. David said: ‘I was a little bit shocked when I first saw the gum wall but after looking at it closely and seeing the thousands of different bits of gum, it makes a really great visual impression. ‘It's a cool and unique thing to discover and as a tourist you don't see something like this every day.’ Scroll down for video .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke will act as a pall bearer at Phillip Hughes' funeral in his home town of Macksville on Wednesday. The funeral of the former Test batsman, who died last week after being hit on the neck by a bouncer in a Sheffield Shield match, will also be attended by the full Australia men's and women's squads and many more major figures from the world of cricket. The service at Hughes' old school is expected to last an hour and will begin with the opening music 'Forever Young' and conclude with 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me'. School children walk past a tribute to Phil Hughes in the cricketer's hometown of Macksville, New South Wales . Green and gold ribbons fly from a street pole as a tribute to Hughes on Wallace Street, in his hometown . Children perform a procession run through outside the Macksville High School in readiness for the funeral . Three cherry-pickers are linked together to form giant cricket stumps bearing the Test number 408 of the Australian batsman . Another tribute to  Hughes is seen in a shopfront window on Wallace Street with the words: 'Phillip 408 God Bless R.I.P' Another tribute in the cricketer's hometown reads: 'Macksville's champion. Australia's inspiration. Rest in peace Phillip' Clarke will act as a pall bearer at Phillip Hughes' funeral and shared a photo of the pair on Instagram . Hughes' hometown of Macksville is 250 miles north of Sydney - and sits between Sydney and Brisbane . Hughes died three days before his 26th birthday. His funeral will be broadcast and relayed on big screens in the Macksville High School grounds to up to 4,000 residents of the small coastal town in northern New South Wales. West Indies and New Zealand greats Brian Lara and Sir Richard Hadlee will be among those attending, as well as a who's who of Australian cricketers of the past two decades and members of the touring Indian team. Clarke will also deliver a tribute to his friend, while Hughes' former state and international team-mates Tom Cooper and Aaron Finch will be pall bearers too. On Tuesday, Clarke shared a picture of the duo on the cricket field together and said: 'Tomorrow is going to be a tough day!' After the service, all current and former cricketers present will be invited to form a guard of honour. England captain Alastair Cook will not be among them, because he is with his one-day international team in Sri Lanka, but Test batsmen Nick Compton and Sam Robson are expected to be in attendance. It is understood the England and Wales Cricket Board will be sending a high-profile representative to Hughes' planned state memorial service - on a date yet to be announced. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said it was 'out of the question' that the players should be expected to play a test match a day after the funeral of a respected teammate and treasured friend. Sutherland said CA would understand if, for some players, emotions were still too raw next Tuesday to face the challenge of test cricket and any player who felt unready for that match could withdraw without recrimination. 'Any player that is not comfortable or doesn't feel right, or there is medical advice to suggest they're not quite right, then we will obviously understand that,' he said. 'I'm sure the broader public will understand that as well,' he said. 'Understand that we and the Australian Cricketers' Association will be supporting them and nobody will think ill of anyone who feels uncomfortable about it.' Clarke, who shared this picture on Instagram ahead of what would have been Hughes' 26th birthday, will deliver a tribute to his friend . A tribute at a petrol station reads: 'In memory of Phillip. Farewell from Macksville. Forever in our hearts' A tribute reading: 'Rest In Peace Phil' written on a cricket bat hangs with green and gold ribbons by a sports field in Hughes' hometown . Veteran fast bowler Ryan Harris became the first player to publicly express misgivings about playing a test match so soon after the tragic death of a team-mate, saying he hadn't yet decided whether he would take part. Harris said Wednesday's service at Macksville - where the Australian sporting colors of green and gold are adorning stores and public buildings around the town - would be an emotional trial for the Australian players and only after that could they address their thoughts to the test match. 'Let's get through that first. It's going to be pretty bloody hard,' Harris told reporters in Brisbane. 'It might be a bit of closure or it might take longer. 'The thing is no one knows. No one has been in this situation before, losing a teammate and a very good mate and trying to play a cricket game less than a week later.' Harris said players would 'probably like a little bit longer' to reconcile their emotions before facing a test preparation. 'But that is reality,' he said. 'There's a test series on and there are games to be played, that's what we have to prepare for. But at least we have a date to work towards.'

In the week since Hughes' passing, Clarke has become a lightning rod for the emotions of his team and his nation. Clarke may not have been a universally popular figure in the past and his relationship with CA had been strained by his unorthodox efforts to prove his fitness for the first test after a hamstring injury. But all of those issues and impressions have been swept aside by the manner in which Clarke has comported himself since the death of a teammate he said was 'like a brother to me.' In articulately and unashamedly expressing his own grief, he made it possible for his team-mates and compatriots to grieve. Clarke will draw from the same well of emotion when he addresses Wednesday's funeral service at the recreation hall of the Macksville High School, close to the banana plantation on which Hughes was raised.","The funeral of Phillip Hughes will be attended by the full Australia men's and women's cricket squads .

"AC Milan have confirmed they are in talks with Manchester United about playing a prestige friendly in the new year. Neither club is in the Champions League or Europa League this season and they are exploring the options of playing each other in a lucrative one-off game, almost certainly in the Middle East.

"Just one in three schools still holds a traditional nativity play even though parents want the Christmas story to live on in education. The most popular Christmas play now staged in schools is an ‘updated nativity’ featuring characters such as aliens, punk fairies, footballers, drunk spacemen, Elvis and recycling bins, a survey showed today. Seven per cent of schools even refuse to call the production a Christmas or nativity play, preferring instead ‘Winter Celebration’, ‘Seasonal Play’ or ‘End of Year Concert’. Scroll down for video . Changing times: Just one in three schools still holds a traditional nativity play even though parents want the Christmas story to live on in education (picture posed by models) The poll also showed that parents want to keep alive the traditional nativity play with 65 per cent saying they wished their children’s school staged one. The findings come amid growing concern among some clergy that Christianity is being marginalised in Britain. Just 32 per cent of primary schools continue to stage a traditional nativity which tells the story of Christ’s birth, according to a poll of 2,157 members of parenting site Netmums. Instead, nearly half – 47 per cent – stage an ‘updated nativity’ which mixes modern and traditional characters. A further one in eight – 12 per cent – puts on a ‘modern nativity’ which dispenses with religious references altogether. Parents reported that ‘modern’ roles being introduced in schools include aliens, recycling bins, punk fairies, Elvis, footballers, a lobster, a napkin, carrots, sprouts, a pumpkin and a drunken spaceman. There were even reports of an Apprentice-style Christmas performance, with ‘Lord Christmas’ instead of Father Christmas playing the lead role. In a growing trend, one in 100 schools asks pupils to perform Christmas plays incorporating information on the festivals of Eid, Hanukkah and Diwali. Almost one in ten schools decided against staging a Christmas production at all. Christmas carols are also under threat in schools, the survey showed. Just 35 per cent of schools still require pupils to sing traditional carols and hymns amid evidence they are being eclipsed by Christmas pop songs such as ‘Rocking Around the Christmas Tree’. The decline of the traditional nativity is against parents’ wishes, the poll suggested. Of parents whose school had elected not to hold a traditional nativity, 65 per cent would like it to introduce one. Shift: Seven per cent of schools even refuse to call the production a Christmas or nativity play, preferring instead ‘Winter Celebration’, ‘Seasonal Play’ or ‘End of Year Concert’ Just one in five parents - 22 per cent - feel the nativity is ‘unimportant’ while one in eight - 13 per cent - planned to teach their child the Christmas story at home. In further revelations, and in a sign of the times, a third of schools now ask parents to sign forms declaring they will refrain from posting photos of the Christmas play on social media. Just 38 per cent of schools allow parents to take pictures of the play freely, while cameras are banned at 16 per cent. The most popular Christmas play now staged in schools is an ‘updated nativity’ featuring characters such as Elvis Presley . A further 14 per cent of schools video the performance before charging parents for copies. But competition for key parts in Christmas plays – and parental pride and angst over the roles allocated – shows no sign of diminishing. One in nine parents have witnessed others pressuring teachers to give their child a main part while 26 per cent suspected it went on at their school. One in seven (14 per cent) admitted being ‘upset and disappointed’ by the part allocated to their child in the school Christmas play. Netmums co-founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘While the UK is a diverse and multicultural society and it’s right children learn about all religions and cultures, many parents feel the traditional nativity is being pushed aside. ‘It seems wrong to bombard kids with commercial messages about presents and Santa without them realising the true meaning of the celebration. ‘This study shows many parents who aren’t religious look to the nativity as a comforting part of the Christmas celebrations and want their school to embrace and celebrate it, rather than make up a version with perhaps less resonance for kids. ‘Christmas is about peace, acceptance and tolerance, so let’s see more schools accept back this tradition.’","Most popular Christmas play now staged in schools is ‘updated nativity’

"Russian special forces are leading attacks on Donetsk airport as fighting in east Ukraine intensifies despite a two-month-old ceasefire, the country's military claims. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said there had been particularly fierce fighting at the in airport over the weekend and claimed Russian troops were involved. 'These are Russian special forces. It's already the third day that they've been trying to do something,' he told Reuters by telephone. Civil war: A man takes pictures of a shop hit by shelling in the Telstilshik district of Donetsk . At least three Ukrainian soldiers have been killed  in the past 24 hours as fighting intensifies for control of Donetsk airport . Damage: Scorch marks and shrapnel holes scar a building in Donetsk, which is a rebel stronghold . Pictures meanwhile showed damage to residential buildings and shops inside rebel-held Donetsk after shelling by the Ukrainian army, but there was no news of civilian casualties in the city. Mr Lysenko's accusations came as both Ukrainian officials and Nato claimed Russia had further violated the ceasefire agreement by sending advanced weapons to rebel units. Ukraine said yesterday that a convoy of 106 vehicles had entered its eastern territory from Russia without permission and accused Moscow of using humanitarian aid shipments to smuggle weapons and ammunition. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'We see a significant military buildup in and around Ukraine. Large transfers of Russian advanced weapons, equipment and military personnel to violent separatists.' Moscow denies using humanitarian convoys to transport weapons and rejects Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the rebels and sending fighters to aid them. It accuses the West and Kiev of pressing a campaign of indiscriminate violence in the eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk. The nine-month-old conflict is thought to have killed more than 4,300 people. Despite a peace deal signed by Ukraine, Russia and separatist leaders on September 5, there have been continued attacks from both sides. Smashed: A room lies in ruins after a block was hit by shelling overnight in the Telstilshik district of Donetsk . Clean up: A man clears rubble in his flat that was destroyed by Ukrainian army shelling during the night . Mr Lysenko said three Ukrainian servicemen had been killed in the past 24 hours in intensified artillery strikes from the rebels that he linked to yesterday's arrival of another large aid convoy from Russia. A further 15 had been injured, according to official sources. 'The new humanitarian convoy arrived and the terrorists received ammunition for heavy artillery ... therefore they are able to increase the intensity (of attacks),' he said. Months of fighting in Ukraine's restive east have left many without enough food and led to severe shortages of essential medical supplies. Russia has regularly dispatched shipments of aid, a move which the pro-Western Kiev government has denounced as a cynical operation to ship military equipment to rebels. Victims of war: A youth looks at the damage in the kitchen of his flat after it was hit by shelling . Elsewhere in Shchastya, north of Lugansk, a Ukrainian soldier fires a missile with a man-portable air-defence system during exercises . Commenting on yesterday's convoy, Mr Stoltenberg said the best way to improve the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine was to stop violations of the Minsk agreement, intended to halt the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and to respect the ceasefire. 'We are seeing that the separatists and Russia (are) not doing that. Russia is fuelling the conflict by providing ... equipment and other kinds of support for the separatists and thereby undermining and violating the ceasefire and also the efforts to create a peaceful, negotiated solution,' he said. Nato foreign ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the situation in Ukraine and to review steps the 28-nation alliance has taken to boost its defences and to reassure nervous eastern European allies following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March. They will agree to continue the measures, which include exercises and rotations of small numbers of troops to eastern Europe, throughout 2015.","Ukraine army says Russian special forces have attacked for three days .

"A brown bear has been spotted in the disaster zone around the Chernobyl, the first time one has been seen in the area for 100 years. The bear was photographed by an automatic camera trap in the exclusion zone around the Ukrainian nuclear power plant, the scene of one of the world's worst nuclear accidents. Scientists are studying the area, evacuated since the reactor meltdown in 1986, to better understand the risks radioactivity poses to humans and wildlife. Scroll down for video . Spotted: This brown bear was photographed by a camera trap in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone . Return: It is believed Brown bears have not been seen in the area around Chernobyl for more than 100 years . Peekaboo: The cameras have been set up around Chernobyl as part of research into the area's radioactivity . The brown bear pictures were obtained by Sergey Gaschak, a Ukrainian collaborator with the British-run TREE (TRansfer, Exposure, Effects) research programme into the effects of radioactivity. It is far from the first large mammal discovered to be stalking the 30km-radius Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Dr Gaschak's camera's have already spotted lynxes, grey wolves, wild boar, elk, horses and otters, among other animals, living in the deserted area. Project leader Mike Wood from the University of Salford told BBC News: 'We are basically working on the assumption that as you move people out of the equation and human pressure and disturbance is removed, then any animals that have a corridor into the exclusion zone find they are suddenly away from the pressures and dangers presented by people.' More than 100,000 people were evacuated from their homes around the damaged Chernobyl power station after the April 1986 reactor explosion - the worst nuclear accident until the meltdown at Fukushima Daichi in 2011. The explosion breached the reactor core, opening it to the elements and belching a massive plume of radioactive fallout that drifted over large parts of the western Soviet Union and Europe. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers in one of history's biggest civil engineering tasks, said to have cost an estimated 18 billion rubles ($18billion). Disaster site: The Chernobyl meltdown in April 1986 was the world's worst nuclear accident until the disaster at the Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011 . The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. The Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated £11 billion ($18 billion). During the accident 31 people died, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for. The TREE research programme aims to 'reduce uncertainty in estimating the risk to humans and wildlife associated with exposure to radioactivity and to reduce unnecessary conservatism in risk calculations.' It combines controlled laboratory experiments with fieldwork, most of which is planned for the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The researchers will be focusing on three different areas of different levels of contamination to get a comprehensive overview of what species are found in the exclusion zone. At any one time 15 cameras will be operating in each area to catch a glimpse of the kinds of wildlife there. This first stage of the project will continue until late 2015. 'Once we have completed this particular stage of the study, looking at what animals are there and in what density, we are then going to be selecting one particular species to target for a trapping and collaring campaign,' Dr Wood told the BBC. 'We will be fitting collars with GPS to these animals, and also dose-measurement technology so that we are then able to track movement over the course of a year through the exclusion zone and get a real measurement of the exact radiation exposure that these animals get.'","Bear spotted by camera trap set up by radioactivity research project .

'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote on Sunday afternoon to his nearly 25,000 followers. Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended. However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong. '1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller. Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just four months.

"A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drunken driving after authorities say he crashed his car into the pedestrian walkway on the Golden Gate Bridge and got it struck there. Bridge spokeswoman Priya David Clemens told KTVU that the driver - who has since been identified as San Francisco man Daniel Sato - left the parking lot on the Marin side of the bridge about 5.30am driving at high speeds. He then crashed his blue Ford Mustang through some concrete and steel partitions that separate the traffic lanes from the pedestrian walkway and bike path. However once inside the walkway, he just kept driving. A bit stuck: An alleged drunk driver wedged his car into this tight space on the Golden Gate Bridge Tuesday morning after driving along the pedestrian walkway . Smash: The 22-year-old driver crashed through steel and concrete barriers to get into the walkway . Not a road: Police say the young man treated the pedestrian path as a traffic lane and kept driving . Traffic: The incident caused major disruptions to the bridge on Tuesday morning as bridge workers tried to remove the car . Arrested: Daniel Sato, 22, was taken to hospital for minor injuries and then arrested for drunk driving . Authorities say the car traveled 400 yards before becoming tightly wedged between two barriers. Fortunately no one was on the bridge walkway when the wreck occurred. The motorist suffered minor injuries, with the car's airbags deploying after jamming into the tight space at high speeds. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and then arrested on DUI charges. However the incident did not stop there. 'This driver really gave our engineers and crews some work to do today,' Clemens said. Exit strategy: Engineers decided the easiest way to remove the vehicle was to crane it out . Local: Sato has posted many photos of his car to Facebook, including ones of it on the Golden Gate Bridge . Trouble: A Bridge spokesperson said the entire incident was caught on security cameras . The engineers had to work whether to remove part of the bridge's railing and tow the car out, or use a crane. At about 10.45am the Mustang was craned out, according to ABC7 News. Traffic had to be stopped in both directions as the car was removed. The entire crash was captured on the bridge's security cameras. However Clemens said they will not be publicly releasing the footage.","Crash occurred 5.30am Tuesday .

"Lionsgate is launching a touring exhibition of The Hunger Games as the first step toward opening a theme park dedicated to the wildly-popular book and film series. The movie studio revealed that it's 'deep into conversation' with potential theme park partners. The post-apocalyptic franchise has proved a substantial money-maker for Lionsgate, grossing nearly £1billion at the box office, and the company is looking for new ways to cash in on its success. Scroll down for video . Movie magic: Lionsgate revealed that it's 'deep into conversation' about opening a Hunger Games theme park . The four-part series has yet to release its final two installments, with the third - The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - set to arrive in cinemas in November. But can the studio turn a successful film franchise into a profitable theme park? Lionsgate will begin testing the waters with the launch of a touring exhibit, The Hunger Games: The Exhibition, in the summer of 2015. The studio has joined forces with theme park creator Thinkwell Group to develop its plans. 'Thinkwell... is spearheading an initiative for line extensions of ""The Hunger Games"" and all of our other brands,' Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said during a conference call, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The studio will test the waters with a touring exhibit - The Hunger Games: The Exhibition - in summer 2015 . He said: 'As a first step, we've already designed a state-of-the-art travelling museum involving costumes, props, and other elements of the Hunger Games world that will begin touring the U.S. next summer.' Now it seems that the studio is eyeing an even grander presence. During Friday's conference call, Feltheimer revealed that studio execs are 'excited about these [theme park] opportunities and are pursuing them,' reports Businessweek. He also mentioned that The Hunger Games: The Exhibition would be the first test of several 'extensions' of Lionsgate franchises, which include Twilight and Divergent. Twilight phenomenon: The vampire-meets-girl love story was a worldwide success . The next big thing: Lionsgate's Divergent is also being eyed as an opportunity for brand 'extension' Twilight has proved particularly successful for the studio, with the vampire love story's five-film franchise grossing almost £2billion worldwide. Apocalyptic teen romance 'Divergent' has likewise made a substantial box office impact, netting £164million with its first of four films. This comes on the heels of Universal Orlando's launch of the Harry Potter-themed extension to 2010's The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Universal Orlando Islands of Adventure launched The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in 2010 . This summer, Universal Orlando added Diagon Alley, which includes a thrill ride, wand shop, and restaurant . The new area in the studio's Florida park is called The Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Diagon Alley, and cost an estimated £239million. This is in addition to the initial site's £158million development costs. At this point, there's no word on whether Lionsgate is looking at developing a stand-alone theme park or simply adding themed attractions into already-existing parks.","Studio says it's 'deep into conversation' with possible theme park partners .

"Nearly all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, apparently leaked documents say, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output. A spreadsheet said to show the salaries of 6,000 Sony Pictures employees, including top executives, reveals that of 17 earning $1million or more a year, just two are not white and just one is a woman. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion as the film studio reels from a wider hacking attack which also leaked five major new films. An entrance gate to the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City, California: Fourteen of the 17 top executives at the major film studio are white and male, according to apparently leaked internal pay documents . Minority of one: Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal, the only woman earning more than $1million a year at the company, and chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment Michael Lynton . As corporate email and internal systems were knocked offline, Sony workers reportedly saw a message on their terminals saying 'Hacked by #GOP,' which is understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace. Sony is said to be investigating whether North Korea was involved after the pariah state objected to the release of a comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-Un. The latest leak from the hack is a spreadsheet titled 'Comp Roster by Supervisory Organization 2014-10-21', including detailed data about the salaries of Sony Pictures executives. Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by “annual rate,” I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Amy B. Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairman of SPE's Motion Picture Group, is the only woman among the top 17 most-highly paid executives. She earns £3million a year, according to the spreadsheet, joint highest on the list, along with Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. Meanwhile, 15 of the 17 top executives appear to be Caucasian. The exceptions are Man Jit Singh, who appears to be South Asian, and Dwight R. Caines, who appears to be African American. And representing the rest of the world... Man Jit Singh, left, worldwide president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Dwight Caines, its president of marketing, are the only non-white top-ranking executives . Sony workers reportedly saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP', understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace - although some believe North Korea was involved . Sony Pictures is far from unique in having a largely white male leadership, however the spelling out of exactly how homogenous its top flight is will heap embarrassment onto the damage caused by the hack attack. Copies of some unreleased Sony films such as Still Alice, Annie, Mr Turner, and To Write Love on Her Arms are now being distributed on file-sharing websites, as well as the still-in-cinemas 'Fury'. A direct connection between the leak of those films and the hacking hasn't been confirmed, but it seems likely. Culver City, California-based Sony Pictures said in a statement yesterday that it is continuing ""to work through issues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week. 'The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter.' Along with the FBI, Sony has brought in forensic experts from the Mandiant division of FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity company, according to a source familiar with the case who did not want to be named because the companies have not yet announced the arrangement. Mandiant helps companies determine the extent of breaches and repair damages. The firm has worked on other high-profile computer breaches, including one at retailer Target last year.","Spreadsheet including employees' salary details is leaked after hack attack .

"Driving under the influence of drugs is illegal, but until now police officers have had to wait for blood tests to confirm whether a driver is high, which can take up to 24 hours. Now, scientists have developed a cannabis-detecting breathalyser that  generates results almost immediately. Researchers at Washington State University came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Scientists have come up with a cannabis-detecting breathalyser that could be used on the roadside, and help police charge people with drug-driving offences more easily . The gadget uses ion-mobility technology, which is used by airport security professionals to detect drugs and explosives, The Seattle Times reported. The prototype device, which could be tested on humans as soon as next year, is not designed to detect how stoned a driver is, but simply to confirm whether they have THC in their system. Researchers at Washington State University came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect THC (illustarted), which is the psychoactive ingredient in pot, which is not found in alcohol . THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. It bonds to receptors on nerve cells, which respond by changing in activity. The cannabinoid receptors are found in areas of the brain linked to memory, cognition, pleasure, coordination and the perception of time. THC stimulates cells in the brain to release dopamine, creating a happy feeling, but can also cause hallucinations, delusions and affect rational thinking. On average, the effects last for around two hours. The idea is, that is the chemical was detected, a driver would be given a blood test, which could then be used as evidence in court. Taking drugs affects people's driving skills, and can give them slower reaction times, nausea, hallucinations, panic attacks, paranoia, 'the shakes,' dizziness, fatigue and the affects their ability to concentrate properly, which could increase their chance of having a road accident. Washington State University’s research could soon help out the Washington State Patrol, which have said that a quarter of blood samples taken from drivers in the area in the last year tested positive for cannabis. The state legalised cannabis two years ago and in 2013, 1,362 drivers tested positive for having active cannabis in their system – 25 per cent more than the previous year. It is estimated that 720 of these people had THC levels high enough to lead to an automatic drugged driving conviction under state law. The Washington State Patrol says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road. Drug-driving affects people's ability to drive, which can increase the change of accidents (stock image) It's illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol and other drugs, including cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine, in the UK. Just one puff of cannabis puts a driver over the limit. The police ask drivers to do a 'field impairment assessment' to assess their ability to drive and can then arrest anyone who they suspect of driving under the influence, before taking them to do a blood test. If the test comes back positive, drivers could be charged with a crime. Penalties for drug driving include: A minimum 12 month driving ban, criminal record, a fine of up to £5,000 and/or six months in prison.

"Miroslav Klose is now the leading World Cup goalscorer in history after netting during Germany's humiliation of Brazil. But the 36-year-old striker had better enjoy the feeling while it lasts, because he might not hold the title for too long.

Unless the Polish-born hotshot finds the net in Sunday's final, he is unlikely to add to his 16 strikes so far. But Thomas Muller already has that total in his sights. Germany coach Joachim Low praised Klose after the match but immediately tipped Muller to set a new record. 'It . really means a lot to all of us,' said Low. 'This is a record . that could be beaten only by Muller.' VIDEO Scroll down for German fans celebrating their 7-1 victory over Brazil . Record breaker: Miroslav Klose is the new top goalscorer in World Cup history . Not far behind: Klose's team-mate Tjomas Muller looks ready to beat his goals record . Muller scored the first goal in the 7-1 victory against the hapless Brazilians to bring his haul to 10 goals in just 12 World Cup games. And all signs seem to point towards Muller breaking his compatriot's record in future. 1 Miroslav Klose (Germany) 16 goals in 23 games (0.70 per match) 2 Ronaldo (Brazil) 15 goals in 19 games (0.79 per match) 3 Gerd Muller (Germany) 14 goals in 13 games (1.08 per match) 4 Just Fontaine (France) 13 goals in 6 matches (2.17 per match) 5 Pele (Brazil) 12 goals in 14 games (0.86 per match) 6= Sandor Kocsis (Hungary) 11 goals in 5 games (2.20 per match) 6= Jurgen Klinsmann (Germany) 11 goals in 17 games (0.65 per match) 8= Helmut Rahn (Germany) 10 goals in 10 games (1.00 per match) 8= Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina) 10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match) 8= Gary Lineker (England) 10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match) 8= Thomas Muller (Germany) 10 goals in 12 games (0.83 per match) 8= Teofilo Cubillas (Peru) 10 goals in 13 games (0.77 per match) 8= Grzegorz Lato (Poland) 10 goals in 20 games (0.50 per match) The Bayern Munich forward is just 24 years . old, so could conceivably have three more World Cups left in him should . he play on to Klose's age of 36. If he continues his impressive current . scoring rate of five goals in every World Cup, Muller could have 25 in . finals by the time he hangs up his boots. Muller also reaps the easy rewards of playing in front of the most powerful midfield in world football. Toni Kroos appears the natural successor to Xavi as the game's most technically gifted playmaker and is the key to Germany's Teutonic tiki-taka, which is strangling the life out of all who dare stand in their path. Combined with Bastian Schweinsteiger's brains and brawn, plus gifted footballers in Mesut Ozil, Mario Gotze and Sami Khedira among others, Germany look set to dominate international football for the forseeable future. As Klose has proved there really is no better gig in football than playing up front for Germany in major tournaments. There are five Germans in the top 10 goalscorers in World Cups. Klose set his goals record by overtaking Ronaldo - the original one - who is among the most skilful and deadly strikers ever to have graced the game. Yet Klose has still managed to surpass his tally thanks to Germany's stunning consistency in major tournaments and a lack of injury problems. Despite their huge strength in other areas of the pitch, there are also few rivals for Muller's position in Germany's team. The talented but raw Andre Schurrle has provided a sharper cutting edge than Muller when coming on from the bench and has three goals despite limited game time in Brazil. Otherwise only Klose, who is enjoying a last hurrah in his career, and the limited Lukas Podolski provide scant competition for the striker’s spot. Start of the rout: Muller took advantage of awful Brazil defending to score Germany's opening goal . The list of superior forwards from other countries who are being eclipsed by Klose and now Muller also makes for remarkable reading. To Ronaldo add the two greatest players of all time, Pele and Diego Maradona, and the top two currently playing the game, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Then add Gabriel Batistuta, Ferenc Puskas, Gary Lineker, Eusebio, Christian Vieri, David Villa, Roberto Baggio, Davor Suker, Sandor Kocsis, Romario, Thierry Henry... the list goes on and on. Yet Klose tops the lot, and Muller could one day usurp his fellow countryman as the World Cup’s goal king. Oh to be a German striker...

"Two officers have been removed from their posts at an infamous Princeton University eating club after they sent emails ridiculing women, including one that featured a sexually explicit photograph. Adam Krop, who is the vice president of the club Tiger Inn, sent an email on October 12 showing a woman engaged in a sex act with a man at the club. It went to everyone on the club's mailing list and was accompanied by a crude joke and a reference to the woman as an 'Asian chick'. Andrew Hoffenberg, the club's treasurer, sent an email to the same group of people later that evening regarding a lecture by the Princeton alumna whose lawsuit forced eating clubs to admit women. Two officers have been removed from their posts at infamous Princeton University eating club the Tiger Inn, above, after they sent emails ridiculing women, including one that featured a sexually explicit photograph . According to The New York Times it said: 'Ever wonder who we have to thank (blame) for gender equality. 'Looking for someone to blame for the influx of girls? Come tomorrow and help boo Sally Frank.' Last month the Princeton Police Department said they were investigating the first email as it is illegal in New Jersey to distribute an explicit photograph without the consent of the person pictured. But yesterday the department said the case was essentially on-hold until a 'victim comes forward'. However, the university launched its own investigation. And amid complaints from members that the emails were evidence of a climate that is hostile towards women, the club's board of governors conducted a survey asking members if they would be surprised if a sexual assault had occurred at the club. The university launched an investigation after complaints from members that the emails were evidence of a climate that is hostile towards women and Adam Krop and Andrew Hoffenberg were asked to stand down . The board then notified members that Mr Krop and Mr Hoffenberg had been asked to stand down as their actions were 'offensive, disrespectful and in direct violation of our core values'. It said the board would now be more 'balanced by gender' and a new process would be developed so incidents of concern could be more safely reported. Neither Mr Krop or Mr Hoffenberg have spoken about the emails. It is understood the survey found the majority of members were comfortable at the club, but 'gender bias' had occurred at a number of specific events and ceremonies. The Princeton University email scandal comes as the treatment of female students at campuses across the U.S. has come under greater scrutiny. Last month the Princeton Police Department said they were investigating the first email as it is illegal in New Jersey to distribute an explicit photograph without the consent of the person pictured, but yesterday the department said the case was on-hold until a 'victim comes forward' A fraternity gang rape has been reported in Virginia, and on Monday, Wesleyan University announced a ban on social activity for a fraternity where sexual assaults were reported. The federal Education Department is investigating sexual violence cases at 90 institutions of higher learning. Princeton's 11 eating clubs are not officially affiliated with the university, but they are the center of social activity for undergraduate students. Tiger Inn is infamous for its hard-partying atmosphere. It was also the last to admit women, in 1991, after being forced by the Supreme Court. Since then women have joined the club, but it is still a male dominated club. Some Tiger Inn attire bears the words 'more dudes' and club nights have had provocative themes. Last month, someone spray-painted the words 'rape haven' on the club's stone fence.","Princeton's Tiger Inn was forced to admit women by the Supreme Court .

"Blue cannot become red, white cannot become black, and stripes cannot become hoops. The sacred law of football kits will be broken by Barcelona next summer when they play in hoops instead of stripes for the first time in their 115-year history. Barcelona’s first ever kit in 1899 was red and blue halves but by 1910 the halves had become stripes and for the most part that is the way things have stayed. When the team won their first European Cup in 1992 at Wembley the players went up the old stadium’s famous 39 steps in orange shorts and red and blue striped shirts. Barcelona are reverting to hooped home shirts for the first time in their 115-year history, revealed by Sport . Barcelona celebrate winning the Champions League against Manchester United back in 2009 . Lionel Messi wears the traditional striped jersey during a triumphant season three years ago . Michael Laudrup and Ronald Koeman (pictured in 1992) alongside Johan Cruyff back in 1974 . Brazilian striker Ronaldo celebrating scoring against Atletico Madrid for Barca during the 1996-97 season . They had worn their orange second kit in the win over Sampdoria but to a man they had changed back into the classic number for one of the most famous photos in the club’s history as they collected and posed with the trophy. The stripes have become wider and narrower as time has past. From 1929 to 1940 only two blue stripes were visible on the front of the shirts. In 1949 a third blue stripe can be seen running down the middle and that is the way things stayed until 1999 when the centenary was marked by a return to the halves they had worn when they were founded. Halves were also used in 2008-09 when the club won its third European Cup. Henrik Larsson,Giovanni Van Bronckhorst, Carles Puyol, Ronaldinho and Xavi celebrating eight years ago . Samuel Eto'o alongside coach Pep Guardiola in 2009 (with Yaya Toure and Messi watching on) There have been some major deviations from the traditional in the form of second and third strips over the years. In the 2002-03 season the second kit was golden with a red and blue line down the middle and the third kit had a Crystal Palace sash. Pistachio green and luminous yellow have featured and the kids were really let loose in the crayon factory two seasons ago when the famous lollipop kit was presented. Its orange fading into yellow reminded supporters of a popsicle and was binned after one season. But messing about with the second and third strips has always been seen as fair game for shirt manufacturers who have to come up with new ideas every season. Romario scores the second goal in a 4-0 win against Manchester United at the Nou Camp in 1994-95 . Hristo Stoichkov celebrates scoring in the same game against United in Barcelona's famed stripes . Portuguese Luis Figo (left) and Brazilian Rivaldo celebrate after the former scored against Zaragoza in 1999 . But touching the home shirt still ranks as blasphemy. You might expect from an eccentric foreign owner with little sense of a club’s roots. But when the idea has come from, or been accepted by the club’s board, questions will be asked. Early indications are that fans are 70-30 against the innovation, there is still time for a rethink.","Barcelona will wear hooped shirts from the start of next season .
The Catalans have worn striped shirts for the majority of their history .

"Iran paraded its military might today in a show of force which came as Isis continued making gains in neighbouring Iraq and Syria which have taken it to within 15 miles of the border with Turkey. The Islamic Republic marked the 34th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of the country on September 22, 1980 and led to an eight-year war. Thousands of soldiers and members of the guard marched in front of the country's president, Hassan Rouhani, who gave a speech at the ceremony in Tehran.

Army Commander Ataollah Salehi, Revolutionary Guard Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari  and Chief of the General Staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Hasan Firouzabadi were other notable commanders in attendance. Every unit of the Iranian Army, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps joined in the parade, remembering the war in which around half a million soldiers died. The war is known as the 'Sacred Defence', and the parade was the opening ceremony of 'Sacred Defence Week',  starting at the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

President Rouhani jetted off to New York and the United Nations General Assembly immediately afterwards, and was seen off by a group of top Iranian officials. The Iranian army is made up of around 815,000 people - it has two parallel land forces - the regular army and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. Iran dramatically reduced its reliance on training and equipment from abroad after the war with Iraq in 1988, and the army underwent a huge restructure. Before the war it had been armed with the latest equipment from the West, including the USA, Britain and France, but during the war, as supplies ran out, they were also forced to Russia, China and North Korea. It now boasts more than 2,400 tanks, including the likes of T-72s, more than 1,500 armoured fighting vehicles, almost 900 multiple-launch rocket systems, nearly 500 aircraft and around 400 ships.

A map showing Isis presence within the Middle East - the terrorist group are now within just 15 miles of the Turkish border after further advances . The Iran-Iraq was lasted from September 22, 1980 to August 20, 1988 and came after years of disputes over borders and fears that the 1979 Iranian revolution would inspire a similar rebellion among Iraq's Shi'ites and that Iran may replace Iraq as the dominant country in the region. It was known as the Gulf War up until the Persian Gulf War in 1990, and is now sometimes still referred to as the First Persian Gulf War. It started with the Iraqi air force, under the orders of President Saddam Hussein, launching surprise attacks on the Iranians with formal warning, and also attacked on the ground, but they did not make much progress before being repelled by the Iranians until they had been basically banished from the country by the summer of 1982. Iran was the aggressor for the remaining six years, until the war finally ended thanks to UN-brokered ceasefire Resolution 598, which saw borders restored to exactly how they had been before the war. The final prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003. There were Iranians who fought for Iraq, and vice versa - including Iraqi Kurdish Democratic Party fighters siding with Iran. Around half a million soldiers died in total, and the war has been compared to World War I because of the brutal nature of the trench warfare, machine gun posts and forays into no-man's land. Chemical weapon use was prevalent from the Iraqi side - most famously mustard gas, which causes blisters on the skin and lungs. The war caused huge financial losses for both the Iranian and Iraqi governments - believed to be more than $500billion each, while it also significantly set back Iraq's scientific advancements.","Iranian soldiers paraded through Tehran to mark 34th anniversary of start of eight-year war with Iraq .

"Kurdish fighters have killed dozens of Islamic State militants in recent days as battles continue to rage around the strategic Syrian border town of Kobane. In one village, a Kurd was today pictured standing over the bodies of Islamic extremists after they were killed in Halimce, a village east of the town. Around 20 jihadists also died in the hills west of Kobane days after it was recaptured following months of heavy fighting which has left the town in ruins. Kurdish forces retook the town on January 26 in a symbolic blow to the jihadists who have seized large swathes of territory in their onslaught across Syria and Iraq. Scroll down for video . A Kurdish fighter points at ISIS militants laying dead on the ground in the village of Halimce, near the Syrian town of Kobane after they were apparently lined up and shot . The bodies of around 20 Islamic extremists were rounded up days after the Kurds recaptured the strategic town of Kobane following months of heavy fighting which has left the town in ruins . Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said: 'Nineteen ISIS members were killed in fighting against the (Kurdish) People's Protection Units (YPG) in the hills surrounding Manaz to the west of Kobane. 'Another three jihadists died in fighting around villages to the east of Kobane, while the YPG also took one ISIS member prisoner,' he told AFP. The YPG had also recaptured five villages around Kobane this week, according to Mr Rahman, whose Britain-based group relies on a network of sources inside Syria. But the Islamic State group still controls hundreds of villages in the area. 'Another 350 villages remain under ISIS control,' he said, referring to settlements in the area around Kobane. One civilian was also killed. 'ISIS shelling in the western countryside of Kobane killed a civilian,' said Mr Rahman, who has repeatedly stressed that the fight for the Kobane area is far from over.

"President Barack Obama joked today during a New York speech that he doesn't seem to have the traffic problems the city's residents are always complaining about. 'It's actually pretty smooth for me during the week,' Obama said, after playfully arguing that everyone in New York 'hypes' the traffic. 'I don't know what the problem is,' he told attendees of the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting. 'I haven't noticed.' Scroll down for video . Traffic? What Traffic?: President Barack Obama feigned ignorance of the traffic jams his visits to New York cause while speaking at the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York this afternoon . Obama said he told former president Bill Clinton backstage that his daughter Chelsea, left, whose due to give birth any day now, could use his motorcade if she went into labor while he was on stage. Chelsea is pictured here during Obama's speech with her mother, former Obama administration official Hillary Clinton, right . A very pregnant Chelsea Clinton showed off her baby bump at the 10th Clinton Global Initiative today. Soon-to-be grandfather Bill Clinton indicated in an interview that aired on Sunday that Chelsea will likely have her baby by October 1 . Obama started off the bit by saying he told CGI namesake and former U.S. president Bill Clinton backstage that if his daughter Chelsea went into labor while he was speaking 'she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic.' The president was seemingly unaware of how intensely New York drivers despise his visits and the traffic jams they cause around the city. Every time the president travels to New York police have to close streets along his motorcade's route, sometimes for long stretches of time, turning the city's busiest roadways into parking lots. The already busy streets were even more jam-packed this week as the United Nations convened for a climate change summit and a General Assembly meeting. Per usual, New Yorkers took out their outrage over the gridlock caused by Obama's motorcade on twitter. 'GO HOME OBAMA NO ONE WANTS THIS TRAFFIC,' twitter user Rebecca Plaine said. 'Thank you Obama for causing all this bulls*** traffic in NYC,' a user named Ramirez tweeted. 'Pres and Lady Obama we love you guys but please leave NY ASAP! This traffic is unbearable!' user Rachel Johnson begged. First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied the president to New York this afternoon, and the first couple will remain there through Thursday. After learning that Obama had mocked their travel problems, residents of New York and the surrounding area were even more irate. 'I know multiple folks who missed flights today because of him. File Under: No laughing matter,' twitter user @lisaedlisa said. Furious New York drivers directed their road rage at Obama on Tuesday afternoon . The president and first lady will be in New York through Thursday attending various United Nations meetings . President Obama was introduced at today's CGI meeting by the organization's founder, former president Bill Clinton. Obama said he noticed audience members 'trickling out' just before he took the stage after a panel that actor Matt Damon was participating in concluded . Obama was preceded at today's CGI conference by actor and Water.org co-founder Matt Damon, who spoke about the clean water initiatives. 'Always wonderful to follow Matt Damon,' the president jested moments after his traffic wisecrack. 'I saw people trickling out after he was done. 'These are the hardcore policy people who decided to stay for me,' he teased. President Obama is in the Big Apple this week for a series of events, including today's U.N. meeting, where he prodded the global community to cut carbon emissions, and the Clinton Foundation gathering. There he promoted the administration's new Stand with Civil Society program and advocated for the strengthening of civil society abroad. This evening the president will attend a Democratic Party fundraiser. Obama will again give remarks to the U.N. on Wednesday and Thursday before returning to Washington, D.C. on Thursday evening.","The president  joked today during a New York speech that he doesn't seem to have the traffic problems the city's residents complain about .

"Bad driver: Anthony Evans-Warner, 17, and his partner-in-crime, 15,  held victim at gunpoint to force him to show them how to drive manually . Two teenage thugs who attempted to steal a car by holding a medical student at gunpoint were forced to give up on their crime when they could not figure out how to operate the stick shift. Anthony Evans-Warner, 17, and his 15-year-old partner-in-crime set upon a first-year resident at the Baylor School of Medicine in Houston as he was set to leave for the weekend, police have said. When the teens discovered that they did not know how to drive the car, they threatened the medical student with the gun to force him to show them how to drive manually. The teens attacked the medical student as he pulled up outside his college accommodation near the NRG Stadium in Houston, The University of Texas At Houston Police Department said. Evans-Warner pointed a gun at the student, and ordered him to get out of his car. 'The suspects were unfamiliar with the operation of a standard transmission and they tried to get the victim to show them how to drive the standard while he was being held at gunpoint,' Inspector Stefan Happ told Click2Houston. While being held at gunpoint, the victim showed the teenage thieves how to drive manually, and was thrown out of his car a few blocks away. 'The officers were chasing the vehicle and apparently they had issues operating the vehicle,' Inspector Happ said. 'They then jumped out of the vehicle and ran on foot.' Police were soon able to apprehend the culprits and return the car to the male student. Evans-Warner, 17, has been charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, and is being held without bail. The 15-year-old is also being held, but his identity is being withheld due to his young age.

"Rory McIlroy has announced he will play for Ireland rather than Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Golf makes its return to the Games in Rio for the first time since 1904 and McIlroy, who hails from Holywood in Northern Ireland, would be eligible to play for either team. McIlroy has long faced a difficult and highly political decicion over his allegiance. He grew up playing golf for Ireland but admitted to Sportsmail in September 2012 - shortly after the London Olympics - that he has 'always felt more British than Irish.' Tough choice: Rory McIlroy at the press conference at Fota Island where he announced his decision . All smiles:  McIlroy on the putting green during the pro-am on Wednesday prior to the The Irish Open . But the 25-year-old two-time major champion admitted he has already made his choice during a press conference ahead of this week's Irish Open at Fota Island. CLICK HERE  to read Derek Lawrenson's exclusive interview with Rory McIlroy from Spetember 2012 . 'I see this as a continuation of what I have always done,'  said McIlroy, who has represented Ireland at golf's World Cup in the past but admitted the football World Cup in Brazil had influenced his decision. 'The World Cup is on in Brazil and it sort of gets you thinking,' said the former world No 1 and current  No 6. 'I've been thinking about it for a while but in saying that, (there's) no time like the present - the Irish Open, something big is happening in Brazil - and I thought, “why not?” 'I just thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to let everyone know, and now I’m really looking forward to Rio.'

Big hitter: The Northern Irishman has won two major championships and is a former world No 1 . 'Reunited with my clubs!': McIlroy tweeted this picture after his golf equipment finally made it to Ireland following his flight from the US Open . McIlroy faced a backlash from some corners following his interview with Sportsmail, in which he hinted he had made up his mind to play for Britain. He said at the time: ‘Maybe it was the way I was brought up, I don’t know, but I have always felt more of a connection with the UK than with Ireland. And so I have to weigh that up against the fact that I’ve always played for Ireland and so it is tough. Whatever I do, I know my decision is going to upset some people but I just hope the vast majority will understand.’ But McIroy said on Wednesday that his sense of allegiance to the Golfing Union of Ireland, the amateur body which runs golf in Ireland, influenced his decision. 'When I actually sat down and thought about it, had a little time to myself, it wasn’t because as a boy, as an amateur, my ambition was always to play for Ireland. Whether to play on the six-man team for the European Championships or the Home Internationals 11-man team, that was always my goal. ‘I played boy junior and boys golf for Ireland, I played my amateur golf for Ireland - just because I’m getting paid that doesn't mean I should change that.’ McIlroy, who recently split from his fiancee, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, drew parallels with the Irish rugby team which draws players from the island of Ireland. ‘If you look at most of the other sports in this country - rugby being the main example - they see Ireland as one. ‘And I have a lot of friends who play for Ulster who would say they're Northern Irish but are very proud to pull on the green jersey, as I will be in a couple of years’ time.’ McIlroy also insisted the final decision was his. ‘I was always just worried about what other people would think when actually it's your decision at the end of the day and you have to take ownership of it and be comfortable with it. McIlroy was born in Holywood, Northern Ireland, which means he is a UK citizen and so eligible for Team GB. But McIlroy is also an Irish citizen and played amateur golf for Ireland on an all-island team, so he is also eligible to play for that nation at the Olympics. ‘That was the decision I was most comfortable with and the decision that I wanted to make. ‘I’m very happy with my decision and I’m looking forward now to the Olympics in a couple of years' time - if I qualify, obviously, for the team,’ he added with a grin. Asked if he had been 'torn' on the issue, the former world No 1 added: 'More worried about what other people would think, rather than me. But you've got to do what's right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with, and ultimately that was the decision that I made.' McIlroy's golf clubs arrived safely in time for today’s Pro-Am but their delay from the United States after the US Open meant he couldn’t play a round with JP McManus on Tuesday at the Old Head of Kinsale.","McIlroy had choice over whether to represent Ireland or Team GB at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016 .

"An illegal immigrant was caught hanging on to the underside of a horse box transporting an Olympic gold medal-winning racehorse from Calais to Dover. The man was found clinging to the chassis of the horse box carrying  Valegro, which won gold with rider Charlotte Dujardin at the London Olympics in 2012. Police with sniffer dogs caught the man, who had chosen the largest and most accessible vehicle in the queue, as the vehicle was readying to return to England after an event in Norway. Scroll down for video . Stowaway: An illegal immigrant was caught hanging on to the horse box carrying Valegro, pictured, which won gold with rider Charlotte Dujardin in dressage at the London Olympics in 2012, pictured above . Groom Alan Davies said: 'We had queued at a manned booth to check in for the train, with just a couple of cars in front of us, and after checking in we were told to pull over once we'd gone through the barrier. 'I thought they just wanted to check the gas was off as they do on the trains, but security came over and looked under the lorry. They then said: ""There's someone under there"". 'They'd seen him on CCTV waiting around and when he'd disappeared they became suspicious.' Mr Davies said that he was shocked by what happened as he had taken precautions to guard against stowaways. If a trucker is caught with migrants in his vehicle when on British soil it is the driver, not the company, who is liable for a £2,000 fine. He told Horse & Hound: 'We were allowed to go – but if I'd gone through any further then I would've been fined. 'I've seen migrants hanging around in groups before, it was a big shock.' Valegro, who won Olympic gold at the London Games in 2012, had been returning from a demonstration event in Norway on Wednesday October 22. Dangerous: Police with sniffer dogs caught the man as the vehicle was readying to return to England after  an event in Norway. Above, migrants in Calais try to jump on to a lorry before it crosses the Channel . Migrants are flocking to Calais in increasing numbers this year, with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift shelters as they wait to cross the English channel. The impoverished conditions in the port city has lead Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, to announce a new refuge for migrants, likened by many to the infamous Red Cross camp at Sangatte. The failed camp acted as a base of operations for many trying to cross in the UK before it was closed in 2002. French authorities insist they have been left with few options after fighting between migrant groups lead to 70 people being injured this summer, while people have also been targeted by criminals. Just last month a crew aboard a P&O ferry were forced to turn a firehose on a crowd of around 250 people as they tried to force their way on to the boat. Suspicious: Police had seen the migrant on CCTV as he waited near the queue of vehicles and went to investigate when he disappeared. Above, desperate migrants try to board a truck from Calais to England . The lorry driver who filmed the chaotic attempt to board the ferry, bound for Dover, described Calais as a 'war zone' saying the situation was at its worst for 20 years. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The security of the border is a priority and we are working at European and international level to address the wider problem of illegal migration. 'We have increased joint intelligence work with the French to target the organised crime gangs behind smuggling and people trafficking. 'These criminals are constantly modifying their tactics in an attempt to evade strengthened border controls and we are seeing increasingly dangerous methods being used, including the use of sealed or refrigerated vehicles. 'We warn those who are tempted to put their lives in the hands of organised criminals that they are putting themselves and their families at risk. If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.'

"Stalker: Kathy Rowe, pictured, posed as her rival house bidder online, asking for men to 'force his way in and on me, while I say no' A San Diego woman who allegedly solicited rape and sodomy on a couple who outbid her for her dream home has pleaded guilty to stalking. Kathy Rowe, who won a local 'Mother of the Year' award in 2007, became so distraught after losing the property to the couple that she created fake sex-ads online pretending to be the wife, asking for strange men to break into her home and 'rape' her. The 53-year-old entered a plea bargain over the stalking charges, in exchange for prosecutors to drop felony charges of soliciting rape and sodomy and misdemeanor charges of identity theft and harassment. Rowe and the couple had both had their eye on the property in Carmel Valley, San Diego, but when Rowe was outbid, she decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell. The young husband and wife were initially subjected to bullying and stalking, which saw Rowe put a stop on their mail and sending religious missionaries to their doorstep. However, Rowe's hate campaign soon took a sinister turn when she allegedly posed as the wife in online adult entertainment ads titled 'Carmel Valley Freak Show,' inviting strange men over to the couple's home for sex . The online ads used the wife's picture and address, and described  scenarios of a rape fantasy. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at my door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' Rowe wrote to a respondent, posing as the wife. One man decided to follow up on the offer, but he was thwarted once by a locked gate and a second time when the husband answered the door. Two men who responded to the sex ads said they understood they were for consensual sex. Dream home: Kathy Rowe was so furious over missing out on this property in San Diego, she launched a campaign of terror against the new owners including posting online adverts looking for sex in their names . Worth jail? Kathy Rowe is facing three years in jail when she's sentenced in January 9 after launching a horror campaign against couple who out-bid her on this Carmel Valley home . Conviction of soliciting rape would have required Rowe to register for life as a sex offender. Rowe could face up to three years in prison when she's sentenced January 9. Rowe's lawyer C. Bradley Patton said he expects she will receive probation and possibly a period of home confinement. The probation would last three years, and the felony could eventually be reduced to a misdemeanor, Patton told the Los Angeles Times. Rowe has reached an out-of-court monetary settlement with the owners, the Times said. Desperate: A former mom-of-the-year was so desperate to buy this San Diego home she launched a campaign of harassment against the couple who beat her to it .

"With Princess Charlene days away from giving birth, Monaco's Prince Albert was forced to draft in sister Stéphanie as his date last night. The Monégasque royal was at the Fight AIDS Monaco Auction Sale at the Hotel Meridien and looked in good spirits, cheerfully giving his sibling a smacking kiss on the cheek as she arrived to join him. For her part, Stéphanie, 49, was chic in a tailored cream boucle jacket and neatly tailored trousers, and accessorised the look with a bright slick of red lipstick. Scroll down for video . Pucker up: Prince Albert plants a kiss on sister Stéphanie's cheek as he arrives at the auction . No nerves: Despite the imminent birth of his twin heirs, Albert, 56, looked happy and relaxed . She also joined auctioneers on the stage to help sell off some of the art, which was donated by painters such as Kenzo Takada, will all profits going to help AIDS victims. Fight AIDS Monaco is a personal project of Princess Stéphanie's and was launched to help people with HIV and AIDS live normal lives, free from discrimination and stigma. Stéphanie is the youngest child of the late Prince Ranier and his wife Grace Kelly and has enjoyed a colourful career, that has included stints as a model, fashion designer and singer. Her love life has been equally colourful, with a first marriage to her bodyguard Daniel Ducruet, followed by a relationship with an elephant trainer. After that relationship ended in 2001, she married Portuguese acrobat Adans Lopez Peres but the marriage ended in divorce less than a year later. Nice to see you: The royal siblings looked thrilled to see each other for the Hotel Meridien event . All smiles: The siblings sat together for the event, which was held to raise funds to help AIDS victims . Birth: Albert's wife Charlene, who is almost nine months pregnant with twins, chose to stay at home . Auctioneer: Stéphanie helped auction off some of the artworks on behalf of her charity, Fight AIDS Monaco . While Prince Albert is no stranger to a complex love life, his romantic life has been transformed since meeting then Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock in 2000. Now Princess Charlene, the sports star moved into the Palais Princier in 2006 and the couple married in 2011. Although heavily pregnant Charlene, 36, usually accompanies Albert to events in Monaco, she remained at home last night. Due to give birth to twin heirs within days, she last appeared in public with the Monégasque royal family on Monaco Day last month. Donation: Painter Kenzo Takada was among the artists to donate work to be sold at the auction . Last appearance: Princess Charlene was last seen on Monaco National Day last month . Imminent: The heavily pregnant princess joined the rest of the Monégasque royals on the balcony . Kiss: She treated husband Albert to a kiss on the balcony of the Palais Princier in central Monaco . Speaking in a rare interview days after the balcony appearance, Albert told local paper Monaco Matin that the birth is imminent. 'As it is a twin pregnancy the birth will surely take place a dozen days early,' he told the French language title. Princess Charlene, 36, who has chosen to find out the babies' genders, is, he revealed, under strict instructions not to tell him. 'The princess probably knows but she is playing the game,' said the expectant father. 'She is keeping the secret as I asked her to.' 'You know, one doesn't often have the opportunity to have such pleasant surprises in life. That is why I prefer not to know the babies' gender before the birth.' With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual. Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013. Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010. But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years. Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents. Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II. During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies. Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another double birth - for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - taking place. While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed. In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role. As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate. ‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins. ‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins. ‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’","Prince Albert was joined by sister Princess Stéphanie for charity auction .

"Steven Gerrard's Liverpool future is up in the air and the midfielder has a big decision to make regarding his future with the only club he's ever played for. Having made his Reds debut 16 years ago, Gerrard came on for the final 15 minutes of Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Stoke having been rested by manager Brendan Rodgers, who confirmed after the game that the club have offered their captain a new contract with his current 120,000-a-week deal ending next year. Here, Sportsmail's experts give their verdicts on whether the Anfield legend, who turns 35 in May, should stay on Merseyside or go in search of pastures new. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard turns 35 in May and has a big decision to make regarding his Anfield future . Gerrard has spent his entire career with Liverpool having made his debut for the club 16 years ago . The midfielder was rested and benched for Liverpool's Premier League clash against Stoke  on Saturday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers brought Gerrard on for the final fifteen minutes as the Reds won late on . Gerrard was in relaxed mood while watching the Premier League action at his home on Sunday . LEE CLAYTON - GO . Go. Go and get some sunshine and few bucks in the MLS. Gerrard has been an ambassador, a tremendous footballer and a terrific professional. He is also someone who won’t be fully appreciated by all until he has gone. He didn’t win the medals like Scholes and Giggs and he hasn’t scored as many goals as Lampard, but he’s my No. 1 and he should go out while he’s still remembered (by some) in that way. I get the ‘one club man’ desire, but Arsenal fans don’t think any less of Thierry Henry, do they? MATT LAWTON - STAY . He should stay and Liverpool simply can't afford to let him leave. Even if his powers are diminishing, his presence remains vitally important. If that means gently moving him into a player-coach role, so be it. He's too important a figure to lose. Gerrard has always been an important figure at Anfield and has scored a number of vital goals for the club . Gerrard netted a late leveller against West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup final as Liverpool lifted the famous trophy . ROB DRAPER - GO . He should go, not because he isn't needed and not because he's not good enough, but because he has done enough at Liverpool. He doesn't have to prove himself as a one-club man. He'll always be revered at Anfield no matter what happens now. It's clear Liverpool won't be winning the league this season and it would be extraordinary if that moment came again in his playing life, so now is a great time to seek new challenges and fresh stimuli. It's regenerated Frank Lampard and he only went to Manchester. But preferably, go abroad, learn a language, enjoy a new culture and the last two years of your career with a fresh challenge. Gerrard, pictured celebrating against local rivals Everton, will always be revered at Anfield no matter what . Gerrard made his senior Liverpool debut in November 1998, coming on as a substitute against Blackburn . 1980: Born May 30, in Huyton. 1988: Joins Liverpool academy. 1998: November - Makes senior Liverpool debut as substitute against Blackburn. 1999: September - One of three players sent off in bad-tempered Merseyside derby as Everton win 1-0 at Anfield. December - Scores first Liverpool goal in 4-1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday. 2003: September - Appointed Liverpool captain. 2004: March - Named England captain for friendly in Sweden in the absence of David Beckham and Michael Owen. 2005: May - Lifts Champions League trophy, scoring the first goal as Rafael Benitez's team fight back from 3-0 down to win on penalties against AC Milan in Istanbul. 2006: April - Named PFA player of the year. May - Nets twice as Liverpool win FA Cup with defeat of West Ham. 2008: October - Scores his 100th goal for Liverpool against PSV Eindhoven. 2009: March - Makes his 100th European appearance for Liverpool in 4-0 win over Real Madrid, scoring twice. May - Voted the Football Writers' Player of the Year. December - Makes 500th Liverpool appearance against Blackburn. 2010: November - Comes off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick in a 3-1 Europa League win against Napoli. 2011: July - Ruled out of the start of the new season after suffering an infection related to his groin problem. October - Scores on his return in 1-1 draw against Manchester United. 2012: February - Liverpool defeat Cardiff on penalties in Carling Cup final at Wembley. March - Hits hat-trick for Liverpool in 3-0 Merseyside derby win over Everton. August - celebrates 250th game as Liverpool captain. 2013: July 15 - Signs contract extension with Liverpool. 2014: April 6 - Scores twice as Liverpool beat West Ham 2-1 to move top of the Premier League. April 27 - Liverpool lose 2-0 to Chelsea  that effectively ends their Premier League challenge. Gerrard celebrates winning the 2005 Champions League with Liverpool - one of many trophies he has won . DOMINIC KING - STAY . Stay. This is heading towards being the hardest decision Gerrard has had to make. In his mind, the biggest point that needs answering is whether he will still be able to make a contribution next season. If he can answer it positively, then he has to stay. If he wants to try a new challenge and sample life in a different part of the world, not one person could begrudge him. There are still things for him to achieve and he is the iconic figure at the club. Liverpool would not be the same if he left. Whatever he decides, he will be given full support. What Liverpool must ensure, though, is to remind him of exactly how valuable he is to them. MIKE ANSTEAD - GO . Steven Gerrard has been a phenomenal player for Liverpool since his debut 16 years ago, but my fear is his legs don’t have enough battery left in them. If Luis Suarez was still there, they would be title contenders – but now they look a few years off challenging again. Gerrard doesn’t have the luxury of time for another slow, rebuilding project. Gerrard has captained Liverpool for a number of years and the club must show how valuable he is to them . Liverpool featured Gerrard on the front of their programme against Stoke to celebrate his 16 years at the club . SAMI MOKBEL - GO . It sounds unthinkable, but it's time for Gerrard to leave Liverpool. I saw him at West Ham earlier in the season and he looked a shadow of the player he was. It might be too far fetched to say his legs have gone, but he can no longer produce those rampaging displays that made him one of Europe's best players in the Premier League. He should go to a league where the pace of the game is much slower; Italy perhaps. He'll be able to prolong his playing career by doing that. MATT BARLOW - GO . STEVIE GO: For his own sake. His Liverpool career has been magnificent but a couple of years playing in the States, or Down Under will clear his head and give him the space to think and recharge after a career under scrutiny from start to finish. He can consider his future and if that is to be in coaching, he can get his qualifications and return to English football ready for that. CRAIG HOPE - STAY . Stay, for now. The MLS, however, is where he should ultimately head. Steven Gerrard has not become a bad player, he just isn't the brilliant force of old, and probably hasn't been for a few years. Only now is this being highlighted - on and off the pitch - in light of Liverpool's struggle. Were he not 'Steven Gerrard', his performance would not merit the scrutiny it is currently receiving. I saw him play at Newcastle this season, and he was Liverpool's best player. Rather, he was let down by team-mates. But Gerrard should try something new, for him and his family. The MLS is an exciting place to be right now and New York Red Bulls need a marquee player. The only question is, could one city accommodate Gerrard and Frank Lampard... Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Man United last term, may follow in the footsteps of former England team-mate Frank Lampard and try his luck in the MLS . STAY 4-7 GO . LAURIE WHITWELL - GO . Why not go abroad for his final few years and experience a different scene? Some of Italy’s giants are crying out for a midfielder of his stature – the recent Milan derby attested to that – and his playing days would extend further than with Liverpool. Would be a fresh challenge in the twilight of his career and he could still return to Anfield a legend in whatever capacity befits. JACK GAUGHAN  - GO . It’d be a crying shame if Gerrard’s career merely petered out at Anfield over the next year or two. He owes it to himself to go and play abroad, trying to win a league title somewhere; that could rejuvenate him. La Liga is a division which is beginning to operate at a faster pace but it’d suit the 34-year-old. It’s not as if he’s never going to enjoy a role at Liverpool when retirement does come. RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - STAY . He should stay. Not that his legacy at Liverpool needs enhancing, but there is something endearing about a one-club player. Besides, even if his form were awful, which it isn't, the club still owe him playing time for sticking around at his best.","Steven Gerrard is a 'one club man' having spent sixteen years at Liverpool .

"A senior Obama administration official told reporters on Monday that American citizens who have fought alongside the ISIS terror army have managed to come back into the country and are under active surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The stunning revelation came ten days after a Democratic New York congressman spilled the beans with a public  but little-noticed claim that there were 40 such 'foreign fighter' jihadis back on U.S. soil. In a gathering with selected journalists, the administration official acknowledged that it's true. The National Counterterrorism Center's latest determination, the official said, 'includes those who've gone, those who've tried to go, some who've come back and are under active – the FBI is looking at them.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to discuss specifics on Monday but wouldn't dispute what another senior Obama administration official said hours earlier -- that ISIS jihadis are among us . New York Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop told the Long Island Metro Business Action group on Sept. 12 that 40 Americans have returned to the U.S. after going overseas to fight for ISIS, and that the FBI has all of them under surveillance . The Pentagon said initially only about a dozen Americans have gone overseas to join up with ISIS, but now the administration concedes that some of them have returned successfully and are currently in the US . 'These are FBI matters,' added the official, whose name reporters were expected not to report as a condition of attending the briefing. 'I refer you to them on specifics.' The revelation marks the Obama administration's first confirmation of what Rep. Tim Bishop said Sept. 12 when he described to a Long Island audience how as many as 40 Americans have returned to the U.S. after fighting for the ISIS terror army overseas. He said also that the FBI already has all of them all under surveillance. 'One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,' he told the Long Island Metro Business Action, a regional economic development organization. 'It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.' 'It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country. Those 40 are under FBI attention and surveillance. So they are known and they are being tracked by the FBI.' 'ISIS' refers to the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, a murderous terror army that has left a wake of death, destruction, kidnapping and rape as it conquered more than one-third of Iraq and Syria. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said Monday during his regular press briefing that he couldn't comment on what would by definition be 'relatively sensitive intelligence information.' But he did say that the U.S. is 'working very closely with our international partners to try to mitigate this threat, to keep eyes on these individuals and to monitor their movements.' 'We've also been working closely with Interpol ... to track the movements of these individuals,' Earnest said. 'So this is an inter-agency response to a significant threat that we're watching closely.' The official who spoke Monday said the National Counterterrorism Center now estimates that 15,000 militants from 80 countries have at least made attempts to fight for Islamist groups in Iraq and Syria. That number includes 100 Americans and another 2,000 from Europe. Rogues' gallery; Salah Osman Ahmed (left) traveled to Somalia in December 2007 to train with al-Shabaab.

Jehad Serwan Mostafa (right) remains at large after being indicted for aiding a terrorist group in 2010 . An ISIS leader told followers on Monday that they should execute lone -wolf attacks in the United States and France because those two nations are the ones that have been flying bombing sorties against the group in Iraq. CNN reported that an ISIS spokesman issued a call to 'hinder those who want to harm your brothers. The best thing you can do is to strive to your best and kill any disbeliever, whether he be French, American or from any of their allies.' 'Civilians should not be exempt from brutality,' he said. 'Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict. Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers. Both of them are considered to be waging war.' ISIS can now muster 31,000 troops overall, the CIA reported on Sept. 17. That number has grown dramatically since June 29, when ISIS declared itself a 'caliphate' – an Islamic nation led by a supreme religious authority. American jihadis, part of a swelling 'foreign fighter' contingent aiding ISIS and other terror networks, could put their ideologies and experience to work in the United States, a fact that has some in Congress clamoring for easier ways to revoke their citizenship. The Pentagon said two weeks ago that only about a dozen Americans had left the country to join up with ISIS, while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of Islamist extremist groups in the Middle East and Africa. Foreign fighters: As many as 12,000 soldiers in the 31,000-man ISIS terror army have traveled into Syria or Iraq to join the Islamist group in battle . Bishop, the member of Congress who first discussed the size of the U.S> foreign-fighter problem publicly, insisted that they don't pose a serious threat. 'At the present time,' he told his Sept. 12 audience, 'the intelligence is ISIS does not present a threat to the homeland, although that is not something that will remain static going out into the future.' 'But there is a concern,' Bishop allowed, 'that it could metastasize in such a way that it could become a threat to the homeland.' Bishop backed President Barack Obama's approach to defeating the terrorist would-be country, which he said 'is a very, very complex and very, very dangerous threat.' Referring to remarks Obama delivered on Sept, 10, he said, 'I think the plan that the president outlined the other night [in his national speech] is a good plan.' The president 'is correct to recognize the threat, and it clearly is a threat to the stability of the Middle East, a region that is already remarkably unstable.' On Thursday, Senate Democrats thwarted legislation that would have revoked the citizenship of Americans who swear allegiance to terror groups that threaten the U.S.","Obama administration official concedes that ISIS fighters from America have returned to US soil .

"A Venezuelan neurosurgeon has learned a costly lesson after making a joke about a bomb at one of the busiest airports in the US. Dr Manuel Alvarado has agreed to pay $89,000 (approximately £56,500) in compensation after his wisecrack shut part of Miami International Airport, created chaos for thousands of travellers and sparked a massive police response.

The 60-year-old made the joke to an Avianca ticket agent when he was boarding a flight to Bogota, Colombia. After the agent asked if he had any explosives in his luggage, he replied: ‘C-4.’ The agent asked if that was a gun, but he explained that it was an explosive. Police were called in and part of the airport was evacuated until investigators determined there was no threat.

"An oil tycoon who was recently ordered to pay nearly $1billion in a divorce settlement to his wife, has seen his fortune cut in half due to a plunge in oil prices. Harold Hamm, 68, was, until recently, a man worth more than $20billion, but a drop in price of crude oil has seen has seen the value of his shares in his company fall by more than $12 billion since August. This comes after the Continental Resources CEO was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm last month. Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm (pictured), according to court filings released on Monday . Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of $995.5million, with about a third of the funds, or $322.7million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed. Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some $650million, in installments worth at least $7million per month. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25million since the case was filed in 2012. To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock. The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten-week divorce trial which ended last month. Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm's shares are in his name. Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at $14billion today . Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small-time driller worth less than $50million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. But under Oklahoma law, their 'active' appreciation since 1988 is subject to 'equitable distribution' with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. High-life: Sue Ann Hamm and the couple's daughter Jane are pictured at a lunch for the Wall Street Journal Innovator of Year award . The Hamms own four houses together including this vast property in an exclusive enclave of Nichols Hills, Oklahoma . Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case. In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control - that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth. The trial ended on October 9. This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together. In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of $3million. Harold Hamm pictured with Mitt Romney during his run for the White House. The oil tycoon donated close to $1million to the Republican candidate's campaign . Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down-to-earth and drives his own truck. His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new US oil prospect since the Sixties. Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney's presidential bid in 2012.","Harold Hamm sees value of shares in his oil company drop by $12bn .

"Five students have been charged with sexually assaulting a woman and keeping her captive in a darkened dorm room at a New Jersey University. The female student reported last week that she was attacked at accommodation at the William Paterson University and then held against her will. According to the criminal complaint, the five men turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim at the Overlook South residence hall. Jahmel Latimer, one of the five men arrested and charged after a female student at William Paterson University claimed she was held captive in a darkened room and the sexually assaulted . They then forced her to perform multiple sex acts before they stopped her from leaving the room. Now five men, who all lived in university residences, have been arrested and are scheduled to appear at Superior Court in Paterson today. Court documents show that the five men arrested were Noah Williams, Garrett Collick , Termaine Scott, Jahmel Latimer and Darius Singleton, who all studied at the University. The men, who are all 18, are facing a range of charges from kidnapping to aggravated criminal sexual contact, and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect.

Darius Singleton, left, and Noah Wiliams, right, who have also been charged. All the men lived on campus and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect . According to the Record, who obtained the complaint to police, Latimer is accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts. The other four men are alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury. The school's president Kathleen Waldron confirmed that all five of the accused lived at the university and have been 'barred from campus'. In a statement she added: 'My deepest concern is for the victim of this criminal act who has courageously stepped forward to take legal action and seek justice. 'No expression of anger or sadness on my part can alleviate the harm done to the victim and my heart goes out to her and her family.' The case comes just weeks after an article in Rolling Stone magazine described an alleged gang rape on campus at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia. The president of William Paterson University, pictured, confirmed that the men lived at the university but had now been barred from campus . The article detailed the alleged sexual assault of a freshman woman by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012. The university, in Charlottesville, has suspended all activities of its fraternities, sororities and related groups until January 9 to address sexual violence and assault. Police are investigating and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said he would be appointing an independent counsel to review the school's sexual violence policies.","Female student reported she was attacked at William Paterson University .

"Paris Hilton has become the target of anti-Semitic taunts and death threats from a crazed stalker who seems to believe the hotel heiress and her family are Jewish. The 33-year-old - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton have both been targeted on Instagram and Facebook by a man who has posted several abusive messages to the pair. According to TMZ, one of the posts he allegedly wrote read: 'I know ur Jew family gives nothing,' and another stated: 'KILL JEWS FOR FUN (sic)' Paris Hilton (left) - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton (right) have both been targeted by a guy on Instagram and Facebook who has posted several abusive messages to the pair . A post to Rick said: 'one month and she's dead, she's never coming home. (sic)' Another message to Rick read: 'I'll beat u and that bitch to unconscious.(sic)' The man is also alleged to have threatened to sexually assault the 33-year-old star. The Los Angeles Police Department has obtained a warrant to try to track down the man on the social media sites and believe they know who he is. This is not the first time Paris has been hit with death threats. In May 2007, the hotel heiress was sentenced to a 45-day jail term and before the stretch was due to start in June that year she was said to be inundated with threats from inmates. An insider said at the time: 'These maniacs have been writing, ""We're going to get you,"" and, ""I'm going to kill you."" It's horrifying. 'One person wrote that she's going to steal Paris' shoes when she gets to jail--and if Paris argues, she'll be beaten to a pulp.' Paris said: 'I'm very scared right now.'","The hotel heiress and her father were targeted on Facebook and Instagram .

"An eco-friendly ‘hobbit house’ made entirely from natural materials faces being bulldozed after planning chiefs ruled it was a blot on the landscape. Nature-lovers Charlie Hague and Megan Williams spent £15,000 building their unique roundhouse at a secluded location near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire using all natural materials. However, the couple, who built their dream without obtaining planning permission, now face having to tear it down after council officers recommended their retrospective planning application was refused. Scroll down for video . Nature-lovers Charlie Hague and Megan Williams spent £15,000 building their unique roundhouse at a secluded location near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire using all natural material including wood and rendered straw bales . The couple built their dream eco-home without obtaining planning permission and now face having to tear it down after council officers recommended their retrospective planning application was refused . The home looks like something Bilbo Baggins would be proud of. Pictured: Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins in JRR Tolkein's  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . The pair, both 26, spent four years living in a damp caravan before starting work on their home last summer. Made from straw bales rendered in lime and situated on land owned by Mr Hague’s parents, it took less than 12 months to build and is now said to be worth between £15,000 and £20,000. The couple said it was the only way they could afford a home of their own after prices of conventional houses in the area increased because of it being popular with tourists. Using local wood and all natural materials, they completed the house just weeks before their son Eli was born and now claim to live a self-sufficient lifestyle at the property - growing their own fruit and vegetables and rearing their own animals. However, they now face having to bulldoze their unique home – which looks like something Bilbo Baggins would be proud of – following an ongoing planning dispute with Pembrokeshire County Council. The authority told the couple that without planning permission they would have to tear it down, so the pair applied retrospectively a year ago hoping the Welsh Government’s ‘One Planet Development Policy’ - which encourages sustainable development - would persuade planners to let them keep their home. Charlie Hague and Megan Williams, both 26, spent £15,000 building the roundhouse and completed it just weeks before their son Eli was born. They said it was the only way they could get on the property ladder . Made from straw bales rendered in lime and situated on land owned by Mr Hague's parents, it took less than 12 months to build and is now said to be worth between £15,000 and £20,000 . But planning officers have now recommended the couple’s application is refused and that their eco-friendly house is razed to the ground. Planning officials said: ‘The proposal represents an unjustified residential development in countryside. ‘Despite its relatively low visual impact it erodes the rural character of its surroundings and represents an unsustainable form of development.’ The couple, who launched an online campaign to keep their home which has been backed by 90,000 people from all over the world, have vowed to carry on fighting. Miss Williams said: ‘We are confident Pembrokeshire County Council will view our retrospective application fairly in line with One Planet Development guidelines. Using local wood and all natural materials, they completed the house in under 12 months and now claim to live a self-sufficient lifestyle at the property - growing their own fruit and vegetables and rearing their own animals . Planning officers have recommended the couple's retrospective application is refused and that their eco-friendly house is razed to the ground. An official said it was an 'unjustified residential development' ‘We admit the house was built without planning consent but said there was no other way for them to afford their own home. ‘We have made the best of the space available to us and there’s no way we intended to flout planning laws. ‘I know it’s not a possibility for everyone, and our situation here is unique - but if young people are to live and work in the area they need somewhere to live.’ Mr Hague added: ‘We built this house to provide our son with a healthy environment to grow up in. ‘We were born in the area, went to school here, and have lived here all our lives. We wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.’ The couple said building the eco-home was the only way they could afford a property of their own after prices of conventional houses in the area increased because of it being a popular tourist destination . The couple, who launched an online campaign to keep their home which has been backed by 90,000 people from all over the world, have vowed to carry on fighting the dispute in an attempt to keep the eco-property . A friend of the couple described the pair as ‘heartbroken’ and said: ‘The roundhouse is a thing of great beauty which they put their hearts and souls into. ‘They are a young couple who should be applauded for solving their own housing issues by creating a sustainable home out of local materials. ‘Instead they are now facing the prospect of watching it being razed to the ground.’ Pembrokeshire County Council is due to decide the fate of the property next week.","Charlie Hague and Megan Williams spent £15,000 building unique eco-home .

"Nicholas Whittaker, 43, (pictured outside an earlier court hearing) has been warned he could face jail after cracking the window of a Thomson Dreamliner . A passenger who punched and smashed an airliner window during a row with his partner admitted in court he deserves 'no sympathy' after being warned he faces jail for his actions. Nicholas Whittaker, 43, sparked panic among passengers on the Thomson Dreamliner after he cracked the inner window of the jet with a single punch while it was 35,000ft in the air. The father of two, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to recklessly acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or anyone on it when he appeared at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday. The court heard how he lashed out on the Boeing 787 following a row with his partner Clare Houston as they returned from a holiday in Florida on May 25. The incident occurred at about 5.30am as the Dreamliner was coming to the end of its flight from Florida's Sanford Airport and was packed with families returning from their holidays, with many having enjoyed trips to Disney World in Orlando. The plane was approximately six miles above Ireland when the row broke out and the pilot considered diverting to the country's airport before ultimately deciding to continue to Manchester. The court heard how cabin crew asked Whittaker to calm down but he responded by telling them to 'f*** off' before punching the window and shouting: 'I'm not a f****** terrorist.' The force of his fist caused a crack in the glass of the interior widow, causing passengers aboard flight Tom145 to scramble to their feet in a bid to move to another part of the jet for fear it would shatter completely. Upon arrival at Manchester Airport, former bus driver Whittaker - who was not thought to have been drinking - was arrested by officers who were waiting for him at the gate. Police confirmed afterwards that no one was injured in the incident. After being released on bail, Whittaker said he was sorry for his actions but claimed to have no memory of the incident. He said 'it's not something I chose to do' and claimed to be seeking treatment for mental health problems. Becoming tearful, he added: 'I've only got one feeling about all this and that's for all those people that were frightened to death up there. I don't deserve sympathy.' Asked if he wanted to say anything to the other passengers on board the jet, he said: 'Sorry, but it's not a big enough word. Of course, they were frightened. 'There's some guy going nuts. To this day I can't fix that for them.' Whittaker said he had 'lost some hours of my life', adding: 'I don't know if I can get them back.' Scroll down for video . Whittaker (left) lashed out on the Boeing 787 as it travelled from Florida to Manchester following a row with his girlfriend Clare Houston (right). He admitted the offence at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court . He went on: 'For me to try to justify it is impossible. There's no justification. 'All I can do is offer the reasons and offer the apologies.' At yesterday's hearing, Judge Adrian Smith adjourned the case for sentence on January 6 and told the court 'all options remain open' including a jail sentence. Following the incident, aviation experts said passengers are only at risk if both the inner and outer pane of an aircraft window are breached. In Whittaker's case, it is understood only the inner pane was cracked. At an earlier hearing, Whittaker turned up to court with Miss Houston and listened as prosecutors outlined the offence. Prosecutor Miss Lauren Costello told Trafford magistrates: 'He became engaged in a domestic with Claire Houston with finger pointing to raised voices and in some instances pushing her head and swinging headphones which struck her in the face. 'Crew were aware his actions were causing concern and upset as there were passengers who were moving their children away. The 43-year-old father of two was travelling on a Boeing 787 Thomson Dreamliner (similar to the one pictured above) when the incident occurred on May 25. He was arrested at the gate upon arrival at Manchester Airport . 'He was advised regarding his behaviour but it didn't faze him. He was swearing at crew and passengers telling them to ""f*** off"". 'There was then a loud bang and raised voices. An attendant saw an internal window had been cracked due to a punch by the defendant. 'Passengers were distressed by the window and took to their feet and he then began shouting ""I'm not a f****** terrorist"" and required calming down. 'While it was taking place the captain was made aware and informed of the damage. 'The captain had to make a decision whether to divert or continue as it was an internal window made the decision to continue and police were called so he could be arrested. ' Whittaker's lawyers initially argued that he was not guilty of endangering life as the damage he caused was internal window and 'just cosmetic.' A Thomson Airways spokesman said: ‘We do have a zero-tolerance approach on all our aircraft. ‘Passenger safety is our paramount priority.'","Nicholas Whittaker smashed inner window of Thomson Dreamliner in row .

"'There was no holy war': A picture purporting to show Indian jihadist Areeb Majeed fled his home to join ISIS in Iraq, only to return because the terror group forced him to clean toilets instead of fighting . Disgruntled jihadists who travelled to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State are begging to be allowed back home after complaining they were forced to do menial tasks and had to suffer without their creature comforts. Foreign recruits have been writing to their parents with feeble excuses  that range from having to clean toilets and doing the washing up to the fact their iPod was no longer working or that it was getting too cold. One Indian jihadist, Areeb Majeed, 23, left for Iraq with three friends in late May amid fears by authorities that ISIS militants were attempting to recruit from India's large pool of young Muslim men. But the engineering student flew home on Friday to Mumbai after whingeing to his mother and father that he was made to carry out lowly tasks rather than fighting on the front line. A number young French Muslim converts are also having second thoughts about signing up to ISIS as revealed in a series of weepy messages home that were leaked to newspaper Le Figaro. One said: 'I'm fed up to the back teeth. My iPod no longer works out here. I have got to come home.' Another wrote: 'I've done hardly anything but hand out clothes and food,' he said. 'Winter is beginning. It's starting to get tough.' A third fighter said he was 'sick' of his time with the militant group, adding: 'They make me do the washing up'. They and dozens of other recruits are reportedly now working with French lawyers who have collected texts and messages that suggest the jihadists felt 'cheated' into joining ISIS. They have appealed for clemency from the authorities, with one lawyer saying that the longer they remain in Iraq and Syria the more chance they have of becoming 'time bombs' when they return. It came as Majeed was arrested and charged by India's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA) with terror-related offences when he arrived back home. The engineering student flew home on Friday to Mumbai where he was arrested and charged by India's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA) with terror-related offences . Creeping influence: Radicalised foreigners have been drawn to ISIS (above), which has conducted a series of mass executions and other atrocities since launching its offensive in Iraq and Syria in June . Majeed told NIA officers he was sidelined by the jihadists for whom he fetched water and performed other lowly tasks such as cleaning toilets, instead of taking part in the deadly offensive like he wanted, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. He phoned his family to say he wanted to come home after suffering an unexplained bullet wound for which he did not get proper medical attention, the agency said late Sunday. 'Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital,' he was quoted as saying by NIA officers. 'There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed.' India's moderate population of 150 million Muslims have traditionally not been drawn into sectarian conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, but the case of the four raised concerns about online recruitment. Al Qaeda announced in September a new chapter of its extremist movement charged with waging jihad in South Asia, prompting several Indian states to be placed on high alert. Tanvir Sheikh, the father of one of Majeed's friends who was still missing in Iraq, said he felt betrayed by his son. Mohommod Nawaz (left) and his brother Hamza Nawaz (right) became the first Britons jailed for attending a jihadist training camp in Syria. Mohommod had complained to his girlfriend about his treatment abroad . The brothers had photos of the terror camp training schedule and pictures of the camp on their phones . Sheikh said his son Fahad was offered a job in Kuwait but instead decided to travel to Iraq to join the extremists. 'He had got a job offer from Kuwait with a salary of three lakh rupees (£3,000) but he ignored that and instead took up arms. 'Now what happens to his future?' Sheikh told the Indian Express newspaper on Monday. 'I feel let down by my son. He had a bright career ahead of him but he took advantage of our love and betrayed us.' It comes days after a court heard how a British man jailed for conspiring to attend a terror training camp in Syria had returned home after whingeing to his girlfriend about his treatment abroad. Mohommod Nawaz, 30, was jailed for four-and-a-half years along with his younger brother Hamza Nawaz, 24, who was given three years at the Old Bailey. The brothers brought back bullets and took the pictures on their mobile phones to remember their time in the jihadist camp - which were later found by police and used to prove their guilt. Photos from the brother's phones showed the strict daily schedule at the camp included two sessions of 'military training', two sessions of 'Islamic lessons' and 'lights out' at 10pm. The day began at 4.30am with prayers, followed by physical training from 6am to 8am. There would be 'military training' twice a day and further Islamic lessons before bed. Creeping influence: Two extremist groups have pledged allegiance to ISIS  in the Libyan town of Darna and the Sinai Peninsula in recent weeks raising fears they could be expanding their caliphate in North Africa . Messages Mohommod sent to his girlfriend reveal he was far from happy in Syria. He moaned about not being able to use his mobile phone while training and feared being caught charging it by other wannabe jihadis. He wrote: 'Aint allowed to have a phone when training... cos I don't have it on me and I can't charge it without someone grassing me up.' He also admitted crying to himself at night over worries he might not see his girlfriend in London again. He wrote: 'I fear we may never see each other again. I was crying bares [lots] last night.' He later added: 'I'm in danger, you'll lose me if you don't marry me.' Radicalised foreigners have been drawn to ISIS, which has conducted a series of mass executions and other atrocities since launching its offensive in Iraq and Syria in June. Last week, U.S. security analysts warned that Islamic State's uprising in Iraq and Syria was gaining influence in North Africa where extremists are now 'mimicking its rhetoric and brutality'. They revealed how rebel networks in Libya and Egypt have been pledging allegiance to ISIS in recent weeks and are even being helped to set up new terror cells. The opening of a new front is concerning officials in Washington because the expansion is taking hold in two countries which have struggled to quash extremism in recent years. In Darna, north-eastern Libya, a group of young militants reportedly from the Islamic Youth Shura Council who claim to control the town, declared its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this month. The terror chief, who has long tried to recruit militants from Al Qaeda, responded by dispatching one of his henchmen to the town to become the group's 'emir' or commander. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's reclusive leader, made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state.","Foreign recruits write home to mum and dad with feeble list of excuses .

"French researchers claim to have found indisputable evidence that  Coco Chanel worked as a spy for the Nazis during the Second World War. A written record made public for the first time in a documentary broadcast on French television last night is said to prove that the late fashion designer was a member of Abwehr - Adolf Hitler's secret military intelligence agency. The documentary also raised questions about the role played by other French celebrities during the Second World War, including singers Edith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier and dramatist Sacha Guitry. Claim: A document made public for the first time in a documentary broadcast on French television last night is said to prove that Coco Chanel was a member of Abwehr - Adolf Hitler's secret military intelligence agency . The newly revealed document suggests that while working for the Nazis, Coco Chanel (pictured left and right) went by the codename 'Westminster' - a reference to her affair with the Duke of Westminster in the 1920s . L'Ombre d'un Doute [The Shadow of a Doubt], broadcast on the state-owned France 3 channel yesterday evening, countered the French government's official claim that almost every well-known figure from the time either joined the Resistance movement or simply boycotted the Nazis. Although the claim has long been considered spurious by French historians, the issue of doubt has largely been ignored by mainstream French broadcasters. Links: Coco Chanel is pictured with Winston Churchill's son Randolph at Ascot in the mid-1930s . According to the documentary, Chanel's involvement with the Nazis began around the time of the collapse of the French army in 1940. She returned to Paris shortly after and moved in to the Ritz Hotel, which was doubling as the Luftwaffe's French headquarters at the time. She soon began an affair with a senior Gestapo officer by the name of Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage and became so closely acquainted with the Nazi upper echelons that she was sent to Madrid in 1943 where she exploited her past acquaintance with Winston Churchill to try and strike a truce with British officers stationed there. Churchill allegedly ignored the offer, with historian Henry Gidel saying Chanel 'displayed incredible megalomania and naivety in imagining that she could change Churchill's mind.' The newly revealed document suggests that while working for the Nazis, Chanel went by the codename 'Westminster' - a reference to her affair with the Duke of Westminster in the 1920s. Her official Abwehr number was F-7124 according to official Nazi record - which has been secretly held in the French Ministry of Defence archives for the past seven decades. The host of the documentary, historian Franck Ferrand, went on to claim that Chanel used her Nazi influence to try and reclaim the perfume business she sold to a Jewish family in 1924. The documentary claims Edith Piaf (pictured) accepted two invitations to perform at private Nazi functions . Ties: The documentary's claims that singer Maurice Chevalier (left) and dramatist Sacha Guitry (right) were linked to the Nazis  largely centred on the idea that the stars' careers flourished in occupied France . To buy the book click here. Ferrand said the fashion designer had hoped that Nazi rules banning Jews owning businesses may lead to the company being confiscated and given back to her, but it later merged that the Wertheimer family had already sold their stake in Chanel perfume to a German businessman. The documentary's claims that Piaf, Chevalier and Guitry were linked to the Nazis were less fleshed-out and largely centred on the idea that the stars' careers flourished in occupied France - with Piaf also accepting two invitations to perform at private Nazi functions. The documentary claimed that officials in post-War France scrubbed the celebrities' records of Nazi links and invented ties to the Resistance movement in order to help rebuild the country's reputation.","French documentary claims late fashion designer worked for the Nazis .

"An advertising campaign showing a woman's breasts has been blamed for more than 500 traffic accidents in one day. The massive adverts placed on the side of 30 trucks driving around Moscow showed a woman's breasts cupped in her hands with the slogan 'They Attract' across her nipples. As the trucks trundled around the streets of the Russian capital, they left a trail of carnage as male drivers became so distracted they ploughed straight into each other. A total of 517 accidents were reported. Distracting: This is the advert pu on the side of 30 trucks and said to have caused 500 car crashes in Moscow . The stunt, by an advertising agency specialising in mobile adverts, backfired after police sent out patrols to round up all the vehicles and impound them until the risque images could be removed. Motorist Ildar Yuriev, 35, said: 'I was on my way to a business meeting when I saw this truck with a huge photo of breasts on its side go by. 'Then I was hit by the car behind who said he had been distracted by the truck. It made me late and left my car in the garage, and although I am insured I am still out of pocket.' Furious drivers across Moscow have reportedly bombarded the agency with compensation claims. A spokesman for AdvTruck.ru, which ran the promotion said: 'We are planning to bring a new advertising format onto the market, encouraging companies to place their ads on the sides of trucks, as we thought this would be a good alternative to putting them on the sides of public transport. 'We wanted to draw attention to this new format with this campaign' he explained. And he added: 'In all cases of accidents, the car owners will receive compensation costs from us that aren’t covered by their insurance.'","Campaign was intended to show off the visibility of mobile ad hoardings .

"Two Indian women have designed a line of 'anti-rape' jeans that send a distress signal to local police who then can locate and help the victim. It comes after a string of brutal attacks in the country which have horrified the world. Diksha Pathak, 21, and Anjali Srivastava, 23, from India's northern Varanasi city, said they have installed a small electronic device in the jeans which - when pressed - will send a call to the nearest police station. Diksha Pathak, 21, and Anjali Srivastava, 23, have designed a line of 'anti-rape' jeans that send a distress signal to local police who then can locate and help the victim . Officers can them locate the woman who had been wearing thanks to a specially installed tracker. Almost 200 police stations in the area have been equipped with the technology to receive the alarm from the jeans when activated. If tests to be carried out next month are successful, lawmakers will press for the system to be expanded nationwide. The women said they came up with the idea after a string of brutal attacks against women in India. Public outrage was reignited last . month by the deaths of two girls, aged 12 and 14, who were gang-raped . and lynched in their impoverished village in the northern state of Uttar . Pradesh. A rape occurs every 22 minutes in India, according to government figures. They have installed a small electronic device in the jeans which - when pressed - will send a call to the nearest police station.

'We have been thinking of making this device for a long time,' said Pathak, a science student and daughter of a cab driver. 'My father is often making himself ill with worry each time I am coming home late. 'These terrible gang rapes of women that we have heard so much about recently shocked me and my colleague to the very core. Hopefully no other women will have to suffer if they are wearing our clothing.' Pathak said she was assisted by her friend, a student in electronics communication. A pair of the anti-rape jeans cost less than 25p in India, and can be worn for three months before the batteries need replacing. Indian law enforcement and justice authorities have shirked their responsibility to fight sex attacks, a UN child rights watchdog said last week amid uproar over the horrific gang-rape and lynching of two girls. 'There has been a dereliction of duty in relation to rape cases,"" said Benyam Mezmur, deputy chairman of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes the loan signing of Chelsea forward Christian Atsu will add another dimension to his attacking options. The Spaniard is hopeful the deal to bring the 22-year-old to Goodison Park will be concluded by Thursday. Atsu's arrival would supplement the resources Martinez already has at his disposal, led by marquee summer signing Romelu Lukaku - also from Chelsea. On the move: Chelsea and Ghana winger Christian Atsu is set to join Everton on a season-long loan deal . Busy: Everton boss Roberto Martinez is still keen to sign another striker before the transfer window closes . Striker Arouna Kone is still at least a month away from fully recovering from a knee injury which kept him out for most of last season while Kevin Mirallas, like his Belgium team-mate Lukaku, is still getting up to speed having returned to training later than many of his team-mates due to his World Cup commitments. Steven Naismith is another alternative up front or off the right but Ghana international Atsu will give Everton something extra in the same way Barcelona forward Gerard Deulofeu did in his loan spell last season. 'We are hoping that the deal can be formalised and finalised by Thursday,' Martinez told evertontv. 'That would be a really good positive move to boost the squad. How ready he will be to have him in the team, it's too early to tell but we want Christian to be part of the squad as soon as we can. 'We are really excited and are desperate to welcome him to Finch Farm (training ground) to allow him to feel the Everton way quickly. 'Christian is a experienced young man and to be that experienced at a young age is incredible. 'He had a really good spell in Portugal then a big move and has played a lot of games in Holland. Playing in a World Cup with Ghana will give him a lot too. 'He can play on both wings, play through the middle and has appreciation of space. 'Technically he is very gifted and will fit extremely well. He has the hunger and desire to want to show what he can do in the Premier League and we feel we are ready to give him that opportunity.'

"Suing: Christopher Dietz says his construction business has lost $300,000 over the negative review on Yelp . Better think twice before you slam a business with a bad review on Yelp - one Virginia woman is being sued for it. Jane Perez was slapped with a $750,000 lawsuit by Dietz Development after she publicly logged complaints about construction work the building contractor performed on her home. In her write-ups on the popular business review sites Yelp and Angie's List, Perez accused the company of damaging her house, trespassing and stealing jewelry. 'Bottom line,' she wrote on Angie's List. 'Do not put yourself through this nightmare of a contractor.' Perez is only the latest online critic to find herself in court over negative comments post online. In . 2009, a San Francisco man was sued by a chiropractor after he posted a . Yelp review accusing the business of over-charging him. That suit was settled out of court. A . Chicago plastic surgeon sued three women in 2010 after they wrote online accusations that he gave them disfigured and misshapen breasts after surgery. In September, a Pilates studio in . Virginia sued two Yelp reviewers who complained that the business . smelled like mildew and that the staff was unfriendly. Free . speech advocates say businesses are increasingly resorting to legal . action to retaliate against negative reviews of their businesses. Christopher Dietz, the owner of Dietz . Development, said he had no choice but to file the lawsuit after he lost . $300,00 when customers fled his business over the review, reports The Washington Post. 'The impact has been awful,' Dietz said. 'There is no one to protect businesses when people slam their name.' He said he is not suing because of the negative review per se - he's suing because the allegations Perez made are false. Review: Perez posted a negative review on the popular site Yelp, as well as Angie's List, another business review site . Allegations: Perez claims her townhouse in Falls Church, Virginia, (pictured) was damaged by the work Dietz did . Jane Perez isn't the only Yelp reviewer to be sued after writing bad things about a business online. Free speech advocates say such cases are on the rise. 'If it's negative and true, that's fair. If it's negative and not true, that's unfair,' he told WJLA-TV in Washington, DC. Perez, a retired captain in the military, said she never thought she could be sued over something as common as a Yelp review. 'I don’t want to see what happened to me happen to anyone else,' Perez said. She stands by her reviews, The Post says, and maintains that what she posted was truthful. A judge in Fairfax partially sided . with Dietz this week - allowing the lawsuit to proceed and ordering . Perez to remove the parts of her Angie's List review that alleged Dietz . Development employees stole jewelry. Her lawyer says Perez's right to free speech and her right to express her opinion should trump Dietz's business interests. 'You should always have a right to . free speech. She should be able to describe her experience with the . contractor...she definitely told the truth,' her attorney said. The stakes in the world of online reviews are increasingly high. Yelp . is primarily known for restaurant reviews, but it has branched out to . include listings and customer evaluations for businesses of all kinds. It has become a review powerhouse, with 84million visitors a month and 33million reviews. A . 2011 Harvard University study suggested that for each star a restaurant . received on from reviewers on the site, the restaurant owners could . expect a 5 to 7percent jump in revenue.

Further, he invoiced me for work not even performed and also sued me for work not even performed. Today (six months later) he just showed up at my door and '""wanted to talk to me."" I said that I ""didn't want to talk to him,"" closed the door , and called the police. (The police said his reason was that he had a ""lien on my house""; however this ""lien"" was made null and void the day I won the case according to the court.)

"You better not change a lightbulb in Victoria, Australia, unless you are a qualified electrician . When travelling around the world, it's not always a bad idea to do your research on local laws and traditions. Not only could this keep you out of trouble, but it can also help you get the most out of your holiday. However, there are some weird and wonderful rules that surely nobody is expected to follow. But whether you are akin to having a sleeping donkey in your bathtub to enjoying eating somewhere that's on fire, it pays to be clued up. Erica Chang, regional director of HomeAway UK who conducted the research, said: 'Travel really does open the mind so it's curious to see what odd rules and regulations can be found on the law books around the world. 'Some might be seen as health and safety gone mad, but others are just funny – I'm sure most Brits abroad would never think they could be breaking the law if they changed a light bulb in Victoria or flushed the toilet at night while in Geneva so it's always best to know before you go!' 1. Only a qualified electrician is allowed to change a light bulb in Victoria, Australia . How many mechanics does it take to change a light bulb? None, in Victoria. Australia's second most populated state says it's illegal to change a light bulb unless you're a licensed electrician.

Milan requires that citizens must smile at all times, or face a fine . Milan in Italy states that it is a legal requirement to smile at all times, except during funerals or hospital visits. Frowners could face a hefty fine. 3. In Florida, it is illegal to pass wind in a public place after 6pm on Thursdays . 5.59pm is fine. You would be deemed to have been causing a public nuisance, so you best run home first to do it in a little bit of privacy. 4. In England, it is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament . This was voted the most ludicrous law in the UK in 2007. A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The people who know about these things here say there is no basis for such a law, not to say it does not exist somewhere in writing.' It is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament in the UK . 5. In Oklahoma, it is against the law to have a sleeping donkey in your bathtub after 7pm . Great if your donkey is awake and just enjoying a bit of relaxation time. Not so good if it has snoozed off in a lava of bubbles. 6. In Canada, by law, one out of every five songs on the radio must be sung by a Canadian .

"One couple knows all too well the pain suffered by the parents of James Foley, the American photojournalist executed on camera last month by the Islamic State. Billy and Karen Vaughn also lost their son Aaron Carson Vaughn in 2011, when the SEAL Team Six soldier's Chinook helicopter was shot down over Afghanistan. Now the couple are calling on President Barack Obama to step down, citing his reaction to the Foley video and 'lack of leadership' in confronting ISIS. Scroll down for video . Time to resign: Karen and Billy Vaughn (pictured above) wrote a letter this week, condemning President Obama's actions following the release of the video depicting the execution of American journalist James Foley by ISIS. The couple lost their own son, soldier Aaron Carson Vaughn, in a 2011 helicopter crash in Afghanistan . Killed in action: SEAL Team Six soldier Aaron Carson Vaughn was one of seven commandos killed in the 2011 chopper crash, in addition to an Afghan translator and military dog. They were shot down by enemy combatants . On Monday, the Vaughns wrote a letter, calling out Mr Obama's decision to go golfing after holding an important press conference on the Foley video. 'As Commander-in-Chief, your actions - or lack thereof - Mr President, cost lives. 'As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe. 'Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it,' the Vaughns wrote in the letter published on World Tribune. The couple go on to directly ask Mr Obama to resign so that a man or woman 'of courage and substance' can take over and address the 'out-of-control thug fest' happening in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS is attempting to establish a caliphate. 'As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole,' the Vaughns said of President Obama's decision to play a round after holding a press conference on the Foley tragedy . Vacation mode: President Obama was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard when the video was released by ISIS. He was photographed on the golf course at least two times after the video's release . 'It’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters... 'America has always been exceptional. And she will be again. You, Mr President, are a bump in the road,' they wrote. Billy Vaughn told MailOnline that  he has been displeased with the way President Obama has been acting at press conferences. 'I'd like to see him have some passion about anything going on in the world instead of just speaking in a monotone voice  like he has a script that has been made up,' Mr Vaughn told MailOnline. Their only-son Aaron Carson Vaughn was killed in August 2011 when a Chinook helicopter was shot down in eastern Afghanistan. All 33 on board died in the crash, including Vaughn and several  SEAL Team Six members. Vaughn and his fellow commandos were attempting to reinforce a group of Army Rangers after they ran into trouble during a raid to capture a senior Taliban leader. SEAL Team Six is best known as the group which carried out the execution of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011. After finally choosing to view the barbaric, on-camera beheading by ISIS of freelance war correspondent James Foley, I have been left with a level of rage known only to those of us who have sacrificed unspeakable offerings on the altar of world peace. My offering was my only son — Aaron Carson Vaughn. Aaron was a member of SEAL Team VI. He was killed in action when a CH47D Chinook, carrying thirty Americans and eight Afghans was shot down in the Tangi River Valley of Afghanistan on Aug. 6, 2011. Many times over the past three years, I have been asked what drove my son to choose his particular career. What made him want to be a Navy SEAL? My answer is simple. Aaron Vaughn was a man who possessed the courage to acknowledge evil. And evil, once truly acknowledged, demands response. Perhaps this is why so few are willing to look it in the eye. It is much simpler — much safer — to look the other way. That is, unless you are the leader of the Free World. As Commander-in-Chief, your actions — or lack thereof — Mr. President, cost lives. As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe. Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it. Please vacate the people’s house and allow a man or woman of courage and substance to seize the reigns of this out-of-control thug-fest and regain the balance we, America, have provided throughout our great history. Thanks to your “leadership” from whatever multi-million dollar vacation you happen to be on at any given moment, the world is in chaos. What’s been gained, you’ve lost. What’s been lost, you’ve decimated. You’ve demolished our ability to hold the trust of allies. You’ve made a mockery of the title “President.” And you’ve betrayed the nation for which my son and over 1.3 million others have sacrificed their very lives. But this should come as no surprise, since your wife uttered a vile statement on Feb. 18, 2008, during the primary campaign — one that speaks volumes of your true convictions. “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country,” she said. I am sure my deceased son thanks you for that, Mrs. Obama. Oh, and you’re welcome. Never in my lifetime have I witnessed such despair and such growing fear that the world’s last best hope, America, has finally been dismantled. Perhaps the better word is transformed — fundamentally transformed. Come to think of it, it’s become difficult — if not impossible — to believe things haven’t gone exactly as you planned, Mr. President. Amazingly, in five short years, your administration has lurched from one disaster to another. You spearheaded the ambitious rush to end the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan — with no plan on how to do so effectively. Also, the release of “the Taliban five” in exchange for one American — without consulting Congress — is also on your shoulders. You have been at the helm during unprecedented national security leaks — including, but not limited to the outing of SEAL Team VI on the Bin laden raid, the outing of the Pakistani doctor who provided the intelligence for that raid, the outing of Afghanistan’s CIA station chief, and the outing of your personal “kill list” to make you look tough. In addition, 75 percent of American deaths in Afghanistan and 83 percent of Americans-wounded-in-action have occurred on your watch, according to icasualties.org. And now, we have this recent, heinous event: the beheading of an American citizen by a barbaric organization you foolishly referred to as “the JV team” in your statements to the New Yorker magazine in January. You, sir, are the JV team. It’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters. America has always been exceptional. And she will be again.

"Education Secretary Nick Morgan said there is good evidence that having classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘can drive up standards . Britain's first new grammar school in fifty years is likely to be approved next month. Nicky Morgan is ‘open to being convinced’ of the case for the controversial expansion of an existing school in Kent. Tory MPs are putting pressure on the Education Secretary to give the go-ahead for a grammar school annexe in Sevenoaks. Previous proposals were rejected by Mrs Morgan’s predecessor, Michael Gove, because they failed to clear red tape put in place by the Labour government. But Mrs Morgan is now said to believe the new application is ‘much stronger’ after Kent County Council insisted its updated plan was ‘compliant with the regulations’. Meanwhile, the Education Secretary has insisted that a ‘rich ethnic mix’ can improve Britain’s schools. She said there was good evidence that classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘can drive up standards’. Her comments directly contradict warnings from Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, who said schools were struggling to cope with an ‘influx’ of migrant pupils. And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith last month said new arrivals were changing the ‘character’ of schools. In parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll. Speaking to the Observer newspaper, Mrs Morgan said: ‘I’m not one of those people who thinks that immigration is always a bad thing. 'The evidence from London suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards. ‘It’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education.’ She also said she disagreed with Mr Gove’s use of the term ‘the blob’ – describing an obstructive Left-wing education establishment resistant to reform – saying that it ‘didn’t help’. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged £67million to boost school standards in maths, science and computer skills. About 15,000 teachers will be sent for retraining under the plans, while school-leavers embarking on maths or physics degrees will be offered cash in return for going into teaching once they graduate. Pupils will also be taught to program computers, or ‘code’, as part of a new GCSE. Last month a study by Bristol University found that schools with large numbers of migrants and pupils from ethnic minorities gain the best GCSE results because they have a stronger work ethic. Mrs Morgan’s controversial comments come two weeks after one of her education ministers also claimed the influx of foreign students was changing the culture of schools for the better. Mrs Morgan again went to war with her predecessor Michael Gove, rejecting his portrayal of the education establishment as a left-wing ‘blob’ Nick Gibb, also a Conservative, said the fact that pupils who spoke English as a second language tended to be academically more able, because they had learned to speak two languages. But critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak English as a second language. In some parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll. The figure is around half in places including Slough, Luton and Leicester. Even David Cameron has said that immigration from Europe was putting ‘pressure’ on public services such as schools and hospitals. In her interview, Mrs Morgan said: ‘There’s no doubt immigration can put pressure on public services, especially in places like Slough, but I’m not one of those people who think that immigration is always a bad thing. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, who said schools were struggling to cope with an ‘influx’ of migrant pupils . ‘The evidence from London suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards. It’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education.’ Mrs Morgan said she wants a greater focus on ‘character education’ in schools. ‘What I mean is a focus on things like the additional character skills we all need to get on in life – resilience, grit, self-esteem, self-confidence.’ The Education Secretary also clashed with her predecessor Mr Gove, who would often use the word ‘blob’ as shorthand for an obstructive teaching establishment that was resistant to reform. Asked about the term, Morgan says it was unhelpful and created a false impression of ministers’ real attitude to teachers. ‘It captures the imagination and then it’s used for ever after,’ she said. ‘I don’t actually know who did it and I don’t know in what context… But it doesn’t help in terms of people then using that quote.’ One senior Tory at the heart of policymaking said: ‘Nicky is having a very difficult time of it,’ and that Gove ‘can’t let go’. A close ally of Mrs Morgan, who is also the minister for women, insisted that she was determined to make her own mark and that, ‘if they thought she would just be a Stepford minister’ without her own ideas and views, they had seriously misjudged her. She added: ‘Sometimes some of the language or the tone that was used, like “we’re going to take people on” and “we’re going to change things and challenge” was counter-productive; as I say, what gets lost are the people at the centre of the system. And most particularly the students. That’s who we’re doing it all for. ‘I would like the teachers to say she listened and parents to say she was on our side in getting the best education for our children. ‘My task is about listening to what teachers are saying, and saying to them, “What can we do? Take some burdens away, give you more freedoms?”.’","Tory MPs are urging Nicky Morgan to approve school in Sevenoaks .

"An Ohio family are in shock after their pet pit bull mauled a 59-year-old grandmother to death in front of her two-year-old grandson Marcus on Monday afternoon. Butler County Sheriff's discovered Cindy Whisman in her daughter's backyard just after 1.10pm after responding to a neighbor's 911 call. Daughter Julie Whisman said that her mother was watching her son when the family dog Polo attacked her. Scroll Down for Video . Mauled: Cindy Whisman was attacked in her daughter's backyard while she was watching her two-year-old grandson Marcus . Vicious: Cindy Whisman was killed by her daughter's pit bull Polo on Monday in front of her two-year-old grandson Marcus . Interned: Polo the pit bull is with the Butler County Animal Friends Humane Society and a decision has yet to be made on his future . Witness: Julie Whisman said that her two-year-old son Marcus has not exhibited any worrying signs of trauma after witnessing his grandmother's mauling by the family pit bull . 'As far as I know my neighbor told me she saw her and the dog outside,' said Julie Whisman to WCPO. 'She thought they were playing back and forth like this, then all of a sudden she saw her on the ground and kept saying 'Polo, Polo,' because that was the dog's name, and she was rolling over, so the neighbor called 911 and then she didn't see her no more.' Neighbor, Wayne Walker tried to save Cindy Whisman from the dog, but told WCPO that he failed to get to her in time. 'Whenever I hit him he yelped and took off running straight into their house,' Walker said. 'I looked at Cindy Whisman... she's gone.'

Distraught: Julie Whisman said that she couldn't believe her family pet, Polo, would turn on her mother with fatal results . According to the sheriff's office Cindy Whisman was mauled across her face, neck and abdomen and they confirmed her grandson was in the backyard when the vicious attack occurred. Julie Whisman said that she could not believe that Polo attacked her mother and said she has owned him since he was a puppy. 'It just doesn't add up to me,' she said to WCPO. 'My son could sit on him, lay on him.' Devastated, Julie said her mother's loss has hit her hard. 'She was my best friend, she was the greatest person to me,' Julie said of Cindy. Cindy said that her son did not seem to be too affected by the attack, but that time will tell . Polo the Pit Bull has been taken to the Butler County Animal Friends Humane Society. It is not clear whether the dog will be destroyed and that will not become an option until the sheriff's investigation is complete.","Cindy Whisman was attacked by the pit bull in her daughter's backyard .

"Brendan Rodgers said this week that Steven Gerrard is 'arguably the best player who's ever played in the Premier League', but the Liverpool captain didn't make his manager's all-time XI in 2012. Rodgers, who dropped Gerrard for Saturday's 1-0 win over Stoke, confirmed that the veteran midfielder has been offered a new contract at Liverpool and told reporters: 'I love working with Steven Gerrard, he's arguably the best player who's ever played in the Premier League.' In April 2012 though, appearing as a guest on Match of the Day 3, Rodgers picked Paul Scholes and Roy Keane as his midfield duo in his all-time Premier League XI, with Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola playing slightly in front of the Manchester United pair. Steven Gerrard prepares to come off the bench against Stoke City on Saturday . Gerrard replaced Lucas Leiva with Liverpool going on to score a late winner through Glen Johnson . Rodgers appears on BBC Match of the Day 3 while Swansea manager back in April 2012 . Brendan Rodgers' all-time Premier League XI . Clarifying his selection, the then-Swansea manager said: 'I went for a sort of triangle in midfield with Scholes, who is one of the best passers of the ball in the duration of the Premier League. 'A wee bit of bite in there with Roy Keane: win it, give it. 'And I guy who invented for me what I call the Zola zone - that space in between the midfield and the front line. (It was a) tough choice between him and Bergkamp.' Gerrard didn't get a mention. Two weeks later, Rodgers brought the subject up again in an interview, heaping more praise on Scholes. He told the Daily Star: 'I’ve loved watching him (Scholes). I’ve got such admiration for his game. He is a wonderful example of a British player. 'I was asked to pick my best Premier League team and he was the first player I picked – I can’t compliment him any higher than that.' Less than a month after that interview Rodgers had left Swansea to take the job on offer at Liverpool. Liverpool finished seventh in his first season in charge and second in May, coming agonisingly close to winning the title before Gerrard's unfortunate slip gifted Chelsea victory in a crucial game at the end of the season. Clearly, Gerrard has done enough in the last two-and-a-half years to convince his manager that he should have been in that original XI.

"It attracts one million visitors every year and counts itself among Britain’s most popular tourist sites. So it is perhaps surprising that Stonehenge has been featured in a list of the world’s most disappointing destinations. The prehistoric monument, located in Wiltshire, joined a host of the planet’s most visited destinations and attractions including the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and Paris as places that left visitors most unimpressed. Scroll down for video . Stonehenge is the UK's most famous prehistoric monument but has been branded a disappointment . Despite being located next to the busy A303, Stonehenge welcomes more visitors than any other English Heritage site in the country . Voters on social networking site Reddit.com,  criticised Stonehenge because it was ‘small, you can’t get very close to it, and it’s really not worth the rather long journey from London’. It is also just yards away from the busy A303 main road. One student pointed out that nearby Avebury Henge was much better, claiming it was ‘bigger and you can walk right up to it’. The monument was built about 5,000 years ago, and is believed to have been used as a site where prehistoric people buried the dead. It welcomes more visitors than any other English Heritage site in the country, and the organisation reported an 18.9 per cent rise is visitors last year and with up to 5,000 people a day flocking to the site in July and August. It wasn't just Stonehenge that suffered the ire of disappointed tourists - Los Angeles was also listed as a let-down for visitors. Despite being home to some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities, some travellers were left shocked by what they labelled ‘a run-down, dangerous and dirty urban sprawl’ Despite being home to some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities, some travellers were left shocked by what they labelled ‘a run-down, dangerous and dirty urban sprawl’. Many said it was ‘uninteresting’, claiming there was little to entertain visitors outside the well-known Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. Another gripe was that great distances make it impossible to walk around, and that the public transport is poor, making much of the city inaccessible to non-drivers. Another surprise addition to the list was The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, long considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Travellers bemoaned that the Pyramids of Giza site ‘can be seen from Pizza Hut’, and are so close to the noise and chaos of the city . For over 3800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man made structure in the world . Built between 2560–2540 BC, the monument is the oldest and largest of three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis. Also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, it is the oldest of the Ancient Wonders of the World and the last one still largely intact. For more than 3,800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man made structure in the world. However, travellers bemoaned the fact that the ancient site ‘can be seen from Pizza Hut’, and are so close to the noise and chaos of the city. Many said they were constantly harassed by locals trying to sell them things, while another said it the inside of the central chamber ‘looked like a cow shed’. Paris was branded the ‘worst city on Earth’ in the survey, with many criticising the rudeness of locals towards tourists.

Other accusations levelled at the city were that it was overpriced and dirty. Meanwhile, Venice was labelled as a ‘gigantic tourist trap’, by voters. The floating city welcomes around 60,000 visitors each day, leading to crowded streets and overpriced food and drink.

"The age of austerity is not just a passing phase and  Britain should get used to having a ‘permanently’ smaller state, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister used one of his most significant speeches of the year to say that low public spending and a ‘leaner, more efficient state’ would have to be maintained permanently in order for the UK to succeed. He said the country would have to rediscover its traditional ‘buccaneering’ spirit for private enterprise in order to generate wealth instead of relying on the state. Pro austerity: Prime Minister David Cameron made his comments at the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet at Guildhall in London alongside other ministers and lords . Keynote speech: The dinner is a chance for the Prime Minister to make a major announcement. He said the country has to rediscover its 'buccaneering spirit' His remarks are a significant shift . for a leader who said in 2010 that he ‘didn’t come into politics to make . cuts’, insisting: ‘We’re tackling the deficit because we have to – not . out of some ideological zeal.' In . his annual address to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet at London’s Guildhall, . Mr Cameron said only a smaller state and a ‘bigger and more prosperous . private sector’ could heal the economy. He . called for a ‘fundamental culture change in our country’ to champion . ‘that typically British, entrepreneurial, buccaneering spirit, and that . rewards people with the ambition to make things, sell things and create . jobs for others up and down the country’. Address: Mr Cameron was sat with the past and present Lord Mayors and spoke to a room of dignitaries, including the Archbishop of Canterbury . Applause: The room welcomes the head table before sitting down to dinner. Later Cameron would extoll the virtues of tightening belts . Impassioned speech: Cameron warned against an Ed Miliband-led government that would set the budget deficit and debts 'out of control again' Mention: Cameron said to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby: 'I hope you will forgive me for saying it's not robbing but to pay Paul, rather robbing Peter to pay Peter' Incoming: Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf is the 686th to take office. She spoke at the banquet, days after the inauguration parade . In an attempt to counter Labour’s . pledge to freeze energy bills, Mr Cameron insisted the single biggest . threat to the cost of living is the budget deficit and debts getting . ‘out of control again’ under a government led by  Ed Miliband. ‘There . are some people who seem to think that the way you reduce the cost of . living in this country is for the state to spend more and more . taxpayers’ money,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘It’s as if somehow you measure the . compassion of the government by the amount of other people’s money it . can spend. At a time when family budgets are tight, it is really worth . remembering that this spending comes out of the pockets of the same . taxpayers whose living standards we want to see improve.’ Opulent: Around 900 guests attend the event hosted in the hall's grandest room, which has hosted royalty numerous times since 1411 . 'More with less': The speech was a shift from David Cameron's claim in 2010 that he 'didn't come into politics to make cuts' Inauguration: Lady Judge Lord Mayor Alderman Fiona Woolf with Prime Minister David Cameron exchanging words after his speech promoting welfare cuts .

In a reference to the leader of the Church of England, who has protested about some of the Government’s welfare cuts, Mr Cameron added: ‘I hope  the Archbishop of Canterbury will forgive me for saying – it’s not robbing Peter to pay Paul, but rather robbing Peter to pay Peter.’ He said that if interest and mortgage rates started to soar because the deficit was allowed to rise again, an ‘increase in cost of living will far outweigh the impact of any increase in government spending or indeed reduction in taxation’. ‘This Government is not prepared to let that happen. Already we have cut the deficit by a third and we are sticking to the task. But that doesn’t just mean making difficult decisions on public spending. Procession: Cameron walks through the Guildhall with Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf and Nicholas Woolf, the Lord Mayor's husband, before the banquet . Sea of red: Dignitaries wait in the Guildhall before the arrival of the Prime Minster ahead of The Lord Mayor's Banquet on November 11, 2013 . ‘It also means something more profound. It means building a leaner, more efficient state. We need to do more with less. Not just now, but permanently.’ Mr Cameron said there was growing evidence that public services could be maintained or improved as budgets are reduced. ‘There are 40 per cent fewer people working in the Department for Education - but over 3,000 more free schools and academies, with more children doing tougher subjects than ever before,’ he added. ‘There are 23,000 fewer administrative roles in the NHS – but 5,000 more doctors, with shorter waiting times.’ He claimed the reductions were proof that a leaner state could deliver better results.","The Prime Minister urged against welfare cuts in speech at Lord Mayor's Banquet in London's Guildhall .

"Tiger Woods insists he 'feels great' ahead of his return to competitive golf this week after nearly four months out following back surgery. With his 39th birthday approaching later this month, the 14-time major champion faces serious questions over his future in the game. He has endured a year beset by back problems and a catalogue of injuries that date back to when he won his last major, the US Open in 2008, with a broken leg and torn ACL. Woods has watched Rory McIlroy usurp him as the brightest star in the game but returns to action at his own tournament, the Hero World Challenge in Florida, promising that he is 'healed', 'stronger' and finally able to put in enough practice to hone his game to the highest standards. Tiger Woods returns to golf this week after four months out following back surgery . Woods was last seen in action during a sorry, injury-plagued performance at the US PGA Championship . 'I feel great,' Woods told SiriusXM PGA TOUR Radio on Monday. 'I feel really, really good. It's great to be back out here competing again. I've missed it quite a bit.' Woods's last appearance before undergoing surgery on a herniated disc in his back was a sad sight, with the former world No 1 grimacing his way round Valhalla at the US PGA Championship. He has since fired swing coach Sean Foley and hired Chris Como to take his place. The early results of their work were put on show in a video released online on Monday (watch below). Their progress will come under further scrutiny at Isleworth during the annual event to raise money for the Tiger Woods Foundation, but the American is happy with the results so far. 'I'm excited that I have this much time off to obviously heal and get stronger and get my game in order for next year,' said Woods. 'I went through a period there for the last year, year and a half, where I didn't really practice that much.' 'I can finally log in the time, log in the minutes, and really delve into a good practice session and really get a lot out of it,' he said. 'And that's something that I hadn't been able to do in quite some time.'

"Astronomers have revealed hypnotic images of swirls, loops and arches that trace the remarkable structure of our Milky Way’s magnetic field. In what could rival works by Van Gogh, Esa claims that these remarkable images are some of the first to reveal the shape of the our galaxy magnetic barrier. Scientists hope its patterns could someday help them gaze back in time to get a clearer picture of what the universe looked like just after the Big Bang. Astronomers have revealed hypnotic images of swirls, loops and arches that trace the remarkable structure of our Milky Way’s magnetic field. In what could rival works by Van Gogh, Esa claims that these remarkable images are some of the first to reveal the shape of the Milky Way's magnetic field. Blue shows colder areas of the magnetic field, while red shows the hotter parts . To create the images, the Planck spacecraft tracked the  sky for more than 1,500 days, mapping the direction of light in the galaxy. While scientists can’t see the magnetic fields directly, they can see how they affect light that gets sent out by tiny dust grains that sits in the magnetic field. One of these – polarisation – carries a wealth of information about what happened along a light ray’s path, and can be exploited by astronomers. Usually, these fields can vibrate at all orientations. However, if they happen to vibrate in certain directions, astronomers say the light is ‘polarised’. Scientists hope its patterns could someday help them gaze back in time to get a clearer picture of what the universe looked like just after the Big Bang. To create the images, the Planck spacecraft looked at the entire sky for over 1,500 days, mapping the direction of light in the galaxy . Planck was launched on 14 May 2009 on an Ariane 5 along with Esa's Herschel infrared observatory. The mission is designed to study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the relic radiation from the Big Bang. The project, initially called Cobras/Samba, is named in honour of the German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947), who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Bby February 2010 had successfully started a second all-sky survey. On 21 March 2013, the mission's all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background was released. At the end of its mission Planck was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions. The final deactivation command was sent to Planck in October 2013. By measuring the amount of polarisation in this light, astronomers can study the physical processes that caused the polarisation, including magnetism. If the dust grains are not symmetrical, more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain, making the light polarised. The fingerprint-like swirls are echoed in a separate image, released earlier this year, which shows the first all-sky observations of ‘polarised’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the Milky Way. Even though the tiny dust grains are very cold, they do emit light but at very long wavelengths – from the infrared to the microwave end of the spectrum. If the grains are not symmetrical, more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain, making the light polarised. If the orientations of a whole cloud of dust grains were random, no net polarisation would be seen. However, cosmic dust grains are almost always spinning rapidly, tens of millions of times per second, due to collisions with photons and rapidly moving atoms. Then, because interstellar clouds in the Milky Way are threaded by magnetic fields, the spinning dust grains become aligned in the direction of the magnetic field. ‘There are still huge questions about what our galaxy's magnetic field is,’ said Professor Joanna Dunkley from Oxford University's Department of Physics. ‘The problem is that we are sitting in our galaxy, and have to try and construct a three-dimensional view of the field, but we can only look from here on Earth. ‘Much of it is messy and tangled, and the information in the orientation of the light coming from the dust grains, or the electrons, gets very hard to interpret.’ The fingerprint-like swirls are echoed in this separate image, released earlier this year, which shows the first all-sky observations of ‘polarised’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the Milky Way. By measuring the amount of polarisation in this light, astronomers can study the physical processes that caused the polarisation, including magnetism .

"San Francisco drag queens are sparring with Facebook over its policy requiring people to use their real names, rather than drag names such as Pollo Del Mar and Heklina. But the world's biggest social network is not budging from its rules. In recent weeks, Facebook has been deleting the profiles of self-described drag queens and other performers who use stage names because they did not comply with the social networking site's requirement that users go by their ‘real names’ on the site. On Wednesday, Facebook declined to change its policy after meeting with drag queens and a member of the San Francisco board of supervisors. The company said is usually deletes accounts with fake names after investigating user complaints. Drag queens from left, Lil Ms. Hot Mess, Sister Roma and Heklina take turns speaking about their battle with Facebook during a news conference at City Hall in San Francisco on Wednesday . ‘This policy is wrong and misguided,’ said Supervisor David Campos, who was flanked by seven drag queens during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall. The drag queens and others in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community say many Facebook account holders fear using their real names for a variety of reasons, including threats to their safety and employment. ‘I have crazy family members who I don't want contacting me through Facebook,’ said a self-described drag queen who calls herself Heklina. Facebook said it temporarily restored hundreds of deleted accounts for two weeks. After that they'll have to either change their name to their real name, or convert their profile to a fan page. San Francisco city supervisor David Campos, right, walks with drag queen Sister Roma to a news conference: Drag queens are sparring with Facebook over its policy requiring people to use their real names, rather than drag names . '(There are) a million different people with a million different reasons to use fake names,' said Sister Roma, a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence . Campos and the drag queens, led by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence - a San Francisco group of drag performers and activists that's been around since 1979 - say they plan another meeting with Facebook and are hopeful that the company will ultimately alter its policy. If Facebook doesn't change its policy, the drag queens at San Francisco City Hall on Wednesday said they would organize protests and boycotts. ‘Abused women, bullied teens, transgender people... (there are) a million different people with a million different reasons to use fake names,’ said Sister Roma, a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. Facebook says it policy ‘helps prevent bad behavior, while creating a safer and more accountable environment.’ The company says performers and others have other ways of keeping their stage identities on the site, including creating pages that are meant for businesses and public figures. If Facebook doesn't change its policy, the drag queens at San Francisco City Hall on Wednesday said they would organize protests and boycotts . Many in the drag queen community are professional performers who rely on Facebook to publicize gigs . Many in the drag queen community are professional performers who rely on Facebook to publicize gigs. They said a fan page isn't the same as a regular Facebook page. ‘Your reach is limited,’ said Rosa Sifuentes, a San Francisco-based burlesque performer who goes by the name Bunny Pistol. The company's policy has been around just about as long as Facebook itself. This isn't the first time users have criticized Facebook's policy. Political activists have complained, especially those living in countries where they could face danger if their real identities are revealed. In 2011, Chinese blogger and activist Michael Anti, whose legal name is Zhao Jing, had his profile deleted because he was not using his given name - even though his professional identity has been established for more than a decade and is better known. Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, has ‘merged’ her stage name with her birth name on Facebook in an apparent compromise. It's not always easy to determine which names are inauthentic. Some people whose real names sound fake have had their accounts deleted, too. For Facebook, the real names policy is not just meant to keep people accountable. The company and other website operators argue that requiring people to use true identities can reduce online vitriol and bullying. Real names also help Facebook target advertisements to its 1.32 billion users. Facebook estimates that 6 to 11 percent of its monthly user accounts were duplicate or fake in 2013. ‘We believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the United States or United Kingdom and higher in developing markets such as India and Turkey,’ Facebook wrote in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ‘However, these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination, such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Facebook has declined to change its policy requiring people to use their real names after meeting with drag queens in San Francisco on Wednesday .

"It's an opportunity Harry Potter fans have been dreaming of - to act out the roles of their favourite characters from the blockbuster movie series. Polish company Liveform and Rollespilsfabrikken have taken over a stunning castle in Czocha, Poland for a Live Action Role Playing festival (LARP) taking place next year. So if you haven't received your letter to sign up at Hogwarts, you could still be one of 180 students, staff, ghosts and creatures that come together to celebrate JK Rowling's other world. Harry Potter fans can act out their fantasies by attending Poland's version of Hogwarts . A castle in Czocha, Poland, is transformed for a special role-playing festival for Harry Potter . Students will get to test out some potions, under the watchful eye of their professors . And in this special video produced by Cosmic Joke, we get a chance to see the role-playing in action. Enrollment at the College of Wizardry opened today (December 1), with sessions running from April 9-12, and then a re-run on April 16-19. Mixing potions, discovering the woodland and even broomstick practice (though that won't involve going airborne) are all part of the mystical stayover. The cost 'per player' is around £140 which as well as including a roof over your head, you will be fed all your meals. A number of roles are filled at the role-playing festival, including the important role of the professors . It's hard work reaching the levels expected as a student at Hogwarts . The role-playing festival will attract a wide age-range of 'players' in April 2015 . You will also be given a school robe and a book. The rules are fairly simple - the majority of LARP players are students, and so are expected to behave appropriately as you would at any school. There are also a number of staff roles up for grabs - including the professors, the groundskeeper and the janitors. The professors will be expected to lecture, the groundskeeper is responsible for the woods around the castle and the janitors run the school, they are the law and their word is final. Broomstick training, plus a bit of game playing, will take place in the playground . Be careful when you trek into the woods, as there are a number of monsters lurking . Students will be expected to behave appropriately during the special few days . There are expected to be players from all over Europe, with Scandinavian fans historically making up a large number. But obviously the main attraction is the playground - hidden passageways, a room of mirrors, a tower, dungeons and cellars, great halls and dark hallways ensure, just like the young wizard does at Hogwarts. Just be careful you don't bump into He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.","Harry Potter role-playing event takes place in castle in Czocha, Poland .

"One of Nevada's largest and most elaborate brothels is now offering 'legal, safe and STD-free' package deals for those keen to indulge in 'a pay-for-play erotic vacation'. For $2,100, visitors to Sheri's Ranch just outside Pahrump can enjoy a two-night stay that includes transportation from Las Vegas, dinner with the 'Sheri's lady of your choice', a souvenir from the gift shop, and a $2,000 voucher for  the hotel's other 'services'. The upgraded $3,200 package includes all of the above plus an extra night at the hotel, an dinner of steak and lobster inside a themed bungalow, champagne and an open bar, and a 'guaranteed sex ticket' worth $3,000.

He explained that Nevada's licensed brothels are struggling against a background of recession, the rise of the Internet and high gas prices. They also face tough competition from an unchecked illegal sex trade in Clark County, which is one of five Nevada counties where brothels are outlawed. 'The brothel industry is about as badly bent as I've ever seen it,' Mr Flint added. 'I don't know that the industry as we know it is going to survive.' According to the newspaper, since Chuck Lee bought Sheri's and the 310 acres surrounding it in 2001, he has poured an estimated $20 million into the property, adding seven standard hotel rooms and three themed suites, a swimming pool, sports bar and a restaurant.

He also urged the French FA to turn a proposed friendly, against Brazil in March, into a farewell game in honour of the striker. ‘That is the minimum the French Federation can do, they owe him that,’ said Wenger, but his career advice for Henry was not to make a hasty decision. ‘I made him start at the age of 17 in Monaco,’ said Wenger. ‘So he had 20 years of competitive football and that deserves high respect and congratulations —not only for what he achieved but also for his focus on football.

"Seated Man With a Cane: Amedeo Modigliani's 1918 painting is at the centre of a court battle after a claim it was stolen from a Jewish dealer by the Nazis during World War Two . A billionaire New York City art dealer is refusing to return a famous $25 million painting that was stolen from a renowned Jewish art dealer by the Nazis during World War II, a sensational lawsuit charges. In court papers, Philippe Maestracci alleges that the Helly Nahmad Gallery -- located in Manhattan’s posh Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue -- is wrongly in possession of the 1918 painting, 'Seated Man With a Cane,’ by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. The canvas was owned by Maestracci’s grandfather Oscar Stettiner, a prominent Jewish gallery owner in Paris. But Stettiner was forced to flee with . his wife and two children months before the German troops stormed into . Paris and the north and west of France became occupied Nazi territory. 'Adolf Hitler, a failed artist . himself, then began the most notorious art looting raid in the history . of the world', Raymond Dowd, the lawyer for Maestracci, told MailOnline. 'The Nazis feverishly . pursued an agenda of destroying, confiscating or selling abroad art they . considered ‘Jewish,’ ‘degenerate’ or ‘modern'. In 1944, the Nazis sold the . Modigliani painting at an auction, with Stettiner, now living in the . unoccupied French region of Dordogne, powerless to stop it. When the war ended, all sales of art stolen by the Nazis were declared null and void’ under international law. But the Stettiners found it . impossible to track and recover the pilfered art because it had been . inaccurately labelled, according to the law suit filed in U.S. District . Court in Manhattan. As family members died out, Maestracci - the son of Stettiner’s daughter Maud Stettiner - became the sole . heir to his grandfather’s estate. In 2008, he learned that art dealer . Helly Nahmad, son of art czar David Nahmad whose family is worth an . estimated $3 billion, was in possession of the painting and planned to . sell it through Sotheby’s auction house, the lawsuit says. Helly Nahmad and David Nahmad pose in front of a Picasso painting at the Helly Nahmed Gallery, in New York (left). The painting at the centre of the legal dispute was created by Amedeo Modigliani (right) The Helly Nahmad Gallery in Manhatten is wrongly holding the Modigliani painting according to Philippe Maestracci . Mr Dowd of the law firm Dunnington, . Bartholow and Miller said Maestracci made repeated requests to Nahmad to . return the painting, but received no replies. 'They didn’t answer despite us writing to them repeatedly’, he said. 'The artwork, valued between $18 million and $25 million, apparently failed to sell in 2008.

Maestracci made repeated requests to HellyvNahmad to return the painting, but claims he received no replies.The artwork, which is valued between $18 million and $25 million, apparently failed to sell in 2008.The lawsuit alleges that the 1944 sale by the Nazis is 'void since it occurred without the owner's consent. The sale has been deemed in violation of international law and New York's law and public policy, which does not recognise forced sales under the Nazi regime'.A receptionist at Nahmad’s gallery she had 'no information’ about the lawsuit and referred inquiries to the gallery lawyer Richard Golub who did not respond. 'At this point, Philippe just wants to get this painting back into the family’. The lawsuit alleges that the 1944 sale as . orchestrated by the Nazis is 'void since it occurred without the owner's . consent in violation of international law and New York's law and public . policy not to recognise forced sales under the Nazi regime'. It asks for the return of the painting or its 'fair market value’. Modigliani, an Italian-born Jew who worked mainly in France, was known for his unique portraits and nudes. In 1920, he died nearly penniless at the age of 35, a victim of tuberculosis complicated by excessive drinking and drug use. A . receptionist at Nahmad’s gallery she had 'no information’ about the . lawsuit and referred inquiries to gallery lawyer Richard Golub who did . not respond.

"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is adamant that he's a changed man. And as the airline continues its charm offensive to win over customers, it has revealed a raft of new developments to be rolled out over the next three years. As part of its ongoing 'Always Getting Better' transformation, the carrier is set to make some huge changes, including the introduction of 'smiley face' interiors in planes, free Wi-Fi for customers and even transatlantic flights. Scroll down for video . Developments: The no-frills airline plans to introduce free Wi-Fi, transatlantic flights and package holidays . In an interview with the Irish Independent, the airline's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, revealed that the budget carrier has its sights set on offering flights to the US as well as well as Ryanair package holidays. He told The Independent: 'The party line is that we still need those wide-body long-haul aircraft and we don't expect we'll get those any time soon. If someone cancels an order and some become available, however, then it's possible that we could be doing transatlantic in about three years.' The carrier plans to launch the global flights under a separate brand, but with the same low prices and basic service of its European flights. There would however, be a business class section with more leg room. Vertical 'seating' -  In July 2010, Ryanair introduced plans to charge passengers £4 (about $6) for standing-room-only seats. Fat tax - In 2009, Ryanair proposed a fat tax for overweight passengers after a third of travelers voted in favor of the extra charge in an online poll conducted by the Irish carrier. Spending a penny, literally - Also in 2009, Michael O'Leary mooted the idea of putting a coin slot on the toilet door. 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet, I'd carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver,' he said. Carry the burden - Ryanair once thought of asking passengers to roll their own luggage across the runway and onto the aircraft themselves. Charging passengers £40 if they forget to print out their boarding passes. 'We think they should pay €60 for being so stupid,' said O'Leary. Could it be the end of the garish yellow? Airline bosses revealed that there are plans to revamp the interiors . Mr Jacobs has previously spoken about the airline's plans to offer package holidays, saying they could be a reality within 18 months. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Jacobs confirmed last month that Ryanair was planning to 'tone down' the decor on board flights - taking away the yellow colour and adding in more blue. At the front of the planes, the airline is planning pictures of destinations, smiling customers and happy staff. He explained: 'We’re looking at the permanent kind of overlay decals which go in the aircraft, we’re looking at a refresh of the interiors which would take away the quite strong yellow and present different images - some of our customers, some of our staff or destinations.' He confirmed the airline would be 'showing happy customers and attractive destinations' to make the aircraft feel 'a little bit fresher on the inside'. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and Head of Marketing Kenny Jacobs (right) revealed changes for the airline . Video courtesy of Shannon Airport. The airline plans to finalise the new designs in a matter of weeks. There will are also hints at launching free Wi-Fi within the next two years. 'We've started to talk to some of the more well-established Wi-Fi providers with a view to having a service up and running not in the next 12 months, but hopefully soon after,' said Mr Jacobs. Despite these changes, the budget carrier will remain low-cost and has recently added flights to Warsaw, Athens, Lisbon, Glasgow international, Cologne/Bonn and Copenhagen. The low-cost carrier has also just completed the purchase of 100 Boeing 737 Max 200s, which are valued at around £7billion. The 737 Max 200 is considered more fuel-efficient than most other current single-aisle airplanes and can accommodate up to 200 seats. Ryanair said that the order will increase its fleet to about 520 aircraft by 2024. The company runs more than 1,600 flights daily and now operates the biggest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe.","The airline has big plans for the next three years, including free Wi-Fi .

"A series of signalling problems has led to  rush-hour travel misery for rail commuters across the UK. The early winter period has seen a string of morning disruptions, with travellers in the Midlands experiencing particularly bad delays. Passengers on London Midland services have had to contend with long-running signalling problems in the Snow Hill area of Birmingham. And today, London Midland and Chiltern Railways trains were affected by a signalling problem between Hatton and Stratford-upon-Avon. Chiltern Railways trains were affected by signalling problems between Hatton and Stratford-upon-Avon (file picture) This caused disruption to services to and from Stratford-upon-Avon, with passengers being warned that disruption would continue throughout the day. Chiltern Railways services were replaced by buses between Stratford-upon-Avon and Leamington Spa, while London Midland was also running buses between Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Parkway. Trains which operate between Stratford-upon-Avon and Stourbridge Junction via Dorridge were not running between Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham Moor Street . Another signalling problem, at Bowes Park in north London, led to 60-minute delays between Alexandra Palace and Hertford North during the rush-hour, while signalling problems near Barassie in Scotland meant no trains were able to run between Ayr and Glasgow Central. Signal problems at Filton Abbey Wood  led to delays between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway . Abellio Greater Anglia passengers were held up by poor rail conditions between Shenfield in Essex and Liverpoool Street station in London, while another problem with signals, at Filton Abbey Wood near Bristol, led to delays to trains between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway. Tube passengers were also affected by signal difficulties, with a signal problem at East Putney leading to severe delays on the District line between Parsons Green and Wimbledon. Yet another signal fault, at King's Cross St Pancras, caused delays on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'We have warned repeatedly that under-investment in infrastructure and maintenance leaves Britain's railways on the constant brink of a series of breakdowns and failures, and that is exactly what has happened this morning on both the surface rail and the London Underground. 'Any turn in the weather tends to expose the weaknesses and today we re-issued the demand to both the Government and the London Mayor to reverse the cuts programmes. 'Yesterday the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLouhglin, was talking big about our railways. Today the travelling public are confronted with the harsh realities of a network operating on the edge.'","Signalling problems in Snow Hill area, Birmingham affected many journeys .

"Controversial: Tory councillor Danny Mayzes, 25, was suspended from his post after suggesting a violent film featiuring an electric border fence offered good ideas for dealing with immigration . A Conservative Party councillor who said a film featuring gun-toting border vigilantes offered a good way of dealing with immigrants has been allowed to keep his post after issuing an apology. Danny Mayzes, 25, of Clacton, Essex, was watching Machete, in which vigilantes patrol an electric security fence on the Mexican border, when he took to Twitter, saying: 'Am watching Machete - now that's how you DEAL with immigration.'

"The last time I found myself in such close proximity to a handsome continental chap, I was 16, and my parents had packed me off to Brittany for the summer to improve my French. Once there, of course, I immediately began a summer romance with the son of the local boulanger. While the garcon and I got into some merry old scrapes together, I certainly don’t remember Pierre, Gustav, Jerome, or whatever his name was, hanging me upside down, twisting me into yoga positions and dangling me from his feet. Today, 25 years later, it’s a different story. I’m trying out Tulayoga (‘Tula’ means balance and ‘yoga’ is union), the hottest treatment currently sweeping Europe. Scroll down for video . Alice Smellie gets an aerial yoga session from Geneva-based Louka Leppard who has celebrities and business tycoons across Europe are flocking to pay £350 for one of his incredible healing sessions . Devised by Devon-born but Geneva-based Louka Leppard, celebrities and business tycoons across Europe are flocking to pay £350 for one of his incredible healing sessions. At first glance it all looks slightly bizarre and far too intimate for a happily married woman such as myself: a massage followed by a combination of acrobatics, meditation and yoga moves, this second part practised while balanced on top of Louka’s hands and feet as he holds your weight. I have little truck with websites that insinuate the healing power of the foetal position (it’s curling into a ball, for goodness sake), and I am also suspicious of anything claiming to unite mind and body (hard to separate them in the first place without removing your brain, surely?). Also, Louka has little formal training. He went to art college, where he studied life drawing, and then became a graphic designer before devising this practice 14 years ago. The process begins with a massage before moving on to the acrobatics. Alice says the yoga is a completely unerotic experience . But once I log on to his website, I start to get it. Louka is quite devastating looking: dark-haired, with a chiselled jaw and the body of an athlete. Never have I studied a website so closely — for research purposes, you understand. From next month, we are informed, he is seeing clients in London. Will British women be queuing up for one-to-ones with the 43-year-old, like their French and Swiss counterparts? I suspect they will. To the envy of — and not a little teasing from — my friends, I decide to book an appointment. But on the day we meet at his West London clinic, I’m not feeling open-minded about upside-down yoga as the panacea to all life’s tensions. It’s the middle of a hectic week, juggling a back-to-school timetable of extra-curricular activities for my three children and I’m feeling fraught and decidedly grumpy. Complaints that I have bought the ‘wrong sort of sugar’ for their morning porridge consolidates my irritation. So I’m in a rotten mood and with very low expectations. I find it impossible to imagine I will ever be capable of curving gracefully in an airborne crab position (as photos of his clients on Louka’s website depict), no matter how good-looking the supporting act. Thankfully, although Louka is actually even more handsome than his photos, he is extremely matter of fact and reassuring. ‘There is no point in having expectations about the treatment,’ he says. ‘Everybody reacts differently: some people laugh and some cry.’ I lie face down on sheets in a bright white room and Louka begins the hour-and-a half-long massage around my whole body. While he makes no medical claims, his belly massage is deeply relaxing and clients say it has helped with digestive, menstrual and fertility problems. As yet I am not feeling any union of mind and body, just a bit stressed and very exposed, lying on my front in my knickers, covered by a thin sheet. But there is nothing like an amazing massage. My eyes close and I start to feel relaxed. Louka has little formal training. He went to art college, where he studied life drawing, and then became a graphic designer before devising this practice 14 years ago . Occasionally, Louka’s voice interrupts my stasis. ‘Breathe deeply,’ he says. ‘Release the tension through your stomach and into the ground.’ When he starts to massage up my back, he says thoughtfully: ‘There is a lot of tension here,’ as he pushes into my right hip. ‘It as though there is intense irritation that can’t be expressed.’ To my astonishment my eyes well up with tears. I think back to that morning, when trying very hard not to shout at my children as they moaned about their breakfast, then feeling bereft when they were cross with me. ‘It’s natural to feel emotional,’ soothes Louka as I brush the tears away, mortified. A few minutes later he smiles. ‘I can feel the tension radiating away from your heart.’ Alice says the bizarre form of yoga has emotional as well as physical benefits, making her feel more relaxed . This is the sort of comment that would normally have me snorting into my kale juice, but do you know what? Whether it’s the release of the stress knots across my whole back or the fact that he’s truly struck a nerve, I believe him. I feel lighter, as though a huge weight has been lifted from me. I can also assure anyone gaping over pictures of Louka, that it is a completely unerotic experience. Truly, it’s more like spending time with a really good friend. Alice says Tulayoga is life-changing . When we get to the upside‑down acrobatics, I am gently swayed up into the air where I am rocked gently to and fro. I feel no fear, just a strange floating, flying feeling. Beneath me are the firm and capable hands of Louka, moving my body into the unfeasible-looking stretches I saw on his website. Although I am upside down, his legs are restricting (not uncomfortably) the blood flow in my legs, so that it doesn’t rush to my head. At no point do I get that dizzy feeling you usually have when you hang, head down. The floating feeling is because my entire weight is being taken by Louka (‘I do have a weight limit,’ he says. ‘More than 80kg is a bit much.’) I feel very safe, and in contrast to my earlier tears, I can’t stop grinning — partly at the release of a great deal of pent-up tension. My body arches and twists so that my back feels wonderfully stretched out. Louka’s hands push on release points down my back and shoulders as I relax. He explains that the stretches in Tulayoga elongate and realign the spine. Finally I am lowered into the foetal position, which signifies the end of our session. Here, you are held in a firm hug and by this point my cynicism has vanished. It feels incredibly protective and comforting, like being held by an old friend. After leaving, I sleep a full night without waking, and in the morning I still feel happy and light. I don’t shout at the children, even when I find myself locked in the daily Battle Of The Lost Games Kit. A week on, and I am still relaxed and calm. It may sound extraordinary and mad, but Tulayoga is life-changing stuff. I even try telling the children that we ought to hug each other more, but they flinch slightly and I realise I’m pushing it.","Tulayoga has been life-changing for ALICE SMELLIE .

"These pictures show more than 1,000 cyclists laying across a central London road in protest at dangerous traffic conditions. Dubbed a 'die-in', protesters blocked roads outside the Transport for London headquarters in Southwark as part of a vigil for six cyclists killed in the capital this month. The demonstration saw riders spread across Blackfriars Road with their bikes strewn around them, while others held candles in tribute to the latest spate of casualties. Scroll down for video . Protest: Cyclists lay across a central London road as part of a mass 'die-in' outside Transport for London . 'Die-in': Thousands attended the Stop Killing Cyclists protest - held as part of a vigil for six riders who have died in the city this month . Donnachadh McCarthy, 54, one of the organisers of the Stop Killing Cyclists protest, said the plan was inspired by riders in Holland, who used similar tactics to push for investment in safe transport infrastructure. Beginning the 15-minute die-in, he said: 'We Londoners are going to join the Dutch, and follow them until we get our roads safe. 'So I respectfully ask you now, London cyclists and pedestrians and drivers who have come to join us today, to lie on the pavement with your bicycles, turn on your lights and let them flash in the memories of people killed and injured in the last eight years. He added: 'We are here because Londoners are fed up of being killed. We need to have modern, European, safe cycling network. We believe it’s a human right for children and pensioners to cycle around our city safely, and at the moment they can’t. Action: The protestors, inspired by riders in Holland who used similar tactics to call for investment in transport, were calling for better safety measures on the roads . Calls: Participants were calling for £600million to be spent on safer cycling in London following scores of deaths on the roads . 'We have brought the battle to TfL’s headquarters because these are the people making the decisions. We want representations and we want real funding. We want £600 million a year spent on safer cycling in London. 'We believe that we need a separate, segregated modern cycle network that is at least two metres wide. We can do that in London, there is plenty of space to do it.' Six cyclists have been killed on the capital's roads in the past month. Brian Holt, 62; Francis Golding, 69, Roger William De Klerk, 43, Venera Minakhmetova, 24, a 21-year-old man from St John’s Wood and a man believed to be in his 60s all died between November 5 and 18. Dramatic: One protestor covers herself in fake blood for the protest, while others lay on the road . Scale: Protestors laid in the road with their cycles for around 15 minutes for the 'die-in' The number of cyclists killed in London so far this year, 14, now stands equal to those who died in 2012. Scene: A cyclist his 30s died in Gateshead . A cyclist died after colliding with a double-decker bus. The incident happened in Shipcote Lane, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear at 4.08am this morning. The cyclist, a man in his 30's, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where he was later pronounced dead. Police and paramedics attended the scene and the A167 Durham Road is closed between Shipcote Lane and the Five Bridges roundabout while enquiries are carried out. Leon Daniels, managing director of TfL Surface Transport, said one of the protesters’ key demands - segregated cycle routes - were to be introduced in the next 10 years. He said: 'We are all shaken by the recent spate of deaths on the roads, and our sympathies are with all the friends and families of those affected. The protesters are rightly demanding safety should be at the top of our priorities. It is. 'That’s why we are investing nearly £1 billion in upgrading the existing superhighways with greater segregation, introducing major new segregated routes and backstreet quiet routes, and overhauling dozens of junctions to give more protection to cyclists. He added: 'Delivering such major improvements will take time, but we are working flat-out to do so. We and the mayor have set out our plans and the first major improvements, such as the segregated extension of the Superhighway to Stratford, are now being seen. 'Over the forthcoming weeks and months Londoners will see many more improvements as the investment we are making bears fruit.' The protest, organised in part by cycle activist group Critical Mass, follows a police operation that stationed hundreds of officers at busy junctions around central London. Vigil: 14 cyclists have been killed on the London roads this year - equaling the number who died in 2012 . Investment: TfL have said they are working flat-out to make improvements . Operation Safeway deployed 650 officers to 60 junctions during evening and morning rush hours on Monday, primarily targeting cyclists who breach the highway code. London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'This targeted operation has been hugely effective at raising awareness of road safety among motorists and cyclists. 'This is a balanced operation reminding everyone of their duty to take care of each other while out on the roads, and I hope the figures put to rest concerns by some groups that they are being singled out.' On November 5, hospital porter Brian Holt, 62, died on Mile End Road in east London as he cycled along Cycle Superhighway 2. He was crushed by a tipper lorry as it moved off from stationary during the evening rush hour. Architect Francis Golding, 69, crashed with a coach in Holborn, central London also on November 5. He died on November 8. The following Tuesday, November 12, Roger de Klerk, 43, died after he was crushed by a single-decker bus outside East Croydon station in south London. Cyclist: Venera Minakhmetova with her bicycle. She died on Wednesday November 13 . Latest victim: Richard Muzira who died after being knocked from his bicycle by a lorry in Camberwell . The next day Venera Minakhmetova, a Russian entrepreneur died after being hit by a lorry at the notorious Bow roundabout on the Cycle Superhighway at rush hour. That evening a 21-year-old man from St John's Wood was hit by a bus at 11.30pm in Aldgate, near the Cycle Superhighway 2. He died the following morning. A cyclist in his early 60s died on November 18 after a collision with a lorry on Camberwell Road in South London. He was named the next day as Richard Muzira.","Thousands took part in the 15-minute 'die-in' in Southwark, central London .

"A faithful German shepherd who defended his family by chasing away a bear risked being euthanized after his owners gave him up because of allergies and issues with their landlord. Luckily, activists took up Duke's case shortly after he was surrendered to New York City Animal Care and Control. The four-year-old pup's incredible story inspired a rescue organization adopt him and save him from the risk of being put down. Duke's owners admitted when he surrendered the dog that he had been a faithful companion. Duke was surrendered by his family after four years - even after he saved them from a bear . 'Duke is very protective of his family and will growl at strangers if they get close to them,' according to a report from Animal Care and Control. When asked about how Duke interacts with other animals, the owner responded: 'He chases deer and has chased a bear away from the family.' Pet Rescue Examiner, which champions pets that are in danger of being killed in shelters, picked up on Duke's incredible story. 'What a way to repay a loyal four-year-old German shepherd who protected his family by chasing a bear away; his reward - the family surrenders the dog to New York City Animal Care and Control citing allergies as the reason they are signing Duke's death sentence,' Examiner writer Cheryl Hanna says. Despite being fearsome enough to chase away a bear more than three times his size, his owners described Duke as 'a big puppy.' 'He likes to sneak under owners' arms while they're sitting and rest his head on their laps, giving them ""hugs."" He loves to be cuddled, kissed, and hugged,' an Animal Care and Control report says. Records show that Duke was given up for adoption on July 30 in the Bronx, New York. The Examiner reports that he could have been euthanized at any time after being dropped off at the shelter. Complicating his adoption process,Duke snapped at shelter staff as he was being handed over and he was listed as a 'New Hope' case - meaning only specially-trained foster homes could adopt him. On Tuesday, a rescue organization came to Duke's aid and retrieved him from Animal Care and Control. No word yet on whether he has found permanent owners.","Duke's owners game him up to the New York City Animal Care and Control last month .

"More than 6,000 people have died from Ebola, not 7,000 as was reported by the World Health Organisation, it has emerged. 'An error' in the number of deaths attributed to the disease in Liberia has been blamed for the error. According to the revised data, published yesterday by the WHO, the worst Ebola epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives. All but around 15 of those deaths have hit the three countries at the heart of the crisis in West Africa - Guinea, where the outbreak began last December, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Scroll down for video . The World Health Organisation has confirmed that nearly 6,000 people have lost their lives to Ebola, not nearly 7,000 as was previously reported . The UN health agency said in a statement: 'An error on reported total number of deaths in Liberia was published on November 28. 'This number has been corrected.' 'The cumulative total number of deaths in Liberia is 3,145,' it said, down from Friday's figure of 4,181. No further explanation was given for the revision. When the agency gave its previous toll of 6,928 deaths on Friday, up from 5,674 two days earlier, it put the steep hike in Liberia fatalities down to 'a reconciliation of historical numbers' and not to new deaths in recent days. It came as Spain was declared free from Ebola, according to the WHO. No new cases have been reported since nurse Teresa Romero Ramos, tested negative and was released from hospital. Since then, 42 days have passed - double the incubation period for the virus - without another case, allowing officials to declare the country Ebola-free. Spanish authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with healthcare worker Teresa Romero Ramos, 15 of whom were considered high-risk and were quarantined at a Madrid hospital, WHO said. 'An error' in the number of deaths attributed to the virus in Liberia was blamed for the miscalculation . It came as the WHO declared Spain free of Ebola, it having been 42 days since nursing assistant Teresa Romero Ramos tested negative for the virus having overcome the disease . In addition 145 hospital employees who helped care for Ms Romero during her stay at the Carlos III Hospital, were monitored. The WHO statement said it 'commends Spain for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus.' Ms Romero contracted the disease while helping care for a missionary who was brought back from West Africa but died. Following Monday's correction, the WHO said that as of November 28, Guinea had recorded 2,155 cases and 1,312 deaths, Liberia saw 7,635 cases and 3,145 deaths while Sierra Leone reported 7,109 cases and 1,530 deaths. There have also been 15 fatalities in other countries, bringing the total to 6,002. Also on Monday, the WHO said 'meaningful progress' had been made towards reducing the spread of Ebola by isolating patients and burying bodies safely. But Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward said that a target for 100 percent isolation of patients and 100 percent safe burials by January 1 will be 'challenging' to meet. He warned that in Liberia there were signs of 'a sense of complacency setting in'.","On November 28 WHO reported death toll had nearly reached 7,000 .

"Mario Balotelli's continued slump is nothing a touch of tender loving care can't solve, says Andrea Pirlo. The Liverpool striker has struggled severely in front of goal since joining for £16million in the summer. His attitude has also come into question, with critics aiming pot-shots at the Italian's work ethic and general demeanour. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Mario Balotelli has struggled to find his feet after signing for Liverpool for £16million in the summer . The Italian striker (pictured reacting against Hull City) is yet to score a Premier League goal for the Reds . But Pirlo - who played alongside Balotelli at AC Milan and for Italy - believes the 24-year-old merely needs an arm around the shoulder from his manager Brendan Rodgers. ‘The difference between other players and Mario is that every action he takes is going to be scrutinised,' Pirlo said. 'The media is interested in him, and things he does are going to be highlighted - where perhaps with other players they would not get such a reaction - or maybe even no reaction at all. ‘There is no question over his talent - I have played with him and I know how good he is and how good he can be. It is the job of the Liverpool coach to manage him in the right way.' Juventus' Andrea Pirlo said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers needs to show some love to Balotelli . Rodgers has so far persevered with Balotelli up front in the league but faces some difficult decisions . Liverpool fans will be left wondering why Balotelli has still failed to score in the Premier League, but Pirlo is left in no doubt that his former team-mate will become a star on Merseyside. ‘He needs to be loved, he needs direction, but most importantly he needs to know that the coach believes in him,' the midfielder added. 'If he spends time with Mario - I know he can still go on and be a great player for Liverpool.'","Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool .

"The controversial 'Pick Up Artist' Julien Blanc who has sparked worldwide outrage after a video emerged of him strangling a woman was mentored by a fellow 'dating guru' who apparently bragged about raping a stripper. Blanc. from Los Angeles, now faces a ban from entering the UK to hold a series of workshops after Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone, said she was lobbying Home Secretary Theresa May to refuse him a visa. But Blanc is not alone in advocating his aggressive approaches to meet women. He was taught by the founders of Real Social Dynamics, Nick Kho and Owen Cook. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Julien Blanc was thrown out of Australia and faces a ban on entering the UK after video footage shows the 25-year-old 'dating guru' using racist language and grabbing women by the throat . Predator: One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding' Cook – who also goes by the alias Tyler Durden, after Brad Pitt’s character in the movie Fight Club – appears in a video from one seminar telling of his pride at forcing a stripper into having sex with him. In an expletive filled tirade - recorded on video - he tells his crowd: ‘She was a stripper... I f*****g hated that f*****g b***h. ‘The last way I f****d her too … I just threw her on the bed and I put it in her, and I could barely even get it in because she was just totally not in the mood. ‘And I was like, ""F**k it, I'm never seeing this b***h again. I don't care.' ‘So I just like, jam it in, and it's all tight and dry and I f**k her.’ Jennifer Li, a woman from Washington, D.C. who has launched a campaign against RSD, tweeted the video on November 7. She added: 'It looks like RSD's founder Owen Cook admitted to rape in this clip.' The video has since disappeared from YouTube. While Blanc is listed as an Executive Coach on RSD's website, Cook is his superior, a co-founder of the company with the title of Executive Producer. The Canadian, who now lives in California, was one of the first to comment on Blanc’s now notorious video, made in Japan, where he encourages men to grab hold of random women by the neck and push them toward their crotches. Blanc said that: 'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want.' Shockingly, Cook said he felt the video was 'pretty tame by Julien's standards'. Aka Tyler Durden: As Executive Producer of RSD, Owen Cook is Blanc's boss. He said that the shocking video of Blanc in Japan was 'tame' 'I hated that b***h': Cook, originally from Canada, was recorded on video recounting how he forced himself on a stripper. Critics of RSD said it amounted to an admission of rape . Girlfriend: Cook has been dating Roxanna, above, for four years and has a son with her - who he told an audience was a 'mistake'. Roxanna also works with RSD advising men how to pick up women . Surprisingly for a pick up artist, Cook is father to a four-year-old son, Vincent, who he had with his long-term girlfriend Roxanna, who also works for RSD. The company offers young men coaching seminars around the world, charging around £1,200 for tips on how to date women. Cook appeared in one video with his son. He introduces Vincent to the crowd, pats him on the head, before saying: 'You were an accident. You were an accident.' Alongside Cook, co-owner Nick Kho – known in the pickup artist community as ‘Papa’ – appears to take more of a backseat in the operations. He married documentary-maker Amber Holmes, who claims to run a female equivalent company to RSD called Lovelogica, in 2012. A dating website review website says his claim to fame is having taken the phone number of Paris Hilton twice - but never dated her. He declined to defend his company’s practices when contacted by MailOnline for this article. RSD's cadre also includes Executive Coach, Jeff Allen, who is notorious around San Francisco’s Mission District for driving his brightly decorated vehicle, which he refers to as his 'rape van', from which he hurls abuse at women who reject him during dates. Big daddy: Nick Cho is also the co-founder of RSD. He is married to a documentary maker, Amber (left) and dating review websites say he is proud of getting Paris Hilton's number twice - but didn't date her . Too late: Blanc appeared on CNN to apologise for the video in a desperate attempt to dampen global anger . One woman who met with Allen at a tapas bar he frequents has described how things took a turn for the worse when she refused his advances. Jolene Parton wrote on her blog that after she had left his company he texted her almost immediately saying: 'Kill yourself n****r. You're pathetic. The cognitive dissonance must be killing you.' The spotlight was thrown on Blanc and RSD last week when the video in Japan went viral on the internet. Footage shows the 25-year-old Mr Blanc using the racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat. His other proposed methods include threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from their friends. One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding’ . A blog post describes how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women. A blog post by Blanc explains how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women . It states: ‘Makes threats to hurt her; make her drop charges; make her do illegal things; threaten to report her to welfare; prevent her from taking a job; take her money and humiliate her.’ In the wake of the media storm around RSD, the company has remained silent, although Blanc has appeared on news network CNN, where he apologised for the content of his past seminars. He said: 'I am extremely sorry. I feel horrible. Those pictures that you're referring to, like choking women, I just want to make that clear, that is not what I teach. Those pictures are a horrible attempt at humour.' Whether it does anything to quell the outrage over Blanc and RSD remains to be seen. He was forced to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled. A similar campaign was mounted to bar him from Canada. A petition calling for him to be refused entry to the UK has received more than 136,000 signatures. The woman behind the petition, who goes by the pseudonym of Caroline Charles said: 'Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous - he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money. 'It is wrong on every level - it is promoting violence against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message to survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to. To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.’ Other commentators have suggested that the campaign against Mr Blanc merely generates him unwarranted publicity. Money maker: RSD rakes in £1,200 a person at seminars around the world attended by young men desperate to be successful at the dating game . Blanc’s company, Real Social Dynamics, runs three day courses costing around £1,200. His company is due to host a two day course starting on 27th November and another from December 19. Eleven more events are scheduled for next year. Mrs May can use discretionary powers to ban anyone for reasons of 'unacceptable behaviour'. The Home Office refused to comment on the specific case for legal reasons. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.’ Mr Blanc’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"With 100,178 passengers expected to fly on Christmas Day, London's Heathrow Airport is making an effort to ensure that no one misses out on their festive holiday feast. Travellers will be treated to turkey, sage and onion stuffing, and Christmas pudding in the form of three specially created boiled sweets. Aptly named Boarding Bon Bons, the treats have been designed to perfectly recreate traditional Christmas dinner flavours. London's Heathrow Airport will provide holiday travellers with Christmas dinner-inspired boiled sweets . Called Boarding Bon Bons, the festive treats will be handed out from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day . Just before the Queen takes to the nation’s TV screens there will be an estimated 16,677 Heathrow passengers in the air during the traditional Christmas lunch time between 1pm and 3pm. This year, Heathrow will become the first airport in the world to offer its passengers a festive twist on this tradition with Christmas dinner sweets that can be enjoyed at 30,000ft. The treats were developed alongside one of the UK’s leading independent confectionary creators. The Christmas pudding has hints of brandy butter, raisin and Christmas spices, while the turkey and sage and onion stuffing sweets taste surprisingly like a real Christmas meal. The sweets were developed with a leading UK confectionary company to truly capture the turkey flavour . The sage and onion stuffing sweet tastes remarkably like the real thing . The Christmas pudding flavour has hints of brandy butter, raisin and Christmas spices .

"On the front lines of the battle for Kobane, Kurdish female fighters have been playing a major role in helping defend the Syrian town from an onslaught by the Islamic State. Pervin Kobani, the 19-year-old daughter of a farmer, is one of them. She is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters, who have been trying to seize the town since mid-September. Three weeks ago, Pervin bumped into her father on a street corner. Scroll down for video . Fighting family: Pervin Kobane (right), who's fighting Isis in Kobane, hugs her father, who's doing the same . Determined: Pervin is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters . She was surprised to see him holding a gun. She didn't know that he too had decided to fight. Her mother is a refugee in Turkey, her only brother studying in Algeria. 'Honestly when I heard my father is fighting on the western front with the YPG I was so proud of him, and it made me want to fight more,' she said. Her father, Farouk Kobane, joined the town's defenders in mid-September, when IS, also known as Isis, launched their attack. He was delighted to see his daughter that day three weeks ago, after months without news. Last week, videojournalist Jake Simkin traveled with Pervin to the western front, to see her father once again. She says he is now her comrade first - but she hugs him like a father anyway. The Islamic State group has declared a self-styled caliphate in areas under its control in Iraq and Syria, governing it according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law. The Kurdish men and women fighting in Kobane are determined not to lose the town to the extremists. Devastation: Large parts of Kobane have been left in ruins by the fighting . The Kurds' defence of Kobane (pictured) has been aided by Coalition air strikes . Simkin's report, shot by  inside Kobane late last month, offered a rare, in-depth glimpse of the destruction that more than two months of fighting has inflicted on the Kurdish town in northern Syria by the Turkish border. It also illustrated what life is like for fighters like Pervin, who says she doesn't really have dreams beyond the present. 'We must save our love for Apo, and Kurdistan and our martyrs,' she said, referring to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, whose group has been fighting Turkey for Kurdish autonomy. Nearby, one of Pervin's comrades saw something moving amid the destroyed remains of central Kobane and opened fire. Pervin left home and took up arms two years ago as the overstretched forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad withdrew from Kurdish areas in northern Syria. She joined the Syrian Kurdish women's self-defense force, known by its Kurdish acronym YPJ. The female YPJ fighters are now integrated with the men's units, the YPG. 'I didn't really have any other ambitions. I just wanted to live a free life, as a woman, (to) be able to see our reality, and have our rights and just live,' she said. Aided by a small Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga force and Syrian rebels, they have been stubbornly defending the town since mid-September and have been aided by over 280 airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. After half a year serving away from her hometown, she returned with Kurdish forces two months ago to Kobane. Most fighting happens at night. The fighters can only sleep during the day, with a rotating two-hour sentry watch. 'We won't allow the terrorist groups in until the last drop of our blood,' Pervin said.","Pervin Kobani, 19, has been fighting Isis in Kobane for several weeks .

"Stretching into the distance under grey skies, the only signs of life on this deserted Spanish highway are the occasional lone cyclist or pack of stray dogs. The MP-203 in Madrid has remained unfinished for six years - despite initial investment of 70 million euro in the shelved project in recession-hit Spain. Weeds can be seen growing on the surface of the abandoned route today, as it emerged the Eurozone has slumped into its longest recession ever. Weeds: An unused toll plaza on the unfinished Spanish highway is seen today, as it emerged the Eurozone has slumped into its longest recession ever .

"Three Australian venues and two American hotels have rejected appearances by controversial pick-up artist Julien Blanc as a social media campaign to end his world tour gathers pace. Blanc, a 'dating coach' whose techniques include choking women and then hushing them, planned to hold seminars in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane over the first fortnight of November. But he is quickly finding himself without a place to host his events after outraged activists took to the phones and social media to #TakeDownJulienBlanc. Scroll down for video . '#ChokeOpen': One of Julien Blanc's techniques to seduce women involves grasping them in a chokehold . 1. Yelling 'Pikachu!' and placing their heads on his crotch . 'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want,' Blanc says, in a seminar recorded on video. 'I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls heads, just like, ""head, on d***"", ""head, on d***"", yelling ""Pikachu!"" with a Pikachu shirt.' 2. 'Deadly' jokes . A blog post on Blanc's 'Real Social Dynamics Nation' website appears to suggest using cruel jokes as a way of picking up women. The post is titled '""My Girlfriend Passed Away"" - The Twisted Humor That Inevitably Knifes Through To Her Panties. Explanatory YouTube videos placed in the article have been taken down. A Tinder exchange also published on Blanc's website shows a person, who is chatting up a woman on the dating app, suggesting that the person's father had died. 'I just buried my father today.. Who would lie about something like that,' the person writes. 3. The 'choke opener' Blanc is pictured choking women and hushing them in multiple Instagram posts. In one caption, written on October 10, he dubs this his 'choke opener', a means of starting a seductive conversation with women. 4. Use 'pull talk' In a video on the RSD Nation website, Blanc encourages his fans to use 'pull talk' - or, 'spewing bulls***' - while physically leading women to the 'sex location'. 'Your words? Spewing bulls***,' he explains. '(They are) wizard stories, pull talk!' 'It's very light hearted, it's very fun, it's kind of like: ""Oh yeah so when this, oh yeah and what about this. 'Just any f***ing thing you want to say and again, your actions are making it happen. ' 'Your actions are taking the responsibility off of her, they're leading, it's not permission seeking, and that is how you move closer to the sex location'. 5. 'Deconstruct her self-esteem' Another blog post provides tips about how to 'manipulate' a woman's self esteem. 'Click on this video right now that (sic) reveals how to deconstruct any girl's self-esteem,' the post says. But the clip has since been removed from YouTube. 'Diss fatties bang hotties': Julien Blanc's controversial techniques have been deemed 'sexist' and 'racist' Blanc has been pictured taking women into a chokehold at venues around the world . The Como Melbourne have ditched his Thursday seminar after the petition attracted more than 11,000 signatures . The Como Hotel Melbourne, St Kilda West Best Beach Bather's Pavilion and Brisbane's Mercure hotel have rejected seminars that were to be held by Blanc's company, Real Social Dynamics (RSD). Blanc calls himself the 'executive coach' at RSD, which he has said is an 'international leader in dating advice'. Blanc has not responded to requests for comment despite numerous interview requests from Daily Mail Australia via email, voice message and social media. Protesters are planning to hold a demonstration against Blanc in St Kilda on Thursday evening, with more than 700 people attending the event on Facebook. 'Julien Blanc is the sad act who thinks sexual harassment and assault = picking up,' the protest page reads. 'Australia has appalling levels of sexual assault and other violence against women, the last thing we need is someone coming to run workshops on how to do it better.' Blanc's forthcoming tour to the United States likewise appears in jeopardy. Touched down: Blanc wEarlier this year in June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami . The Courtyard Marriott in Seattle tweeted: 'This event will no longer be taking place in our hotel.' Staff at another venue, the Hilton Garden Hotel in Austin, Texas, wrote on Facebook: 'We will not be having this seminar in our hotel in support of the values we believe in'. In an interview with SBS's The Feed program last night, campaign organiser Jennifer Li, from Washington DC, said: 'I didn't know this was going to actually take off, I just knew I had to try in order to tell myself, ""you know, I did something""'. In a Change.org petition, initially addressed to Melbourne's Como Hotel, Ms Li labelled Blanc's pick-up techniques 'sexist' and 'racist'. 'Julien Blanc... has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse,' she wrote on the petition. Ms Li went on to say the hotel should not soil its good name by associating with 'a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game'. She asked the hotel to stand up for the women of Australia and around the world and not to host the event which would teach other men 'how to violate and harass women'. When the hotel announced its decision, it was bombarded with thanks on social media. Sian Mann thanked The Como Melbourne for making the move to scrap the seminar . 'Good for you... u may just have indirectly saved someone from horror ordeal,' BFavell wrote . The Como even won over some customers by making the decision to cancel the event . Mr Blanc said he started in the pick up game when he read the novel The Game written by Neil Strauss . It's understood the 25-year-old gave a talk in Sydney earlier this week and he is scheduled to head to Japan shortly. In June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami. On his website, Mr Blanc said his interest in picking up girls started when he read The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss. In the book, Strauss documents his time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'. 'I wasn't a popular kid, and it sucked. But it didn't ""really"" bother me, until one day I... found a link to The Game,' Mr Blanc wrote on his website, Pimp. 'I read a few pages of it and I was HOOKED. I had to try this whole ""walking up and talking to girls I’ve never met before and make them want to sleep with me"" thing out... I was so off at first.""'","Julien Blanc is a self-described American 'pick-up artist'

"One of the most important tools  an actor has is their face. From expressing grief and torture to joy and love the face is one of the most powerful ways to convey emotions. But in a video shot by Pedestrian TV, Australian actor Guy Pearce was asked to use his expressions a little differently, by recreating popular emoticons known as Emoji. Scroll down for video . In a new video released by Pedestrian TV Australian actor Guy Pearce recreated Emoji emoticons . The Hollywood actor nailed many of the hilarious expressions such as this sunglasses shot . While Pearce - who started his career in soap Neighbours - hits the nail on the head with some of the impressions, other attempts fall a little short. In a game called Emoji Me the 47-year-old was shown  the team's favourite symbols one-by-one which he then attempted to reenact. The first challenge is relatively simple, and as the Emoji 'face screaming in fear' pops up on the screen Pearce imitates the image perfectly. Others Pearce struggled with, like this smirking Emoji . The wink was one of the actor's best attempts at recreating the expressive emoticons . Next on the list is a classic winking face, which the Australian actor also recreates with ease. However Pearce struggled with the smirking emoticon, contorting his face before saying 'Oh it's actually going up isn't it ... I'm not sure what that one is.' The acclaimed actor then manages to pull an exceptional surprised face, before presenting arguably the most impressive of the lot. The acclaimed actor then manages to pull an exceptional surprised face . At the end of the video Pearce quips 'Do i get the job?' Closing one eye and sticking his tongue out in the style of Miley Cyrus, Pearce mimics the animated emoticon in spectacular fashion.

"A family were alarmed when what started as a normal morning drive became a frightening encounter with three enormous white rhinos. Mother-of-one Holly Powers, originally from Oregon, lives in Pretoria, in the Gauteng Province of South Africa with her husband and their 20-month-old son, Thomas. The incident occurred when the family went for a morning drive around the Rietvlei Nature Reserve just ten minutes from their home. Scroll down for video . One of the rhinos started to walk towards the family's car, but soon picked up its pace to running at full speed . Mr Powers warned his wife that rhinos have been known to occasionally attack cars in Kruger National Park . The third rhino to emerge started to charge the car carrying Mrs Powers' 20-month-old son Thomas in the back seat . Mrs Powers recalled: 'We have a 20-month-old little boy who wakes up at 5:30 am every day, so on this morning we decided to get up and take a drive. 'A short time after entering the reserve we encountered two white rhinos about a 100 metres down the road. 'They both slowly sauntered toward our car and got very close but were not aggressive in any way. 'While watching the two that were right near our car we noticed a third step out of the bushes, 100 metres away, where we had first seen the original two. Against the advice of her husband who told her to wind up her window, Mrs Powers kept it down to take photos of the charge . 'Fortunate': Mrs Powers said the experience was incredible and felt fortunate to be present to witness such a special event . 'This rhino headed in our direction starting out at a slow walk but then suddenly started to run toward us at full speed.' With adrenalin pumping and against the advice of her husband, who warned she should wind the window up, Mrs Summer managed to capture the third rhino as it hurtled full-pelt towards the family car. She continued: 'I was in awe of the first two rhinos that were so close to our car and when the third stepped out of the bushes I was shocked that there was a third. 'When it started to run at full speed my thoughts went to my camera that was already in my hand and ready to go. 'I couldn't believe how fast such a large creature could run - I caught almost its entire approach on my camera all while my head was out the window and my husband was yelling at me again and again to roll up the window.' Up close: Mother-of-one Holly Powers captured what it's like to be charged by a one-and-a-half tonne rhino . Soon after entering the reserve the family encountered two white rhinos about a 100 metres down the road . She added: 'My adrenaline was running and I was so excited that I was catching this whole thing with my camera that I really didn't think about the danger. 'My husband was stressed and knew we were at some risk because rhinos have been known to occasionally attack cars in Kruger National Park and other places around South Africa. 'I suppose as long as we were in the car we weren't at any real risk of physical injury, just damage to our car. In addition, these rhinos had been de-horned for anti-poaching purposes, so this inherently lowered the potential damage risk as well.' Thankfully there was nothing to worry about and despite charging towards them the rhino slowed as quick as it had started and joined its companions just feet from the car. It started as a normal family drive: Mrs Powers, left, and her twenty-month-old son Thomas, right . Footage taken by Holly's husband Christopher, 37, shows just how close the animals were. Holly said: 'All three hung out around our car for a while and then continued on down the road. 'We turned the car around and followed them for a bit. I'm glad that we did because just a little down the road we came to a small mud pit where we then witnessed each of them take turns rolling around in the mud. 'The whole experience was incredible and we couldn't believe how close we were the whole time. We felt fortunate to be the only people present to witness all of this.'","Holly Powers, 35, originally from Oregon, lives in Pretoria, South Africa .

"A stunning timelapse video has showcased the beauty of Tower Bridge by day and night including the impressive glass bottomed walkway. Chad Gordon Higgins, who is originally from the West Midlands but now lives in London, took 12,076 pictures in and around the capital's landmark, and then spent seven-and-a-half hours condensing these into 3,878 to make the video. The 37-year-old spent over 18 hours in London shooting the footage. Videographer Chad Gordon Higgins captured some spectacular scenes in his timelapse of London Bridge . Mr Higgins took 12,076 pictures in and around the capital's landmark and then condensed them into 3,878 to make the video . Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Higgins said: - 'I've filmed a couple of times in the underbelly of Tower Bridge for various programmes, but I've never actually been up to the walkways. 'The exposed ironwork, girders, suspension and the sheer amount of rivets put in to hold it altogether is mind-blowing considering it's 120 years old. 'During one of the shots I rested against one of the top suspension cables taking in the views and you could feel the feint vibrations of the traffic below, the cables that have resonated the crossing of probably, billions of people over years gone past and now with the addition of the glass floors, it's a great sight to behold. 'Everyone is on a journey somewhere.' Before the stampede: The inside the bridge before tourists from all over the world ascend on London's most famous bridge . The glass walkway, which opened last month, where tourists can pay £9 to walk through and view the hustle and bustle on the roads below . Impressive: Mr Higgins described Tower Bridge as structurally 'mind blowing, considering it is 120 years old' Tower Bridge last month unveiled its £1m glass walkway 140ft above River Thames, costing just £9 to visit. It has been designed to give tourists, sightseers and thrill-seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world, not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens. For the faint of heart or weak of knee, it may be reassuring to learn that each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb. The iconic Tower Bridge is a magnificent sight to behold, and even better when contrasted at various points throughout the day . The brand new glass walkway, which is designed to enthrall the general public, rather than instill fear . The view from the £1million glass walkway; each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is around three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb . Tower Bridge Exhibition executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people. Higgins added: 'Shooting timelapse for a living means that I get to spend a lot of time on rooftops for sunrise and sunsets for various TV companies. 'I've recently filmed from the Shard but the vintage view from Tower Bridge is certainly unique.' Higgins is doing a free talk about timelapse this Saturday (December 6) in Kings Cross, London and he will be attempting to create the biggest crowd-sourced timelapse of London.

"It may look like an iPhone 4 but this gadget is in fact a stun gun which has landed a 21-year-old man three years in prison. Marcel Cross was found with the concealed weapon after police were called following reports of a man with a stun gun in Bicester, Oxfordshire. Officers who attended the scene on January 6 discovered Cross with the gun and despite his claims to have purchased it as a novelty item, he was charged with possession of a firearm. This is the stun gun belonging to Marcel Cross, pictured beside a real iPhone 4. The only noticeable difference between the two is the buttons are slightly more prominent on the stun gun version . The real McCoy: The stun gun was made to look like this Apple iPhone 4 (filed photo) The disguised stun guns are sold cheaply on the internet, often under the pretense of self protection. PC Joe Stafford, of Banbury CID, said it had been 'cleverly disguised' to look like a mobile phone and said the prison sentence reflected how serious an offence carrying the disguised weapons were. 'The stun gun had been cleverly disguised as an iPhone 4 mobile phone. Marcel Cross was given a three year prison sentence for possession of the stun gun . There can only be one reason for disguising an item like this and that is to allow a person to carry it without detection. 'The . seriousness of this was reflected in the sentence passed at court. The . sentence should act as a deterrent to others who may consider possessing . a similar item. 'The . defendant claimed to have purchased the weapon from a local market as a . novelty item, but the judge stated that the defendant needed to . recognise the seriousness of the offence. Cross was jailed at . Oxford Crown Court on Monday for three years, for possession of a Section . 5 firearm. Cheap stun guns disguised as the ubiquitous iPhone are becoming steadily more common in the UK. Earlier this year a 14-year-old boy was found to be carrying one of the concealed stun guns and a confused police officer was zapped by it. The dangerous device was found when the schoolboy, who was not identified, was arrested alongside three other teenagers after a bus driver complained he was subjected to vile racist taunts. The guns are mostly manufactured in China and can be bought online for as little as £15, but can be deadly - they are capable of discharging blasts of up to 50,000 volts of electricity. Another variation now on the market includes a stun gun which doubles as an iPhone jacket - meaning it can be used to stun people, or charge your phone.","Marcel Cross found with stun gun 'cleverly disguised' as iPhone 4 .

"These neon waves lapping gently at the shore may look supernatural, but they are created by one of nature’s tinniest creatures. Millions of plankton glowed  to light up a beach on the tiny island of Mjorn in Sweden last Wednesday. Scientists believe the bioluminescent phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction. Scroll down for video . An eerie glow: Millions of plankton glowed to light up a beach on the tiny island of Mjorn in Sweden last Wednesday.Scientists believe the bioluminescent phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction . Organisms such as plankton, fireflies and anglerfish are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin, which reacts with oxygen to create light. Lukasz Warzecha, who lives in High Peak, Derbyshire, photographed the stunning sight while on a trip with to Sweden. ‘After a good half an hour of shooting in the area I was cold and ready to leave but Ulrika [a friend who appears in the photographs] decided to have a look for some bioluminescence,’ he said. Hands on: Organisms such as plankton, fireflies and anglerfish  are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin, which reacts with oxygen to create light. Here, Lukasz Warzecha puts his hands into the water to disturb the tiny creatures, causing them to give off light . A haunting spectacle: The amateur photographer from Derbyshire had never seen the natural phenomenon before and would have missed it if his friend Ulrika (pictured) hadn't thrown some small stones in the water, which came to life and glowed . Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton. The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light. Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction. Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways. Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat. Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators. ‘I'd never seen it before, but she threw some small stones close to the shore and the ocean came alive - I couldn't believe my eyes. ‘We went around the corner to an even smaller bay and as we were walking along the beach our feet were leaving shining footprints. ‘The concentration of plankton in that small area was so big it looked at times like the water was on fire and was certainly mirroring the sky.’ Dr Andy Davies, a marine biologist at Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, explained: ‘The light is created by small organisms called plankton, which are producing this light through a complex chemical reaction. ‘It's an example of how organisms have evolved complex responses to external stimulus.' He said that late spring and early summer are the best times to see the phenomenon, so it seems that Mr Warzecha was lucky to witness the eerie spectacle. Bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals, especially in the open sea and in insects. ‘Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater,’ he said. ‘However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light. ‘Sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas,' he said. Millions of plankton glowed to light up a beach on the tiny island of Mjorn in Sweden (marked on the map) last Wednesday .

"It seems phone batteries always die at the same moment you need to make an important call. But while shouting at your mobile in frustration might seem pointless, a new gadget could soon mean your screams won't be in vain. Researchers in London have created a new technology that uses sound, such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop, to charge up mobile phones. Scroll down for video . While shouting at your mobile in frustration might seem pointless, a new gadget could soon mean your screams won't be in vain. Researchers in London have created a new technology that uses sound, such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop, to charge up mobile phones . Their prototype device, which is about the size of a mobile phone, uses zinc oxide to convert vibrations caused by sound into electricity. The invention was inspired by previous research at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), which found playing pop and rock music improved the performance of solar cells. This was because the sound vibrations triggered the movement of material in the solar cell that caused it to improve efficiency by up to 40 per cent. Developing this research further, Nokia worked with the QMUL team to create an energy-harvesting prototype that could be used to charge a mobile phone using everyday background noise. Nokia worked with the QMUL team to create an energy-harvesting prototype that could be used to charge a mobile phone using everyday background noise. Pictured here is the zinc oxide used in the device . The team used the key properties of zinc oxide, a material that when squashed or stretched creates a voltage by converting energy from motion into electrical energy, in the form of nanorods. The nanorods can be coated onto various surfaces in different locations making the energy harvesting versatile. When this surface is squashed or stretched, the nanorods then generate a high voltage. The latest research was inspired by a study last year that found playing pop and rock music improves the performance of solar cells. Scientists at QMUL and Imperial College London found  sound vibrations triggered the movement of material in the solar cell causing it to improve efficiency by up to 40 per cent. This discovery could make it possible to power a wider range of devices with solar energy than at present, as scientists can improve the efficiency of solar cells using the ambient, or background, noise present in many environments. Practical uses for this discovery could include solar powered air conditioning units, laptop computers or electronic components on buses, trains and other vehicles. The nanorods respond to vibration and movement created by everyday sound, such as our voices. Electrical contacts on both sides of the rods are then used to harvest the voltage to charge a phone. In order to make it possible to produce these nanogenerators at scale, the scientists found innovative ways to cut costs in the production process. Firstly, they developed a process whereby they could spray on the nanorod chemicals - almost like nanorod graffiti - to cover a plastic sheet in a layer of zinc oxide. When put into a mixture of chemicals and heated to just 90°C, the nanorods grew all over the surface of the sheet. Secondly, gold is traditionally used as an electrical contact, but the team were able to produce a method of using cheap and cheerful aluminium foil instead. The final device is the same size as a Nokia Lumia 925 and generates five volts, which is enough to charge a phone. 'Being able to keep mobile devices working for longer, or do away with batteries completely by tapping into the stray energy that is all around us is an exciting concept,' said Dr Joe Briscoe from QMUL. 'We hope that we have brought this technology closer to viability.' The device is the same size as a Nokia Lumia 925 (pictured) and generates 5 volts - enough to charge a phone .

"Love them or hate them, emoticons are creeping into more and more apps, social networks and websites.

On 30 March 1881, four emoticons, described as typographical art, were published in American satirical magazine Puck.

They have been dubbed 'vertical emoticons' because they are viewed vertically, rather than horizontally. In the tongue-in-cheek article, Puck wrote: 'We mean to let the public see what we can lay out, in our own typographical line, all the cartoonists that ever walked. 'For fear of startling the public we will only give a small specimen of the artistic achievements within our grasp, by way of a first installment.' Computer scientist Scott Fahlman was the first documented person to use typed characters as a way of expressing emotion. In a message to the board at Carnegie Mellon University in 1982, Mr Fahlman suggested :-) and :-( should be used to distinguish between jokes and serious posts. But, there is some suggestion that emoticons were used much earlier, even before the 1881 issue of Puck. Reports claim Abraham Lincoln used a ‘winky face’ in a 1862 speech. The transcript records the audience's response to Mr Lincoln's  introduction as: 'applause and laughter ;).' But this is generally considered to be a typo. Similarly, a Robert Herrick poem from 1648 appears to feature a smiley face after the words ‘smiling yet’. In the second line of To Fortune, published in Hesperides, the poem reads: Tumble me down, and I will sit, Upon my ruins, (smiling yet:), Tear me to tatters, yet I'll be patient in my necessity.' This is also considered to be a typo, and its connection to the word 'smiling' is a coincidence. Below this text are four 'faces' drawn to show joy, melancholy, indifference and astonishment.

In addition to being used on mobiles, the pictographs have since been added to websites including Twitter and Facebook. But, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by this consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others.

"Criticism: Education Secretary Michael Gove said some families make the wrong decisions and get into financial trouble . Families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘decisions’, Michael Gove has claimed. The Education Secretary argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’. The remarks were condemned by Labour and ‘insulting and out of touch’. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities. Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help. Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet. Mr Gove was challenged over reports that one in four parents are having to borrow to pay for school uniforms and some food banks were distributing uniforms to struggling parents. He  said he had recently visited a food bank in his Surrey Health constituency. But he suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves. He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ Mr Gove was responding to a question from Labour frontbencher Luciana Berger who demanded to know ‘what more can he and his Government do to ensure that no students turn up to school embarrassed because they do not have the right clothes’. Demand: Charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks, including this one in Southwark run by Felicia Boshorin . Labour seized on the response with  Miss Berger saying she was ’appalled’ by Mr Gove’s comments. The Labour Liverpool MP said: ’People I have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks. ’I vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances. ’This Government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by.’ Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ’It is appalling to suggest the rise of food banks is due to poor financial management. Labour frontbencher Luciana Berger . ’It’s a smack in the face to families who are working hard but can’t make ends meet, leaving them with no other option but to turn to food banks to feed their families. ’These comments are completely misjudged.’ Chris Johnes, director of Oxfam's UK Poverty Programme, said: 'Thousands are now turning to food banks, but they do not so out of choice, they do so when they have nowhere else to turn. 'The staggering rise in the numbers of people using food banks is down to failings in the benefit system, too many low paid jobs and rising prices that are dragging huge numbers into poverty.' In May a report by Church Action On Poverty and Oxfam suggested up to half of those seeking help were doing so as a direct result of having benefit payments delayed, reduced or withdrawn. Other factors behind the increase on those using emergency help - the 'hidden hungry' - include rising food prices, unemployment and energy costs. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey told MPs that it was 'completely wrong to suggest that there is some sort of statistical link between the benefit reforms we're making and the provision of food banks'.","Education Secretary says families are 'unable to manage their finances'

"It is 72 days since Steven Gerrard looked to the future and took the emotional decision to end his 114-cap England career. He came to the conclusion that the time was right to make a clean break, having given his country 14 years’ loyal service, so he could maximise his prospects of being Liverpool’s dominant midfield influence for the next 'two, three or four' seasons. After making public his plans, the 72 hours that followed were difficult and raw for Gerrard. England’s performance at the World Cup had been scarring but the promise of helping Liverpool move forward provided ample solace. He wanted to give his boyhood club his undivided attention. Steven Gerrard's sole focus is on Liverpool, having retired from international football over the summer . England's disappointing performance at the World Cup will have been difficult for Gerrard to take . There were also reassuring words from Brendan Rodgers. ‘A lot has gone on over the summer,’ said Rodgers, during Liverpool’s tour of the United States. ‘I am very happy that Steven is going to commit to Liverpool and I am sure that (his contract) is something we will look at. I know he can continue to play beyond this season. ‘I have always said that. Now he doesn’t have international football, he will have that freshness. Listen, for his own mind, I am sure he will want it sorted out, absolutely. You never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contracts. It is something I am sure will get sorted.’ Speaking over the summer, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insisted Gerrard's contract would get sorted . Gerrard trains alongside Mario Balotelli on Tuesday ahead of Liverpool's Champions League clash with Basle . It was intimated in the same conversation that Gerrard signing a new deal was a formality but, two and a half months on, there is an element of uncertainty starting to swirl around. Discussions have yet to begin about extending the captain’s present deal, which expires next June. ‘It (the contract) is something we are looking at as a club and with him and how he feels,’ Rodgers said ahead of Wednesday night’s crucial Champions League showdown with Basle. ‘He is still in a real good physical condition. He’s 34 years old, never needs a day’s rest. ‘This is genuine superstar, a world class player who has performed consistently for so many years. This country has not produced too many of them. He will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end (and when that is we shall see). ‘When he still strikes a ball there are not many like him, both his passing and his shooting; I am certainly enjoying working with him and anyone who works closely with him should. Every football person will know the qualities and influence he still has.’ So here are the questions: What is the delay? Gerrard curls the ball over the Everton wall to give Liverpool the lead in last week's Merseyside derby . Gerrard gestures seemingly in response to recent criticism of his form being below its usual lofty standard . Why have Liverpool not removed from the equation the possibility that, on January 1, Gerrard would be allowed to start speaking to clubs abroad about moving when his deal expires? Never before has he been so close to being a free agent. There will, ultimately, come a point in the future when Gerrard is no longer the fulcrum of Liverpool’s team but that moment is not at as imminent as some of his critics have suggested during his side’s fragmented start to the campaign. Yes, there have been some games in which Gerrard has not reached the levels he would expect of himself but he, remember, is the reason Liverpool face Basle with three points rather than one, thanks to his coolly-dispatched last-gasp penalty against Ludogorets. When Gerrard was last in Liverpool with Basle, in November 2002, he was unceremoniously hauled off at half-time by Gerard Houllier and subjected to caustic criticism from his then manager, who implored that he did not waste his potential. Gerrard keeps his cool to slot home an injury-time penalty to give the Reds victory against Ludogorets . The last time Liverpool faced Basle, back in 2002, Gerrard was hauled off at half-time with the Reds 3-0 down . Gerrard, of course, emerged from the salutatory lesson to become the finest player in Liverpool’s history, a man whose fingerprints are all over the trophies they have won during this century. His influence will always be there – and it needs to be for some time longer. Rodgers has appreciated everything Gerrard has done for him since he arrived, from the moment he cut short a family holiday to welcome the new manager into his office at Melwood ('He told me he would give me 100 per cent. He lied. He’s given me 200 per cent') to driving last season’s title charge. The manager knows Gerrard’s importance, as do the supporters. The next move is in the hands of Liverpool’s hierarchy. Gerrard is an influential player for the Reds and has been an integral part of all the club's wins this century .","Steven Gerrard yet to be offered a new contract by Liverpool .

"Ray Rice called his sickening attack on his wife Janay 'one bad night' that 'just happened to be on video' as he spoke out in his first interview since being reinstated by the NFL. The former Ravens running back told the Today show on Tuesday how a counselor 'ripped him apart' and put him back together after he punched his then-girlfriend in Atlantic City in February. He claimed that while he and his wife have argued, he has never laid hands on her apart from that one incident. The couple do not believe Janay is a domestic violence victim. 'You know, domestic violence is a real issue in society,' Rice told host Matt Lauer. 'We could take our one bad night, it just happened to be on video, but we are truly sorry to the people that are really going through it. You know, it's a real problem.' Scroll down for videos . Apologetic: With his wife Janay at his side, Ray Rice said in an interview that aired on Tuesday that he made a terrible 'uncharacteristic' mistake when he knocked her out with a single punch in February . Fears: As the family spoke with Matt Lauer, Rice said he worries about the day his daughter Rayven, pictured, searches for his name online and finds out that he punched her mother in the face . He also admitted to making a 'horrendous mistake' for not publicly apologizing to his wife at a May press conference. Instead, in a move that only served to stoke the controversy, it was Janay who apologized for her 'part' in the attack. 'It wasn't truly coming from us,' he said, explaining that the Baltimore Ravens told them what to say. 'I was nervous... I made a horrendous mistake not apologizing to my wife.' He went on: 'My wife is an angel - she can do no wrong. I take full responsibility for what I did. I'm horribly sorry for everything I've put my family through.' Rice, 27, said he now lives in fear that one day their daughter Rayven, who is now two, will search for him on Google and find out what happened. 'We know what's going to come up,' he said. 'That's what I'm worried about fixing.' Rice, who is allowed to sign with any NFL team after winning his appeal last week, added that if he never played football again, he knows that his wife would be happier. 'I knew my wife before I had anything,' he said. 'We both know where we came from. And just to be honest with you, she's very independent. My wife can survive in this world without me. She could survive in this world in society without me. She could've done it on her own.' Shocking: Rice was suspended by the NFL for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . Mistakes: The couple appeared at a press conference in May (pictured) but Ray Rice did not publicly apologize to his wife Janay. Instead, she apologized for her part in the night - which caused public uproar . He went on: 'If I never play football again, I'll be honest with you, I would adapt into life and I would sacrifice more so she can have a better future.' Janay, who appeared beside him and her parents for the interview, added: 'I know he'll support me in anything I want to do.' Still, he is hopeful that an owner will welcome him to his team this season or next. 'I think that they would have to be willing to look deeper into who I am and realized that me and my wife had one bad night and I took full responsible for it,' he said. 'I accepted it... I took full responsibility. And the only thing I can hope for and wish for is a second chance.' The couple also agreed that 'when the time is right', they would speak out and try to help others who have been affected by domestic abuse. His interview, which aired on Tuesday, came a day after his wife Janay spoke out in a lengthy interview of her own. She revealed that she has still not seen the surveillance footage showing her husband knocking her out after a night of drinking in February. Painful: Janay Rice wipes away a tear on the Today show as she recounts how angry she was after a video emerged showing her now-husband Ray Rice knocking her out cold in an elevator in February . After the incident, she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. The pair reconciled and married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault. She also slammed the Ravens for failing to support her family in the aftermath and revealed that she only issued a public apology for her part in the incident after the team suggested it. Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games. But after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in. 'I can't say he's telling the truth,' Janey Rice told NBC's Today show about NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in footage due to air in the next couple of days . Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team after his indefinite suspension from the NFL was dropped on appeal by a U.S. District Judge on Friday. During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. Ray Rice told NBC that he has not himself been in touch with any teams and that he's leaving it up to his agent. He added that he is working on staying in shape. See below for video .

"The revelations undermine the Trussell Trust's claims last week about how many people are using food banks . Volunteers for a charity that blames welfare cuts for the soaring use of its food banks have admitted that fraudsters routinely ‘take advantage’ of the handouts. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest provider of food banks – which highlighted a ‘shocking’ rise in demand for emergency food packages last week – last night pledged to investigate after volunteers were filmed admitting that people could take free food without checks, and that many visitors were asylum-seekers. One worker at a bank run by the trust said that people regularly ‘bounce around’ locations to receive more vouchers than they are entitled to. A Mail on Sunday investigation has also found inadequate checks on who claims the vouchers, after a reporter obtained three days’ worth of food simply by telling staff at a Citizen’s Advice Bureau – without any proof – that he was unemployed. Undercover reporters posing as volunteers at food banks in London and Nottinghamshire also found: . According to the Trussell Trust’s statistics, more than 913,000 people received three days’ emergency food from its banks in 2013-14 compared with 347,000 in 2012-13. The charity, which runs more than 400 of Britain’s 1,000 food banks, acknowledged that a third of the food was given to repeat visitors, but insisted the rise was based on genuine need for emergency food. Individuals experiencing severe financial hardship are able to claim food vouchers but there are no clear criteria on who should be eligible. Once received, the vouchers can be exchanged for three days’ worth of food at an allotted centre. The Trussell Trust has a policy that an individual can claim no more than nine handouts in a year, but undercover reporters found this limit varied in different branches. One volunteer at Trussell Trust-run food bank in Waterloo, who had been helping the charity for more than a year, said that he regularly saw the same people claiming more food parcels than they were in entitled to. Lax system: Limits on how many food parcels people are allowed to claim vary across the UK . Volunteer filmed by MoS at Trussell Trust's London Waterloo food bank: 'People take advantage... they bounce around different locations to get the vouchers' Staff at Nottingham’s Citizens’ Advice Bureau handed out a food bank voucher to an undercover Mail on Sunday reporter entitling him to a generous three days’ worth of shopping –without even asking for any identification. Our reporter Ross Slater, pictured, arrived at the CAB office near the city’s railway station to enquire about food vouchers. After filling out a form giving  his name, address, date of birth, phone number and the reason for the visit, the reporter was told to wait for an assessor to interview him. The woman, called Katherine, who was in her 60s, asked our reporter a series of questions about why the food bank vouchers were needed. He explained he had been unemployed for a  few months and had been caught out by higher than expected winter fuel bills and was strapped for cash and food. He added that his wife had left her job and was not earning and that they had two children to care for. After asking for details of how much Jobseekers’ Allowance was received, the assessor’s questions turned to the dietary requirements of the reporter and his family. Katherine asked our man  to wait while she found out which food bank would be able to help him and then returned with an official voucher signed by the centre’s manager  Sarah Webber. From there the reporter  was sent to the Trussell  Trust-run food bank at St Philip’s Church in Bulwell, Nottingham, where he presented the voucher to  one of several helpers. Within minutes he was given with four shopping bags bursting with essentials – about £40 worth of groceries. These included basics such as bread, sugar and pasta, as well as less essential items such chocolate pudding. After inviting the reporter  to help himself to the soap, toothpaste and hot dog rolls they had spare, the volunteers wished him a Happy Easter and he staggered out of the church with his bags. He later returned the goods. Last night the Trussell Trust said any distributor found to be providing vouchers to people not in genuine need would receive extra training. WHAT OUR REPORTER WAS GIVEN . Our basket included: Warburton’s bread £1.45; apple juice £1; Fray Bentos steak & ale pie £2.49; Heinz tomato soup 89p; Loyd Grossman pasta sauce £1; Dolmio sauce £1.80; instant mashed potato 28p; creamed rice pudding 15p; long-life milk 56p; Irish stew £1.49; spaghetti rings 34p; sliced peaches in juice 35p; custard 17p; new potatoes in water 15p; plum tomatoes 34p; Silver Spoon sugar £1; tea bags £2; processed peas 21p; kidney beans 25p; tuna steaks £1.39; sardines 60p; spaghetti 16p; meatballs 45p; chocolate pudding 65p; strawberry jam 29p; bran flakes 88p; bread sauce 70p; risotto rice 99p; granola £3.75; baked beans 35p; sticky toffee pudding 65p. TOTAL: £38.35 . He said one woman who attended Friday’s session had visited at least nine times in just four months, receiving food each time. He added: ‘It’s got to the point where I recognised names because you see them so frequently.’ The volunteer also said he suspected that several people, possibly other family members, had been collecting vouchers under the woman’s name. The Trussell Trust, which was set up in 1997, oversees more than 400 of Britain’s estimated 1,000 food banks. It works with local churches to run many of them. The charity was set up by former Army serviceman Paddy Henderson  and his wife. A female volunteer showed a reporter a list of people who had claimed more than three food parcels, but she said that they would be unlikely to be refused items if they visited again. In another case, a man was given a food parcel after turning up without a  voucher – only a form the Jobcentre. He was handed the food despite a female volunteer earlier saying: ‘We’re not supposed to give it out.’ Nigel Baxter, lead organiser at Bestwood and Bulwell food bank in Deep Valley, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Sometimes you get professional people on £60,000 salaries dropping in. ‘They have just been made redundant and feel embarrassed to be here. They still have the trappings of a good job, like Sky TV and iPhones, which are under contract, but they can’t afford to eat.’ Another volunteer revealed: ‘Some people just hoover up everything and even complain that the product is a cheap one and not the brand they want.’ Senior Tory MP Brian Binley welcomed this paper’s investigation, saying he had ‘always been very suspicious’ of the level of abuse in some food banks. He said: ‘There are also a lot of dishonest people who will cadge their way into situations. ‘Food banks are run by very kind people. They do not understand that there are some people who will take advantage.’ Last night Tory MP Nigel Mills, a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: ‘If somebody is playing the system that’s clearly an abuse of what that charity is trying to do.’ Last night the Trussell Trust said it would investigate allegations of abuse, adding: ‘There is no evidence to suggest that awareness of the food banks is driving an increase in visitors, rather that food bank use is meeting a real and growing need.’ Additional reporting: Amanda Perthen and Tracy Kandohla .","Mail on Sunday undercover film exposes abuse of charity .

"Charges? Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said that his department is pursuing an investigation into whether or not to charge Louis Head for inciting the Ferguson riots . Michael Brown's step father Louis Head could face charges for inciting the mob violence that left parts of Ferguson a smouldering wreck this time last week, claims the city's police chief. According to Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson Police department is 'pursuing' an investigation into whether Brown was in part responsible for starting last weeks fiery riot by screaming 'Burn this motherf****r down! Burn this bi**h down!' on discovering the grand jury's decision. Speaking on Monday night's Fox News, Jackson was asked by host Sean Hannity whether he believed charges should be pressed against Head for his role in the disturbances that evening, posing the question, 'Is that inciting a riot?' In reply, Jackson said, 'We are pursuing those comments. And there is a lot of discussion going on about that right now. But I really can't get into that right now.' An indignant Hannity questioned Jackson about whether political pressure may make it expedient for any investigation against Head to be quietly dropped. 'Is there an atmosphere where maybe there is a group in law enforcement, maybe in the prosecutors office arguing, 'Oh we should just let it die?'. But, wouldn't that just encourage people to act the same way and feel they can get away with it?' said Hannity. In response, Jackson appeared unequivocal, saying, 'No, we can't let all that happened in the community die. Scroll Down for Video .

It was last Monday, after spending months appealing for calm that Michael Brown's family exploded into rage when it was announced that the grand jury had decided not to charge Officer Darren Wilson. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department. She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown.' 'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!' Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department after the grand jury decision . Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face. 'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!' 'They still don't care!' she screamed as she threw her arms in frustration. 'They never going to care!' She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.' He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. He did this at least ten times and called for a microphone at one point to spread his message to more people. At that, some of the crowd did become agitated toward the police. Wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I Am Mike Brown' while was expressing his rage toward the crowd and cameras, Head also had a beanie on that had a photograph of Michael Brown. As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters. Protestors in the parking lot of a burning auto parts store in Ferguson following the grand jury decision . Ferguson has been struggling to return to normal after Brown, an 18-year-old black man, was killed by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson police officer .

In mid-2003, he pleaded guilty to a felony count of narcotics trafficking and he was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released in 2008 after five years behind bars. The family released a statement immediately after the grand jury decision via their lawyers which read: 'We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.

"A father who battled cancer and later suffered a heart attack claims his life was saved by years of bodybuilding. David Prescott had tumours in his liver and intestine as well as suffering a massive heart attack. But rather than letting his body get the better of him, he used bodybuilding to save his life - by building back his strength using weights to get back to full health. David Prescott says after becoming a bodybuilder when he was young, he felt he was 'invincible' After battling tumours in his liver and intestine - and then a heart attack - the 50-year-old said: 'For me, bodybuilding has given me the fight, discipline, determination and the character to come out of that four year spell of major health issues wanting to be fit and healthy again' Mr Prescott, 50, said: 'Bodybuilding always gets a pretty raw deal and a lot of negative things follow the sport around. 'For me, it has given me the fight, discipline, determination and the character to come out of that four year spell of major health issues wanting to be fit and healthy again. 'Never be surprised with how much your body can soak up, and with a strong frame of mind what it can physically and mentally overcome.' After becoming a bodybuilder when he was young, Mr Prescott, from Standish, Lancashire, began to feel he was invincible. But in 2010, his life was turned upside down when he was diagnosed with liver cancer. 'The diagnosis initially floored me, it was like a steamroller crushing me,' he said. 'Yes I had various symptoms but I was just under 16 stone and felt quite literally invincible. 'My wife Trish and I sat in a side room, and the results were given. In the next 30 minutes I laughed, cried and felt like I had died.' Mr Prescott underwent a 10-hour operation which took away half of his liver. He left hospital with 57 staples holding his abdomen together and was 27lb lighter. Mr Prescott (pictured right, today) underwent a 10-hour operation which took away half of his liver. He left hospital with 57 staples holding his abdomen together and lost 27lb. He said: 'Never be surprised with how much your body can soak up, and with a strong frame of mind what it can physically and mentally overcome' Mr Prescott has inspired his 26-year-old son David Jnr (pictured) to follow in his footsteps.The young engineer competes as a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu . He said: 'Everything I had worked so hard to achieve had been taken off me. Mentally and emotionally I was battered. 'Virtually from the time I got home my recovery was being mapped out in my mind and it was the ultimate challenge. 'The first week, I could barely shuffle from my front gate to the nearest lamp post. The following week I persuaded Trish to take me to the gym. 'She didn't try to talk me out of it, she knew by hook or by crook I'd have got there anyway. 'The steps up to the gym were a challenge on their own. 'I picked up the weights and proceeded to curl them, my arms started to shake uncontrollably, I dropped the weight and struggled on. He said: 'Nobody knows my body better than me and that's the knowledge bodybuilding gave me. I just wanted my life back' 'This was the start of my recovery I now had something to build on. 'Day after day, week after week, I chipped away at it, getting fitter and stronger. I was in control again.' But just a year later Mr Prescott was left devastated once again after he suffered from a heart attack. He was told he would be on medication for life after having to have a stent fitted and he was advised to exercise less. He said: 'In some respects this affected me more mentally. To me, it sounded like my life as I knew it was finished. 'But after a few days I decided to return to the gym and see for myself and I started off very sensibly. 'However, after a few weeks I became fitter and stronger, I was confident in my ability and never felt afraid to push myself a little further. 'Nobody knows my body better than me and that's the knowledge bodybuilding gave me. I just wanted my life back.' He has also inspired his 26-year-old son David Jnr to follow in his footsteps. The young engineer competes as a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and has won the British Open twice alongside many other major competitions. Mr Prescott added: 'People say if their story could inspire one person they would be happy. I couldn't think of anybody better to inspire than my own son. 'He has that steely drive and determination and a positive outlook on life which he gained having to live through those tough uncertain years not knowing if his dad was going to pull through or fully recover.'","David Prescott, 50, began bodybuilding when he was a young man .
