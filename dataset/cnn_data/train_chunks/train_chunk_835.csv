"By . David Kent . One of the biggest surprises of the World Cup in Brazil was the Netherlands' thrashing of defending champions Spain in their Group B opener. If the Dutch are going to make the most of that result and make it far in the competition, however, midfielder Arjen Robben knows they must improve on Wednesday's effort when the Australians threaten to spring an upset against them. Robben and Co had to come from behind to beat the Socceroos 3-2 in Porto Alegre, an outcome that clinched a spot in the next phase of the tournament but one that also showed how precarious a team's balance can be. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arjen Robben score a wonder-goal for Bayern Munich . Hold: Arjen Robben says the Australia win was a wake-up call that they must up their game in the World Cup . Passion: Robben and Co came from behind to win 3-2 against Australia which secured them qualification . 'The first half, we just played really bad,' Robben told nieuws.nl. 'We were just sleeping. We made a lot of mistakes in possession. Actually, everything just went wrong, we weren't in the game.' The Oranje had looked sharp in their 5-1 demolition of Spain but struggled against a defiant Australia. 'We had a lack of focus and concentration,' Robben said. 'This should not happen during a match. 'We wanted the confidence that we got from the Spain game to take the win. We had to realise that this was a whole different game than against Spain. 'We had to start again, start again from 0-0.' Robben, voted Man of the Match by FIFA, hailed Australia's resilience. The striker put the Dutch ahead in the 20th minute but a stunning volley from Tim Cahill allowed Australia to equalise and then, after half-time, Mile Jedinak put Australia ahead from the penalty spot. Goals from Robin van Persie and Memphis Depay also handed the Dutch three points. 'We had to work very hard for the victory,' Robben said. 'The Australians fought hard as it was their last chance. Their equaliser affected us but we were able to react.' Striker: Robin van Persie helped the Dutch snatch three points from Australia in Group B . Goal: Robben said Australia's equaliser affected them but they 'were able to react' well . The Netherlands and Chile each have six points and will face each other in a battle for group supremacy in Sao Paulo on Monday. While the European team has already assured itself of a spot in the knockout round, Robben knows a good performance is needed against Chile, who won their game against Spain 2-0. 'We have take a big step forward,' Robben said. 'We have six points, which is the maximum we could have taken. Now we have one more group game and we want to play well.' Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal will be without Van Persie against Chile with the Oranje captain having picked up his second booking on Wednesday. Out: Van Persie will not be available for Holland's game against Chile after picking up a second booking . GROUP B TABLE . 1. Holland (PLD 2, GD 5, PTS 6) 2. Chile (PLD 2, GD 4, PTS 6) 3.

Australia vs Spain (5pm, Monday) Holland vs Chile (5pm, Monday) Australia coach Ange Postecoglou, meanwhile, says his team will leave the competition with their heads held high. Beaten 3-1 by Chile in their opener, the Aussies made things very interesting on Wednesday. 'I just wanted the players to get the reward for the way they went about things against the Dutch,' Postecoglou said to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I have put a lot of pressure on the players... to be a certain type of team, to take it to a world class opposition. We did it but we didn't get the reward. I am massively disappointed.' Postecoglou believes that Australia have a good future ahead of them. 'We came to this World Cup and we are playing against three of the best nations in the world,' he said. 'People were saying we were not going to score a goal, that we were just going to try to survive. 'We have only just started on this journey, the goal is that we come back in four years time and they fear us as much before we go on the pitch as much as they fear us on there now. 'I said all along that I was not going to discount this World Cup. We came here to make a mark, and we have had opportunities in both games to do so.' Postecoglou hailed 34-year-old striker Cahill, who played his last World Cup game against Holland and scored a wonder goal. Cahill picked up his second booking against and will miss Monday's game against Spain in Curitiba. 'Timmy was Timmy,' Postecoglou said. 'He was outstanding. I told him I wanted this to be his best World Cup. I said he was going to be a handful for any opposition. I am really delighted for him.'

"By . Sophie Goodchild . Thousands of patients are being denied the choice of life-saving heart drugs by cash-strapped NHS trusts. The UK drugs watchdog gave GPs the green light two years  ago to prescribe new-generation blood-thinners for people with irregular heartbeats at risk of suffering strokes. But doctors are defying recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), according to  a leading charity. The Atrial Fibrillation Association claims that the bodies that deliver NHS treatments are placing restrictions on use of new blood thinner drugs . The Atrial Fibrillation Association (AFA) claims that clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) – the bodies that deliver NHS treatments – are placing restrictions on use of these new drugs. Jo Jerrome, the charity’s deputy chief executive, said such limits were affecting the quality of life of patients. She claimed CCGs were driven by a fear that the drugs would be ‘overly expensive and stretch resources’, despite being deemed cost-effective by Nice. The new blood-thinners – known as novel oral anti-coagulants (NOACs) – cost about £2 a day compared with just £1 a month for warfarin, the most commonly used treatment. But patients on warfarin need regular monitoring which increases the cost of care. New drug: Novel oral anti-coagulants  cost about £2 a day for the NHS . ‘We have been told that CCGs are making it extremely difficult such as imposing a nine-month wait before patients are given  an alternative drug,’ said Ms Jerrome. ‘Patients have even said they’ve been told wrongly that the drugs haven’t been approved. ‘Trusts in some parts of London have made it difficult by making GPs sign long contracts if they’re going to prescribe these new drugs. This isn’t usual and it limits patient choice.’ One doctor, who asked not to be named, told The Mail on Sunday he had seen evidence of CCGs prohibiting the drugs, and the AFA claims to have reports of doctors being threatened with fines for prescribing them. On its website, NHS Vale of York CCG warns of ‘cost implications to the NHS’, stating: ‘Significant numbers of patients changing from warfarin to a NOAC would .  .  . lead to the need to limit commissioning of other services’. In Oxfordshire, the CCG says ‘warfarin remains the agent of choice for most patients’. It denied it was restricting the use of the new drugs, and said clinicians were using them ‘in line with published Nice guidelines’. More than a million patients in the UK suffer the most common heart rhythm disorder – known as atrial fibrillation – and the condition is blamed for causing  more than 20,000 strokes a year  in this country. The most commonly used therapy is warfarin, which is the  same chemical used in high doses to kill vermin. But patients who take this blood-thinner need regular blood tests to prevent them suffering complications. These checks reveal if their blood is clotting too much, which can trigger a stroke, or clotting too little, which increases the  risk of internal bleeding. Nice gave the go-ahead in 2012 for three new thinners – dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban  – that promised to revolutionise stroke-prevention. They are effective yet do not require the same monitoring. However, the UK lags behind the rest of Europe when it comes to prescribing them. Consultant cardiologist Martin Cowie, from Imperial College London, said doctors were failing patients by denying them choice and it should be ‘automatic’ that people received the new drugs. Tory MP Glyn Davies, who has undergone treatment for an irregular heartbeat himself, claimed take-up of new treatments had been absolutely ‘abysmal’. A Nice spokesman said: ‘CCGs are legally obliged to fund these new drugs in cases where they’re clinically appropriate.’","New blood-thinners could save lives, but patients are denied them .

"By . Nick Purewal . Kieran Read will return for the All Blacks after concussion trouble for Saturday’s third and final Test against England in Hamilton. Head coach Steve Hansen has thrown the fit-again number eight into the starting line-up, as New Zealand bid to complete a series whitewash against Stuart Lancaster’s side. Jerome Kaino moves to blindside flanker to accommodate Read - but keeps his place in the starting XV ahead of Liam Messam, who drops to the bench.

Malakai Fekitoa wins his first start for the All Blacks, with Conrad Smith ruled out after breaking a thumb in New Zealand’s 28-27 second Test victory last weekend. The All Blacks will look to equal the record 17 consecutive Test by seeing off England in Hamilton, so Hansen has duly selected from strength. Highlanders centre Fekitoa is already proving one of the Super Rugby starts of the season, the 22-year-old bolting through the All Blacks ranks in impressive fashion. Fit-again Read’s global renown was underlined by being crowned International Rugby Board player of the year in 2013. The 28-year-old was forced to sit out New Zealand’s first two Tests after suffering lingering concussion symptoms.

"By . Louise Cheer . An elderly woman has died in a car accident after attending a funeral service for a cousin in Sydney's north. The male driver of the car, 80, was taken to Westmead Hospital with injuries after the vehicle apparently drove out of control - first running into a building and then into a palm tree. Janine Marra - another member of the family, who was the first on the accident scene - has told MailOnline how she and the funeral's director desperately tried to help the mother-of-four, 79, and the driver. The married couple had just attended a funeral in Ryde. The woman, 79, died at the scene but the man, 80, was transported to Westmead Hospital . The couple were travelling down Quarry Road in Ryde when they collided with a building and ricocheted into a tree . The occupants of the car - who Ms Marra confirmed were married but declined to name them - were leaving a funeral service at Fields of Mars Cemetery in Ryde when the tragic accident happened. Police say no other vehicle was involved in the incident. Ms Marra said she was about to leave the service on Friday when she and funeral director Michael Manning saw the couple's Nissan Pulsar moving back and forth erratically. 'A few moments more and [Michael] would have pulled the keys out. There was nothing he could do and we jumped in a car to follow them but by the time we got there they had hit the palm tree. I hoped that she died on impact because then she wouldn’t have suffered' She told Mr Manning to go investigate what was happening and when the car didn't stop he reached in to take out the keys, but before he could the car took off at a high speed down Quarry Road. She said: 'A few moments more and [Michael] would have pulled the keys out. 'There was nothing he could do and we jumped in a car to follow them but by the time we got there they had hit the palm tree. 'I hoped that she died on impact because then she wouldn’t have suffered.' Ms Marra said there was hardly anyone else around to help, except for some grave diggers and a few family members, before emergency services arrived. She then had the difficult task of breaking the news to the woman's children, who did not attend the funeral. Friday's incident happened at the Fields of Mars Cemetery at 12.45pm . Fire and Rescue NSW tweeted crews had to cut the driver out of the Nissan Pulsar . She said she rang one of the sons, adding: 'He had to ring two brothers and a sister to break the news to them.' A New South Wales police spokeswoman said the Nissan Pulsar clipped a building before it hit a tree while travelling down Quarry Rd at 12.45pm on Friday. 'It’s left the roadway and ricocheted into the tree,' she said. The spokeswoman added the woman had died at the scene. Crews from Fire and Rescue NSW had to cut the driver out of the vehicle. It was reported by the ABC that the accelerator of the car became stuck and prompted the car to crash. But Field of Mars cemetery chief executive Pauline Tritton said it was not known if this was the case or if the driver had a foot on the accelerator. Police continue investigations into the incident and a report will be prepared for the coroner.

"India was on Thursday grappling with the task of establishing contact with those responsible for the abduction of 40 Indian construction workers in the war-torn Iraqi city of Mosul, which has become the first foreign policy challenge of the new NDA government. The Iraq government has traced the location of the kidnapped men, who mostly belong to Punjab and other parts of northern India, but there was little clarity on who was holding them. In an indirect expression of concern about the well-being of the men, the External Affairs Ministry spokesperson said there was ""no safety in captivity"". A crisis management group formed by the Foreign Ministry met twice on Thursday - with both meetings personally chaired by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj - to take stock of the options and to assess the safety and security of all the Indians in Iraq. As more details emerged from Iraq, it became apparent that the Indian workers, employed by the Baghdad-based Tariq Noor Al-Huda Construction Company, were abducted on Sunday. This was a full three days before the government confirmed the kidnappings. Sources said the men were captured while they were apparently being moved out of the second largest city of Mosul, overrun by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) last week. The families of several kidnapped men from Punjab have also said that their last contact with them was on Sunday. Though media reports claimed the abducted men were safe and would even be handed over to any representative of the Indian government, the Foreign Ministry said the Iraqi government had confirmed they were in custody. In flight: People from Iraqi Shiite Turkmen families who have fled the violence in the Iraqi city of Tal Afar, at Shangal, a town in Nineveh province . The initial information, based on inputs from the Red Crescent, about the kidnappings had been ""reconfirmed by the Iraq government"", Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said. The CRISIS management group, formed by the External Affairs Ministry to oversee efforts to rescue the 40 Indians abducted in Iraq and to arrange the evacuation of other Indians, is headed by Secretary (East) Anil Wadhwa. It was formed on Tuesday after reports emerged that nearly 90 Indians were stranded in Iraq. On Thursday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj personally chaired two meetings of the group. The other members of the crisis management group are Joint Secretary (Gulf) Mridul Kumar, Joint Secretary (WANA) Sandeep Kumar and Joint Secretary (Americas) Vikram Doraiswami. Asked if the Indians were safe, he said: ""There is no safety in captivity. Safety is when people are in places where they are welcome."" He added: ""We have been informed by Iraq's Foreign Ministry that they have been able to determine the location where these abducted Indian nationals are being held captive with workers of a few other nationalities."" Though he did not give details, sources said the other detained persons included Turkish and Bangladeshi nationals. He refused to provide details of the location where the Indians are being held ""or what the Iraqis have shared with us in terms of possibilities"". Suresh Reddy, India's former envoy to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad on Thursday to reinforce efforts to secure the release of the kidnapped men and to facilitate the evacuation of Indian nationals. Reddy, believed to have key contacts in the government and local tribal leaders, participated in several meetings during the day. Saleh Dabbakeh, spokesperson of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Iraq, told Mail Today that there was little information about the Indians in Mosul. He said the 46 nurses from Kerala stranded at a teaching hospital in Tikrit were ""fine"". The parties to the conflict included the ISIS, other armed groups and tribal leaders, he said. There are an estimated 10,000 Indians living across Iraq, but the External Affairs Ministry says only a little over 100 are in areas affected by violence, including the 40 kidnapped men. Iraqi soldiers and helicopter gunships battled Sunni militants for a third day on Thursday for control of Iraq's largest oil refinery, the loss of which would be a devastating symbol of the Baghdad government's powerlessness in the face of a determined insurgency hostile to the West. The two sides held different parts of the Baiji facility, which extends over several square kilometres of desert. The facility, which was shut down, normally produces about 300,000 barrels per day, strictly for domestic consumption. The militants, led by the al-Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), clearly hope to get millions of dollars in revenue from operating the refinery. Terrorists: An image taken from a video uploaded to a militant social media account, showing militants raise their weapons as they arrive at the country's largest oil refinery in Baiji, 250 kilometers north of the capital, Baghdad . More broadly, however, capturing the facility could weaken Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's hold on power by calling into question his ability to stop the militants' advance anywhere in Iraq. In the strongest sign yet of US doubts about Iraq's stability, the Obama administration is weighing whether to press the Shiite PM to step down in a last-ditch effort to prevent disgruntled Sunnis from igniting a full-scale civil war. President Barack Obama on Thursday said the US is prepared to take targeted military actions in Iraq if they would help fight a growing threat from extremist militants. He also said the US is ready to send as many as 300 military advisers to Iraq. A witness who drove past the Baiji facility, some 250km north of Baghdad, said the militants manned checkpoints around it and hung their black banners on watchtowers. One of the militants laying siege to the refinery confirmed over phone that the facility remained in government hands, saying that helicopter gunships slowed the insurgents' advance.","40 Indian construction workers remain in captivity in war-torn Iraqi city of Mosul .

"By . Freya Noble . and Daniel Mills . Haunting footage has been released of the moment a Gold Coast home become a sickening crime scene with animal blood scrawled on a garage door and a car set alight during the early hours of Tuesday morning. The grainy security footage, filmed from a fixed CCTV camera across the street, is the best hope police have of identifying those responsible for the early morning attack on the Hazel Court home at Arundel. Despite it's poor quality and a lack of light, the video manages to show at least two people loitering at the front of a garage door presumably scribbling the message:  'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!' in cat's blood. The silhouetted figures make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are in the footage but police have confirmed it is more than one. Scroll down for video . In the rear of the image, at least two people can be spotted loitering in front of the garage door where it is presumed a message is being scrawled in cat's blood. The silhouettes are lit up by the flame which is later used to throw into the car parked right to the right of the screen . A burst of bright light fills the screen the moment the flame is thrown at the car . The culprits can then be seen moving towards the car holding a flame fueled by an accelerant, before throwing it inside. The car is quickly engulfed in flames before the footage ends with it still burning. A Queensland police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the pivotal moments of the film are at 2.17am and 2.19am in real time where the footage starts and car is set alight. 'At 2.17am you can clearly see people in front of the double garage door, and to the right you can see the small black square which is the car later set set alight.' Detectives have described the grisly slaughter of the cat, and the message which it was used to write, as 'abhorrent.' The RSPCA has offered its own $5000 reward to anyone that offers up information that leads to an arrest. A 19-year-old man was taken into police custody on Tuesday but released without charge. A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of this morning while their car was set on fire . Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told MailOnline the incident appears likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants. 'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically,' he said. The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', though the animal did not belong to residents at the home, Senior Sergeant Lithgow said. 'Police are continuing to investigate and the occupants are cooperating.' RSPCA Queensland CEO Mark Townend confirmed that no missing animal report had been filed but investigations in to the owner of the animal were ongoing. 'At the moment there is no lost report for a cat of that description.' 'It is microchipped but the data unfortunately is linked to a few owners back.' Rhonda Gibson, who lives a few doors down from the targeted house on Hazel Court in Arundel, said the Gold Coast suburb is usually very quiet as most of the residents are either retired or young families. 'It's a really quiet area and there's lots of retired people in the area.' 'Nothing much ever really happens here.' When news  that a cat had been mutilated a few houses down reached the Gibsons, as cat owners they were very upset. Residents were seen cleaning the horrific graffiti off their wall alongside their burnt car . 'Of course that makes you feel ill, but thankfully it wasn't our cat,' Mrs Gibson said. She also said residents in the house next-door to the targeted home told her they felt the force of the fiery car when the explosion rattled their windows and shook their home. There had been no previous trouble in the street, and the residents of the house involved were not known to Mrs Gibson or her husband. Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion around 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle. The cat's head was left at the front door of the house. People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning. Detective acting Inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message. However, he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links. 'We're interviewing the occupants and looking for motives of any persons of interest that might be involved,' he told said. Police were called to the Arundel address after reports of an explosion . Insp Aubort said given the nature of the incident, police were eager to catch the culprits as soon as possible. 'It's an abhorrent attack on an animal,' he said. 'I think any case where you have the intentional killing or maiming of an animal is a disgusting act and we'll certainly be looking to prosecute those responsible to full extent of the law.' RSPCA Queensland has offered a $5000 reward to help catch those responsible for the incident. 'They cannot get away with this,' CEO Mark Townend said. 'This is one of the worst acts of animal cruelty that the RSPCA has seen.' Mr Townend said he feared the offender would strike again. 'It's a stepping stone to violence against people,' he said. Investigations are ongoing and anyone with information have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","CCTV shows at least two people loitering outside garage of Arundel home at 2.17am Tuesday .

The Sydney teenager who had his head speared by a metal bar by an angry gatecrasher, has said that no punishment his attacker could receive can compare to his own life sentence. Liam Knight, 18, underwent five hours of life-saving surgery and is still undergoing rehabilitation after a gatecrasher threw a three-metre long metal bar at him at a friend's party in January last year. In a victim-impact statement read by his brother Shane at his attacker's sentence hearing, Liam told Sydney's District Court that the night has 'left my life in tatters'. 'I had to re-learn how to speak ... it's distressing not to be physically strong and able,' his brother read out on Friday. Liam, who now uses a walking aid, said he now feels self-conscious. 'I feel that people are looking down on me. 'People no longer see me as Liam but as a person who need help.' He is now unsure of his future in terms of career, being able to live alone and having relationships because of his attacker, who is known only as DS. 'DS has changed my whole life for the simple fact that he couldn't get into a party.' Scroll down for video . Liam Knight (centre) arrives with his family at the District Court on Friday, June 20 . The 18-year-old revealed in a victim-impact statement read out by his brother (right) at his attackers sentencing, that his 'life is in tatters' after the traumatic ordeal . The statement revealed that Liam had to learn to speak again and must now use a walking aide after the attack . No punishment for DS could 'compete with the life sentence that I have been given,' he said. Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating Harry Staples' 18th birthday in Forestville in Sydney's north on January 11, 2013. The then 17-year-old DS, arrived at the 18th birthday party at about 11pm before being told to leave because he wasn't invited, the court was previously told. He then scaled the home's six-metre fence and climbed onto the roof of a shed. Angry and intoxicated, he began throwing building materials at partygoers. A three-metre 'rebar' pierced Liam's skull and became lodged in his head, causing permanent brain damage. Liam was sedated by paramedics and firefighters were called in to cut the steel rod, before he was rushed to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital. Sydney's District Court also heard from Philip Staples, the father in charge of the 18th birthday party that was the scene of the horrific crime. The statement said Liam (right) is now unsure of his future in terms of career, being able to live alone and having relationships because of his attacker . The three-metre long pole speared through Liam's skull, requiring him to undergo five hours of surgery to have it removed . Mr Staples told the court he had a 'deep sense of sadness and failure' at being unable to protect his son's friend Liam from his lifelong injuries. After hearing this, DS took the stand and cried as he said, 'no words can describe how sorry I am'. 'I had no right to act the way I did,' the teen said. The court heard DS had been on bail at the time of the attack on Liam, and the teen described his behaviour between 2012 and 2013 as 'out of control'. 'I did have an anger problem ... I did have a drinking problem.' When he was first taken into custody over the offence, DS conceded he only thought about himself. 'Now I know it is nothing in comparison to what people that night had to go through, especially Liam Knight.' DS then told Mr Staples: It's not your fault what happened to Liam Knight, it's my fault.' One of the steel poles allegedly thrown by the gatecrashers at the party, similar to the one that speared Liam in the head . Outside court Liam said he believed DS was remorseful and accepted his apology, but was still angry with him. 'I just hope him and a lot of other people, they use me as an example that the violence today is just ridiculous, and people should think about what they do before they do it,' he told reporters. Acting Judge Ronald Solomon said it was likely that DS would face a 'substantial sentence' when the matter returns to court in August. The teen pleaded guilty to several assaults and was found guilty following a trial earlier this year of one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Liam. Jimmy Angelo Tupou,19, was cleared of any involvement and found not guilty of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company earlier this year.

"By . Sean Poulter . They are favourite at weddings and dinner parties, but putting chicken liver parfait or pate on the menu carries an increased risk of food poisoning, experts warned today. Many famous chefs make a point of cooking the livers used in these dishes so they remain pink in the middle - but this does not kill off bugs. Public Health England (PHE) has now issued an official food poisoning alert linking chicken livers to campylobacter, the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. Danger: Health experts have warned that most large outbreaks of campylobacter - the most common form of food poisoning in the UK - are from chicken liver dishes such as pate and terrine . There are some 60,000 officially recorded cases of campylobacter poisoning each year, but the true number of victims is thought to be more than 600,000 because only a tiny fraction of people go to their doctor. Most people recover from the symptoms - which include diarrhoea, stomach pains and fever - in a few days, but there can be complications, including paralysis and even death. The government watchdog said 80 per cent of campylobacter cases linked to large food poisoning outbreaks, as opposed to individual cases, appear to involve to chicken liver dishes. Chicken liver pate recipes from chefs such as Jamie Oliver  suggest frying the livers and leaving them a little pink in the middle, while recipe suggestions from supermarkets like Tesco follow the same line. However a PHE spokesman said: ‘Chicken liver parfait/pate dishes have increased in popularity over the last few years and many chefs recommend leaving the centre of the livers pink which does not kill the bacteria. ‘Our records show that the number of people linked to outbreaks where chicken livers were implicated has risen from eight people in 2000 to 210 in 2013.’ The problem stems from the fact that a very high proportion of chicken sold in the UK is contaminated with campylobacter, despite a 10 year programme by the Food Standards Agency and farmers to try and tackle the problem. Research suggests that two in three chickens sold in supermarkets and butchers is contaminated with campylobacter, with the figure rising to three in four of the chicken reared on British farms. Generally, the bug is found on the skin of the bird and is killed during the cooking process, however it can be found inside chicken liver. Trend: Chicken liver pate recipes from chefs such as Jamie Oliver (pictured) suggest frying the livers and leaving them a little pink in the middle - but this does not kill campylobacter . Consequently, if they are not cooked for long enough at a high enough temperature before being turned into pate, the bug will survive. PHE said many of the outbreaks in recent years have been traced to wedding receptions at hotels, banqueting venues or pubs. Others were associated with catering at other functions such as hotels, clubs and restaurants. Last year, a Surrey hotel was ordered to pay £72,000 in fines and costs after 46 guests at a wedding reception fell ill after eating an undercooked chicken liver parfait. And two years ago, a five-star Hampshire hotel was fined more than £35,000 after guests fell ill from eating a chicken liver parfait served at a Christmas party. The Food Standards Agency has launched Food Safety Week and is highlighting the dangers of chicken and campylobacter. As part of this, it has also warned families against washing raw chickens because this carries the risk of spreading any contamination to other surfaces. Dr Bob Adak, head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at PHE, said: ‘We welcome this campaign by the Food Standards Agency as it is raising awareness of a very common illness. There are more gastrointestinal infections caused by campylobacter than any other bacteria. ‘Out of a number of possible risk factors, the greatest by far is eating or handling poultry meat which is why we are urging people during Food Safety Week to pay attention to how they store and handle chicken and other poultry meat at home. 'Hand and kitchen hygiene are key here and if you have handled raw meat or used a chopping board, you need to wash these thoroughly using soap and hot water.’ An FSA spokesman said: ‘Campylobacter is a serious issue. Not only can it cause severe illness and death, but it costs the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year as a result of sickness absence and the burden on the NHS.’","Official warning issued linking  chicken livers to campylobacter bacteria .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A powerful new model to detect life on planets outside of our solar system (artist's impression pictured) has been developed by researchers . A powerful new model to detect life on planets outside our solar system has been developed by British-Australian researchers. The new model focuses on methane, the simplest organic molecule on Earth, widely acknowledged to be a sign of potential life. At least 90 per cent of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is created by living organisms. As a result, many researchers regard methane on other planets as a possible indicator of life. Researchers from University College London and the University of New South Wales in Sydney have now developed a new spectrum for 'hot' methane which can be used to detect the molecule at temperatures above that of Earth. They estimate that they can now detect methane at temperatures of up to 1,500K/1220°C - something which was not possible before. To find out what remote planets orbiting other stars are made of, astronomers analyse the way in which their atmospheres absorb starlight of different colours and compare it to a model, or 'spectrum', to identify different molecules. Professor Jonathan Tennyson, co-author of the study said: ‘Current models of methane are incomplete, leading to a severe underestimation of methane levels on planets. 'We anticipate our new model will have a big impact on the future study of planets and ""cool"" stars external to our solar system, potentially helping scientists identify signs of extraterrestrial life.’ The study, published today in PNAS, describes how the researchers used some of the UK's most advanced supercomputers, provided by the Distributed Research utilising Advanced Computing  project, to calculate nearly 10 billion spectroscopic lines. Each line has a distinct colour at which methane can absorb light, meaning it can give much more accurate information about methane at a broader range of temperatures. Methane (molecules pictured) is an organic molecule present in gaseous form in the Earth's atmosphere. It widely acknowledged as being a sign of potential life, as on Earth it is produced as a byproduct of many living organisms . Methane (CH4) is an organic molecule present in gaseous form in the Earth's atmosphere. It widely acknowledged as being a sign of potential life, as on Earth it is produced as a byproduct of many living organisms. At least 90 per cent of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is created by living organisms. However, the presence of methane itself doesn't necessarily indicate alien life. If a planet's air does contain methane, it could come from living organisms, extinct organisms, or geological processes within the planet itself. Another possibility is that it could have  been carried to the planet from elsewhere in space. The new list of lines is 2,000 times bigger than any previous study, which means it can give more accurate information across a broader range of temperatures than was previously possible. Lead author of the study, Dr Sergei Yurchenko, added: ‘The comprehensive spectrum we have created has only been possible with the astonishing power of modern supercomputers which are needed for the billions of lines required for the modelling. 'We limited the temperature threshold to 1,500K to fit the capacity available, so more research could be done to expand the model to higher temperatures still. 'Our calculations required about 3 million CPU (central processing unit) hours alone; processing power only accessible to us through the DiRAC project. ‘We are thrilled to have used this technology to significantly advance beyond previous models available for researchers studying potential life on astronomical objects, and we are eager to see what our new spectrum helps them discover.’ he added. The new model has been tested and verified by successfully reproducing in detail the way in which the methane in failed stars, called brown dwarfs, absorbs light.","90% of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is created by living organisms .

The deal will allow BlackBerry to add a vast array of consumer-focused apps to its devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity applications. However, many believe the move could be a last roll of the dice for BlackBerry after its devices suffered poor sales. could Amazon save Blackberry? BlackBerry is set to offer 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with Amazon, it was revealed today . The Fire handset was unveiled by Jeff Bezos at a special event in Seattle. 'It's time to whip the crown from Apple,' said Mr Bezos before showing off the new handset for the first time. The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'. BlackBerry customers using devices powered by its 10 operating system will be able to access popular Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and Minecraft. The apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from this fall, when the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the statement said. The move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as it attempts to reinvent itself under new Chief Executive John Chen as BlackBerry phones have lost ground to Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices. Chen wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine communications. The company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automobile industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars. The announcement came on the same day Amazon launched fire, its $199 handset that will go on sale next month . BlackBerry already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients including corporations and government agencies to manage and secure mobile devices on their internal networks. Chen intends to build on those ties and BlackBerry's touted security credentials to allow these enterprise clients to build and customize in-house corporate and productivity applications for their employees. 'Making the Amazon Appstore available on BlackBerry 10 devices will help BlackBerry continue to meet two essential needs: greater app availability for our smartphone users and enhanced productivity solutions for enterprises,' Chen said in the statement.","Will bring key apps to Blackberry handsets for the first time .

The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. For a man regarded as one of the world’s leading innovators, his comments provide a sobering warning of the dangers that AI could pose to humanity. Tesla-founder, Elon Musk, (pictured) believes a horrific 'Terminator-like' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried that he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand . In March, Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher. Vicarious’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘computer that thinks like a person… except it doesn’t have to eat or sleep’, according to the company's co-founder Scott Phoenix. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Musk said: ‘I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.’ ‘There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator,’ Musk continued. ‘There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.’ In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Musk said: 'I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there. There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator'. Pictured is a scene from Terminator 2 . Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The . search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with . Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help . computers think like humans. One . of its founders warned artificial intelligence is  'number 1 risk for . this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, . I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex. The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is around 3mm thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions. These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans. According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. ‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. ‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’ In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human. Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example. In March, Elon Musk made an investment in San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (right) and actor Ashton Kutcher (left) As well as Vicarious, Musk was early investor in AI firm DeepMind, which was earlier this year acquired by Google for £400m ($678m). Elon Musk’s comments echo that of Professor Stephen Hawking who last month warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment.

"By . Mark Prigg . The hot question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold blooded like reptiles, fish and amphibians finally has a good answer. Dinosaurs, for eons Earth's dominant land animals until being wiped out by an asteroid 65 million years ago, were in fact somewhere in between. Scientists evaluated the metabolism of numerous dinosaurs using a formula based on their body mass as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones and their growth rates as shown by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees. Researchers say dinosaurs had growth and metabolic rates that were actually not characteristic of warm-blooded or even cold-blooded organisms, but somewhere inbetween - and this helped them grow large. The researchers called creatures with this medium-powered metabolism mesotherms, as contrasted to ectotherms (cold–blooded animals with low metabolic rates that do not produce much heat and bask in the sun to warm up) and endotherms (warm–blooded animals that use heat from metabolic reactions to maintain a high, stable body temperature). Grady said an intermediate metabolism may have allowed dinosaurs to get much bigger than any mammal ever could. Warm–blooded animals need to eat a lot so they are frequently hunting or munching on plants. The study, published in the journal Science, assessed 21 species of dinosaurs including super predators Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, long-necked Apatosaurus, duckbilled Tenontosaurus and bird-like Troodon as well as a range of mammals, birds, bony fish, sharks, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. 'Our results showed that dinosaurs had growth and metabolic rates that were actually not characteristic of warm-blooded or even cold-blooded organisms,' said University of Arizona evolutionary biologist and ecologist Brian Enquist. 'They did not act like mammals or birds nor did they act like reptiles or fish. 'Instead, they had growth rates and metabolisms intermediate to warm-blooded and cold-blooded organisms of today. In short, they had physiologies that are not common in today's world.' There has been a long-standing debate about whether dinosaurs were slow, lumbering cold-blooded animals - as scientists first proposed in the 19th century - or had a uniquely advanced, more warm-blooded physiology. As scientists unearthed remains of more and more fast-looking dinosaurs like Velociraptor, some championed the idea dinosaurs were as active and warm–blooded as mammals and birds. The realization that birds arose from small feathered dinosaurs seemed to support that view. Modern animals such as this leatherback turtle have a similar 'inbetween' metabolism . University of New Mexico biologist John Grady said the idea that creatures must be either warm-blooded or cold-blooded is too simplistic when looking over the vast expanse of time. Like dinosaurs, some animals alive today like the great white shark, leatherback sea turtle and tuna do not fit easily into either category, Grady added. 'A better answer would be 'in the middle.' By examining animal growth and rates of energy use, we were able to reconstruct a metabolic continuum, and place dinosaurs along that continuum. Somewhat surprisingly, dinosaurs fell right in the middle,' Grady said. Grady said an intermediate metabolism may have allowed dinosaurs to get much bigger than any mammal ever could. Warm–blooded animals need to eat a lot so they are frequently hunting or munching on plants. 'It is doubtful that a lion the size of T. rex could eat enough to survive,' Grady said.","Researchers say finding explains how T-Rex got so big .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Today 230 Ford Australia employees will work their last shifts at the car manufacturer's Geelong and Broadmeadows factories. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union confirmed exact numbers on Friday as Ford prepares to wind down its factory operations in Australia, planning an exit by 2016. But it came as no surprise to the union with representatives telling MailOnline last week the cuts would be made at the Victorian factories. Scroll down for video . On Friday, 230 employees will clock off for the last time at Ford's Victorian factories . AMWU national vehicles division secretary Dave Smith told AAP it was a 'tragic milestone' in the shuttering of Australia's automotive industry. 'Despite reducing the impact of its decision to lower vehicle production through a voluntary redundancy program and redeployment to other non-manufacturing areas, 230 workers are being shown the door against their will,' Mr Smith said. 'While the 230 Ford workers will be clocking off for the last time today, the impact will be felt right across the component and service supply sectors.' This round of job cuts will see about 300 workers axed from the workforce, with 50 voluntary redundancies. It will leave 450 workers at Broadmeadows and 350 at Geelong. But Ford spokesman Wes Sherwood told AAP it was not over yet with job slashing to continue until the end of the year. 'As we have said all along, we expected the majority to be compulsory separations,' he said. To help keep operations afloat, Ford has contributed $10 million to a federal government industry fund, and jobs fairs at its plants were attended by 30 potential employers. It comes just over a year after Ford announced the two factories would close its doors in 2016. Earlier this month AMWU representatives told MailOnline the job cuts were coming . Declines in sales of the Territory and Falcon are to blame for 230 forced redundancies and 50 voluntary redundancies . Earlier this month, regional secretary of the AMWU vehicle division Paul Difelice told MailOnline that Ford had attributed the cuts to slow vehicle sales in its Ford Territory and Falcon ranges. 'The Falcon is the one that has taken the most hits on the marketplace,' he said. 'There would have been around roughly 1,000 Ford Falcons sold this time last year and now it would be around the 690 figure.' Ford's job losses come after Holden and Toyota announced in December and February respectively they would both cease Australian operations by 2017. It follows six years of struggle for the auto industry since Mitsubishi closed its Adelaide plant in 2008.","First round of job cuts will see about 300 people made redundant .

"By . Martin Beckford . Embarrassment: David Cameron campaigning with Anthony Stansfeld in Witney . David Cameron's local crime tsar has been accused of setting up a sham office in a ‘cynical scam’ that increased his travel expenses by 6,000 per cent, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Anthony Stansfeld, the Conservative Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley, could not claim for the cost of the 45-minute drive from his home to the force’s headquarters every morning. He changed his main office to a single room in a police station just four miles from his house. It meant Mr Stansfeld could then receive expenses for every journey he made to the police HQ, after briefly checking in at the smaller office. In the first few weeks after the move he clocked up over 1,000 miles and was paid more than £450 of public money – a 6,181 per cent rise on the £7 he received the previous month. And in a further twist, Mr Stansfeld has now become the first PCC to appoint a chauffeur to ferry him back and forth to work. It means his mileage claims have ceased but it will cost taxpayers at least £20,000 a year for him to be driven around in an Audi. At the same time, Thames Valley Police must make £40 million of cuts over the next four years. Last night there was astonishment at the behaviour of Mr Stansfeld, who is paid £85,000 as PCC and £15,000 in allowances as a Tory councillor. It is yet another embarrassment for Mr Cameron, MP for Witney, West Oxfordshire, and for the Conservatives’ flagship law and order policy of electing 41 Commissioners across England and Wales, to make the police more accountable. Four miles away: Stansfeld drove from his home in Kintbury, Berkshire to his local station . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Anthony Stansfeld’s pop-up office appears to be part of a cynical scam to milk the system for as much cash as possible.’ Jon Harvey, a Buckingham town councillor, added: ‘I am very curious as to how him having these two offices benefits the Thames Valley public.’ Mr Stansfeld lives in the upmarket village of Kintbury, Berkshire. But his 13 staff are based at the Thames Valley HQ in Kidlington, North Oxford, a 37-mile journey that takes 45 minutes along the busy A34. Because Revenue rules do not allow employees to claim business mileage between home and their main place  of work, Mr Stansfeld initially had  to cover the cost of his commute. Sham office: Stansfeld used to briefly check in at Hungerford Police Station . Records on his website show he was paid just £15.30 in mileage expenses last December, his first month in charge. In January he claimed £7.20 for driving 16 miles, at 45p a mile. But a footnote says he then opened an office in Hungerford, just down the road from his home. It explains: ‘Therefore his main place of work is now Hungerford with a home-to-work mileage of nine.’ Under the new arrangement, Mr Stansfeld claimed back the cost of 13 return journeys to Kidlington in his own car, after first checking in at Hungerford. His mileage claim shot up to 1,005 in February, for which he was paid £452.25, and in March it went up again to 1,334, for which he received £600.30. Real office: Stansfeld then drove to the Thames Valley Police Headquarters in Kidlington, allowing him to claim mileage on the second journey . No need to drive: Standsfeld is now chauffeur-driven in an Audi A6 . It takes six minutes to complete the journey from his house to the small, red-brick station in Hungerford, which is open to the public just four hours a day, three days a week. When The Mail on Sunday visited, the front counter was manned by one civilian worker and there was no sign of Mr Stansfeld. In the reception area next to the front door, an A4 piece of paper bearing his name has been stuck on a door with drawing pins. But in April, he stopped using the Hungerford office after acquiring a chauffeur. He is now taken in one of the force’s own Audi A6 saloons directly from his home to Kidlington. He advertised on the Thames Valley Police website for a ‘support officer’ on at least £19,700 a year whose main roles would be providing ‘driving and practical support’. David Hanson MP, Labour’s Shadow Policing Minister, said: ‘The PCC needs to immediately explain the need for this expenditure, and why he initially opened a temporary office close to his home. ‘This is another example of potentially increased costs which are taking away money from policing the front line at a time when the number of police officers is being cut.’ A spokesman for Mr Stansfeld said: ‘Thames Valley is a large area to cover and the Hungerford office was made available to the Police and Crime Commissioner to increase his productivity. The PCC has recently employed a support officer whose role includes administrative support for the PCC. The decision was also taken to make driving duties one of the responsibilities of this post. 'The PCC has had the use of a surplus force fleet car since April and therefore has not submitted any mileage claims since then.’ Since publication of this article we have been asked to make clear that Mr Stansfeld had intended to use the Hungerford office as his permanent place of work. The audit report did not conclude it was a “sham” office.  In addition, we confirm that the support officer/ driver, was part-time with a salary of £11,980. Mr Stansfeld has also clarified that he stood down as Executive Member of West Berkshire Council prior to becoming Police and Crime Commissioner, and now receives the basic allowance of £6,149 rather than £15,000 as reported.","Anthony Stansfeld accused of  a ‘cynical scam’ to milk travel expenses .

"By . Andrew Levy . Millions of children are growing up unaware that stories such as the Nativity or the tale of David and Goliath come from the Bible - because it is being shunned in schools and homes. Almost one in three Britons didn’t know the where the story of the birth of Jesus could be found, despite being asked just after Christmas. This rose to 36 per cent for the tale of the Good Samaritan and 41 per cent for Samson and Delilah.Nearly two-thirds - 59 per cent - had no idea the stories of David and Goliath and Jonah and the Whale were from the Bible. Millions of children are growing up unaware that stories such as the Nativity or the tale of David and Goliath come from the Bible - because it is being shunned in schools and homes . Yet one in ten thought the stories of King Midas and Icarus - both from classical Greek myth rather than the Bible - appeared in the Old or New Testament. The Bible Society, which commissioned the report, said the statistics were ‘symptomatic of the fact that many children indicate they have never read, seen or ever heard these stories’. Some 54 per cent of children were never read Bible stories by adults, it found. Yet 86 per cent of parents said they had been regularly told about key passages when they were growing up. The growing indifference to the scriptures echoes the shrinking congregations reported by the Church of England. Almost one in three Britons didn't know the where the story of the birth of Jesus could be found . Usual Sunday attendance was 807,472 in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, half the 1.6 million in 1968. Campaigners fear the religion is in a state of permanent retreat. Recent census figures have recorded a decline of more than ten per cent in just a decade in the number of people who regard themselves as Christian. And courts have rejected claims by Christians for a respect under the law for their beliefs. In November, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said the Church of England was just ‘one generation away from extinction’. He added: ‘If we do not invest in young people there is going to be no one in the future.’ The survey of more than 5,700 adults and 804 children found a quarter of children had never heard of the Nativity or Noah’s Ark and two-fifths were completely unaware of Adam and Eve and The Crucifixion. Two-thirds hadn’t come across the Creation story, three-quarters had never been told about Daniel in the lion’s den and more than nine in ten didn’t know about King Solomon. Parents also showed embarrassing gaps in knowledge, with 46 per cent wrongly identifying a Harry Potter plot line as coming from the Bible. Yet nearly half of adults think Bible stories provide ‘good values for life’ and 40 per cent say they are important to our history and culture. More than a third stated they were simply ‘classic stories that stand the test of time’. Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion, who described the report as ‘disturbing’, said: ‘It’s essential for us to keep these stories alive, regardless of our religious beliefs (or lack of them). ‘They are indispensable to our understanding of the past and the enrichment of our present.’ Bible Society chief executive James Catford added: ‘Our research indicates that the Bible’s brilliant and engaging stories could be lost to future generations unless people take action. ‘The Bible enriches life and every child should have the opportunity to experience it.’","One in three Britons didn’t know where story of birth of Jesus could be read .

"The immediate assumption one has on hearing that an academic has won the Nobel Prize  is that he must always have been a brilliant and hard-working individual  who was marked out for golden success. In the case of the Cambridge scientist Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this week, we were roundly disabused of this notion when he let it be known that his school science report began with the word ‘Disastrous’ — and went downhill from there. ‘I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist,’ his biology teacher wrote. ‘On his present showing this is quite ridiculous; if he can’t learn simple biological facts he would have no chance of doing the work of a specialist, and it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part, and of those who have to teach him.’ Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October, says human cloning could happen within 50 years . Gurdon’s work was ‘far from satisfactory’. One effort ‘scored two marks out of a possible 50’. In a class of 18 at Eton College, this master placed Gurdon 18th. And yet, 79-year-old Gurdon has for decades been pre-eminent in the field of cloning and cell research. True, there are those who have questioned some of the ethical issues arising out of his work. It is as a direct consequence of his endeavours, for example, that other scientists decided to proceed with cloning Dolly the Sheep. He has also been at the vanguard of defending genetically modified crops. But no one in recent years has questioned Sir John’s brilliance, nor his dedication to his work. Even when he was the Master  of Magdalene College at Cambridge University, with administrative responsibility to students and scholars, Sir John never let up in his scientific work, and was hard at it in the laboratory even on days when he had also to attend fundraising meetings and the like. 'I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist. On his present showing this is quite ridiculous... and it would be a sheer waste of time' Some people will read this story and remark how foolish the science teacher was. Not since 1895, when a Munich science teacher said that little Albert Einstein ‘will never amount to anything’ could anyone have got a budding scientist so wrong. But there is another way of looking at it. Is it not possible that this patently honest report is one of the reasons why Gurdon went on to such great heights? In most schools today, the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times, even when they have achieved nothing spectacular. If a small child at kindergarten rolls a piece of Plasticine into the shape of a garden worm, the class is expected to be as impressed as if he had moulded it into the shape of the Venus de Milo. At assemblies, the most feeble, inaudible lisped readings and songs are greeted with wild applause. And later on, in the modern child’s school-days, it is thought desirable to continue praising and emphasising the positive. Pre-eminent: As a direct consequence of Sir Gurdon's endeavours, other scientists decided to proceed with cloning Dolly the Sheep (pictured) Thus the recent, welcome, decision to raise the bar for English GCSEs passes and to admit finally that some children could not spell, or write grammatically, or remember the books they had been studying, was greeted with howls of outrage and seen as unfair, and even cruel. The truth is that in state schools, proper school reports are a thing of the past. The old cliche — ‘could do better’ — is no longer allowed. It’s considered too harsh for the poor dears. But the fact is that unless someone tells a young pupil that they could do better, they never will do better. They are left with the lie that they could not improve — even if they tried. In any case, trying is not something which they are encouraged to do. Conned by artificially high grades at GCSEs, which are doled out by cynical examination boards touting for custom (the boards get paid by schools which choose them, so it is in their interest to make things easy), whole generations of school-children have never received criticism of the kind stingingly — and helpfully — delivered by John Gurdon’s Eton master. 'Far from satisfactory': In a class of 18 at Eton College (pictured), Sir Gurdon's teachers placed him 18th after he 'scored two marks out of a possible 50' Indeed, many students receiving such a rebuke today would probably need counselling, or their parents would write off to a solicitor seeking redress. For his part, John Gurdon became a great scientist, not because he was a conceited, lazy boy, who thought he knew it all, when he did not. He became a great scientist when he stopped being that boy, and learned the tough lessons that his biology master wanted to teach him: get your facts right, apply yourself, learn to be humble in respect of facts, work hard. Of course, Sir John has rightly been . seen as one of a number of high achievers who were either slow starters, . or whose genius was not spotted at school. So wrong: A Munich science teacher said that little Albert Einstein 'will never amount to anything' Winston Churchill is the classic case of the boy who was largely unloved by his parents, and unappreciated by the teachers. When he was an eight-year-old attending a private school called St George’s, Ascot, Churchill was said by his teacher to be ‘a very naughty boy’ and ‘a constant trouble to everybody and is always in some scrape or other. He  cannot be trusted to behave himself anywhere’. Actually, Churchill’s anarchic and ungovernable behaviour — which got him into many scrapes in his political career — were part of what made him so unpredictable and successful a warlord. When he went on to Harrow School, his housemaster despairingly wrote: ‘He is so regular in his irregularity that I really don’t know what to do.’ (By contrast, in Linz, in Austria, a schoolmaster was writing that his pupil was ‘very satisfactory’ in his ‘moral conduct . . . religious instruction, adequate; freehand drawing good’. It was, of course, Adolf Hitler). There are countless examples of school . reports of successful people which are hardly complimentary — yet which . show the teachers had seen something in their pupils that would go on . being part of their later character. Churchill could certainly make colossal . mistakes and be ‘a constant trouble to everybody’ — that turned out to . be part of his greatness. And the important thing is that his teachers . were happy to express their firmly held opinions of him. The rot set in from the Seventies . when teachers’ training colleges all started going barmy, and it was . considered wicked to correct children’s mistakes. This was also the period from which educational standards generally started to plummet. Too harsh: In schools today the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times, even when achieving nothing spectacular but unless someone tells a pupil that they could improve, they will never do better . If you are a dedicated teacher with a passion for your subject and a real love for your pupils, you will go on and on correcting them until they achieve excellence. But this approach did not fit in with the prevailing ethos of the educational establishment, which meant core subjects suffered. In maths, science, languages, and history, it is essential to get your facts and grammar right. Unsurprisingly, there has been a marked decline in these subjects in British education across the past 40 years, and a growth in so-called subjects where there is no right or wrong answer — such as design, creative writing, media studies, international relations, business studies, fashion, psychology — subjects where no one lets facts get in their way. By contrast, life-changing medical research such as that conducted by Sir John Gurdon, depends upon actually knowing things. And knowing things is  only possible if some teacher has been brave enough to tell the pupils when they have got something wrong. All through the party conference season we have been treated to the boring spectacle of politicians vying with one another to raise the number of British students in higher education. But what is the point of doing so if these students are not studying anything useful? And how can anyone be expected to study something useful  unless at an early stage a school teacher has been honest enough, caring enough, to say — as that biology teacher did all those years ago to a young John Gurdon: ‘If you go on making mistakes like that, you’ll never make anything of your life . . . it would be a sheer waste of time.’","Nobel prize winning scientist Sir John Gurdon had 'disastrous' school report .

In the video footage, the SUP boarder, right, can be heard shouting: 'You drop in on me like that again and you won't f*****g surf here again. It's my wave, keep your f*****g eyes open' The incident, which occurred off Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, has left Mr Brown ‘wary of going back into the water’. He said: ‘I think he’s bang out of order for the way he spoke to me and the localism he used as well. ‘It’s inappropriate - it shouldn’t be used in any way, shape or form. ‘I’ve heard he’s quite renowned for saying these kinds of things to other people in the water. I’ve heard of at least a handful of people saying the same thing has happened to them. ‘It’s disgusting and it’s just not right. ‘It’s the same as racism. It’s exactly the same thing just in a different manner. ‘I am a bit wary to get back in the water now to be honest. I think I’ll go to a different beach now to avoid him.’ The . former Army serviceman and keen surfer added: ‘I was quite shocked. Everyone in Cornwall is pretty laid back – you don’t get that kind of . thing usually so to receive that from him was one hell of a shock. ‘I told him I’m from Cornwall but he comes across as if it is his water and almost as if he classes me as a holidaymaker. ‘It shouldn’t make any difference where I’m from - it’s the same water.’ The paddle boarder, right, tells longboarder Phil Brown, left: 'Don't act like a t**t in the water. F*** off back to England you ****' Mr Brown, who served eight years in the Army working in The Queen's Royal Hussars on a battle tank Challenger Two – and was deployed to Afghanistan – said other locals have also been left shocked by the incident. He . said: ‘They all think it’s disgusting the way he was talking to me. There’s no real reason for anyone to talk to anyone else like that. ‘It made me feel horrible and I didn’t appreciate the way he was talking to me. ‘I’ve had suggestions that I should go to the police about it but I don’t really want to go down the formal line. ‘I’m not spiteful and I don’t wish the guy harm, I just want him to know I’m unhappy and I want an apology.’ Mr . Brown also said he was left confused by the man’s comment telling him . to ‘f*** off back to England’ and said there was no need for localism. He said: ‘I don’t know if he’s from Cornwall - he has a broad Liverpuddlian accent - but he said at the time “I was born here”. ‘I don’t know what his views are but I certainly don’t think of Cornwall is its own country or anything like that. ‘I know there’s some good old rivalry between Devon and Cornwall but that’s just banter.’ Phil Brown, left, also said he was left confused by the man's comment telling him to 'f*** off back to England' and said there was no need for localism . Phil Brown, centre, said he accidentally caught the same wave as the paddle boarder. He said: 'I didn't realise that if someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it's classed as their wave' It’s . unclear what the SUP boarder meant by his racist comment but it appears . he holds the view that Cornwall is a separate entity to England and . that it should be classed as a different country. Despite . his strong northern accent, the black and white Saint Piran’s flag can . be seen stuck to the front of his paddle board which is used by some . Cornish people as a symbol of identity. The . view that Cornwall is separate from the rest of England is a view which . is long-held by several people from the county, who regard the ‘Kernow’ as distinctly separate from the rest of the British Isles. A . minority believe the Cornish should be considered a separate race or . nation, with their own language, society and customs which is distinct . from the neighbouring mainland. Mr . Brown, who now manages a brewery in the county, said the whole incident . was an accident on his part and said he just wants an apology from the . SUP boarder. The incident, which occurred off Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, has left keen surfer Phil Brown, pictured, 'wary of going back into the water' He said: . ‘I started surfing properly last summer and I didn’t realise that if . someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it’s classed as . their wave. ‘What I . did wasn’t dangerous - there was no one in front of us - so there’s no . reason for him to have said it would’ve created an accident. ‘I’ve . never seen the guy before in my life, let alone surfed with him before, . but there was such a distance between us that it shouldn’t have been a . problem. ‘Apparently I . was in the wrong but after the wave he seemed quite happy at first until . he paddled across to me and had a right bl**dy go at me. ‘But to be honest I just want an apology and to shake the guys hand and move on.’ The Saint Piran's Flag is the Cornish flag and is attributed to Saint Piran - a 6th Century Cornish abbot . Saint Piran's Flag is the flag of Cornwall. It is a white cross on a black background and is used by some Cornish people as a symbol of identity. It can be found raised outside many homes in Cornwall as well as on car bumper stickers, bunting, t-shirts and tax disc holders. The flag is attributed to Saint Piran - a 6th century Cornish abbot and saint. One early use of the white cross and black background design was the 15th century coat of arms of the Saint-Peran family. The earliest known description of the flag was written in 1835. At the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June 2012, the flag was among those flown on the Royal Barge, Gloriana. Saint Piran's Day - the national day of Cornwall - falls on March 5 annually and is celebrated in the county most notably with parades and processions, ceremonies of raising the flag, shop decorations and family entertainment. In 2006 Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to make March 5 a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise St Piran's Day celebrations. Since then, several employers mark the day by giving their staff a day off to honour ‘St Piran's Day Holiday’.","Longboarder Phil Brown, 29, was subjected to abuse after 'sharing' a wave .

"By . Arthur Martin . Lurking in the shadows, this is the vile thug who scrawled the word ‘Islam’ on the Bomber Command war memorial in London. The balaclava-clad vandal was caught on camera desecrating the monument to the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives during the Second World War. CCTV footage shows the suspect spraying the Green Park monument with red paint at 3.20am on Monday. Scroll down for video . Suspect: A CCTV camera picked up this man as he approached the Bomber Command memorial on Monday . Gotcha: The vandal, who covered his face with a balaclava (right), snuck in and out of the shadows to spray (left) Fled: The attack took around ten minutes before he walked calmly away along Piccadilly towards Knightsbridge in Central London . During the desecration, the vandal hides in the shadows when cars pass before continuing to spray the memorial. The vandal wrote the word ‘Islam’ in 2ft-high letters and also sprayed over an inscription. Similar graffiti was sprayed on the . Animals in War memorial, in nearby Park Lane. The £7million Bomber . Command monument was opened by the Queen in June last year. Gerry Abrahams, 90, of Margate in . Kent, who flew more than 31 bombing missions, said: ‘If anyone knows who . this man is, please tell the police. Suspicious: Another CCTV camera appears to capture the moment before the war memorial was vandalised . The man surveys the statue at the centre of the memorial. This still is from footage released by the RAF Benevolent Fund . Disrespect: The CCTV footage, thought to be captured between 3am and 5am, shows what looks like someone spraying (top right) Attack: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was sprayed and then covered up by police . Message: This image shows the word 'Islam' daubed on the Animals In War Memorial, but police are not sure if it was carried out by Muslim protesters or far-right groups trying to stir up trouble . A tarpaulin covers part of the Animals in War Memorial on Park Lane, which police say they found at 5am on Monday . ‘He should be brought to justice. I am shocked and appalled by this vandalism.’ Harry Irons, 89, of Romford in Essex, who survived 80 missions as a rear gunner, said: ‘I want people to look at these pictures and help catch the perpetrator. ‘It is appalling to treat the memorial  like this.’ Jim Dooley, head of fundraising for the Bomber Command monument, said: ‘This is heartbreaking for the veterans. I just hope police can find this thug.’ Police are yet to make any arrests over the vandalism, which was partially cleaned by workmen earlier this week. The clean-up begins: A contractor removes Islam graffiti which was daubed on a memorials to members of RAF Bomber Command after a spate of ugly attacks in the wake of soldier Lee Rigby's murder . Making good: At the Bomber Command monument, two contractors worked for over an hour removing the metre-high bright red letters spelling 'Islam' Disgraceful: A council worker removes the word 'Islam' from the Animals In War memorial in London's Park Lane after it was attacked by vandals . No respect: The vandals also sprayed paint over a poignant message giving details about the monument . There are concerns the repairs could cost tens of thousands because the paint has soaked into the stone. A spokesman for the RAF Benevolent . Fund, which is responsible for the memorial’s maintenance, said: ‘The . paint has seeped in to such a depth that the use of solvents is unlikely . to bring the memorial back to how it should be. ‘The worst-case scenario is taking the damaged stone out and replacing it with fresh stone, which will be very expensive.’ The two monuments were targeted as . police forces across the country dealt with a spate of ugly attacks . after the killing of soldier Lee Rigby. The grandparents of murdered soldier Lee Rigby today laid a floral wreath at the makeshift shrine to the brave soldier. The couple stopped at the scene of the slaying to lay a blue pillow-shaped wreath adorned with flowers and a blue ribbon with the words ‘grandson’ and Drummer Rigby’s service number ‘2B – RRF’ An inscription read: ‘To our brave grandson Lee Rigby – taken from us too soon. We will miss you terribly. Rest in peace. Nanny and Grandad from Southend on Sea.' Mourning: The uncle (left) and maternal grandparents (right) of Lee Rigby visiting the site where he was brutally murdered . The grieving couple held hands as they spent two hours reading tributes laid at the shrine. While reading one – a poem entitled the Woolwich Soldier – Drummer Rigby’s grandmother appeared to wipe a tear from her eye. Her husband, who did not want to give his name, said: ‘We came down here to see the flowers and read the messages people left for Lee. We really appreciate it. ‘We are too upset to say more at this moment. Sorry.’ Tribute: The pair read a selection of the vast array of messages of condolence left at the site . The number of people leaving floral tributes was so vast that nearby flower shops reportedly ran out of blooms . The poem, The Woolwich Soldier, read: . Just out for a walk on an early stack, not looking for trouble, not watching my back. Mothers with prams holding hands with their kids, not paying attention to the car as it skids. Caught completely off guard not expecting what comes, one man with a knife another with guns. No chance of defence, no chance to fight back, looking for help as the cowards attack. An angel arrives as the light turns to grey, a woman attempts to steer attackers away. My last thought of 'Thank You' never strays from my brain, as my body shuts down I feel no more pain. I look to the left and I look to the right, thousands of squaddies are all that’s in sight. Uniforms are crisp and their faces are clean, no anger or hate to be seen. As if by command they all salute as one, the RSM smiles, says 'welcome home, son'. Lieutenant Colonel Bob Christopher Royal Artillery, the Commander of Woolwich Station where Drummer Rigby served, today released a statement saying he was killed doing a job he loved. It said: 'Drummer Lee Rigby was in London reaching out to young men and women who want to serve their country by joining the Armed Forces. This was a job he loved doing, and he was very good at it. He was tragically killed while travelling home from that job and our thoughts are with his family, loved ones, friends and colleagues. 'Drummer Rigby was proud to live and work in this community, as are all the soldiers who are based here. The best tribute we can pay him is to not allow this awful crime to separate the military family in Woolwich from the fantastic support we have received, are currently receiving and know that we will continue to receive from our friends and neighbours across the borough. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the police for their sterling work as well as the local people and their community leaders who represent the wide range of religious and ethnic backgrounds which make up and enrich this borough. 'I have had the privilege of hosting a number of Drummer Rigby’s family, loved ones and friends over the past few days and I know they, like us, Drummer Rigby’s Army family, have been touched and take strength from the large number of people, including many from this fine borough, that have taken the trouble to come and leave tributes and pay their respects on such an amazing scale as is clearly visible in the road leading to the barracks which Drummer Rigby called home.'","London monuments to bomber pilots and war animals daubed with graffiti .

"By . Associated Press . A Texas man has pleaded not guilty to a capital murder charge stemming from a childhood attack on a boy who died nearly 13 years later. Don Willburn Collins, now 29, appeared in court north of Houston on Thursday to enter his plea. Authorities say Collins was 13 in 1998 when he poured gasoline on Robert Middleton and set him on fire on Middleton's eighth birthday near the boy's home in Splendora, about 35 miles northeast of Houston. Don Willburn Collins (pictured itoday) pleads not guilty for capital murder in a childhood attack on a boy who died nearly 13 years later from skin cancer blamed on the horrific burns he suffered in the assault . Maimed: Middleton was burned on his eighth birthday, and shortly before his death gave a videotaped deposition accusing Collins of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack . Middleton survived but died in 2011 of skin cancer that authorities blamed on his injuries. Collins is currently jailed on a $1 million bond and his trial is scheduled to begin on January 5th. A judge ruled in March that Collins' case could be transferred from juvenile to adult court. Collins' attorney, E. Tay Bond, has said there's no credible evidence that could lead to a conviction. Middleton . was burned across 99 percent of his body at the time of the attack and . endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011. Middleton had initially named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. Collins . spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after . prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case. Shortly . before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he . accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks . before the attack. Judge Kathleen Hamilton hears Don Collins' not guilty plea during an arraignment today . Don Collins pictured waiting for his arraignment hearing in the 359th state District Court today . The . sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case, and . prosecutors charged the now 28-year-old Collins with murder last year — . but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take . him to trial. Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said she was relieved the case would go to trial. 'When . Robert died we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen, maybe . someone is just going to get away with what they did to him,' she said. 'It's been a long road.' Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said he hopes the case can be tried by the end of the year. Several witnesses testified during that Collins had confessed to them or others that he . had been responsible for the attack on Middleton. But . attorney E. Tay Bond said there is no credible . evidence in the case that would result in a conviction. Horror injuries: Attacked on his eight birthday, Robert Middleton was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 . 'I . think the indictment for capital murder is a direct reflection of the . desire that this community has to hold someone accountable for the . tragedy that was bestowed upon Mr. Middleton,' Bond said. Bond said he plans to ask for a change of venue and will present evidence at trial of Collins' history of mental disability. One point of contention is the maximum prison sentence Collins could face if convicted. If Collins had been certified to stand trial as an adult when he was a juvenile, his maximum sentence would have been 40 years. The maximum term for capital murder as an adult is life in prison. 'We believe the full range of punishment is life,' Ligon said. Bond said 40 years should be the maximum possible sentence. Collins also faces a charge in neighboring San Jacinto County of failing to register as a sex offender.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Goldfish may be forgetful, but when it comes to classical music, it seems they know what they like. They can distinguish between a piece by 18th century German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and one by 20th century Russian Igor Stravinsky, a study found. Japanese researchers played goldfish Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor and Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. They trained four of them to bite a red bead on hearing one piece, but not the other. Holy mackerel! Goldfish have evolved to develop similar . hearing mechanisms as seemingly far more complex animals, said . researchers who painstakingly trained them to tell the difference . between Bach and Stravinsky . Professor Sigeru Watanabe, from the department of psychology at Keio University in Tokyo, Japan, said goldfish have evolved to develop similar hearing mechanisms as seemingly far more complex animals. He said: ‘Humans... can easily recognise and enjoy a variety of types of music. ‘Several studies have investigated whether these properties of music exist in non-human animals. ‘Goldfish are known as a hearing specialist species, since they have evolved a structure to enhance auditory signals detected by the inner ear. ‘This suggests that goldfish have evolved specific features for hearing and can recognise complex auditory stimuli similar to those recognised by modern vertebrates.’ The researchers carried out several experiments, and eventually trained four goldfish to either bite the bead to one piece of music and to do nothing when the other was playing. The fish were able to distinguish between the music around three quarters of the time. But they were not fast learners – it took more than 100 training sessions before they were able to distinguish the pieces. The scientists also tested to see whether the fish would recognise other pieces by the same composers that they had never heard before. However found they did not appear to recognise them and instead the fish swam around randomly. Academic fishing expedition: Like humans, the fish did seem to show some individual tastes – one fish avoided music by Bach, left, and preferred Stravinsky, right, while another fish avoided Stravinsky, the study found . In another experiment involving six different goldfish, the scientists found the animals did not appear to show any strong preference for a particular type of music. However, like humans, the fish did seem to show some individual tastes – one fish avoided Bach’s music and preferred Stravinsky while another of the fish avoided Stravinsky. Professor Watanabe added: ‘For those subjects, the musical stimuli might have a certain kind of reinforcing properties, although it was not consistent among individuals. ‘On the other hand, three of the six subjects did not show any preferences for areas of the tank in which music was presented.’ The findings go some way to disproving myths that suggest goldfish are relatively simple creatures with low levels of intelligence. According to popular myth they have a memory span of only 15 seconds. But recent research has suggested that goldfish can have a memory span of up to three months.","Fish able to distinguish composers around three quarters of the time .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A coroner has demanded to know how an 88-year-old grandmother was allowed to starve to death in a care home. Irene Willits, who worked as a bus conductress during the Second World War, was reduced to an ‘emaciated skeleton’ after care home staff failed to check she was eating properly. When she finally died of severe malnutrition, she weighed just 4st 12lb – the weight of a seven-year-old child. Coroner Simon Nelson said he was so horrified to hear what happened to Mrs Willits, that he is to write to the local health authorities and even the police to raise his concerns. Irene Wilits (pictured in 2003 with her great grandaughter Sophie Lovel) weighed less than five stone at the time of her death and was described as looking like a 'skeleton with skin pulled over' despite being in a care home and categorised as 'high risk' The inquest heard that doctors who saw Mrs Wilits at hospital before she died 'couldn’t believe that she had come from a care home'. Now her daughter Yvonne Newell has hit out at her care at Ashbourne Nursing Home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, saying 'We were let down. No one should die of malnutrition in modern-day Britain.' The inquest heard that the former Second World War bus conductor and grandmother had 'slipped through the net', after staff at the nursing home failed to carry out appropriate record keeping for almost a month in the lead up to her death in September 2009 and a review by her dietitian had failed to take place. Irene Wilits as a bus conductor during WWII . One doctor at the hospital said that medical help should have been sought sooner, whilst the pathologist said she had 'looked like a skeleton' with a BMI of just 13. Pathologist Dr Samer Al Habba said: 'She looked like a skeleton so I’m not surprised about her low weight, she was extremely malnourished. 'She should have had medical intervention, there wasn’t enough care. 'She was well underweight. It is impossible to gauge the time scale that dehydration had occurred.' Mrs Willits had been a resident at the home since November 2008 after a series of mini strokes and problems arising surrounding weight loss caused her to be hospitalised. When she was discharged, she . was initially expected to stay in the care home for one month but . ended up remaining because she had shown improvements in her health and . eating and put on just under a stone (6 kg). The . inquest heard that she was categorised as 'high risk' and needed her . weight to be continually monitored, but over the next six months her . weight dropped. Her . daughter, Yvonne Newell, 66, giving evidence, said that she had visited . her elderly mother regularly and four days before her death in September . 2009, had noted that she was becoming more frail. She . also raised concerns that the care home was not keeping records . up-to-date which was brought to the attention of the coroner, Simon . Nelson. An investigation by Greater Manchester Police after her death found that Ashbourne House had 'fulfilled all their requirements'. DC . Desmond Henry had told the hearing that he 'didn’t feel there were any . grave concerns about the medical staff or medical providers' and that 'all documentation completed was of higher than average standard.' But . coroner Mr Nelson hit out at the care home’s record keeping and GMP . after it was found that there were no care records from August 10, 2009 . - bar a report on August 16, 2009, that referred to a slight weight . gain. Irene Wilits' daughter Yvonne Newell (pictured) said that she is still looking for answers as to why her mother died: 'I still want to know how this happened, I think that when the coroner said she fell through the net he was right. I still have reservations about what happened in the days leading up to her death' Mrs Newell said: 'She went in a lot better health than what she was in the end. I assume if somebody needs care then they are given it. 'I can’t believe that a care home . would leave someone in such a state without water and not admit her to . hospital. It is inconceivable that that would happen and also not to . advise me how bad she was.' Irene on her Wedding Day in 1947 . Dr . Shauna Macullen said that when the grandmother arrived at Rochdale . Infirmary she was dehydrated and 'didn’t have any more weight to lose'. 'She . was chronically underweight. The deceased didn’t have any more weight . to lose. The nursing staff (at the hospital) were concerned with the . poor physical state she was in.' Mrs Willits’s health failed to improve and she died the following day. Dr . Macullen added that she had been 'surprised' the hospital staff hadn’t . seen Mrs Willits before, adding: 'She was very very unwell, but . deterioration can be very rapid. She can’t have drank for a couple of . days. I do believe they should have sought medical help sooner.' Area care home manager for Ashbourne . Nursing Home, Francesca Stewart said: 'Any concerns a home has about . weight or diet are referred to the outside professionals. 'The home did pass on the concerns to the outside services. 'It . was evident that Irene was seen regularly by external professionals and . at no time prior to her death did the external professionals raise . concerns about the care provided by the home and was not considered to . be at risk. 'The staff . at the home regularly encouraged her to eat and take in more fluids, . this is confirmed from her notes. Whilst the home would raise any . necessary concerns to her well being, it was ultimately for the visiting . nurses, GP, district nurses and community dietician to administer.' She said that she accepted that . records should have contained entries on a weekly basis and accepted . that it was good practice to chase up any outside assessments. Community . staff nurse with Pennine Acute Trust, Lynn O’Connor had implemented a . care plan for Mrs Willits because she was at risk of malnutrition. She . said that she had expected that the staff at the care home would carry . out weekly weigh ins, record the weight and liaise with the dietician . adding that this was 'very important'. Mrs Wilits (centre, with her daughter Yvonne, left) had been a resident at the home since November 2008 after a series of mini strokes and problems arising surrounding weight loss had caused her to be admitted to hospital . Returning a narrative verdict Mr Nelson said: 'In March 2009 her weight was 38.4 kilos, in May 35kg, August 33kg and at post mortem 31kg. These figures demonstrate a loss of over 10 per cent over a period of six months. 'It was imperative that her weight was maintained. 'Overall there were no concerns over the care of Mrs Willits prior to August 10 but the relevant records thereafter simply do not exist. 'The cause of death by the doctor was malnutrition which is an extremely rare cause of death. 'Record keeping is a major concern both within the acute setting and case homes. If it is not there it hasn’t taken place, it is as simple as that. There is no explanation of the absence of appropriate record keeping. 'I also have concerns about the vulnerable adult section compiled by the Greater Manchester Police about the completion of the care home records. It is supposed to evaluate the quality of the records provided by the care establishment. Mrs Newell (pictured with her husband outside Heywood Coroners Court) said: 'There was no way this happened overnight. I couldn't believe how she looked when I saw her that morning at the home, she was totally emaciated' 'It was suggested that there was nothing untoward. Having seen the actual records I do not share that evaluation and I will be writing to GMP to express my concerns. 'I am also extremely concerned and have had communication with Pennine Acute Trust that she didn’t have another dietary review. 'She died of malnutrition which more than likely was caused by a combination of naturally occurring disease.' Speaking after the inquest Mrs Newell, a retired export administrator, said that she was still looking for answers as to why her mother died. The coroner said that he had concerns about record keeping at Ashbourne Nursing Home in Rochdale, where Mrs Wilits starved . She said: 'I still want to know how this happened, I think that when the coroner said she fell through the net he was right. I still have reservations about what happened in the days leading up to her death. 'I know what she looked like when she went into hospital. If you imagine a skeleton with skin pulled over it, that was what she looked like. It was horrible. 'There was no way this happened overnight. I couldn’t believe how she looked when I saw her that morning at the home, she was totally emaciated. I would have liked to have known what she weighed at that stage before they pumped her full of fluid but they couldn’t weigh her. I have never seen anything like it. 'You don’t expect someone in this country to die of malnutrition it’s a third world problem, yet it happened.'","Grandmother Irene Willets, 88, died a day after she was admitted to hospital for severe malnutrition in 2009 .

"By . Emma Innes . Norma Spear died of dehydration after contracting a urinary tract infection while staying at a residential home . Gross neglect by staff at a Birmingham care home led to a grandmother dying of dehydration, a coroner has ruled. Norma Spear, 71, died in Moseley Hall Hospital on November 6, 2011, three days after she was admitted from Druids Meadow residential home in Highter's Heath, Birmingham. Ms Spear, from Harborne, Birmingham, developed a urinary tract infection in her five weeks at the home which stunted her appetite and led her to become dangerously dehydrated, the inquest heard. Carol Clay said her mother's stay at the home, during which she lost 35lbs in weight, was only supposed to be temporary and that she was due to return home once a new fire had been fitted. Birmingham's deputy coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe identified 11 failures - five of them severe enough to merit gross neglect - by staff at the home. In reaching a verdict, following a six-day inquest at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall, Mrs Ormond-Walshe said Ms Spear had 'died of natural causes to which neglect contributed'. She added: 'The failures I found are gross because they were so terribly simple. 'Without one or more of these gross failures, Norma Spear would have survived. 'She was at risk of the very thing she died of and that risk had been told to staff by a social worker. 'It should have been obvious she was not drinking sufficiently for at least the last two weeks. It does not require medical training.' Most of the errors catalogued centred around the staff's failure to call a doctor, despite repeated requests from Mrs Clay, and to properly investigate Ms Spear's worrying weight loss. Mrs Ormond-Walshe also highlighted four criticisms against some of the GPs attached to Druids Meadow, including failures to establish Ms Spear's medical history and to properly diagnose her dehydration. Speaking after the verdict, Mrs Clay, 52, said: 'It's a bittersweet feeling really. 'We've got the decision that she would have lived longer and had that confirmed by medical experts. 'We feel vindicated but it's an empty win.' During her five week stay at the home her daughter, Carol Clay, claims she lost 35lb in weight and did not drink properly for two weeks . Ms Spear's granddaughter, Becky Arnold, wept as the list of failures were read out in court. The 35-year-old mother said: 'She did nothing but care for other people and she died because she was not properly cared for by other people. 'I'm disgusted with them and hope it affects them for the rest of their lives.' Birmingham City Council's legal advisor, Edward Pepperall QC, said the coroner should feel comforted the home closed in 2011 and that the authority had replaced a large number of its care homes with four care centres. He said an internal review of how paperwork was updated and stored had taken place and that the Care Quality Commission had carried out subsequent inspections. In reaching a verdict, following a six-day inquest at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall, coroner Mrs Ormond-Walshe said Ms Spear had 'died of natural causes to which neglect [ at the home, pictured] contributed' Those in charge of the home could still face disciplinary proceedings, he said. The inquest had been told how Ms Spear was taken to Moseley Hall on June 3, 2011, after suffering a fall at home. She fully recovered from her injuries and despite needing encouragement to eat and drink, her weight was stabilised at around eight stone. But her weight dropped and her health quickly deteriorated after she moved from the hospital into Druids Meadow on September 28. Mrs Clay, who now lives in Hampshire, told the court how she had repeatedly asked staff to arrange for a doctor to see her mother amid fears she was dangerously dehydrated. Despite her concerns, exacerbated by Ms Spear's medical history, staff at the home did not arrange for a doctor to see Ms Spear until November 1.","Norma Spear contracted an infection while staying at Druids Meadow residential home.

"By . Leon Watson . A young architect died after rushing into a burning block of flats to try and save her fiance, an inquest heard. Sophie Rosser, 23, tried to raise the alarm when she saw the flat she shared with fiance Oscar Silva, 28, on the Isle of Dogs, East London, was on fire in August last year. Poplar Coroner's court heard Miss Rosser, who had been returning from a party in Chelsea, had phoned Mr Silva to say he should get out. Sophie Rosser (right) who died at 23 after rushing into a burning block of flats trying to save her fiance Oscar Silva (left) Her body was found on the fourth floor and Mr Silva told the court he watched from the balcony, where he had fled from the smoke, as paramedics desperately tried to revive her. In a statement read to the court said: 'A cab dropped her off at 1.37 on Sunday morning and I was asleep. Sophie called me to say there was a fire and our flatmate and I should evacuate. 'The intercom sounded but I couldn't hear who it was. The stairwell was full of smoke so we couldn't get out. We went back into the flat. I rang Sophie at 1.43 but there was no answer. 'I went to get the lift thinking she might have got in, but when it arrived there was nobody in it. I closed the door to the flat and went to open the balcony. 'I saw the fire brigade arriving and I saw paramedics doing their best to revive Sophie. When we got out I went to the hospital and I saw her twice, but she never regained consciousness.' Miss Rosser was found in the lobby of the fourth floor of the six-floor building by fireman Joseph Carter. Miss Rosser had been returning from a party in Chelsea when she saw the block was on fire . Miss Rosser's body was found on the fourth floor and Mr Silva told the court he watched from the balcony, where he had fled from the smoke, as paramedics desperately tried to revive her . Mr Carter, who was based at Millwall, . told the inquest: 'When we arrived there were people crying, telling us . to get in and get people out. It was my first big fire so I was quite . nervous. 'When we got to . the fourth floor there was zero visibility and it was very, very hot. I . could feel the heat coming through my boots. 'I . was staying low, virtually kneeling. I was feeling around with my left . arm whilst trying to keep the wall close enough to touch so I could feel . where I was. 'You couldn't see anything. My arm was outstretched and I was feeling for anything. 'After . about 10 seconds of entering the lobby I felt Sophie's foot with my . hand. I shouted ""casualty"" ""casualty"" until I knew my colleague knew I . had found someone. 'I got to her head and she was unconscious. I got her to the lobby door and passed her over to my colleague.' Miss Rosser was found on the fourth floor of the block, where the fire originated . Coroner Mary Hassell asked Mr Carter if he could have remained conscious without breath apparatus in the area where he found Miss Rosser. He said: 'It was really bad, it was thick black smoke from ceiling to the floor. Smoke would have overcome her in a matter of seconds.' Miss Rosser was found on the fourth floor of the block, where the fire originated. It appears she was trying to make her way to the fifth floor where she lived with her boyfriend, to try and save him. Coroner Dr Hassell asked: 'Is there any reason why she could have ended up on the fourth floor when she knew she lived on the fifth? We know she was trying to get to her boyfriend, but could she have become disorientated?' Paul Hobbs, a firefighter from Whitechapel who arrived on the scene shortly after, told the inquest: 'It's hard to say, but she would have been overwhelmed with smoke and with the adrenaline pumping, she could have become disorientated.' Grace Adong, a neighbour, told the inquest how she had left a damp towel over a lamp in her room, which appeared to cause the fire. She said: 'I didn't think it would be any danger, the lamp had never worked in the two months I had been there.' She said after returning from work she went to bed at about 1am but was woken by the smoke. Mrs Adong told the court: 'I went to sleep about 1am. I noticed white smoke coming under the bedroom door. I opened it and there was a metre high of smoke in the corridor. 'I went into the front room and there were flames an the curtain was on fire. I thought it best I opened the balcony door to get rid of some smoke.' The coroner asked: 'Had it not occurred to you that by opening the balcony door it could make things worse?' Miss Adong told the court: 'No.' The court heard how she ran out of the flat and banged all the doors on her floor to alert people but the fire continued to rage. The five-day inquest continues.","Sophie Rosser, 23, tried to raise alarm when she saw burning block .

"By . Jack Doyle . Updated: . 04:49 EST, 24 February 2012 . David Cameron is planning more electronic tags and longer curfews for serial offenders as it was revealed thousands are being let off with a slap on the wrist. Some 4,500 criminals with 15 or more convictions were given a caution last year. Tens of thousands more were handed fines, community sentences or suspended jail terms. Overall, some two-thirds of the worst serial offenders escaped jail, Ministry of Justice statistics show. Error: David Cameron wants to hand out more punishments to prolific criminals but his own experts fear this could push crime up not down . MPs said the figures betrayed the ‘soft justice’ system and called for more public control over sentences. Today, it was reported the Prime Minister will toughen up non-custodial sentences. Offenders will be sent to a 'virtual prison' , with a 16-hours-a-day curfew and judges and magistrates will be given the power to confiscate credit cards, passports and driving licences. The plans will mean longers curfews and more electronic tags for offenders. No formal agreement has been reached, but ministers hope to publish the plan within six weeks. Tory MP for Clacton, Douglas Carswell, said: ‘From November we get to elect our police chiefs. We now need to ensure democratic accountability over the rest of the criminal justice system. ‘So long as we leave it to the Secretary of State, we will never sort this problem out and get the criminal justice system we want and the public demands. 1,000 jailed over the riots . Changes: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke wants to promote better reform programmes rather than filling up prisons . ‘Soft justice is a consequence of an unaccountable justice system.’ Sentencing . figures published yesterday showed nearly 105,000 criminals with at . least 15 previous offences came back before the courts in England and . Wales. More than one third were locked up. But . 67,461 were given a non-custodial sentence. Around a third of those, . 20,553 were given community sentences and 16,149 were given a fine. More than 11,000 were handed an absolute or conditional discharge – in effect no punishment at all. A further 8,160 were given suspended jail sentences. In 2004 the custody rate for offenders after 15 or more crimes was 42 per cent, nearly 7 per cent higher. Overall, three quarters of crimes are committed by adults and juveniles with existing records. Last year re-offending accounted for some 638,153 out of more than 850,000 offences. Government officials suggested average prison sentences were at a ten-year high, with burglars locked up for an average of 19 months. Average sentences for robbery and drug offences were also up. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has pledged to mount a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ to turn offenders away from crime. He wants tougher community punishments and better reform programmes. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Overall re-offending is falling but the levels are still too high and we are determined to address the root causes of this behaviour. ‘We are making our jails places of hard work, toughening community sentences and making offenders pay back victims and communities.’","Figures show two thirds of Britain's worst serial offenders escaped jail .

The wardens were set upon by the prisoner who is said to have 'flipped' as he was being taken out of his cell for lunch at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison on Wednesday afternoon. One officer was stabbed five times by the prisoner on the jail's health care unit - while another man was slashed on his arm. 'Crazed': Winson Green prison in Birmingham where four prison officers have been badly injured after being slashed and stabbed with broken glass by an inmate . A third male suffered leg wounds and a fourth sustained an injury to their hand after being attacked with the 'improvised weapon', police said. Two of the prison officers yesterday remained in a stable condition in hospital while the other pair were released following treatment. The prisoner has now been transferred to a mental health facility while investigations are carried out . Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Police were called by the ambulance service at 12.48pm on Wednesday to a report of four prison officers being assaulted at HMP Birmingham. 'Initial inquiries suggest that the four were injured by an improvised weapon. The four men were taken to hospital. Two remain in hospital in a stable condition. 'Detectives have launched an investigation into the assault and we are working closely with the prison. 'A prisoner has been transferred to a mental health facility while inquiries continue.' Glyn Travis, assistant secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said: 'We understand four officers have been attacked - one very seriously. 'The prison officer most badly injured suffered nasty stab and slash wounds but is in a stable condition in hospital. He is currently awaiting further surgery to his arm. 'The others I believe have since been released from hospital after suffering cuts and lacerations to various parts of their body. 'For whatever reason this prisoner has become upset about something, it can be we entirely unprovoked and just serves as a reminder of how dangerous our job can be. 'The staff at Birmingham prison do an exceptional and professional job. We are not there to be punch bags - we are there to rehabilitate and care for prisoners. 'We offer the officer's family our support and wish him a full and speedy recovery.' One officer was stabbed five times during the attack on the prison's health care unit, while another was slashed on his arm. It is believed the prisoner has been transferred to a mental health unit .

'The staff, all members of the prison's healthcare unit, were wounded in an altercation with a prisoner on remand, with two staff receiving serious lacerations. 'All staff were transferred to local hospitals for treatment. The prisoner has been contained. 'The safety and welfare of our staff and those in our care is our utmost priority, and we have launched an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding this attack.

"By . Louise Boyle . For New Yorkers, the grueling search for affordable apartments is about to get a little easier. The city is planning to build more 'micro-apartments' - economically-friendly spaces that average 400 square feet - the New York Observer reports.

'We’re in the process of vetting a number of . city-owned sites, and RFP guidelines will be tailored to the chosen . sites.' Scroll down for video . Big Apple living: New York City is planning to build more micro-apartments like the one pictured here. This particular design is being used for a 55-unit block being built in Manhattan . At close quarters: The innovative apartment design, which was chosen by Mayor Bloomberg, is aimed at addressing the city's shortfall in affordable housing which currently stands at 800,000 . Transformation: The floor plans show how one of the units can be adapted from a living room to a bedroom . The news comes several months after city officials announced plans to build 55 new units of micro-apartments on the East side. Those units are planned for East 27th . Street in Manhattan - with 40 per cent of homes available to low and . middle-income New Yorkers. The first residents are expected to move in . September 2015. The . project, which was viewed by Mayor Bloomberg in January, will be the first . apartment building in New York where units are constructed off-site and . then fitted together. The design team behind the project aimed to capitalize on the sense of 'openness' in the tiny units. The new homes are all between 250 to 370 square feet and have ceiling heights of around 9ft. Each unit has an open-plan living space with kitchen, a separate bathroom, balcony and long storage area packed in close to the ceiling. Just like Lego: An artist's impression shows how the prefabricated units, which will be made in Brooklyn Navy Yard, will be fitted together at the site . Who lives in a house like this? Mayor Bloomberg surveys the tiny apartment to be built at a city-owned site at 335 East 27th Street . Streamlined: The design allows single New Yorkers on limited incomes to live in spaces of under 400ft uin the prefabricated units . Modern living: The design was a joint collaboration by Monadnock Development LLC, Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation and nARCHITECTS . The apartments were designed with a pull-out pantry, fridge, range and fold-down bed. The new homes will be at 335 East 27th Street in mid-town . Manhattan close to the East River.  The building will have rehearsal . spaces on the ground floor, lecture halls and a cafe. An attic garden and ground-level picnic area have also been planned along with a laundry room, bike room and gym. Mayor Bloomberg said of the units: 'New . York’s ability to adapt with changing times is what made us the world’s . greatest city – and it’s going to be what keeps us strong in the 21st . Century. 'The growth rate for one- and . two-person households greatly exceeds that of households with three or . more people, and addressing that housing challenge requires us to think . creatively and beyond our current regulations.' The current housing codes do not allow for an entire building of micro-apartments in NYC - despite the number of one and two-person households accelerating at the fastest rate. Neat design: Mayor Bloomberg surveys the living space of the new apartment design which will be part of a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York . On board: Bloomberg tries the foldaway bed at the apartment which he backed as part of New York's way of adapting for the future .

"By . Nikki Murfitt . Mother-of-three Emma Spencer, 36, is the glamorous face of flat racing on Channel 4 . It is a tale straight from the pages of a Jilly Cooper bonkbuster. A champion jockey cheats on his beautiful blonde wife – a top racing correspondent – with Britain’s best woman jockey, who also happens to be his training partner. And, of course, he gets found out. Emma Spencer, the glamorous face of flat racing on Channel 4, was filming away from home when her husband Jamie Spencer invited racing pin-up Hayley Turner back to the six-bedroom family mansion in Newmarket. The pair – who both worked with the Queen’s trainer Michael Bell – were already close, but this time Jamie broke the marriage vows he made five years  earlier. In the horsey set, which is notoriously incestuous and riven with gossip, nothing stays secret for long and Emma soon learned of the tryst. Headstrong and utterly loyal, she was incandescent at her husband’s betrayal and demanded a divorce. ‘Trust is, and always has been, a very big thing for me in my life,’ she says, sadly, as we discuss the affair over lunch at Newmarket. ‘If that is broken it is very difficult for me to go back.’ So it was understandably distressing when, in the bitter aftermath of the affair in 2010, she was asked to interview Miss Turner live on air after a 40-1 win; a request that would strike many as insensitive if not downright astonishing. But she point-blank refused to speak to her rival and Channel 4 bosses drafted in a replacement at the last minute. It was some time before Emma conquered this understandable reluctance, but she has since interviewed Hayley on camera and now says: ‘Post-race interviews are part of my job with Channel 4 and that is what I had to keep uppermost in my mind – personal feelings had to be put aside.’ Someone who is instinctively discreet, it took Emma the best part of four years to steady herself in the face of a very public humiliation – and only now is she willing to talk about it. Emma, 36, admits: ‘It’s true. In the aftermath of the affair, I refused to put myself under the spotlight in that way. I’m a very private person and not someone who wants to air their personal difficulties in front of the camera. 'I wanted to avoid any unnecessary tensions on screen and with my marriage break-up still raw, one of my colleagues stood in for me.’ Emma Spencer (pictured) was filming away from home when husband Jamie Spencer invited racing pin-up Hayley Turner back to the couple's six-bedroom family mansion in Newmarket, Suffolk . Now the three players in this sad drama are to be thrown back together at Royal Ascot, with Jamie and Hayley riding in the hope of a place in the Winners’ Enclosure and Emma waiting by the side of the track to interview whomever triumphs. It has the potential to be rather awkward, particularly given Emma’s unguarded comments. ‘It remains difficult between Hayley and I’, she said recently, adding: ‘I don’t have anything to do with her. She does her riding and I do my work. We don’t speak and I have no difficulties with that.’ It is a far cry from the days when Jamie and Emma were dubbed the ‘Posh and Becks’ of racing. Doyens of racing’s hard-partying social scene, they shared a £2million mansion, Grange House Stables, in Newmarket, Suffolk, with their three children – now eight, seven, and five. Emma, the Uppingham-educated daughter of legendary 80s gambler Jack Ramsden, says: ‘Jamie had a plane and one day, on my birthday, I had to get to Haydock Park – which is always log-jammed with traffic – to cover a race. As there’s a landing area at the course, Jamie told me I could take the plane.’ It was one of many larks they enjoyed together, but four years ago cracks began to appear, and the  burgeoning friendship between Jamie and Hayley, 31, developed into a full-blown affair. It is a matter of enduring regret for Jamie, 32, regarded on the circuit as a ‘wild’ Irishman who is nevertheless utterly devoted to his children. Hayley Turner (above) and Jamie split up soon after the affair was discovered . He has previously said: ‘I made a monumental error of judgment and now have to live with it. What I did is hard to explain. There’s not a day goes by that I don’t think of the catastrophic consequences of my stupidity. It’s hard, day in, day out.’ He went on to say: ‘I found the one person, but overnight it was all gone. Some evenings I think hard about it and can never find the reason why it happened. A huge error of judgment cost me all the things I wanted from a young age. A day doesn’t go by without me thinking about it.’ Emma, however, is adamant that the marriage is over for good. She says she would never consider another relationship with a jockey, adding: ‘I was 23 when I met Jamie. Dating and marrying a jockey – or someone in horse racing – seemed inevitable at that stage in my life. ‘But it is a very close-knit and gossipy world. Everyone knows your business and that can be tough when you are going through a very difficult situation. I want to find someone outside this business. ‘Maybe Mr Right is out there for me somewhere. It’s fair to say I am paddling my own canoe at the moment, but I hope that one day I will find someone special. I am extra cautious about any relationship because of the children. I wouldn’t introduce them to anyone I was having a relationship with until I was very sure it was a long-term thing.’ Most women would feel a sense of bitterness at being forced to watch their husband’s mistress continue to compete alongside him. And it is telling that while Emma insists she has now ‘moved on’, she most certainly does not wish to be friends with the woman who wrecked her marriage. But nor does she want to confront Hayley. ‘No, I have never discussed what happened with her,’ she says softly. ‘What would it achieve? I’m not a confrontational person and I don’t see the point in holding a grudge.’ So if that means congratulating Hayley on a win next week, Emma says she will take it in her stride. ‘It would be unprofessional to let outside factors get in the way, I have moved on,’ she says. ‘It’s all too easy for people to tune into racing and assume that I am the token blonde, that I’m some kind of bimbo. But I’ve been brought up in this world, my parents were successful trainers and I know a lot about this business. ‘I work incredibly hard at being good at my job and looking after my children, those are my priorities.’ Emma insists she and her former husband are now on good terms, saying: ‘Of course when he is in a race I will be cheering him on.’ Head to head: Former lovers Hayley Turner, left, and Jamie Spencer are set to compete at Royal Ascot . Jamie and Hayley split up soon after the affair was discovered. And Hayley has said that marriage and children are ‘not high on my list of priorities right now’. Meanwhile there is the pressing issue of what to wear for Royal Ascot. Viewers often tune in to see what Emma is wearing and are critical if they see the same outfit twice. She says she ‘loves fashion’, adding: ‘Unfortunately, I don’t get a clothing allowance from Channel 4, so weeks like Royal Ascot can be incredibly expensive. I always have at least eight outfits with me and last year I was running into the Royal Enclosure when I was stopped by an official who said my dress was too short. Rather than argue, I raced to my car, did a quick change and managed to get back in time for my interviews. This year I’ve made sure everything is on the knee. Being banned from the Royal Enclosure would be just too embarrassing!’ For all Emma’s upbeat attitude, she is clearly feeling the strain of being a single mother. She juggles covering the flat racing season with looking after the three children. They live in an 11,000 sq ft house in Newmarket, while Jamie has the ex-marital home, three miles away. ‘Having two parents living apart is difficult’, she concedes. ‘But the children seem to be coping, it is all they have known since they were very little.

"By . Andrew Levy . A mother has finally received an apology from health chiefs – four years after her premature baby was left to die in her arms by a hospital. Tracy Godwin was left cradling her tiny son, Tom, for 46  minutes until he stopped breathing as staff ignored her desperate pleas for help. He had been born at 22 weeks, but Miss Godwin was not told that the hospital did not resuscitate babies born before 23 weeks. If she had known, she could have gone to another hospital, which might have tried to help her child. Memory box: First-time mother Tracy Godwin, 34, cradled her newborn son Tom in her arms until he died . A coroner has now ruled that Southend Hospital in Essex made a series of errors in its care of mother and son. Miss Godwin, whose relationship with Tom’s father collapsed after the tragedy, said she was ‘ecstatic’ with the result but added: ‘It doesn’t bring Tom back.’ ‘It has been an incredibly difficult four years since the death of my baby boy in horrendous circumstances,’ she said. ‘I have finally received an apology and the coroner has found that the trust failed in its care of me and my baby. This ordeal has brought about significant change at the hospital, and the fact that no other mother will go through what I went through is a positive I will cherish. Sadness: Miss Godwin has since received an unreserved apology from the hospital, which has fully accepted its failings and put in place stringent new guidelines and training to ensure this never happens again . ‘I want mothers-to-be up and down the country to be aware of my case and the fact that each trust has its own guidelines.’ Miss Godwin, 34, of Oldmead, near Southend, was having a  normal pregnancy until March 4, 2010, when she developed excruciating stomach pains. Southend . Hospital said it could not help babies born under 23 weeks because . their quality of life would be impaired if they were resuscitated. One . in every nine babies in Britain is born either sick or premature - . before 37 weeks of gestation, according to the charity Bliss. Only . 9 per cent born in the 23rd week of pregnancy survive, and just 14 per . cent of 23-week babies live after being resuscitated. It . is routine practice in Britain to resuscitate babies born between 23 . and 25 weeks, but individual NHS Trusts can decide their own policies on . babies born at 22 to 23 weeks. In . other countries such as Holland, there is a policy not to intervene . with babies born at 23 weeks and let them die a dignified death. She was put in a private room at Southend Hospital and when staff told her the baby might arrive early she begged them to do everything they could to keep it alive. After three days a midwife broke her waters with what Miss Godwin believes was a large pair of scissors and she gave birth to her 1lb son shortly afterwards. Describing the traumatic experience, she said: ‘They put him in my arms and he cried and was  wriggling around. I could feel him breathing and see his eyelashes and toes. ‘But I kept thinking, “Where’s the incubator?” We were begging the midwives to do something to help him but no one was saying anything. He was not stillborn, he was trying to live. ‘If they had tried for an hour and said they couldn’t do anything more for him or he was severely brain-damaged that would have been different, but he wasn’t given a chance.’ The inquest at Chelmsford  Coroner’s Court heard that Miss Godwin was not told of the resuscitation policy until six weeks later during a meeting with senior staff. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray last week recorded a verdict of death from natural causes and said failings in the care provided ‘did not affect the outcome’. Babies born at 22 weeks have about a  1 per cent chance of survival. Following her ordeal, Miss Godwin has given birth to a daughter, Isla, at a different hospital. She also arrived prematurely, at 24 weeks, but is now a healthy little girl. Let down: Tom was delivered 22 weeks and two days into her pregnancy at Southend Hospital (pictured) Miss Godwin received undisclosed damages from  Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in January. It has since introduced reforms including annual training for staff on procedures. Chief nurse Sue Hardy said: ‘We again offer our sincere condolences to Miss Godwin on the loss of her baby. Since that time we have  carried out a great deal of work to improve our internal policy for babies born prematurely.’ Payout: Tracy Godwin (right) with her solicitor Johanne Turner (left), a clinical negligence partner at BMTK .","Tracy Godwin, 34, cradled her newborn son Tom in her arms until he died .

"By . Damien Gayle . The death toll from the factory building collapse in Bangladesh could reach as much as 1,400, it emerged today. As many as 900 workers are still missing six days after the reinforced concrete of Rana Plaza in Savar, near Dhaka, crumbled around them. Around 3,000 workers - mainly young women who made cheap clothes for the likes of Primark and Matalan  - had gone to work in the eight-storey building last Wednesday morning, despite huge cracks appearing in the walls the day before. Clearing the rubble: Rescue workers use heavy machinery to clear the wreckage of the eight-storey Rana Plaza, where the death toll is expected to leap as high as 1,400 as they discover bodies trapped inside . Grim search: Around 3,000 workers - mainly young women - had gone to work in the eight-storey building last Wednesday morning, despite huge cracks appearing in the walls the day before . The official death toll is at least 386, but that number is expected to be upgraded sharply as authorities take into account those who they believe remain trapped, dead beneath the rubble. Police have been given 15 days to quiz the building's owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, a leader of the ruling Awami League's youth front, who was arrested on Sunday as he tried to flee to India. Officers from Bangladesh's elite Rapid Action Battalion seized Rana in the Bangladesh border town of Benapole. He is being held on charges of negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work. His father, Abdul Khaleque, was also arrested on suspicion of aiding Rana to force people to work in a dangerous building. Emergency workers hauling large concrete slabs from the scene of the catastrophe - Bangladesh's worst ever industrial accident - said today they expect to find many dead bodies when they reach the ground floor. Hundreds of bystanders remain at the site, waiting for news of missing relatives, holding their pictures and identity cards as they watch cranes lifting sections of ceilings and floors from the rubble. Emergency workers in hard hats used drilling and cutting machines to break up the slabs into manageable pieces. Property tycoon Sohel Rana was arrested by Bangladesh police while apparently trying to flee the country over the collapse of the Primark garment factory . Mahmud Ali of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society said many more bodies are believed trapped under the rubble of the building, judging by stench of decomposing flesh. Ratna Akhtar, looking for her husband at a nearby school ground turned makeshift morgue, cried: 'Give me my husband back. At least I want to see his dead body if not alive.' The eight storeys of the illegally constructed Rana Plaza collapsed in a heap last Wednesday, trapping thousands of workers from five garment factories inside. The collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit Bangladesh's garment industry, which is worth £13billion a year and supplies High Street retailers throughout the West. Bosses at high street giant Primark have said they will pay compensation to the families of their workers who were killed and injured in the accident. The budget clothing chain occupied a floor of the eight-storey building, and some of the workers injured and killed in the incident worked for a company that supplied the brand. Still working through the night: Emergency workers hauling large concrete slabs from the scene of the catastrophe said today they expect to find many dead bodies when they reach the ground floor . Catastrophe: The eight storeys of the illegally constructed Rana Plaza collapsed in a heap last Wednesday, trapping thousands of workers from five garment factories inside . Roughly 2,900 workers have been accounted for so far - about 2,500 survivors and the 386 dead. It is not clear how many people worked in other offices in the building which also housed a bank and many shops. Brigadier General Ali Ahmed Khan, chief of the fire brigade at the scene, said there was now little hope of finding anyone else alive. 'Our men went inside and saw some dead bodies in the ground floor. But no one was seen alive,' he said. In another sign no more survivors are expected, the waiting ambulances that had rushed the rescued to hospitals since the start of the disaster are now gone. Police say as many as 900 people are still . missing in the aftermath of the collapse. This woman is one of nine . survivors who were pulled from the rubble yesterday . Hope: A survivor is carried into an ambulance while surrounded by onlookers, after being rescued from the garment factory building that collapsed Wednesday in Savar, near Dhaka, Bangladesh . Rana, the building's owner, was yesterday brought to the Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrates' Court in a bullet-proof vest, and led away to an unknown detention place after the magistrate granted a police request to hold him longer before filing formal charges. The crimes he is accused of carry a maximum punishment of seven years. More charges could be added later. Rana had permission to build a five-storey building but added three more floors illegally. Huge cracks had appeared in the building on April 23 but Rana told tenants it was safe to go in. Bosses at high street giant Primark have said they will pay compensation to the families of their workers involved in the Bangladesh building collapse that took the lives of 400 people. The budget clothing chain occupied a floor of the eight-storey building, and some of the workers injured and killed in the incident worked for a company that supplied the brand. In a statement released on its website, a Primark spokesman said: 'Primark's team in Bangladesh has been working to put in place immediate and long-term help for victims of this disaster. 'We have partnered with a local NGO to address the immediate needs of victims, including the provision of emergency food aid to families. This initiative began in Bangladesh immediately (when) the extent of the disaster became clear. 'Primark will also pay compensation to the victims of this disaster who worked for its supplier. This will include the provision of long-term aid for children who have lost parents, financial aid for those injured and payments to the families of the deceased.' Primark said it would be 'reviewing our commitments constantly' to ensure they meet the needs of the victims, and also urged other retailers who used suppliers based in the building to offer assistance. Ruth Tanner, campaigns and policy director at the anti-poverty charity War on Want, said: 'If UK high street chains like Primark had put in place proper measures to ensure the workers who make their clothes are safe, these deaths could have been avoided. 'While Primark has taken some responsibility, the retailer and the other companies involved must pay full compensation, including loss of earnings, sign the Bangladesh Fire and Safety Agreement and ensure such a disaster never happens again.' A bank and some first-floor shops closed after police ordered an evacuation. But managers of the garment factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts. Police have also arrested four owners of three factories. The death toll in last Wednesday's collapse has already surpassed a fire five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed in Bangladesh. 'I think it is a wakeup call for the nation, a wakeup call for the industry and for the trade unions,' said Shirin Akter, president of Karmojibi Nari, a Dhaka-based group that lobbies for the rights of women at work. Hundreds of angry workers poured into the streets in the Dhaka suburb of Ashulia and set fire to an ambulance yesterday, the Independent TV network reported. They also tried to set fire to a factory, it said. The authorities shut down all garment factories in the Ashulia and Gazipur industrial suburbs, including one that had reportedly developed cracks and was evacuated earlier. Bangladesh's garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Primark has acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza. It said in a statement yesterday that it is providing emergency aid and will pay compensation to victims who worked for its supplier. 'Primark notes the fact that its supplier shared the building with those of other retailers. We are fully aware of our responsibility. We urge these other retailers to come forward and offer assistance,' it said. Canadian company Loblaw, which also got its Joe Fresh clothing line made in Rana Plaza, said it will ensure that victims and their families 'receive benefits now and in the future.' Spokesman Julija Hunter said the company is still working out the details, but plans to deliver support 'in the best and most meaningful way possible.' Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorised to be made in the facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorised production.","Official death toll is at least 386, but 900 workers remain unaccounted for .

"By . Laura Topham . Professor Gordon Carlson said: 'Patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them' A quarter of patients who develop a digestive complication after surgery needlessly suffer ‘a harrowing death’ due to an NHS postcode lottery, a leading surgeon has claimed. Approximately 600 people suffer acute intestinal failure in NHS hospitals every year, leading to 150 deaths, according to NHS surveys. The condition usually occurs as a result of an operation on  the abdomen, such as removal of a cancer or even after appendicitis, leading to parts of the gut unexpectedly failing. This triggers a cascade of complications, resulting in the need for intensive care. Later, patients may be discharged home but require drip-feeding and full-time personal care. Yet everyone who had  surgery for the condition at the National Intestinal Failure Centre in Salford, Greater Manchester, has survived in the past three years, indicating that deaths are avoidable. ‘Whether or not you die of this complication is a postcode lottery,’ says Professor Gordon Carlson, consultant surgeon at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. ‘Often patients will succumb quite quickly, but others have months of harrowing illness, and one patient was in hospital for two years. It’s a horrible situation. ‘Patients could have better recovery and survival if more specialised centres like ours existed for treating them. At the moment there is a one in four chance of  a slow, painful and undignified death if you develop this problem. Our success rates show this need not be the case.’ The Salford team claim their success rate is due to a large, dedicated staff, with one consultant surgeon and two nurses to every five patients. Rates of intestinal failure are rising steadily, due to the ageing population having more complex surgical procedures. More patients survive life-threatening illnesses but are then left debilitated. While exact figures do not exist, acute intestinal failure is estimated to affect about ten people per million. Some 600 people are in hospital with the condition at any one time. The Salford team (Salford Royal Hospital pictured) claim their success rate is due to a large, dedicated staff, with one consultant surgeon and two nurses to every five patients . The National Intestinal Failure Centre treats around 220 patients at home, fed via drips, and between 20 and 25 in hospital at any one time, or about 75 a year. The staff also includes dieticians, physiotherapists, pharmacists and psychologists. Its treatment advances have attracted international recognition and were presented at the annual President’s Meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. There is one other intestinal failure centre in the UK, at  St Mark’s Hospital in Harrow, West London. Treating people in such centres could also reduce costs as most patients have been in hospital for many months. ‘Although patients are often in hospital with us, that represents the end of the treatment process, and they’d otherwise be in hospital longer somewhere else and they require a significant cost and huge effort to treat,’ says Prof Carlson. The other intestinal failure centre is at St Mark's Hospital in Harrow . ‘One patient had been in hospital for two years and the average is usually some months – plus it’s not unusual for them to have had a large number of operations before they come to us which have failed to address the problem.’ The human intestine. Approximately 600 people a year suffer from acute intestinal failure in NHS hospitals . A 2008 review of treating intestinal failure recommended a network of intestinal failure centres be set up. But that has not happened. Prof Carlson adds: ‘If you live near an intestinal failure unit you are more likely to get referred to one.’ One reason for the Salford’s centre’s low death rate is the low level of infection. ‘The ability to look after a central feeding line put into a patient’s heart over a prolonged period without it getting infected is crucial – nationally ten per cent used will lead to an infection, but  in our unit  there has not been a single infection in 15 years in any of our patients. ‘The condition is very serious but the size of team needed to get the patient through that is just not available everywhere. ‘It’s not that different to doing transplant surgery: you  wouldn’t go to your local hospital for a heart transplant, you’d go to a specialist centre.’ He says: ‘The ideal would be patients able to access that level of support and expertise within 100 miles of their own home rather than travelling from all over the UK to our centre.’ One patient saved by the Salford unit is retired salesman Paul Pringle, 65. A routine removal of a cancerous polyp in 2006 left him in hospital for nine months with intestinal failure. He developed pelvic abscesses and peritonitis, then an open wound in his stomach. The married father-of-two from Lancashire was eventually transferred to the Salford centre and saved by a complex, 16-hour operation that removed the damaged bowel and filled in the stomach holes by taking tissue from his legs. A spokesman for NHS  England said: ‘Commissioners are currently working with clinical experts to ensure that services across the country reflect the national standard and deliver the best possible services for all patients with these conditions.’","Prof Gordon Carlson consultant at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Gerri Peev . Furious: Charities are angry George Osborne is planning to cap tax relief on donations . Charities went to war with Downing Street last night after wealthy donors were branded tax dodgers. No 10 said many are giving money to bogus charities, some of them abroad, to claim income tax relief and wipe out their liabilities. But furious charities said the accusations – for which Downing Street has produced no evidence – were a desperate attempt to justify George Osborne’s plan to cap tax relief on donations. More than 800 charities, including Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Care, have signed up to a campaign called ‘Give it Back George’ to persuade the Chancellor to drop his plans, outlined in the Budget. They warned that the cap, set at 25 per cent of a donor’s income if he or she is giving more than £50,000, will hurt already struggling charities. Last night Dame Stephanie Shirley, who has given away £60million herself, accused the Government of ‘a cack-handed assault on philanthropic giving’. Dame Stephanie, who runs a group called Ambassadors for Philanthropy, said the charity sector would lose ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’ a year. In an open letter to David Cameron, she said: ‘These plans are already discouraging major giving, with donors informing charities privately of their intention to put on hold plans to give five-, six- or even seven-figure sums. ‘They will, if enacted, significantly hamper the work of many charities, large and small, as almost half of all giving comes from just 7 per cent of donors.’ The Government’s claims that there is a widespread problem with the wealthy  funnelling cash to bogus charities was quickly shot down by the Charity Commission. The watchdog, which registers charities and investigates claims of wrongdoing, said it had never been contacted by the Treasury about the issue. Cancer Research UK is one of 800 charities which has backed a 'Give it Back George' campaign . The ‘charity tax’ is the latest public relations disaster to hit the Government as a result of the Budget, following the unpopular ‘granny tax’ to freeze tax allowances for pensioners and the ‘pasty tax’ to put VAT on hot snacks. David Cameron's official spokesman accused major charitable donors of 'exploiting' the system to pay less tax . The Chancellor went on the attack yesterday, saying he was ‘shocked to see that some of the very wealthiest people in the country had organised their tax affairs so that they were regularly paying virtually no income tax.’ David Cameron’s official spokesman . then accused major charitable donors of ‘exploiting’ the system to pay . less in tax than the average family. ‘In certain instances they may be . giving to charities and those charities don’t, in all cases, do a great . deal of charitable work,’ the spokesman said. Government . officials said the Chancellor had been shown examples by Revenue and . Customs officials of wealthy people who have thrown lavish ‘footballers’ wives’ style parties and then claimed that they were charitable . fundraisers to get tax relief. Taxpayers may claim relief on donations made to any charity based in the EU. But . charities and critics said that if the Government wants to stamp out . abuse it should close loopholes rather than impose a blanket cap that . will hurt some of Britain’s best-loved charities. John . Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation, said: . ‘Philanthropists who make large donations give away far, far more than . they could ever claim in tax relief. ‘We should recognise and celebrate them,  not brand them wealthy tax dodgers.’ The foundation said the biggest 100 donors, who will be hit hardest by the plans, handed over £1.67billion last year, an average of £17million each. Charities, including WaterAid, claim they will suffer under the cap, which will leave them struggling to survive . Chris Bain, director of Catholic charity Cafod, said: ‘Mr Osborne is using a sledgehammer to crack an over-exaggerated nut. ‘It cannot make sense to punish the vast majority of honest charities and philanthropists for the supposed actions of a minority. ‘It is insulting for the Treasury to brand Britain’s many great charitable givers tax avoiders. We hope the Chancellor will listen to reason and rethink this ill-judged, ill-designed tax.’ Laws introduced only last year already crack down on ‘tainted donors’, tycoons who funnel money into charitable trusts that ultimately benefit them. Another law imposed a ‘fit and proper test’, meaning that if a donor wants to claim tax relief for a charity abroad, it has to be rubber-stamped as a genuine charity by the UK authorities. John Hemming, chairman of Charities Tax Group, which advises charities on tax, said: ‘If this cap has been designed to tackle abuse, I’m surprised they don’t feel comfortable with the legislation they have only recently implemented.’ The Treasury has promised to discuss how to minimise the effects of the plan on charities. More than 800 charities have put their names to the Give it Back George campaign . But Treasury minister David Gauke held meetings with charities last week and sources said he ‘did not budge one inch’. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Reliefs exist for good reason but it is not right that wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce their income tax bills to close to zero, often year after year. ‘There will still be tax relief for donations  to charity. ‘We remain committed to supporting philanthropy, which is why we are proactively exploring with philanthropists ways to ensure this new limit will not significantly impact upon charities that depend on large donations.’","Downing St say many are giving money to bogus charities .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Parts of Britain are now poorer than Poland, Lithuania and Hungary, official figures reveal. People in the Welsh Valleys and Cornwall - Britain’s two poorest areas - scrape by on less than £14,300 a year on average. Because Britain is so expensive, this leaves families in these areas worse off than those vast swathes of Eastern Europe, according to an EU study. In much of the UK, people's incomes are well below the EU average - in some areas by as much as a third. In the map (above) Britain's poorest regions are highlighted, showing how far below the European average incomes have fallen. The Cornish, for example, are 36 per cent less well-off than the EU norm. Families in Slovenia meanwhile are just 16 per cent poorer - and in Portugal 23 per cent. In Lincolnshire and Durham, the next two poorest areas in Britain, people live on less than £16,500 a year. This puts them in the same bracket as Estonians and rural Poles, once prices are taken into account. Britain as a whole fares a little better, with average earnings of £23,300 - just over the EU average of £20,750. But this still leaves us out of the top 10 wealthiest countries in the EU. And this figure is propped up by Europe’s runaway richest region – inner London. In the heart of the capital the average GDP per person is £71,000 a year. This is 321 per cent of the average across the EU, according to Brussels’s official statistics arm Eurostat. While Britain is home to Europe's richest city, most of the country is poorer than the Continent . London is far and away Europe's capital of cash - with incomes 300% the EU average . Here are the top 10 richest cities: . But central London’s soaring wealth has failed to trickle down to much of the rest of the country, the figures suggest. Britain’s . seven most hard-up areas - including Lancashire, Leicestershire, South . Yorkshire and Staffordshire - are poorer than ANY region in Belgium, . Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, . Sweden and Austria. The . region of “West Wales and the Valleys” is now in the top five poorest . areas in Western Europe - with families HALF as wealthy as their German . counterparts on average. The . only parts of Britain matching Germany for wealth – outside central . London – are “Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Oxfordshire” and oil-rich . “North East Scotland” around Aberdeen. But even England’s second wealthiest area – with average incomes of £32,000 – fails to make it into Europe’s top 20 rich league. Only North East Scotland, with an average GDP per person of £33,000, sneaks into Europe’s Premier League of wealth. Eurostat, which is Brussels’ equivalent of the Office for National Statistics, measures wealth across the EU using a measure known as 'purchasing power standards'. This aims to measure GDP per person but also 'takes into account differences in national price levels', to give a more realistic idea of how much the cash in people’s pockets is actually worth. On this basis, four of the UK’s 37 regions struggle by on less than 75 per cent of the average EU earnings, alongside 15 in Poland, nine in Greece, seven in the Czech Republic and Romania, six in Hungary and five in Bulgaria and Italy. Towns in Britain are not only being left behind by wealthy parts of the South East - but also by much of the Continent, including former Communist countries in Eastern Europe like Krakow (above, right) Former mining villages, like Easington Colliery in County Durham (pictured left) are now poorer than booming cities in Eastern Europe like Vilnius (right) in Lithuania . Alongside Britain Portugal also has four poverty regions. Slovakia has three, Spain two and Croatia and Slovenia one each. Families . in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – which are so small that they each . only count as a single region – also live on less than 75 per cent of the EU . average, according to the figures. Overall, there are just eight regions of the UK wealthier than the EU average. The remaining 29 areas are poorer. The . Valleys and Cornwall are in the top 50 poorest regions of the whole of . Europe – and in the top 10 deprived areas of Western Europe, according . to the purchasing power league table. Eleven regions have incomes at least 20 per cent below the European average. Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie told MailOnline the figures were a wake up call for Britain. He said: 'No other European country would tolerate such a gap between its rich and poor regions. 'To allow so many parts of the country to fall behind not only London, but most of Europe, is shocking. We've got to take more action to have balanced prosperity. 'The challenge of the next few years is to help these parts of the country that have been left neglected.' The Labour MP added: 'It is shocking to think parts of Britain are now poorer than Poland and other areas of Eastern Europe. 'When you start to take into account the prices people are having to pay in these areas - especially after seeing their incomes squeezed for years now - the contrast with Europe is even more stark.' Whole streets in some of Britain's great towns and cities, like this one in Salford, have been abandoned. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said successive British governments had ran the economy for the benefit of the City - neglecting the rest of the country. He said: 'Many of the poorest places in Britain are places that have europe-style big government. In Wales and the North East of England, the public sector is a huge chunk of the economy. 'If you are going to manage the economy like Europe, don't be surprised if you get European levels of wealth.' Mr Carswell claimed there was a 'liberal metropolitan bias' in Westminster against areas outside London. He said: 'For about 40 years we have been running our currency and our economy for the benefit of finance. This causes a huge distortion. We are basically subsidising Porsches and property in West London.'","Seven areas of Britain poorer than ANYWHERE in France or Germany .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A millionaire businessman extradited to the US for arms dealing is back at home with his family after being released. Christopher Tappin, 67, from Orpington, south London, has been released from a London prison after he was transferred from the US in September last year. In November 2012 he pleaded guilty to selling batteries used in Hawk Air Defence Missiles to Iran and was given a 33-month sentence and ordered to pay a fine of $11,357 (£6,693). Businessman Christopher Tappin, 67, who was jailed in 2013 for arms dealing, is back home in Orpington, south London, (pictured) after serving time in both the US and UK . Tappin was accused of using his company to ship five batteries used in missiles to Iran via the Netherlands. He was extradited to the US in February 2012 (pictured) and jailed in January 2013 . Before that Tappin spent 20 months fighting extradition, which cost him £500,000 in lawyers' fees, according to an interview in The Times. Daughter Georgina Raeburn confirmed her father is home but was not ready to talk about the situation in detail. While in the US Mr Tappin was in a Pennsylvanian prison and before being flown back to England was incarcerated in a New York detention centre which was 'teeming with rats', according to his lawyer. He described a harrowing ordeal involving being confined to a windowless room in solitary confinement. A former director of an international freight service and president of Kent Golf Society, the family man maintains his innocence, saying he was trapped in a sting by FBI agents. Mr Tappin believes evidence may have been doctored and he had no choice but to enter a plea bargain with US prosecutors or face spending the rest of his life in jail. Between December 2005 and January 2007 it is believed he knowingly aided and abetted others in an illegal attempt to export certain batteries which are special components of the Hawk Air Defence Missile. The batteries Tappin was accused of shipping can be used in Hawk Air Defence Missiles (pictured) but he says he thought they were destined for the car industry . Now home with his wife, Elaine, he is hoping to fight the 2003 extradition legislation that meant UK courts had no power to prevent him being sent to US shores.

"By . Lizzie Parry . An angler wrestled a giant catfish likened to a 'serpent' from the depths of a lake landing the catch, which at 119 pounds and 6ft long is Britain's biggest freshwater fish. Alex Fanshawe, 32, fought the fish for 15 minutes before hauling his prize ashore - a Wels catfish he nicknamed Duke - with the help of fellow fishermen on the third attempt. The monster catfish is longer nose-to-tail than its captor Mr Fanshawe is tall and was snared during his first trip to Oakwood Park Predator Lakes in Norfolk. Mr Fanshawe, from Ruislip in west London, had just joined the Catfish Conservation Group of freshwater fishermen, when he landed the group's top prize. Angler Alex Fanshawe, 32, battled for 15 minutes wrestling a giant catfish - 'The Duke' - at the same lake in Thetford, Norfolk. The Duke was thought to be the biggest fish in the lake until Will's catch . He said he was woken by an alarm attached to his reel, alerting him to a fish picking up the bait. He said: 'It was the last morning of the trip when I was awoken from my slumber at 5am by the sound of my alarms and a screaming reel telling me that something big had picked up my bait and was moving off at quite some pace in the opposite direction. 'A few minutes into the fight and this fish wasn’t budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster. 'With the help of some fellow anglers, who had heard the commotion and gathered behind me, we were all able to lift the fish onto the waiting mat on the third attempt. 'I’ve only been catfishing for about a . year, and so far that trip I’d only managed to land a small carp so the . lads were laughing at me. 'A few minutes into the fight and this fish wasn't budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster' - Angler Alex Fanshawe . 'They . weren’t laughing after I caught the Duke though. Before the Duke, the . biggest fish I’ve ever caught was probably only a 5lb catfish. 'I couldn’t believe it. It was like a serpent, when we were pulling it in, it just kept coming out of the water like a serpent.' The carnivorous fish, known as Duke, is well over 30-years-old, and is the second biggest freshwater fish ever caught. Mr Fanshawe, who works as a DJ, added: 'I stood there in total shock and disbelief. 'To say I was over the moon was an understatement. It was the largest fish I have ever seen on the bank and the most amazing experience of my life. The giant fish, which measures around 6ft from nose to tail, is thought to be the biggest living freshwater fish in Britain . Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish, are found in areas of central, southern and eastern Europe, as well as near the Baltic and Caspian Seas. They are a scaleless fresh and brackish water fish, recognisable by a broad, flat head and wide mouth. They can live for around 30 years and have excellent hearing. Wels catfish feed on insects, crustaceans and other fish, as well as frogs, mice, rats and water birds including ducks. There have been instances where the breed has been spotted lunging from the water to catch pigeons on the shore. They live in large, warm lakes and deep slow-flowing rivers. In rare cases the species can grow up to 13ft and reach more than 400lbs making it the second largest freshwater breed of fish after the beluga sturgeon. 'I’m definitely going to try to catch a . bigger fish, but it may be a problem since I’ve landed the biggest . coarse fish in Britain.' Adrian Hills, from the Catfish Conservation Group, said: 'I think it’s safe to say that Duke is probably Britain’s largest living freshwater fish. Well done, Alex.' Fishing experts The Angling Trust said they too are not aware of a bigger freshwater fish in Britain. A . spokesman said: 'I’m not aware of a bigger freshwater fish. 'It must . have been difficult to land something that is bigger than a person. 'Fifteen minutes is quite a long time in those circumstances. Many bigger fish are landed in much less time.' In 2012, chef James Jones landed a 144lb Wels catfish at a lake in Essex. However, that monster fish has since died. The monster male catfish measured approximately 8ft from nose to tail - and was caught using a bit of mackerel.","Alex Fanshawe caught the Wels catfish at lake near Thetford, Norfolk .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Syrian rebels have surrendered the city of Homs to forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad, bringing a three-year siege of the city by government troops to an end. According to Homs Gov. Talal Baraz, more than 1,500 troops have left the city since Wednesday, giving up their positions in the Old Homs district. The city will be declared 'secure' when government troops move in later today. However, in a show of defiance, rebel forces in Aleppo blew up a hotel being used as a base by government troops after digging tunnels underneath and packing them with explosives. Scroll down for video . Troops loyal to Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad (left) have retaken the city of Homs after rebel forces left as part of an amnesty deal. Green buses arrived today to take the remaining fighters away (right) The governor of Homs said that around 1,500 fighters had left the city, which will be declared 'secure' after government troops move in later today . In retreat: Some of the final rebel fighters to leave pose for a photograph before boarding the bus . The amnesty, which saw fighters bussed out of the city, was brokered by Iran and enforced by the UN . As part of an amnesty deal in Homs, rebel . fighters were taken on green buses out of the city once dubbed the . 'capital of the revolution' after militias seized large parts of it . during the 'Arab spring' in 2011. This afternoon a banner on Syrian TV said the last of the rebels left . the city, proclaiming, 'Old Homs is totally clean of armed terrorist . groups' - the term used by the government for the rebels. As Al-Assad's troops entered the city the extent of destruction caused by two years of continuous fighting was laid bare, with whole neighbourhoods reduced to rubble and building reduced to concrete skeletons. The city was once home to nearly a million people, according to a 2002 census, but its central districts are now virtual ghost towns, littered with twisted metal an broken concrete. While re-taking Homs marks a major victory for Al-Assad, elsewhere in Syria today rebel fighters reduced the once-luxurious Carlton Hotel in Aleppo to dust after digging tunnels underneath it and packing them with explosives. The hotel was being used as a base by government troops at the time, though it was not immediately clear how many died in the attack. War-torn: After being under siege for nearly three years, the centre of Homs has been left in ruins . While there are still rebel soldiers in some of the outskirts of the city, the centre of Homs is now deserted . Troops loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad have now moved into position formerly held by the rebels . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which maintains a . network of activists on the ground, said at least 14 soldiers were . killed in the blast. Islamic Front, the rebel alliance . which claimed responsibility for the attack, claimed to have killed 50 soldiers. The blast set off a gigantic mushroom cloud next to the historic citadel of Aleppo, collapsing the Carlton Hotel in a government-held area near the front lines in the city, which has been one of the bloodiest and destructive battlegrounds of Syria's civil war. While it is not thought the attack was directly linked to the withdrawal from Homs, it is a powerful display by the rebels, showing they can still inflict heavy damage on Al-Assad's forces. In a live broadcast from the site of blast, Syrian state TV's correspondent in Aleppo stood on a pile of rubble, saying that the army had been using the building as a base and soldiers were positioned there at the time of the explosion. The report did not mention casualties as the Syrian government does not reveal the numbers of soldiers killed in the civil war. The correspondent said: 'They [rebels] use tunnels like rats because they cannot face the Syrian Arab Army.' As government forces entered the city, the destruction wrought by three years of conflict became clear with burned out buildings puckered with shell shrapnel . Parts of the city, once dubbed the 'capital of the revolution' when it was seized by militias during the Arab spring in 2011, have been reduced to rubble . According to a 2002 census, the city was once home to a million people, but is now largely deserted . It is not the first time rebels are believed to have used the technique to attack the Carlton. In February part of the building collapsed after fighters allegedly dug underneath the hotel an filled them with explosives. The Front, an alliance of several Islamic groups fighting to topple Assad, has also used the technique to carry out deadly attacks against government forces in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. The city of Aleppo has been carved up into opposition- and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2012, capturing territory along Syria's northern border with Turkey. In recent months, government aircraft . have continuously bombed rebel-held areas of the city and the opposition . fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The . rebels also have detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing . dozens of people. While an amnesty deal is in effect in Homs, elsewhere in Aleppo today rebel forces leveled a hotel being used as a government base after tunneling underneath it and planting explosives . The explosion was described as being 'like an earthquake' by a TV correspondent. It was not immediately clear how many soldiers were killed, and estimates range from 15 to 50 . The Islamic Front posted a statement on its official Twitter account Thursday saying that its 'fighters this morning leveled the Carlton Hotel barracks in Old Aleppo and a number of buildings near it, killing 50 soldiers.' Syria's uprising began with largely peaceful protests and has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones, pitting largely Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government that is dominated by Alawites, a sect of Shiite Islam. Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters and Syrian rebels who have taken up hard-line al-Qaida-style ideologies, have played an increasingly prominent role among fighters, dampening the West's support for the rebellion to overthrow Assad.","Syrian rebel fighters have left the city Homs after a three-year siege .

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 01:35 EST, 29 November 2013 . Accused: Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, is charged with six counts of murder . A former Marine charged with the gory stabbing deaths of six people in California told investigators he targeted homeless people in part because they were vulnerable, and that he believes he has a 'killer gene'. Itzcoatl Ocampo, a 23-year-old Iraq War veteran, was initially arrested for the stabbing deaths of four homeless men earlier this year. Ocampo later confessed to two more murders - the October killings of his high school friend Eder Herrera's mother and brother in Yorba Linda. The revelations come as Ocampo faces six felony counts of murder for allegedly stalking and stabbing his victims in killings authorities said were carried out with a roughly seven-inch military-style blade and that terrorized Orange County's homeless community. Ocampo has pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, Ocampo could face the death penalty. The district attorney has not yet decided whether to seek capital punishment in the case. Ocampo told investigators he started to kill homeless men because they were 'available and vulnerable' and continued stabbing his victims even after believing they were dead, according to the transcript. Ocampo said he looked at Penthouse magazine before the attacks 'to pump himself up,' Wyatt said. 'He seemed to get excited when he was talking about the actual kill,' Wyatt testified. 'So, I asked him if he was aroused by the act of killing.' Scroll down for video . The victims: (L-R) James . McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd . Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus . Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30 . Service: A relative holds a photograph of Itzcoatl posing proudly in his Marines uniform. He was said to have become paranoid and delusional after his deployment . Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old who is the prime suspect in the killings, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be . Ocampo at first questioned the word arousal, according to the transcript, but then added, 'my balls felt like they were going to explode, and I knew that I had the killer gene.' Ocampo was arrested in January after a witness helped chase down a suspect following the stabbing of a fourth homeless victim outside a fast-foot restaurant in Anaheim, about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Ocampo was initially charged with the four murders and prosecutors last month added charges for the Yorba Linda killings. Detectives said Wednesday they saw similarities in the cases of the Yorba Linda deaths and the stabbings of four homeless men in December and January. Detectives focused on the severity of the attacks, the number and the type of wounds, and the proximity of Ocampo's home to the Yorba Linda killings, the Orange County Register reported. Murder weapon: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas holds up picture of a knife similar to the one he accused of being used by Itzcoatl Ocampo in the killings . Normal young man: Itzcoatl Ocampo's family has released these images of the young man, showing him in happier times . Authorities have linked Ocampo to a killing spree targeting four homeless men: James Patrick McGillivray, 53, who was stabbed December 20 near a shopping center in Placentia; Lloyd Middaugh, 42, who was found December 28 near a riverbed trail in Anaheim; Paulus Smit, 57, who was stabbed to death outside a Yorba Linda library on December 30; and John Berry, 64, who was stabbed to death on the day Ocampo was arrested. Each of the four men was stabbed more than 40 times with a weapon believed to be a 7-inch fixed-blade military-type knife, authorities said. Locations: Police in Orange County, California say Ocampo was responsible for four killings since December 2011 . Before Ocampo's January 13 arrest, police had fanned out across the county better known as the home to Disneyland and multi-million dollar beachfront homes to urge the homeless to be careful and seek shelter indoors. Veterans Affairs officials say such high-profile violence can paint an inaccurate picture of returning veterans. His father, Refugio Ocampo, said his son came back from his deployment a changed man. He said his son expressed disillusionment and became ever darker as he struggled to find his way. After Ocampo was discharged in 2010 and returned home, his parents separated.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Put to death: John Ruthell Henry, 63, was executed in Florida at 7.43pm Wednesday for killing his estranged wife and her son in 1985 near Plant City . Florida executed tonight a convicted killer who fatally stabbed his wife and her young son in 1985. It is the third U.S. execution in less than 24 hours since a botched April lethal injection in Oklahoma. The governor's office says John Ruthell Henry, 63, was pronounced dead at 7.43pm Wednesday. The inmate was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally stabbing his wife, 29-year-old Suzanne Henry, a few days before Christmas outside Plant City, Florida. A detective testified at his trial in 1987 that Henry stabbed Suzanne in the neck with a five-inch paring knife and then watched her die while smoking a cigarette, reported Tampa Bay Times. He also was found guilty of murdering his 5-year-old stepson, Eugene Christian, hours after the woman's murder. The toddler was stabbed in the throat five times. Henry previously had pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for stabbing his common-law wife, Patricia Roddy, in 1976 in front of her children, one of whom begged him to stop hurting the woman. He served less than eight years and was released in 1983. Suzanne Henry's relatives told reporters she hadn't known about John Henry's previous killing when she married him after his release. The U.S. Supreme Court turned down a last-second appeal by attorneys who argued Henry wasn't mentally stable enough to comprehend his death sentence. Just before his execution, Henry asked for forgiveness and apologized for what he'd done. 'I can't undo what I've done. If I could, I would. I ask for your forgiveness if you can find it in your heart,' he said.

Tears for a killer: Joan Careford of East Anglea, England, wipes tears from her face as she waits for the execution of John Ruthell Henry, 63, at the Florida State Prison near Starke, Florida . Jessica Carey, spokesperson for the Florida Prisons, told reporters that Henry has refused a last meal but was 'calm' Protesters against the death penalty demonstrate in front of the Florida State Prison June 18 . The state claims . anyone with an IQ of at least 70 is not mentally disabled; testing has . shown Henry's IQ at 78, though his lawyers said it should be . re-evaluated. A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections said Henry has turned down a last meal, and she described his demeanor as 'calm' before the execution. Earlier in the day, Henry was visited by his sister, niece and daughter, as well a Catholic spiritual adviser, said DOC spokeswoman Jessica Cary. ‘Carrying out the sentence of the death penalty is one of our most solemn duties,’ Cary told reporters. ‘[We strive to] carry it out in a dignified and humane manner.’ Dark past: Henry, pictured being led into the Pasco County Courthouse in 1985, was released two years prior after serving eight years for the murder of his common-law wife, Patricia Roddy, in 1976 . Henry was put to death using a combination of three drugs, beginning with midazolam to render him unconscious. After that, the condemned man was injected with vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. John Henry has become the third man to be put to death in the U.S. since April, when officials in Oklahoma botched the lethal injection of Clayton Lockett, who ended up dying from a heart attack. 'I can't undo what I've done. If I could, I would. I ask for your forgiveness if you can find it in your heart.'                                                                 - John Ruthell Henry . The case made international headlines and led to the postponement of nine executions nationwide. The . 63-year-old Floria man's execution Wednesday was preceded by those of . Georgia inmate Marcus Wellons and Missouri convicted killer John . Winfiled, who were put to death Tuesday night. Neither execution had any noticeable complications, and Henry's execution Wednesday also appeared to go normally. Georgia and Missouri both use the single drug pentobarbital, a sedative, whereas Florida uses a three-drug cocktail. Midazolam, . a sedative used before surgery, has only been used in Florida since . October; previously, sodium thiopental was used, but its U.S. manufacturer stopped making it and Europe banned its manufacturers from . exporting it for executions.

Living example: Herman Lindsey, right, hugs a colleague in front of the Florida State Prison. Lindsey was the 23rd person exonerated from Death Row and was part of a group of protestors who waited for Henry's execution . Henry's was be the 13th execution in Florida since April 2013, and the 18th since Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011. Scott on Tuesday brushed aside questions about the state's execution procedures, saying he has to 'uphold the laws of the land.' When asked directly if he had discussed with the Department of Corrections what happened in Oklahoma and whether any changes were needed in Florida, Scott would only say: 'I focus on making sure that we do things the right way here.' During Henry's trial, prosecutors said the unemployed bricklayer went to Suzanne Henry's home three days before Christmas of 1985 to talk about buying a gift for the boy, who was Suzanne's son from a prior relationship. They fought over Henry living with another woman and he stabbed her 13 times in the neck and face. Watershed case: Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett died in April from a heart attack following a botched execution . Prosecutors said Henry then took the boy and drove around for nine hours, sometimes smoking crack cocaine, before stabbing him five times in the neck. Hours later, Henry told a detective, he found himself wandering a field. He later told therapists he had killed the child to reunite him with his mother. Henry tried to use an insanity defense for killing his wife. Psychiatrists at the . trial testified that Henry had a low IQ, suffered from chronic paranoia . and smoked crack. He told them he had intended to commit suicide after . killing the boy but said he was unable to go through with it. In . an appeal the Florida Supreme Court rejected last week, attorney Baya . Harrison III wrote that Henry's 'abhorrent childhood, extensive personal . and family mental health history, poor social adjustment, and lack of . rational thinking and reasoning skills so impaired his adaptive . functioning that he was actually performing at the level of a person . with an IQ of 70.' In May, a panel of mental health experts said .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wondering whether your 'dating' status is about to turn into a relationship? Facebook may have the answer before you do. As part of a couples-themed study undertaken by the social networking giant for Valentines Day, Facebook data scientists analyzed timeline posts between Facebook users who had entered relationships. Study head Carlos Duik said he found that in the 100 days leading up to he day when users change their relationship status, the number of timeline posts increased significantly. Called 'The Formation of Love', the study found that during the 100 days before a relationship starts, there is a slow but steady increase in the number of timeline posts shared between the future couple. However once they get together the posts start to decrease dramatically . Couples interact less with each other on Facebook once they get together, however the posts they do exchange become 'sweeter', a study by the social network giant has found . The amount of exchanges peaked 12 days before the beginning of the relationship change, with 1.67 posts a day, according to Venture Beat. However after that, timeline post activity decreases. 'Presumably, couples decide to spend more time together, courtship is off, and online interactions give way to more interactions in the physical world,' Diuk wrote in a blog post yesterday. Diuk also analyzed how the sentiment of the timeline posts changed over time, and found positive feelings increased significantly around the day when the relationship begins. He said that even though the number of posts exchanged between the couple decreased once they get together, the sentiment of the exchanges became 'sweeter'. This is because of anniversaries and special shared moments, he said. The study involved data mined from some 460,000 couples and 18 million posts, Diuk said. Facebook data scientists found that, even though the number of wall posts goes down once the relationship starts, the wall posts that are exchanged become happier and sweeter . Another part of the couples-themed analysis purports to have determined which American cities are most popular among single people. The top five, in order, were found to be Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Memphis. Facebook data scientist Mike Develin also identified the five cities with the highest probability of a relationship being formed. He said Colorado Springs, Colorado; El Paso, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; Fort Worth, Texas, and San Antonio, Texas. 'In a city where everyone is paired up, the incentive to pair up is even stronger, while cities like New York and Miami are places that people go to be single,' Develin wrote.

"By . Tom Rawstorne . For more than half a century, the sprawling 400-acre site on the outskirts of the Kent town of Sandwich was a world-renowned centre of medical discovery. There, housed within laboratories bursting with high-tech equipment, a 2,500-strong team of scientists researched and developed drugs that would treat everything from tropical diseases to erectile dysfunction. Today, three years after the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer handed that army of brilliant minds their P45s, the site is now a business park where the breaking news is the imminent arrival of a Sainsbury’s supermarket. Sandwich in Kent, where thousands of highly skilled people were hired to work in the town's Pfizer pharmaceutical plant . While the 200 jobs it will bring are not to be sniffed at, it goes without saying that they will not be of the same calibre — or pay-grade — as those that went before. And while the locals might find the out-of-town store convenient, that will not compensate for the economic impact the closure of the Pfizer plant has had on the economy of Sandwich. Across this historic town, everything from hotels to bookshops, from the summer festival to the Christmas decorations, was hit by the American corporation’s decision to slash its British operation to the bone in 2011. It is against this background that residents view Pfizer’s latest assault on a British company — and needless to say, they view it with a healthy degree of scepticism. Last week, the U.S. company tabled a  £63 billion bid for AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-biggest pharmaceutical company. If it goes ahead, it would represent the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a UK firm. But there are growing concerns over what the deal would mean for British workers, and for the crucial research and development work they carry out. The US drug company hit the headlines when it created its anti-impotence drug Viagra . In a bid to address these fears, Pfizer’s chief executive Ian Read wrote to the PM to guarantee jobs while pledging to complete a substantial research and development facility in Cambridge. But while David Cameron welcomed the assurances as ‘robust’, there is widespread concern that his position may be compromised by the fact that Pfizer’s PR and lobbying campaign is being led by a firm chaired by a close friend. Back in Sandwich, Mark Moorhouse, a town councillor and chair of the local Chamber of Commerce, says: ‘When Pfizer left it was devastating for the town. Now we are hearing rhetoric about them wanting to invest in Britain again. ‘But how can there be all this talk when they had a perfectly good bespoke site here which they suddenly decided to pull out of? For a lot of people, it simply doesn’t make sense.’ Take a stroll through the winding streets of Sandwich and beside the tea-rooms and antique shops, and you’ll find that the scars left by Pfizer are still raw. In King Street, a stunning Grade II-listed shop stands empty but for some of the original Edwardian fixtures and fittings. Until three years ago, it was home to a highly successful independent bookstore employing four people. But when Pfizer announced it was to slash its workforce, the store ran into difficulties almost overnight. ‘Pfizer employees accounted for 30 to 40 per cent of our sales and we saw a slump after they announced the closure,’ said then-owner Louise Vance. ‘My friends from the company said they were sorry, but the situation was so uncertain they had stopped spending until they knew their fate.’ Further evidence of what exactly their ‘fate’ would be can be seen at the site of the former Pfizer facility on the outskirts of Sandwich. Today it has been renamed Discovery Park and relaunched as a ‘global hub for science, technology, business and enterprise’. The US pharmaceutical giant is trying to take over their British rival AstraZeneca leading to fears that even more highly-skilled British jobs could be lost . But while it has had some success in attracting new companies into the area, the void left by Pfizer is plain for all to see. Once, this was the largest pharmaceutical research centre outside the U.S., but today huge empty car parks bear testimony to what happened on February 1, 2011. ‘On that day we had a town council meeting about the Open Golf Championship coming to Sandwich that year,’ recalls Mr Moorhouse. ‘But as soon as the news broke it spread around the town in an instant. So what should have been a meeting with a celebratory mood became like a morgue — the impact was immediate.’ Pfizer's former headquarter building in Sandwich, Kent, where Viagra was discovered . Initially, it was believed Pfizer would shut down the facility completely. But while in the end some 650 staff were retained at Sandwich, it wasn’t just the people that Pfizer employed directly whose livelihoods were threatened. Mr Moorhouse estimates that some 3,000 people indirectly depended on the company for the lions’ share of their income — everyone from cleaning contractors to taxi firms. ‘I remember going out for a curry to celebrate my birthday about a week before Pfizer made the announcement, and the local Indian was packed with people from Pfizer,’ says Mr Moorhouse. ‘Without their business, the pubs and restaurants, in particular, have seen a big dip in their takings.’Among those to have suffered is Chris Ash, owner of the Fisherman’s Wharf restaurant, on the Quay by the River Stour, the closest restaurant to the Pfizer site. ‘It was all very sudden when they went,’ he said. ‘There were no rumours or talk beforehand. So the town was taken aback by what happened. They were a wealthy company who were very generous and then suddenly it stopped. We got a lot of people in for lunch and dinner — particularly business lunches — so we felt the full draught of the exodus. ‘The main problem here is we have 28 pubs and restaurants all competing for a smaller cake, and for the first six months we very definitely felt the loss of trade ... our profits for December were down 25 per cent because Pfizer had around a dozen Christmas parties here.’ Heather Lemoine, landlady of the Admiral Owen pub, also said business had suffered — and not just behind the bar. ‘The biggest effect has been on the buy-to-let housing market,’ she said. ‘A lot of people bought houses and rented them out to Pfizer people. When Pfizer went, the rental incomes disappeared.’ The company is seeking approval to buy AstraZeneca . Like others in Sandwich, she has been following Pfizer’s takeover bid with interest. And she is unconvinced by the promise to invest in a combined Pfizer-Astra research centre in Cambridge. ‘Why did they build a “mini-city” here and then just go?’ she asks. ‘I fear the same thing might happen in Cambridge.’ Financial analysts would answer her question by pointing out that Pfizer has not achieved global success without being ruthless. It is a point made by John Bragg, a one-time Pfizer scientist and former mayor of Sandwich, who is currently a town councillor. He helped set up Pfizer’s first lab in 1955 and says the decision to shut Sandwich reflects a no-nonsense approach to making money. ‘They hadn’t had anything new out of Sandwich for ten years, and Pfizer are not a company to reinforce failure,’ said Mr Bragg. ‘You don’t keep things going which are losing money for you, so what were they to do? ‘Of course we made our representations to Pfizer at the time and they explained that it was part of a global policy, that they were reducing hugely the amount of money they were spending on research. They didn’t do that because there was successful research going on, it was because there wasn’t.’And what about Cambridge, might the same happen there? Mr Bragg thinks it is ‘improbable’ that Pfizer would not carry through with the initial investment, but adds that if, in ten years, the facility was not delivering it would be ‘a different story’. And he, like his fellow residents, knows just how big an impact that can have on every aspect of a local community. ‘We were proud of the fact that the company had such a presence in Sandwich — they did have a profound effect on the whole of the area,’ he says. ‘Not only did they employ a lot of people, who had a lot of money to spend locally, but there was also a knock-on effect socially because these people were involved in all sorts of activities in the town.’ Not only did Pfizer sponsor the Christmas lights and the tourist information bureau, it gave financial support to the town’s popular summer festival. When Pfizer left, those holes had to be filled. Of course, the biggest hole was that which the departing staff left behind on the outskirts of Sandwich — their offices, laboratories and support facilities. While the remaining 650 Pfizer staff still occupy a corner of the site, the rest of the business park is far from full. With support from central government the plan is to create 3,000 jobs there by 2017. So far, it has achieved less than half that number, with a few more to come if the new Sainsbury’s is given the green light. ‘Sainsbury’s will play a key role in regenerating the site and help achieve the vision for Discovery Park to become a world-leading employment location and a pioneer of innovation, providing a range of great benefits to Sandwich,’ said Discovery Park managing director Paul Barber, somewhat predictably. Nice spin, but for the people of Sandwich it will take more than words to forget the day they discovered how big business really works: a lesson that should not be buried beneath Pfizer’s billions, or its promises to AstraZeneca and the Government as it tries to wrest control.","Pfizer employed 2,500 research scientists in their plant in Sandwich, Kent .

"By . James Chapman . Secrets: The Iraq report cannot be published until the issue of documents sent between Tony Blair and George Bush have been resolved by the involved parties . Tony Blair was blamed yesterday for a delay in publishing an official report into the Iraq War. Norman Baker, a Home Office minister, accused the former premier of trying to block the release of secret communications between him and George W Bush. He has told Sir John Chilcot, who is heading the inquiry, of his deep concern at the length of time it is taking. A letter from the former Whitehall mandarin – seen by the Daily Mail – shows that publication of notes sent by Mr Blair to former US president Bush, and records of their conversations, is an issue. 'We continue to work toward delivering our report to the Prime Minister at the earliest possible date,’ he told Mr Baker, adding that discussions ‘about the disclosure of sensitive documents are not yet concluded’. Mr Baker said he was dismayed by Sir John’s confirmation that Mr Blair’s messages to the White House are causing a delay. ‘The way the Blair government handled the Iraq war is perhaps the most shameful episode in the history of our democracy,’ he said. ‘The fact Tony Blair appears now to be holding up the proper release of information is a disgrace. ‘We need the Chilcot inquiry report now – we need it out before the general election. ‘Voters are entitled to know what was done in their name. Tony Blair should stop blocking the release of this information and Sir John should not allow the timetable in his inquiry to be dictated by the former prime minister.’ David Cameron said last year he hoped the difficulties surrounding publication of the conclusions would be ‘concluded as soon as possible’. But the declassification of key documents - and the process that requires individuals criticised in a government-commissioned report to have a chance to comment - remain stalled. In a letter to Sir John, Mr Baker said he . was ‘very concerned that your final conclusions have yet to see the . light of day’ and pointed out that it was ‘more than a decade since the . Iraq war occurred and therefore operational sensitivities must be long . gone’. He added: ‘Given the huge controversy . of the episode in British life, I think it is very important that all . the facts are now made public and the potential for individual . embarrassment should not be allowed to get in the way of this . objective.’ The details of the decision to go to war have not been aired more than a decade after thousands protested . Mr Baker asked if it was true, as has been claimed, that the delay centered around the release of correspondence between Mr Blair and Mr Bush. Sir John said he was ‘able to confirm that the sensitive documents under discussion include notes send by Mr Blair to President Bush, and records of conversations between the UK Prime Minister and the President of the United States... I regret that I am unable to answer your question about the involvement of the former Prime Minister...’ Gordon Brown asked Sir John to investigate the conflict in 2009 and he last took evidence from a witness three years ago. Tory defence minister Andrew Murrison warned last week that the report will not be ‘very kind’ to Mr Blair, saying he was ‘not clear why it hasn’t been published already’. Mr Blair has firmly denied being responsible for the hold-up. ‘I’ve made it absolutely clear that when the report’s published is entirely up to them [the inquiry team]. 'It’s not my decision at all... it’s the responsibility of the people who run the inquiry,’ he said. A spokesman said: ‘He has as much reason as anyone for wanting the report published.’","Sir John Chilcot must wait for issue of 'sensitive documents' to be resolved .

"By . Louise Cheer . Witnesses watched in horror as a 2m-long python strangled a wallaby and then dragged it away to devour it - right in front of their eyes. The incident happened outside Pravina De Beer's Katherine home on Uralla Road. She was hosting a dinner party when her guests told her about the live nature show happening just metres away. Scroll down for video . The olive python wraps itself around the stricken wallaby, suffocating it before dragging it away . Ms De Beer's party was put on hold as about 25 guests rushed down to capture the moment. More...

They watched on as the 2m-long olive snake snake squeezed the last breaths out of the wallaby, with some guests dumbfounded by the display and took photos. The snake started eating the wallaby at 5pm and when they returned at 8.45pm there were no traces of what had happened. 'I had some guests from New Zealand on holiday and they couldn’t believe it,' Ms De Beer told NT News today. But this incident was one of many that happened near Ms de Beer's property. NT wildlife experts have seen pythons in the area as long as 3.8 metres . She said there were a lot of kangaroos and snakes in the area. Ms De Beer recalled one incident where a snake ate a baby goat under her house. Northern Territory reptile expert David 'Reedy' Reed said it was uncommon for people to see a python kill a wallaby. It can take a python less than a minute to capture and kill a wallaby . 'Every year I would get two or three people calling me who see that exact circumstance,' he said. 'I get call-outs for olive pythons who eat things from fully grown maltese terriers to people’s cats, but more commonly ducks and poultry. 'I've met some really big pythons in the last month that are around 3.8m.' Mr Reed said most of the time pythons used an ambush method to trap their prey. 'It’s hard sneak up on a wallaby,' he said. '(The pythons) ambush the wallabies. 'They sit and wait where wallabies normally trail and feed, and then pounce. 'It then constricts it and then it will swallow it whole. 'The process from the time it grabs it and kills it would not last more than a minute. 'Then it would swallow it whole which would take a good hour or so.' This particular python will not eat for at least four months, depending on when it wakes up from hibernation.","The wallaby was attacked by a roadside in Katherine, in the NT .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The 'cowardly' sons of one of Britain’s richest men who randomly attacked two off-duty policemen on a night out walked free from court today. George, 26, and Costas Panayiotou, 24, whose father Greek-Cypriot property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou is believed to be worth £400 million, attacked the off-duty officers in London's Soho on November 30 last year. The duo, who were out with brothers Yiannaki, 30, and Christoper . Stavrou, 28, at the time repeatedly punched and kicked the policemen even after they had been floored, the court was told. George Panayiotou (centre) and Costas Panayiotou (right) sons of property tycoon Andreas (left) randomly attacked two off-duty police officers while on a night out last year . The court heard how the men, who are sons of property tycoon Andreas (centre right), approached the officers - raining down punches on them even when they were on the floor in the violent attack in Soho, London . One of the officers they attacked needed titanium plates in his cheek and eye socket following the unprovoked attack, Southwark Crown Court heard. In court today, Recorder Christopher . Heheir said: 'The facts of the case to which each of you should be . really ashamed are offences all too common to the courts. 'There is one way to describe this attack - cowardly. All of you behaved in a thoroughly cowardly way.' Costas Panayiotou was given a 15-month . sentence suspended for 18 months after pleading guilty to affray. His brother George received six months suspended for 18 months after also pleading guilty. Stavrou received six months suspended for 18 months and his brother Christopher got nine months suspended for 18 months. All wearing smart suits and . ties, the gang smiled and glanced at . family and friends when their sentences were read out. The five off-duty officers were leaving their Christmas party at the Strawberry Moon club Soho when they came across both the Panayiotou and Stavrou brothers. When one of the officers yelled ‘Oi, purple baseball cap!’ at George Panayiotou, the group ran across the road and began raining blows on the officers.

The court heard how the gang rounded on the officers while Costas punched another random man returning home from a nightclub with his girlfriend. Michael Hall, prosecuting, described the violence, saying: 'Then he [Costas] punches the off duty officer Gavin Collins, knocking him to the ground and either the punch or his impact with the ground causes an impacted fracture of his cheek and eye socket that requires surgery and the fixing of titanium plates and screws.' Yiannakis Stavros then ran across the road and punched another officer, Matthew Holland, from behind. He was then joined by the other two - who also punched Mr Holland as he retreated backwards. The Panayiotou brothers outside court with family and friends. All four men were also imposed a curfew between 9pm and 6am by the judge . Mr Hall added: 'Matthew Holland is then set upon by all four defendants, punching and kicking him, at one point finding himself on the ground, where they continued to punch and kick him.' He continued: 'Mr Holland describes 15 blows down Regent’s Street and another 15 blows when first put on the ground at the junction of Cuckoo Club and Swallow Street.' They only stopped when door staff from nearby clubs stepped in, the court heard. Costas had three previous convictions for similar offences of common assault in 2010 and 2012, it was revealed in court. During mitigation, it was said that all four defendants feel 'real shame and remorse' following the random attack. Property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou - who is thought to be worth £400million - stands outside court . Sentencing them, Recorder . Heheir said: 'The facts of the case to which each of you should be . really ashamed are offences all too common to the courts. 'It didn’t seem like much alcohol had been consumed by anyone which makes what happened even more unfortunate. 'Your . paths crossed...I say your paths crossed, but you were on the opposite . side of Regent’s Street which is where you should have stayed. 'You .

Costas Panayiotou started off by punching in the face an entirely . uninvolved member of the public who was walking with his partner. 'That didn’t deter you, you didn’t give a thought to who he was. 'Another police officer, Gavin Collins, tried to stop and your response was to punch him in the face. 'He . sustained severe fractures to his face which ultimately required . surgery. Although the surgery was successful, he is still suffering the . effects of what you did. 'As . if that wasn’t bad enough with two people already punched all four of . you joined in the attack on Matt Holland - he was repeatedly punched and . kicked including when he was on the ground. 'There is one way to describe this attack - cowardly. All of you behaved in a thoroughly cowardly ways.

"By . Katy Winter . Confirming the long held stereotype that unfaithful men lavish romantic gifts upon their lovers while neglecting their spouse, a survey has revealed that cheating husbands spoil their mistresses but scrimp on their wives when buying Valentine’s Day gifts. The survey reveals that the majority of men will spend will spend £50.00-£100.00 on a present for their wives for Valentine’s Day, but £200.00-£300.00, more than double, on their mistresses. The types of presents, not simply the amount spent on them, also vary, with mistresses receiving more lavish and romantic gifts, while wives are more likely to receive practical items. A mistress is much more likely to receive sexy lingerie (right) whilst a wife is more likely to be given a piece of technology such as a DVD player (left) which somewhat lacks romance . The survey of 3,256 cheating husbands from across the UK, was commissioned by dating site Ashleymadison.com . The research also laid bare the most popular gift items for wives and mistresses, with 25 per cent of men buying diamonds for their mistress (compared with 10% for their wife) and 20% splashing out on lingerie for an affair (compared to 8% for their wife).

"By . Steph Cockroft . A former Moroccan diplomat and his wife are facing up to five years in prison after illegally sneaking a woman into America so she could work as their servant - for free. Former Moroccan diplomat Abdelkader Amal and his wife Hnia, from Alexandria, Virginia, refused to pay the victim a salary, despite forcing her to work up to 60 hours per week as their private housemaid. Instead, the husband and wife - who reportedly seized the victim's passport - paid just $8500 towards the woman's apartment in Morocco while she was employed between December 2007 and December 2010. A picture of who is thought to be Abdelkader Amal, left, and his wife Hnia, right. The couple, from Alexandria, Virginia, have admitted bringing a Moroccan woman into America under a fraudulent visa. They are pictured here with their daughter Mariam Amal, who is not involved in the case . The Department of Justice said the couple now face a lengthy prison sentence, as well as a $250,000 fine, after admitting bringing the Moroccan woman into America under 'false pretenses'. Mr Amal, who worked as a diplomat at the Moroccan embassy in Washington D.C., and his wife, who runs a cleaning company from their home, pleaded guilty at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to a charge of alien harboring. A spokesman for the DOJ said: 'The . guilty plea stemmed from evidence that Abdelkader and Hnia Amal . unlawfully brought a woman into the United States from Morocco and then . kept the woman in their home as a domestic servant for three years.' The DOJ said the couple promised to pay the housemaid - identified only as 'F.H' - $400 a week if she worked for the family's cleaning company. But the victim - who was snuck into the country on a fraudulent visa - was forced to work as the family's servant for three years, during which time she was never paid a salary. The couple instead made two down payments on the woman's . apartment in Morocco, which came to just $8500. A couple who opened the Amals' front door during a broadcast by abc, believed to be the two defendants, did not give any comment about the case. The couple kept the victim as their maid for three years but never paid her a salary, according to the Department of Justice . The two payments, made in October 2010 . and January 2011, covered only a quarter of the . total apartment cost, the DOJ said. According to court papers, F.H was forced to clean, cook and provide childcare for the Amals' grandchild. She was also made to work for the cleaning company and clean for the couple's friends, the DOJ said. Although the cleaning company was paid for F.H.'s work, the victim never saw any of the money. The Department of Justice confirmed the Amals face up to five years in jail after admitting bringing the woman into America on a fraudulent visa . The Amals snuck F.H into America on a visa which they had obtained after pretending she would be working as a housemaid for a different employer. According to Mr Amal's plea agreement in the case, he used to be employed as a military official in the Moroccan embassy in Washington D.C. Once he stopped working there after his retirement in 2003, he was no longer eligible to sponsor individuals to come into America, the DOJ said. The Amals have now agreed to pay more than $50,000 to F.H. They are due to be sentenced on July 11.","Abdelkader Amal and his wife Hnia pleaded guilty to alien harboring .

"By . Tamara Cohen . The trade advantages of being in the European Union single market are ‘imaginary’ and have not helped British exports, according to a new report. It claims the UK’s exports to Europe have grown at a slower rate than our trade with other leading countries outside the EU bloc, over the past four decades. And the proportion of EU trade within Britain’s total exports of goods and services abroad, is no higher than when Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, at just over 60pc. UK¿s exports to Europe have grown at a slower rate than our trade with other leading countries outside the EU bloc, over the past four decades . Meanwhile, it points out that Britain’s trade with countries outside the EU – such Iceland, Norway and Switzerland – has increased enormously over the same period. The report from the centre-right think tank Civitas, using trade figures from the OECD, suggests fears about losing and jobs and growth if Britain leaves the European Union may be misplaced. When campaigning ahead of the last referendum on membership in 1975, then Prime Minister Harold Wilson told the public that it was ‘the world’s most powerful trading bloc’. But the author Burrage, a former academic at the London School of Economics and now director of an Asian market research firm, said new figures made clear the single market had ‘changed nothing’. In first study of its kind, he showed exports of UK goods to the 14 nations who were members before 2004 have not increased as a proportion of trade with all OECD nations. European Union countries accounted for 63.9pc of exports when Britain joined the common market in 1973. Despite highs of up to 70pc in the late 1980s and in 2004, it slowly fell to 61.9pc by 2012. The authors say UK goods exported to non-EU Iceland, Norway and Switzerland more than doubled over this period from 5.1pc to 10.7pc. Services exported to them trebled from 6.1pc to 20.2pc, A list of countries which were the fastest growing exports to the initial members of the EU over the past 20 years found rapidly-growing Vietnam in first place, followed by Qatar and China. The report authors say UK goods exported to non-EU Iceland, Norway and Switzerland more than doubled over this period from 5.1pc to 10.7pc (library image) Britain was in 28th place, just below Egypt. The value of UK exports to European countries is way behind those from Germany, France and even the United States which was behind Britain until 2011. Mr Burrage rules out the argument that UK producers have not adapted to the opportunities offered by the single market. He found the fastest growing markets for UK good and services are mostly outside the EU, with Qatar, China, Turkey and Korea. They are all ahead of the initial 14 EU countries. The report from the centre-right think tank Civitas suggests fears about losing and jobs if Britain leaves the European Union may be misplaced (library image) ‘Over the 40 years of EU membership, for all the costs and obligations incurred, for all the treaties negotiated, and for all the immense amounts of time and anguish spent arguing about various aspects of the EU project, the proportion of UK exports going to the UK’s future EU partners has changed hardly at all’, he said. ‘While the share of UK exports to fellow EU members has been virtually stable, the share going to non-members in Europe has risen steadily, leading one to suspect that both insider advantages and outsider disadvantages are imaginary.’ The study also cast doubt on pro-European claims that Britain had more clout to negotiate trade agreements as part of the EU. There were 25 EU free-trade agreements in force in 2012 while non-EU Switzerland had independently negotiated 26, the report said.

Data showed both lager and cider sales were buoyant with more than 10 million extra litres of lager and 2.5 million extra litres of cider sold last week alone. There was also a 17 per cent increase in the sales of soft drinks as the World Cup party began while sales of nuts, crisps and snacks accounted for a further £3 million being spent in our supermarkets .

One confident customer in Wales laid a £10,000 bet on England to win the competition, while money has also been flooding in on them to beat Uruguay in their second game of the tournament where they were 11-10 favourites just four hours before kick-off. 'Considering the expectation on England has been at an all-time low it has not put punters off backing them to lift the trophy. The support is even outside of this country as shown with our customer in Wales who placed a £10,000 bet on them,' said Coral's John Hill. The Military Police reports that a group of 14 Brazilian (one minor) was arrested around noon on suspicion of causing turmoil in bars, downtown, where there were English fans.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Updated: . 19:33 EST, 6 January 2012 . The NHS will pay to remove breast implants at the centre of a global health scare. For the 3,000 patients who had the PIP implants fitted on the NHS, anxiety about them will be enough to qualify for an operation to replace them with high-quality alternatives. But last night Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also cleared the way for up to 47,000 private patients to have the PIP implants removed at taxpayers' expense – if there is a clinical need. Helpful: The NHS will pay for its patients who were fitted with the controversial PIP implants to have them removed, it emerged today . He said there was no evidence to . recommend routine removal, but private clinics had a 'moral duty' to . take them out, and if they would not, the NHS would step in. The Government would then try to claw back the money from the clinics at a later date. Asked if women would be able to have . implants removed by the NHS even if they were fitted privately, Mr . Lansley replied: 'Of course it remains true – as it is for all patients – . that if they have a clinical need the NHS is there to support them.' Announcement: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the data available to experts has not been good enough to give them a clear idea of the risk posed by the controversial PIP implants . The definition of clinical need . includes women whose implants are intact but are overwhelmed with . anxiety. The Government expects most private clinics to absorb the cost . but has pledged no women will 'be abandoned'. It is estimated that if the NHS funded . the removal of all 50,000 of the implants believed to be fitted in . British women, the total bill would reach £150million. Paying for a third would cost . £50million, the amount clinics are estimated to have made by choosing . cut-price PIP implants over better-quality ones. Most of those fitted with the implants . on the NHS will be breast cancer survivors, while private patients are . likely to have them for cosmetic reasons. A number of private clinics have said . they will go under if they have to fund surgery, while others are . charging women thousands of pounds to have the substandard implants . taken out. Women treated at a private clinic that has since gone out of business will also be entitled to NHS care. Concerns about the safety of the PIP . implants were first raised in France when surgeons noticed they were . rupturing more easily than other brands. The failure rate there has been cited . as 5-10 per cent and tests show they are filled with industrial-grade . silicone contaminated with fuel additives and window sealant. Accusations: Jean Claude-Mas, pictured in a file . photo, faces criminal charges around the world, insisted that he had . 'nothing to say' to his victims . Sixteen cases of cancer, one fatal, . have since been linked to the implants and the French government has . agreed to fund routine removal for the 30,000 women affected there. Germany and the Czech Republic are also recommending removal of the implants. Last night, after a review ordered by . Mr Lansley, the Department of Health said its experts had concluded . there was no link between the implants and cancer. However, the review panel could not . establish if the rupture rate for the PIP implants was higher than . others – and could not rule out the possibility that some are toxic. Mark Harvey, a partner at Hugh James . solicitors, which is representing more than 250 women, accused the . Government of making a 'tacit admission' that it could not compel . clinics to act. He added: 'What they have done is put . the ball firmly in the court of the clinics, and we expect the clinics . to meet that challenge and to follow the NHS's lead. If they do not, we . will be asking the courts to compel them to act.' It emerged yesterday that former Poly . Implant Prosthese owner Jean-Claude Mas, 72, scornfully dismissed . women's fears about the implants in a statement to French police in . October 2010, shortly after his factory was closed down. He said of women taking legal action . against him: 'These are people who are psychologically fragile or are . doing it for the money.' He also admitted he used illegally . obtained low-cost silicone gel never tested on humans to manufacture the . implants but insisted they posed no threat to health. Laurent Gaudon, a lawyer with a French . implant victims' association, said of the remarks: 'This displays the . shocking greed and cynicism of Jean-Claude Mas.'",Review also reveals there is no evidence to recommend the routine removal of PIP implants from women .
"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Almost 100 terror suspects linked to 295 murders were sent 'comfort letters' by the the Government reassuring them they were no longer wanted. Northern Ireland's police chief Drew Harris told MPs 95 suspects linked to 200 killings received the letters. But the Police Service of Northern Ireland later clarified the true number of unsolved killings was closer to 300. The revelation emerged during a Commons hearing today. One MP said the admission 'broke his heart'. John Downey (pictured) was suspected of the IRA Hyde Park bombing. The case against him was dropped after he produced a 'comfort letter' sent to him by the Government . Mr Harris was giving evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which is holding an inquiry into the controversial on-the-run letters agreed between Sinn Fein and the last Labour government. Under the deal letters were sent to about 190 Republican terror suspects informing them they were no longer wanted by the authorities in the UK. The scheme was set up in the wake of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - a cornerstone of the peace process. But its existence only emerged after the collapse of a case against a man accused of the IRA's Hyde Park bomb in 1982 - an attack that killed four soldiers. The prosecution of John Downey, 62, from Co Donegal, over the Hyde Park outrage was halted in February after a judge found he had been wrongly sent one of the letters, when in fact the Metropolitan Police were looking for him. Mr Downey denied involvement in the attack. The 1982 Hyde Park bomb attack on the Household Cavalry killed four soldiers and seven horses . When the 228 'comfort letters' first . emerged it sparked fury in Northern Ireland. There will be fears that . today's revelation could reignite the row. Mr Harris told MPs that some of the letters were sent to 'notorious' terrorists. He said: 'When you look through the 228 names, there are people in that who are notorious, without a doubt' He said 95 had been sent to murder investigation suspects. 'Ninety five of these individuals are linked in some way or other to 200 murder investigations,' he said. After Mr Harris finished giving his evidence his force issued a statement of clarification that those 200 incidents actually involved the murder of 295 people.' Northern . Ireland MP Ian Paisley responded angrily to the revelation. He said: 'I . must say, it breaks my heart today, as a citizen of Northern Ireland, . as a citizen of the United Kingdom, 95 people are holding letters . excusing the murder of 200 people. That breaks my heart.' Mr . Harris also revealed that five of the individuals who had received the . letters were under active police investigation on the back of new . evidence unearthed by Northern Ireland police's Historical Enquiries . Team. He said he did not know if the letters would scupper these probes. The Northern Ireland police chief said: 'I don't know whether they will be annulled or not.' Northern Ireland MP Ian Paisley Jnr reacted angrily to the revelation that 95 letters were sent to suspects wanted in 200 murder probes . Today's bombshell revelation came after the children of IRA murder victim Jean McConville vowed to continue fighting for justice as they gathered to mark what would have been her 80th birthday. Relatives planted a tree and released doves into the air during a poignant ceremony of music and prayer at a victims’ support centre in north Belfast. The event was held as police announced that a 56-year-old man had been re-arrested in connection with the notorious 1972 abduction and killing of the Belfast mother-of-ten. The suspect was originally detained by officers last month but the interview process was halted due to a medical issue arising. Seven people have been arrested and questioned in the last two months in connection with the murder - including Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Mr Adams, 65, was released on Sunday without charge after four days in police custody. A police file is to be passed to prosecutors to determine whether any charges will be pursued. Mr Adams vehemently denies any involvement in the crime. After the remembrance event at the Wave Trauma Centre, Mrs McConville’s son Michael said the last week had proved very stressful for the family. 'We know it’s going to be a long road to try and get justice for our mother, we know all these events when they take place we know we are going to go through a hard time,' said Mr McConville. 'We have been backed into a corner by the IRA and we are going to come out fighting and we want justice for our mother.' Mrs McConville, a 37-year-old widow, was dragged, screaming, away from her children in the Divis flats in west Belfast by a gang of up to 12 men and women after being wrongly accused of informing to the security forces. She was interrogated, shot in the back of the head and then secretly buried - becoming one of the 'Disappeared' victims of the Troubles. Her body was not found until 2003 on a beach in Co Louth, 50 miles from her home. Families of Disappeared victims whose remains have yet to be discovered joined members of the McConville family at today’s event.","Individuals got so-called 'comfort letters' from Government .

"By . Sam Webb . A mother who spat into the face of a teenage referee at her son's junior football game has been convicted of assault. Oksana Karaliova, 34, was sent off from the sidelines then spat twice in the young official’s face after the under-9s match. Her husband Lazaro Garcia, 44, who also got a red card as he watched the game in Salford, Greater Manchester, grabbed him by the throat after the final whistle. Oksana Karaliova, 34, spat into the face of a teenage referee after she disagreed with his decisions during an under 9s football game. Her husband Lazara Garcia also grabbed the 16-year-old by the throat . The couple, from Salford, were both angered by decisions made by the 16-year-old during the game - and subjected him to a tirade of expletive-laden abuse. They denied common assault but were found guilty after a day-long trial at Manchester magistrates court. The shocking incident took place in November, during and after a junior league game between Barr Hill under-9s and Moorside Rangers under-9s at Barr Hill Playing Fields in Salford. The court heard that the ugly scenes were witnessed by eight-year-olds and reported to police, who launched an immediate investigation backed by the Football Association. Giving evidence the young ref, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court he had been qualified for three years and that parents and the two clubs were fully aware of the FA’s Respect code of conduct and campaign. He said trouble flared after a tackle he left unpunished because he believed the young player had slipped. Karaliova, a mature student at Salford University, began to hurl obscenities at him. The teenager has now quit full-time refereeing because of the incident . The court heard that the ugly scenes at Barr Hill Playing Fields were witnessed by eight-year-olds and reported to police, who launched an immediate investigation backed by the Football Association . The teenager said: 'I walked up to the lady and said ""what did you say?"". 'She said ‘are you f****** serious? You are a f****** ******* and you do not know what you are doing.' He told the court that he sent her off but she refused to go then lit a cigarette. Karaliova, the ref went on, told him that she would be waiting for him at the end of the match and demanded that he gave her his contact details and his address. The court heard Garcia, who works at the Lowry Hotel in Salford, was also sent off by the referee after he questioned his reasoning for giving his wife a red card, saying: 'Is this a f****** joke?' The ref said: 'They had no respect for what I was doing. I felt really intimidated and I didn’t know what was going to happen at the end. 'I was on my own.' The ref, now 17, said Karaliova approached him as he walked back to the clubhouse after the game and said ""I have got something for you referee"" before she spat in his face. He said he tried to stop her walking off and Garcia approached. The ref said: 'He grabbed me by the throat and at that point was threatening me and shouting at my face. His wife came over my shoulder and spat in my face again. I didn’t know what they were going to do. I rang my dad straight away.' The teenager has now quit full-time refereeing because of the incident. Marcus Corfield, a Moorside coach, said of Garcia: 'In all my years of football I have never seen anything like it.' Giving evidence, the couple denied the attacks ever happened, but magistrates called their evidence implausible. They were released on bail and will be sentenced on June 2. After the hearing, Manchester FA chief executive Colin Bridgford said: 'This behaviour has to be challenged throughout junior football and we all have to play our part in that.'","Oksana Karaliova committed sickening attack during children's game .

"By . Ashley Collman . A writer claims he was almost involved in a mid-air collision two weeks ago that could have been one of the deadliest air accidents ever. Kevin Townsend was flying from Hawaii to Los Angeles when he says his plane almost collided with another. He estimates that 590 could have died if the pilot hadn't veered out of the way of the on-coming jet, yet the near-miss hasn't made the news. In an essay for Medium, Townsend argues that it's events like his flight last month that prove the airline industry is desperately in need or more oversight. Near miss: Writer Kevin Townsend was on board a United Airlines flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles last month when it nearly collided with another plane head on. Above, a stock photo of a United Airlines Boeing 787 . Dip: Usually a flight's tracker should be flat once reaching cruising altitude, but you can see the point at which the plane dipped 600 feet in the above graph around the 1:15pm point . Shortly after reaching cruising altitude on April 25, the entire cabin of United Airlines flight 1205 went weightless as the pilot unexpectedly dipped 600 feet. 'I felt my body float upwards and strain against my seatbelt. Passengers around me screamed. There was a loud crash in the back — a coffeepot clattering to the floor and tumbling down the aisle,' Townsend wrote. 'Our tray tables began rattling in unison as the 757 strained through the kind of maneuver meant more for a fighter jet.' After a few minutes, a flustered flight attendant came over the intercom and said: 'OK. That was obviously unexpected.' Once the plane climbed back up to cruising altitude the flight attendant explained that 'the pilot took evasive action to avoid an aircraft in our flight path' and that everyone's in-flight entertainment would be comped for the flight. Safely on the ground on Los Angeles, Townsend interviewed the flight and began his own research into what really happened and how air traffic is controlled. On a road, cars stay out of each others way by driving in different lanes, but that doesn't work in the air. Instead westbound flights fly at even altitudes while eastbound flights fly at odd altitudes. Townsend's flight to LA was flying at 33,000 feet, meaning they were in the right and the oncoming plane was in the wrong 'lane' so to speak. Protocol: When two airplane are about to collide, systems on board send out an alarm and give orders for each plane to either dive or climb . Moments from crashing: But by the time the United pilot received the alarm on April 25, he could already see the plane ahead of him and had to act quicker . Shortly after reaching cruising altitude, an alarm went off in the cockpit, alerting the pilots that they were in the direct path of another flight. When this happens, the two planes are given orders to either dive or climb so as to get out of each others air space. But by the time the pilot received the alarm in this case, the oncoming plane was dangerously close - close enough to see coming head on. Planes going 600mph can close a distance of 5 miles in 15 seconds meaning they were mere moments away from collision. 'Holy s***, there it is!' the pilot exclaimed, and immediately took the plane into a dive. 'The first officer later told me the US Airways flight was “certainly too close for comfort.""'Townsend said. After researching past collisions, Townsend discovered that the April near-miss could have been the most disastrous in history. Currently, the most deadly airplane collision is the Tenerife Airport Disaster of 1977, which claimed 583 lives when two 747s collided. Epic proportions: The deadliest aircraft collision happened at Tenerife Airport in 1977 and claimed 583 lives. Townsend estimates that 590 would have been killed if his plane collided over the Pacific last month . Last month, Townsend was on board a 757-300, the longest narrow-body twin jet ever made, with 289 on board. Since they were traveling over the Pacific the other plane was most likely similarly large. 'Had there been a collision, it would have been the new record, with an estimated 590 deaths, one of them mine,' Townsend said. But the story still hasn't been reported in the news because of the way airlines self-govern themselves. When an incident happens in the air outside of air traffic control, it's up to the pilot to report incident. It wasm't until two weeks after the accident that the FAA finally found out about the incident and said it was being investigated, both internally by the airline and by the Air Traffic Organization. However, an FAA inspector in Hawaii told Townsend that nothing was likely to come from the investigation because everything on the planes seemed to work properly. Townsend finds this ludicrous and compares it to driving a car on a road at night when suddenly you see another car coming at you in the wrong land. 'You swerve into another lane just as the car passes. The FAA’s view would hold that nothing was amiss because your headlights revealed the oncoming car,' he explains. In the essay, Townsend calls for more oversight of the airline companies and believes they should collect better data and be more open with sharing their findings.","Kevin Townsend was on board a Los Angeles bound flight from Hawaii that almost collided with another plane .

"By . Charlotte Thomson . A successful solicitor accused of assaulting his wife and racially abusing her celebrity fitness trainer lover went on trial yesterday. Alexander Hutcheon, 58, allegedly assaulted Nicola Hutcheon by poking her in the face with his finger at their luxury home in the west end of Aberdeen. He is further accused of shouting and swearing at her partner Steve Agyei, the former fitness instructor of Cherie Blair, and of making racist remarks in a city bar. Solicitor Alexander Hutcheon, pictured left leaving Aberdeen Sheriff Court, is accused of attacking his wife Nicola Hutcheon, pictured right and racially abusing her personal trainer Steve Agyei . Mr Hutcheon, the owner of one of Aberdeen’s leading property and mortgaging businesses, went on trial at the city’s sheriff court. Giving evidence, Mr Agyei, 49, said he was sitting in the bar having a drink with Mrs Hutcheon when Mr Hutcheon and his 14-year-old son approached them on January 29. The self-employed fitness instructor claimed the solicitor spoke softly in his ear and called him a ‘monkey, darky and stalker’. Mr Agyei told the court: ‘He started saying “tink” and that really stuck in my head. It’s the first time I’ve ever been called a gypsy in my life. It really stuck in.’ He told the court that Mr Hutcheon then asked his wife how she could be with someone like him: ‘She said something like that she wanted to be with me.’ The trainer said he was not intimidated by Hutcheon, of Rubislaw Den South, because he was physically stronger and the solicitor was a lot older and shorter than him, but Hutcheon was acting in a threatening manner. Mr Agyei . said he met Mrs Hutcheon when she was on a night out in a west end hotel . last May. A week later she said was separating from her husband and . they got together soon afterwards. Defence . lawyer George Mathers accused him of setting out to destroy his client . after he had seduced the wealthy woman, adding: ‘Financially, you’re not . well off – I don’t wish to be insulting.’ Mr . Agyei replied: ‘At this present time I would agree with you. I don’t . need any money from any woman, that’s not the way I’ve been brought up. I . would never live off a woman.’ The fitness trainer said he was with the woman of his dreams and had plans to make his own money. Mrs Hutcheon had been pregnant with his baby, but she miscarried and they lost their child. Fitness instructor Steve Agyei, pictured left, has claimed solicitor Alexander Hutcheon called him a 'monkey, darky and stalker'. Mr Agyei was once the fitness instructor of Cherie Blair, pictured right . He said he had consulted with a solicitor and talked about the case with Cherie Blair. ‘I was personal training her when I was down in London, so I was discussing what was happening in my life,’ he said. Earlier, the court heard from Adrian Hutcheon, the couple’s eldest child, who told the court that his father had taken him down to the Noose and Monkey pub to see his mother. The 14-year-old said his father had been contacted by a friend to let him know his wife was in the bar with the fitness instructor on January 29. He said Hutcheon was taking him down to the pub because his mother had promised to live with her family and be faithful and get their lives back on track. The third-year pupil said he could not remember what his father said to the couple but insisted he had not said anything racist. The court heard he left with his father a short while later and Mrs Hutcheon did not go home with them. The teenager said that his mother left for days at a time but would come home for a while, and went on family holidays abroad with them. He said that she came home on March 27 when his father and siblings were in their beds and started raising her voice at his father. He told the court he went upstairs to a room on the top floor and saw his father pointing his finger at his mother as he spoke. She appeared to almost dive towards Hutcheon and, as she did so, her husband’s finger made  contact with her lip. ‘I was confused,’ said the schoolboy. ‘Why did she move her head forward and make contact? I just didn’t understand what she was doing.’ Hutcheon denies all charges. The trial continues later this year.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . What’s the secret to being confident? Some people believe it's having a positive mental attitude, while others claim it's being wealthy. But according to one researcher, the answer may in fact lie in what we’re wearing. Professor Karen Pine from the University of Hertfordshire said that specific clothing - including even superhero T-shirts - can make people more confident in all sorts of situations. A new book by Professor Karen Pine from the University of Hertfordshire suggests that what you wear can boost or lower your self-esteem. She asked students in groups to wear Superman clothing and found they were more confident both mentally and physically (stock image shown) The research is outlined in her new book Mind What You Wear. In the book she claims clothing affects a person’s mental processes and perceptions. Yesterday car manufacturer Kia revealed their own separate survey into what makes people confident for the launch of their revamped Kia Soul car: . Women . 1. A new haircut2. A sunny day3. Walking in heels4. Learning a new skill5. Booking a holiday6. Shaved legs7. Lipstick8. Glowing tan9. Little black dress10. Designer perfume . Men . 1. A sunny day2. Freshly shaved face3. A new suit4. Freshly brushed teeth5. A nice smelling aftershave6. Being praised at work7. A new hair cut8. Sleeping in freshly washed sheets9. Learning a new skill10. Someone agreeing to go on a date . And ultimately, what you wear could discern how confident you feel about yourself. 'We know our clothes affect other people's impressions of us,' Professor Pine told the MailOnline. 'Now research shows what we wear affects us too. 'Putting on different clothes creates different thoughts and mental processes. 'My book aims to make people more aware of this, to understand how changing their clothes can change their mood and their thoughts.' In the study, she gathered a group of students and asked some to wear a superman T-shirt. She wanted to know if heroic clothing would change how students thought. Surprisingly, she found that not only did it make them more confident, but it also made them actually think they were physically stronger. ‘When wearing a Superman T-shirt the students rated themselves as more likeable and superior to other students,’ she explained in a release from the University of Hertfordshire. ‘When asked to estimate how much they could physically lift, those in a Superman T-shirt thought they were stronger than students in a plain T-shirt, or in their own clothing.’ It wasn’t just superhero clothing that affected a person’s state of mind, though. In another test, women were ask to do a maths test in a swimsuit or wearing a sweater, with the latter group performing better. Wearing a white coat, meanwhile, was found to improve a person’s mental agility. And in the book she claims when women are stressed, they neglect 90 per cent of their wardrobe, choosing to dress up only to feel confident. In addition to scientific research, Professor Pine said she also has ‘tips on how to feel happier and more confident with the right clothes, explaining not only that we are what we wear, but that we become what we wear.’ Professor Pine's research suggests people should be more careful when picking out what clothes they plan to wear. In tests she found women performed worse in maths tests when wearing a swimsuit, while people in general had better mental agility when wearing a white coat .","Professor Karen Pine researched how a person's attire affects confidence .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Ian Drury . Women soldiers could be allowed into frontline combat roles, it was  announced yesterday. Signalling the historic change, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it was time for the Armed Forces to abandon the ‘macho’ image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough. He said the US, Canadian and Australian armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should Britain. British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond pictured with Chief of the General Staff Sir Peter Wall who has also backed the move . But . last night some former soldiers criticised the ‘politically correct’ announcement, saying it should not be considered a ‘right’ for women to . fight on the front line. One said the mixture of men and women could undermine the cohesiveness of units – putting lives at risk. Joanne Dyer Killed in action Joanne Dyer, 24, who trained with Prince William, was killed by a roadside bomb in Basra in 2007 . Women . can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy . while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, . logisticians or signallers. However, . they remain barred from all infantry battalions and Royal Marine . Commando units – including Special Forces – and from tank regiments and . other armoured units. Theoretically, . women would be allowed to join the Special Forces, such as the SAS. But . to do so they would be expected to pass the unit’s gruelling mental and . physical selection process. ‘There . is no way we are going to make the tests easier,’ said a defence . source. The ban has not stopped women being killed in Iraq and . Afghanistan where they are at risk from roadside bombs even away from . the frontline. Eight women have been killed in combat in the conflicts – 2 per cent of the total fatalities. Among . the women who have been killed serving in Iraq is a friend of Prince . William. Joanna Dyer, 24, a Second Lieutenant attached to 2nd Battalion . The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, trained alongside Prince William at . the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Mr . Hammond said yesterday that he had brought forward a planned review – . to be carried out by the Chief of the General Staff – of whether women . should be able to join the infantry and the armoured corps. It . will coincide with what could be the first year that British troops . have not been engaged in fighting somewhere in the world since at least . 1914 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan. By . January next year there will be fewer than 500 troops in the warzone, . mainly in mentoring or advisory roles. When UK forces pull down the . Union Flag at Camp Bastion, it is likely to signal the end of a century . or more of unbroken warfare for British forces. If the review backs . women on the front line, the Army would be expected to make the . necessary changes – such as reforms to living quarters – as soon as . possible. No timescale for the first women on the frontline has yet been . set. Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy . Mr Hammond said: ‘At a . time when the Americans, the Australians, the Canadians, even the . French – the Israelis of course for years – have women in their combat . arms, this is something we have to look at again.’ He acknowledged that . the demands of frontline combat may mean that only a limited number may . meet the rigorous fitness requirements for some posts. ‘I . am looking for a way forward that signals the Army’s openness to all . who can meet the standards required, maintaining combat effectiveness . and militarily necessary standards of fitness,’ he said. But Colonel Richard Kemp, who led British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘The infantry is very different from any other job. ‘The . essence of infantry soldiering is to close with the enemy and kill him . face to face with bullets, bayonets and grenades. Facing and killing a . large and aggressive male enemy soldier – if necessary in hand to hand . combat – requires a certain ferocity, aggression and killer instinct . that is more characteristic of men than women. ‘Fighting . and killing an enemy in close combat is not a right nor an . “opportunity” as the Defence Secretary suggests. It is a dreadful, . gut-churning, traumatic and incredibly tough job that must be done to . defend the country. ‘The . politically correct view that men and women are the same and equally . capable of every human activity is a dangerous notion when applied to . close infantry combat.’ Major . Judith Webb, who retired from the Army in 1986, opposes close combat . roles for women. ‘We have to accept that we are different . physiologically,’ she said. ‘We don’t have the same upper-body . strength.’","Tory Cabinet Minister reveals plan for women to be given combat roles .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A hospital  under investigation by police and the NHS has suspended ten nurses – three of whom have been arrested over tampering with medication and falsifying records. Last night campaigners fighting for a full public inquiry into deaths and poor care at the hospital in South Wales, said the problem was bigger than the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Gareth Williams, who set up a support group for families of patients who have suffered at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, said: ‘The suspension of ten nurses is shocking news.' Under investigation: Three of the ten nurses suspended from Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, have been arrested over tampering with medication and falsifying records . He added: ‘I have always said the scale of the scandal at the hospital is enormous. But people have been slow to listen.’ His mother Lillian, an 82-year-old amputee, died at the hospital in 2012. She was starved and neglected by staff for days and died a ‘horrible death’, Mr Williams said. Hospital sources said five of the suspended nurses were responsible for Lillian Williams’ care. The three arrested nurses have been released on bail. The Welsh Government ordered an inquiry into the scandal, due to report soon, but Mr Williams called for a full public inquiry into all hospitals run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU). ‘The problems are throughout the health board, not just at Bridgend Hospital, but at Morriston and Singleton,’ he said. Families of patients who have suffered are now calling for a full scale inquiry into all hospitals run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) - not just  Princess of Wales Hospital . Scandal: Campaigners believe that the scandal in South Wales is worse than that of Mid Staffordshire NHS trust last year (stock image) ‘I am getting told about two or three suspicious deaths a month at the three hospitals and we know that this neglect stretches back at least four to five years.’ Mr Williams alleges his mother’s medication was tampered with and that she was given the wrong insulin doses. Others claim relatives were given the drug when it had not been prescribed. Last night it emerged the hospital had agreed compensation with the family of Basil Hewins, who died after being treated there two years ago. ABMU admitted there was a ‘breach of duty’ which ‘on the balance of probabilities resulted in Mr Hewins contracting peritonitis which led to septicaemia and ultimately his death’. His son Clive Hewins said the 84-year-old had suffered a ‘fortnight from hell’. The patient, who had dialysis for a kidney problem, was admitted to the Princess of Wales Hospital on July 6, 2012, with suspected shingles. His son was told it was not a dialysis hospital so had to perform the procedure himself. He added: ‘Our concerns … grew when one nurse said she didn’t know what she was doing regarding dialysis.’ The family also reported finding waste water running through a corridor from a wet room towards Mr Hewins’ room. On July 20, he was diagnosed with peritonitis and septicaemia. He died soon after an operation at another hospital. An ABMU spokesman apologised for ‘failings’ in Mr Hewins’ care and expressed ‘sincere condolences’.","Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend 'bigger problem than Mid Staffs'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Energy drinks can lead to alcohol abuse, a new study has found. Jayde Dinsdale's heart stopped three times after she downed 10 Jagerbombs mixed with Red Bull . Energy drinks can lead to mental health problems and drug and alcohol abuse in teenagers, researchers have warned. Their findings have been published just a day after it emerged a teenager's heart stopped three times after downing 10 Jagerbombs mixed with Red Bull. Jayde Dinsdale, 18, was drinking the Jagermeister spirit and energy . drink shooter, which cost £2.20 for two, on a night out with friends, in . Yeovil, Somerset. But as the alcohol wore off, the high levels . of caffeine in her system took control of her heart rate - causing it to . accelerate dangerously out of control, medics have since said. She suffered three heart attacks and temporarily 'died' on her . bathroom floor after she downed ten high-caffeine Jagerbombs on a . 'two-for-one' promotion night. The new research, published in the journal Preventive Medicine, . found that students prone to depression - and those who smoke . marijuana or drink alcohol - are more likely to consume energy drinks. Among the . 8,210 high school students surveyed, nearly two thirds reported using . energy drinks at least once in the past year, with more than one in five . consuming them once or more per month. And worryingly, it was the younger high school students who were more likely to consume energy drinks than older ones. Last month researchers at the University of Michigan reported that teenagers who drink energy drinks are much more likely to also drink alcohol and use drugs. They are also more likely to start smoking. They . suggested this could be because  teenagers who are ‘sensation-seekers’ or ‘risk orientated’ are more likely to drink energy drinks. In turn, having these character traits means they are also more likely to experiment with other substances. As the alcohol wore off, the high levels of caffeine in Miss Dinsdale's system caused her heart rate to accelerate dangerously. She suffered three heart attacks, temporarily 'died' and needs an internal defibrillator . Energy drinks have been associated with a number of negative health effects, including cardiovascular symptoms, sleep . impairment and nervousness and nausea. The side effects are caused by . the beverages' high concentration of caffeine. Study author Dr Sunday Azagba said: 'Marketing campaigns appear designed to entice youth and young . adults. It's a dangerous combination, especially for those at an . increased risk for substance abuse.' The researchers from the University of Waterloo and Dalhousie University in Canada, are calling for limits on teens' access to the drinks and reduction in the amount of the caffeine in each can. Dr Azagba said: 'The trends we are seeing are more than cause for concern, particularly because of the high rate of consumption among teenagers. Another recent study found teenagers who drink energy drinks are much more likely to also drink alcohol and use drugs. They are also more likely to start smoking . 'These drinks appeal to young people because of their temporary benefits like increased alertness, improved mood and enhanced mental and physical energy.' In recent years energy drink sales have skyrocketed, with sales predicted to reach $20 billion in 2013 in the United States alone. Dr Azagba said: 'In our opinion, at the very least steps should be taken to limit teens' access to energy drinks.' She added there was also a need to increase public awareness and education about the potential harms of these drinks and to minimise the amount of caffeine available in each drink. 'This won't eliminate the problem entirely, but steps like these can help mitigate harm that appears to be associated with consumption of these drinks. 'This is something we need to take seriously. Change won't happen without a concerted effort. The study was based on data from the 2012 Student Drug Use Survey, consisting of a representative sample of junior and senior high school students from three provinces in Atlantic Canada.","Students prone to depression - and those who smoke .

Pensioners who require long-term care could end up paying double the much-vaunted cap on costs because there are so many hidden charges, a report claims. The Coalition has pledged that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000 – with the state stepping in to foot the bill after that. But the pledge does not cover the full bill for elderly care. Cap: The Coalition said that the cost of care would be capped at £72,000 . Among the costs not included in the cap is the ‘bed and board’ bill for living in a care home, which can exceed £10,000 a year. Now the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries has found that these hidden charges mean people will shell out an average of £140,000 before they reach the level of the cap. Their research also found that only around one in ten pensioners will ever reach the point of receiving help from the state – the majority will have to bear the full costs themselves. They concluded that the cap has been set so high that only around 8 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women who enter care will ever reach it. Thomas Kenny, one of the authors of the report, said: ‘Anyone who is expecting that the cap will pay for care is in for a shock. ‘The cap is there to protect against catastrophic costs, and we estimate that few people entering care aged 85 years will reach it.’ Warning: Dr Ros Altmann, a former government adviser, warned that people still need to save to provide for their old age . The Coalition has pledged to end England’s care crisis, which can see the elderly facing unlimited care costs – leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year. The cap, which will come into force in 2016, will be set at £72,000 and will cover nursing in care homes or the cost of home helps. After this level, the state will step in and pay the rest. However, it will not cover a range of costs such as bed and board, or help for those whose needs are not deemed to be ‘substantial’ by the council. People will also pay extra if they do not want to live the type of ‘bog standard’ home a local authority would fund. The study found that once these hidden charges are factored in, people would have spent an average of £140,000 by the time they reach the so-called cap of £72,000. Mr Kenny said many people would still have to dip into the money locked up in their property to pay for care. ‘Recent research data shows that one in three women and one in four men aged 65 today is likely to need care,’ he said. ‘Yet the average disposable income for retired households was £18,700 in 2011/12, which is below the level required to fund average long-term care costs before reaching the cap.’ He said that, even with the cap, people would have to save through their lives to pay for care, and called on more people to take out pension plans which include a care element. 'With the right tax incentives and flexibility, there are products that could help people to meet any care needs that they may have in the future,’ said Mr Kenny. Although the average person is expected to spend around £140,000 on care costs before reaching the cap, this can increase to some £250,000 if a person is in care for 10 years. There are also significant regional variations in the costs and the amount of time it will take for the cap to apply. In London, someone entering a care home aged 85 is expected to reach it in four years and incur a personal cost of £117,000 before reaching it. In the West Midlands however, it will take seven years to reach the cap with a personal cost of £170,000. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on older people, said: ‘The government is not going to cover the care costs for most people. Even with the cap, most people will still end up paying all their costs. ‘People are not putting money aside but they need to, because society cannot afford all the older people coming through. ‘We will all be affected by this. We need to make provision – the state won’t cover it.’ Last night a spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We are introducing the first ever cap on care to protect people from catastrophic costs and deferred payments so no one should be forced to sell their home in their lifetime. ‘Our reforms will mean that more people will get financial help sooner.’","The Coalition pledged nobody will pay care costs above £72,000 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The father of an Ohio soldier who was kidnapped in Iraq ten years ago and later killed will finally face the man who has confessed to taking his son's life. The Pentagon contacted Keith Maupin six weeks ago to say that a man who had confessed to killing 20-year-old Matt was in custody in Iraq. Mr Maupin, who refused to shave for more than four years as he waited for news of his son's fate, is due to speak to the judge handling the case over video conference next week. Closure: The Pentagon says an Iraqi has confessed to killing Matt Maupin, who was captured in 2004 . Answers: Keith Maupin, who refused to shave while his son was still missing, wants to know why Matt was killed . 'They told me they had a guy in jail over there that has confessed to killing Matt,' Mr Maupin told Fox 19. 'They're pretty sure this is the guy or he wouldn't have called me.' Mr Maupin doesn't know if he will have a chance to speak to the suspected killer, and said all he knows is that an Iraqi judge wanted to ask him some questions. For years Mr Maupin and ex-wife Carolyn had held on to hope that their son would be returned alive, after he was ambushed by insurgents in April 2004. His captors released a video showing the young man surrounded by armed insurgents as he sat on the ground. A few months later another video, appearing to show him being killed, was released. Finally, in March 2008, the Army contacted Sergeant Maupin's parents to say that remains had been found and that DNA analysis showed they belonged to their son. Ordeal: Shortly after Matt was captured when his fuel convoy was ambushed, a video appeared showing masked gunmen surrounding him . Ambush: Matt Maupin was taken hostage after insurgents attacked the fuel convoy he was with . His body was flown home but for the soldier's father, his ordeal was never far from mind. 'For the past ten years, it has never gone away,' he told Cincinnati.com. 'When we brought Matt home it was good to complete the circle ... But I never got closure.' Mr Maupin, who helped found the Yellow Ribbon Support Group after his son's capture, said he knew only a few details about the suspected killer. The Iraqi is currently facing two other cases, including one for killing a civilian around the same time. Mr Maupin doesn't know if he will get a chance to address the suspect, but if he does he said he wanted to ask why his son, who was part of a fuel convoy, was killed. Campaign: Keith and Carolyn Maupin at a homecoming event in 2005. They founded a care package charity in memory of their son . Never forget: Matt's parents founded the Yellow Ribbon Support Center, which delivers care packages above to the forces, to help other soldiers and keep their son's memory alive . 'At that time was not a threat. He was just a kid that wanted to serve his country and come home. Why?' Mr Maupin said. He is traveling to Washington on Monday to learn more about the case and will speak to the judge through a translator. In April 2008, the family were told that two of the kidnappers had been sentenced to death, and that at least six Iraqis were believed to have been involved.","Matt Maupin, 20, was kidnapped by insurgents in 2004 and was seen surrounded by gunmen in a video .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The dead will have to be dug up and reburied in deeper graves because Britain's cemeteries are almost full, MPs have claimed. A shortage of grave space has become 'critical' in many towns - with councils having nowhere left to bury the dead. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston urged ministers to let churches and council cemeteries re-use older graves to ease the crisis. Traditional village graves, like this one at St Mary's church in Harmondsworth west London, are rapidly filling up, MPs have warned . Promession, or cryomation - Involves using liquid nitrogen to chill the body to -196c, leaving it so brittle that it can be ‘fragmented’ on a vibrating mat. A magnet then removes metal objects such as fillings and artificial limbs, leaving a sterile powder. Resomation - Sees bodies placed in silk bags and submerged in an alkaline solution that has been heated to 160c. Flesh, organs and bones all dissolve under the onslaught, leaving behind a combination of green-brown fluid and white powder. Ashes turned into diamonds - This technique utilises the fact that both human beings and diamonds are carbon-based. A body is cremated and the resulting ash is then purified at 3,000C before being further heated and pressurised into a diamond over a 16-week period. Such a move would involve lifting out remains from graves that are more than 75-years-old, burying them deeper in the same grave and then re-using the space on top. Many cemeteries in London are already full and are allowed, under emergency 2007 laws, to re-use old graves. But this exemption only applies to the capital. It comes after warnings that almost half of England's cemeteries could run out of space within a generation. And in just 30 years all of Britain's public cemeteries are now expected to be full. Dr Wollaston said that in one part of her Devon constituency there are just 16 empty burial plots left. Sir Tony Baldry, the Tory MP who represents the Church of England in Parliament, said the law did not make it clear whether churches or local councils were responsible for providing burial space. Local churches have traditionally provided the a town's main graveyard - but many are full and have been 'closed'. At the same time councils are finding it increasingly difficult to find space for new cemeteries. It emerged last year that many Town Halls were already resorting to converting car parks into cemeteries to meet the demand. Earlier this year the Church of England moved to tackle the crisis by offering discounts for cremations rather than burial because of the shortage of space. Dr Sarah Wollaston warned that some cemeteries in her constituency were almost full and called on ministers to consider allowing churches and Town Halls to reuse plots for new burials . Dr Wollaston's warning came during a Commons committee debate yesterday. She asked Sir Tony about the 'critical shortage of burial places?' The Tory MP said: 'In Kingsbridge in my constituency, there are only 16 places left. 'All the measures available have been instituted, such as using plots that have not been taken up and clearing extra ground in cemeteries, but we are now reaching a critical shortage, and I gather that the situation is repeated around the country.' Dr Wollaston added: 'I feel that it is best to deal with this before we reach the point where there is nowhere left. 'Although this is an uncomfortable question and of course no one likes the idea of having to reuse plots. The reality is: what is the alternative?' Sir Tony said Dr Wollaston was 'absolutely right'. He said: 'She has identified what I suspect is something of a lacuna in the legislation about who is responsible for making provision for new cemeteries and new burial ground places. 'In my constituency, in Bicester, there are difficulties. Land around the towns is valuable as development land — farmers and landowners are not keen to give up land for new burial grounds — and it can be quite a challenge for district or town councils to provide new burial space.' Last year, cemetery experts warned that the only way to solve the crisis was to re-use old graves. Tim Morris, the head of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said: 'If the public are to continue to have access to local and affordable burial space, there is no alternative to the re-use of old, abandoned graves.' Mr Morris added: 'Money needed to build new cemeteries could be saved, and spent on the living, through the re-use of graves.' The Ministry of Justice has said the issue is 'under constant review'.","Tory MP Sarah Wollaston warns shortage of graves now 'critical'

"By . Mark Duell . These are the horrific injuries a 17-year-old boy inflicted on an elderly lady with her own walking stick - before he raided her home for cash and jewellery. Aaron Davis, of Hextable, Kent, has been jailed for more than ten years after assaulting 89-year-old Jean McDougall and leaving another pensioner for dead in a second robbery. Mrs McDougall suffered serious bruising . around her eyes, face and upper arm, a lip laceration, bleeding on her . brain and a compression fracture to the top of her spine - which still . causes her pain. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Injuries: Jean McDougall suffered serious bruising around her eyes, face and upper arm, a laceration to her lip, bleeding on her brain and a compression fracture to the top of her spine - which still causes her pain . He beat one of his victims so hard . that her false teeth came out and her glasses were broken. A court heard . how Davis assaulted his frail victims on their doorsteps, before . stealing their valuables. Davis, . now 18, had pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to three counts of . grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of robbery, the burglary of . the first victim’s shed and another burglary at a  football pavilion. He was sentenced on May 6 at Maidstone Crown Court. Judge . David Griffiths QC ordered him to serve ten and a half years in a young . offenders’ institution, also imposing an extended five-year licence . period for the protection of the public. He . told Davis: ‘Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was . wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you . wanted to show off to your friends. ‘It . is quite clear that these were to some extent premeditated, targeted . offences - targeted, in that you chose vulnerable, elderly victims. ‘On . such victims you didn’t need to use violence at all because of their . frailty, but you chose to do so as you went about pursuing your . intention of relieving them of various items - cash and other personal . belongings. Horrific injuries: Aaron Davis (left), of Hextable, Kent, has been jailed for more than ten years for assaulting 89-year-old Jean McDougall (right) and leaving another pensioner for dead in a second robbery . ‘The use of violence against such victims was cowardly and likely to cause them serious injury.’ His first victim was 81-year-old June Carr, who he attacked on September 10 last year at the home where she had lived for 34 years. The court heard he knocked on her front door, in a quiet cul-de-sac in the village of Hextable, at about 8am under the pretext of offering to do some work for her. He then pushed Mrs Carr to the ground, causing her to hit her head and fall unconscious. Leaving Mrs Carr for dead, Davis stole her son’s wallet and some other belongings from inside her house, before fleeing the scene, later returning to burgle her garden shed. The court heard Mrs Carr lay on the ground for several hours before a neighbour found her, confused and delirious, and called for an ambulance. She spent two weeks in hospital being treated for a fractured skull and two bleeds to the brain. In a victim impact statement, her sister-in-law told the court Mrs Carr now had no quality of life. The statement said: ‘She doesn’t watch . the TV or listen to the radio anymore. She just sits on the sofa all . day. She doesn’t go out or interact socially. 'I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep' Jean McDougall, victim . ‘She will never have the independence to go out on her own again. I don’t know what the future holds for June, but I do believe she will not get any better now.’ A month later Davis returned to the same cul-de-sac, this time targeting dementia sufferer John McDougall, 84, and his wife and carer Jean. Davis knocked on their front door and spoke to Mrs McDougall, asking her the time, before leaving. Later, having established his targets were elderly and vulnerable, he returned and this time demanded money. Judge Griffiths said: ‘You then proceeded to inflict a cowardly physical attack on Mr and Mrs McDougall, at one point deploying a walking stick which you found on the premises. ‘Plainly they were in no physical state to resist your attack, which was gratuitous. ‘You made off with some of their personal . items - jewellery and some cash - and a short time later you boasted to . a friend about what you had just done.’ Hearing: Davis, now 18, was sentenced earlier this month at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) in Kent . Mr and Mrs McDougall were found by a neighbour, covered in blood and seriously injured. The woman asked police that images of her injuries be shown to show the full severity of the attack. Judge Griffiths said: ‘The psychological trauma inflicted on both victims inevitably was very substantial.’ In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs McDougall said: ‘I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep. ‘I would say I now feel 90 years, whereas before I felt about 60. My comfortable existence has been shot to pieces. If I hear a noise when I’m in bed I lie there terrified. ‘John is not well at all. He has lost . about a stone in weight. He complains about his head being sore. He . suffers terrible headaches. John and I are prisoners in our own home . now. 'Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you wanted to show off to your friends' Judge David Griffiths QC . ‘I feel as if my life stopped on that day in October and now I have a new life which is full of worry and anxiety and difficulties. ‘The only time I had seen violence in my life was when I was in the Army serving in the Second World War. Apart from that I’ve had a good and happy life, which halted in October’. Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, two counts of GBH with intent, one count of wounding with intent, and two counts of burglary. The second burglary offence relates to a separate incident in the autumn of last year, in which Davis burgled a sports pavilion in Hextable. Detective Constable Shelley Rainer of Kent Police, who led the investigation, said after the case: ‘This case involved an extremely violent assault on three innocent pensioners, for very little financial gain. ‘It is a case that has caused immeasurable damage to the victims, their families and the community they live in. ‘The victims’ courage in supporting the police has led to the successful conviction and prevented other offences in the future. ‘Despite the age of the defendant the judge has imposed a significant sentence that I think reflects the serious nature of the offences and also the threat that he poses to society.’","Aaron Davis, of Hextable, Kent, has been jailed for ten and a half years .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . An obsession with being too clean and hygienic could lead to a higher risk of dementia, researchers have warned. Their study pinpointed a significant relationship between a nation’s cleanliness and the number of Alzheimer’s patients. Countries which can afford better sanitation have higher rates of the disease. Scroll down for video... The study  found a 'very significant' relationship between a nation's wealth and hygiene and number of Alzheimer's patients within a country's population . So Britons and inhabitants of other . developed nations were around ten per cent more likely to suffer . dementia than those in countries like Kenya and Cambodia. The . researchers suggested the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ was behind the . difference. This is the theory that an excessively clean lifestyle . leaves our immune systems out of balance and unable to combat many . germs. It has already been linked to the rise in the number of allergies, such as asthma and eczema. One . in three Britons over 65 will develop dementia. Alzheimer’s and other . forms of the condition blight the lives of more than 800,000, with 500 . new cases each day. Lead . researcher Dr Molly Fox, from Cambridge University, said: ‘The hygiene . hypothesis is well-established. We can now add Alzheimer’s to this list . of diseases. ‘There are important implications, especially in developing countries as they increase in sanitation.’ The . study of health data from 192 nations found those with a relatively low . risk of infection had more patients with Alzheimer’s. Clean environments in developed nations result in far less exposure to a diverse range of bacteria (pictured). This might cause the immune system to develop poorly and could expose the brain to the inflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease . Likewise, . better sanitation and urban living were linked with a higher incidence . of the disease, irrespective of life expectancy. Taken together, these . factors accounted for 42.5 per cent of the variation in rates of . Alzheimer’s between countries. Dr Fox said changes in diet, life expectancy and healthcare could not explain the differences. The . researchers found that exposure to germs throughout an individual’s . lifetime, not just early on, may affect the risk of dementia. A . lack of contact upsets the development of white blood cells, . particularly those called T-cells, which are a key part of the immune . system. This imbalance has . been linked to the types of inflammation found in the brains of those . with Alzheimer’s, said the report in the journal Evolution, Medicine and . Public Health. Dr Fox added: ‘We need to find the right balance of exposure.’ A . spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘It is an interesting . theory. However, it is always difficult to pin causality to one factor.’ The best way to cut risk is to eat healthily, exercise, not smoke and keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check, he added. Countries where more than three-quarters of the population are located in urban areas, such as the UK and Australia, had 10 per cent higher rates of Alzheimer’s compared to countries, such as Bangladesh and Nepal, where less than one-tenth of people inhabit urban areas. VIDEO: Dr Molly Fox discusses her research on the link between hygiene and Alzheimer's . Overall, differences in levels of sanitation, infectious disease and urbanisation accounted for 33 per cent, 36 per cent and 28 per cent of the variation in Alzheimer’s rate between countries. Previous research has shown that Alzheimer’s affects fewer people in Latin America, China and India than it does in Europe. Even within those regions, prevalence is lower in urban than in rural areas, according to the new findings. The hygiene hypothesis is based on the assumption that lack of contact with 'dirt' in the form of bacteria and other infectious agents upsets the development of white blood cells, key elements of the immune system. In particular, T-cells are said to be affected. T-cells have a variety of functions, including attacking and destroying foreign invaders and marshalling other parts of the immune system. Some, known as 'regulatory' T-cells, reign in the immune system when it starts to get out of control. Dysfunctional regulatory T-cells can lead to inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Regulatory T-cell deficiency is linked to the type of inflammation commonly found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Today, more than 50 per cent of people with Alzheimer's live in the developing world, and by 2025 it is expected that this figure will rise to more than 70 per cent . ‘Exposure to microorganisms is critical for the regulation of the immune system,’ wrote the researchers. They added that, since increasing global . urbanisation beginning at the turn of the 19th century, the populations . of many of the world’s wealthier nations have increasingly very little . exposure to the so-called ‘friendly’ microbes due to ‘diminishing . contact with animals, faeces and soil.’ ‘The increase in adult life expectancy . and Alzheimer’s prevalence in developing countries is perhaps one of the . greatest challenges of our time,’ said Dr Fox. ‘Today, more than 50 per cent of people with Alzheimer’s live in the developing world, and by 2025 it is expected that this figure will rise to more than 70 per cent. ‘A better understanding of how environmental sanitation influences Alzheimer’s risk could open up avenues for both lifestyle and pharmaceutical strategies to limit Alzheimer’s prevalence.’ The hygiene hypothesis is normally thought to be most relevant in childhood, when the immune system is still developing. But in the case of Alzheimer’s, exposure to microbes across a person’s lifetime might be important, say the scientists. This is because regulatory T-cell numbers peak at various points in life, for example at adolescence and middle age. The results of the study are published by the journal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health.","Study looked at link between cleanliness and Alzheimer's in 192 countries .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Spared jail: Gianna Registe, 21, walked free from court today after carrying out a £2,500 Boots loyalty card scam - and blowing the lot on make-up . A 21-year-old model walked free from court today after she carried out a £2,500 loyalty card scam while working for Boots - and blew the lot on make-up. Gianna Registe amassed 25,000 points on her Boots Advantage Card as she worked as an optical assistant at the chemist’s flagship store in Oxford Street, central London. She credited the card with fake sales and rewards by introducing people for eye tests  - before spending it all on make-up. 'She spent the £2,500 on cosmetics and other toiletry items,' Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court. Now, Registe, who is listed as a commercial/alternative model for Fusion Management, has been sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Registe’s four-month scam was discovered after her suspicious bosses at Boots launched an investigation last year, the court heard. She has since found a new job as an . optical assistant for high street chain Specsavers - but has so far . failed to inform her new employers about the fraud. Wearing a smart black trouser suit with a designer Louis . Vuitton bag hanging off her arm, Registe was stony-faced as she was . sentenced today. Sentencing the model, Judge David Higgins told her: ‘Briefly, as an employee at Boots, you used a staff loyalty card to acquire points to the value of £2,500. ‘In one way or another you used them all. This amounted to a gross, sustained and relatively sophisticated breach of trust over a period of three to four months. ‘Your criminal wrongdoing became routine and your behaviour was deeply deplorable and antisocial. Fraud: Registe amassed 25,000 points on her Boots Advantage Card as she worked as an optical assistant at the chemist's flagship store in Oxford Street, London. She credited the card with fake sales and rewards . Make-up spree: 'She then spent the £2,500 on cosmetics and other toiletry items,' said prosecutor Peter Zinner . ‘If you choose to behave in this way you . must accept the consequences, which the courts have made clear are . likely to be severe.’ However, the judge added that he had been persuaded that Registe's remorse was sincere. Julia Smart, defending, told the court Registe was ‘hard working’ and had raised hundreds of pounds for good causes - including £300 by shaving her head. She has also volunteered for . disadvantaged children in Hackney, east London, and has run the Race For . Life to raise cash for Cancer Research and Macmillan Cancer Research, . he said. Scene: Now, Registe, who is listed as a commercial/alternative model for Fusion Management, has been sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Above, the Boots store she worked at . ‘From the moment the fraud was . discovered by Boots she has never sought to deflect blame from herself . or excuse her conduct in any way at all,' said Mr Smart. ‘It is with great sadness and shame that she finds herself before here today. In every other respect she is a role model for young women.' Registe, from Manor Park, east London, admitted a single count of making or adapting articles for use in fraud. She was ordered to complete 50 hours' unpaid work within a year and must repay Boots £2,500 in compensation, as well as an £80 victim surcharge.

"By . Sam Webb . A mother-of-two convinced she had pancreatic cancer died from the disease after 10 months of having her fears dismissed by doctors. Andrea Charlesworth, 43, from Ilkeston in Derbyshire began suffering from stomach pains in April last year. When she researched her symptoms on Google and began to believe that she had either ovarian or pancreatic cancer and went straight to her doctor. Andrea Charlesworth, 43 (right, pictured with Sister Amy), from Ilkeston in Derbyshire began suffering from stomach pains in April last year. She was convinced she had pancreatic cancer but tests did not detect it. Just 10 months later she was dead . But after tests for ovarian cancer were negative and she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, her family thought there was nothing too serious to worry about. When Andrea's health deteriorated doctors dealt with the two blood clots on her lungs but never managed to diagnose the underlying problem. And just a week before she died in January when she was bed-bound, an NHS helpline adviser suggested she get up and do some exercise. Family: Andrea Charlesworth with her grandson Lucas. Family paid tribute to the 'kind and loving mum and grandma' Far from being able to get out of bed, within six days her mother Glynis, 61, and sister Amy Charlesworth, 26, had found her dead at her home. Amy said: 'It's a heart-breaking situation thinking she knew what it was for all that time. 'We are just trying to make something positive out of a terrible situation.' Andrea didn't open the door when Glynis and Amy went to pick her up for a scheduled hospital appointment to treat her blood clot. When they finally got a spare set of keys and made it in Andrea was in her bed and not breathing. Screaming in horror, Amy ran into the street for help and called an ambulance but it was too late and neither CPR from a neighbour nor paramedics could save her. Devastatingly, her post-mortem revealed she had been right all along. She had died from heart failure caused by pancreatic cancer. Now her mother and sister are desperately raising awareness in the hope that the same tragedy will not strike another family. Amy, who is doing a sponsored 10k next week to raise money for Pancreatic Cancer Action, said there is not enough education about pancreatic cancer . Stoic: Amy Charlesworth and her mother Glynis. The pair are desperately raising awareness in the hope that the same tragedy will not strike another family . Pancreatic cancer is responsible for around 9,000 deaths in the UK every year, with fewer than four per cent of patients surviving five years or more after diagnosis. It is the ninth most common cancer - around 9,000 are diagnosed annually. Symptoms tend to manifest once the cancer is advanced and include unexpected weight loss, upper abdominal pain and jaudice - all of which could be a multitude of illnesses. So the condition is often diagnosed late. Treatment ideally involves removal of the tumour, though such surgery is only suitable for up to 20 per cent of patients. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be offered. Andrea . leaves behind a daughter Leah, 16, a son Luke, 23, and a one-year-old . grandson Lucas, as well as a large family including her two brothers . Adrian 41, and Aaron, 31. Amy, . who is doing a sponsored 10k next week to raise money for Pancreatic . Cancer Action, said: 'People aren't educated well enough about . pancreatic cancer. 'Although it's more common in older people, it can strike young women and we want to help people realise that. 'No-one else should have to go through what Andrea did. 'A test suggested there was a high chance of cancer and Andrea became hysterical. 'But an emergency ultrasound revealed she didn't have ovarian cancer and ultimately she was never diagnosed with any kind of cancer. 'Her laugh was unmistakable and she was well-known and well-liked by everyone. 'But most of all she was a kind and loving mum and grandma and that's been taken away now.'

A mindless thug who stabbed a teenager to death after gatecrashing a party advertised on Facebook was caught smiling on CCTV just half an hour after the brutal killing. Edward Redman, 18, who was jailed for life yesterday for the murder of Jay Whiston, 17, was seen catching a bus and talking on his mobile phone in the aftermath of the horrifying incident in Colchester, Essex. The unemployed thug also appeared relaxed as he walked with two friends in an underpass. Chelmsford Crown Court heard heard that 17-year-old Whiston was stabbed twice after he tried to defend his friend in what was described as a 'senseless and tragic' attack, in September 2012. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Edward Redman killed Jay Whiston in a brutal stabbing. Just half an hour after the murder, he was caught smirking as he spoke on his mobile phone . Chelmsford Crown court heard that Edward Redman, right, stabbed Jay Whiston, left, twice in an attack which was described as 'vicious and cold blooded' Aftermath: Redman was pictured looking relaxed with friends just an hour after the 17-year-old was declared dead . A jury took just three hours to find Redman guilty of murder, following a 12-week trial. Unemployed Redman was told he will have to serve a minimum of 17 years when sentenced this afternoon. Mr . Whiston's mother Caroline Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly . emotional victim impact statement delivered shortly before the sentence . was handed down. She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. 'Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do. 'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. 'Jay’s heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn’t miss it.' Casual: He then caught a bus, and video footage showed him talking on the phone and sitting on the back seat . Spotted: He crossed a railway line to reach the bus stop on the night of the stabbing . Jay Whiston was stabbed twice and collapsed outside the house, pictured, where the party was being held in Colchester, Essex in September 2012 . The court . heard that the attack happened on the evening of September 8, 2012 after . a party had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter. Around 100 youngsters appeared at the house on the cul-de-sac in Colchester for the party, including Redman. The court heard the party had been initially well organised until a number of uninvited guests, including Redman arrived. The jury heard that Redman and his friends 'spread an air of fear' and told party goers that they were 'tooled up'. In an emotional victim impact statement Mr Whiston's mother Caroline Shearer, said 'when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out'. She is pictured beside Mr Whiston's step-father Mike Shearer . The court heard that Jay Whiston, pictured here in France in 2009, tried to defend a friend when he was attacked at the house party . The court heard that a confrontation developed when one of Redman's associates attempted to steal alcohol from Mr Whiston's friends. Redman stabbed Mr Whiston inside the house before following him onto the street where he delivered the second, fatal wound. A post mortem found that Jay Whiston suffered one stab wound to the abdomen and a fatal wound to the upper chest . The court heard that Mr Whiston, from Clacton, Essex, collapsed onto the street and was rushed to hospital. He was declared dead at 10.57pm. A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Whiston suffered two stab wounds, one to the abdomen with the fatal blow to the upper chest. Prosecution counsel Mark Milliken-Smith told the court: 'This case demonstrates the senseless and tragic taking of a . young life, so full of promise. 'It’s another desperate example . of the catastrophe and heartbreak brought about by the indiscriminate . and cowardly use of knives. 'If any more evidence was needed that . knife crime was prevalent, the events didn’t take place in a . gang-overrun inner city estate but at a party staged at a house in . suburban Colchester.' Redman's father Gary, 52, his brother John and former girlfriend Shannon Fenlon were all convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Police investigating the killing said they had been faced with a “web of lies spun” by the defendants. Gary and John Redman received a two year jail term while nursery assistant Ms Fenlon was jailed for nine months. Speaking . after the sentencing, Chris McCann from the CPS East of England, said: 'This is a case where, as every parent fears, a party got out of hand . with tragic consequences for Jay Whiston and his family. 'More than 100 people turned up - many of them uninvited - among them Edward Redman and his friends. 'They . brought an air of unpleasantness, intimidation and menace with them . which tragically ended in Jay’s death after he told Redman they didn’t . want any trouble. 'Sadly, that is exactly what happened as Redman took offense and stabbed him. 'This . was a difficult investigation given the number of witnesses who . attended the party and the efforts by the Redmans to conceal the truth . but the prosecution worked hard to put the correct facts before the jury . and after hearing all the evidence the jury was clearly convinced by . the prosecution case, returning their guilty verdict after just three . hours.' Judge Charles Gratwicke described the crime as 'a vicious, cold blooded stabbing'. Immediately after the stabbing, Redman was heard on the phone saying: 'Just tell them there was a big fight. You don't know anything about it.'","Edward Redman, 18, will serve a minimum of 17 years for 'senseless' murder .

"By . Sarah Harris . A fifth of students are unemployed six months after graduating from some British universities, figures show. Amid stiff competition for graduate jobs, they fail to get work despite studying for three years and building up debts. The chances of landing a job vary considerably between institutions. Fourteen universities have unemployment rates above 15 per cent. Prospects: Where graduates study has a big impact on their chances of finding a job . Some students are around ten times more likely to be left unemployed than those graduating from other mainstream degree courses. At London South Bank University, 22.6 . per cent of students were not working or embarking on further study six . months after graduating last summer, figures from the Higher Education . Statistics Agency show. The unemployment rate stood at 20.6 . per cent at the University of East London and 18.9 per cent at the . University of Bolton. The national average was 9.2 per cent. The agency’s figures will be . particularly alarming for undergraduates who started degree courses last . September when tuition fees were tripled to up to £9,000 a year. Some . could leave with debts of around £30,000. The best performing mainstream university was Robert Gordon in Aberdeen where only 2.3 per cent of students were out of work. Among the prestigious Russell Group . of universities – considered to be some of the best in the country – all . but one had an unemployment rate below 10 per cent. Top of the class: Every student to leave the Royal Academy of Music, London found work, the survey found . It was 12.5 per cent at Queen Mary, University of London. Graduates from some of the . institutions with the lowest unemployment rates are so successful . because they have been on niche courses that aim to give them the . training to shoehorn them into their vocations. All 25 graduates from the Royal . Academy of Music in Central London were employed or studying after . finishing their course last year, along with 98.9 per cent at the . Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in South-East London. The figures also showed that students . from Northampton and Derby universities were more likely to be in work . than Oxbridge graduates. Only 92 per cent of graduates who were at Oxford had a job six months after finishing their studies . Northampton had an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent, while Derby’s was 3.9 per cent.

The majority of the 163 UK . institutions surveyed by the statistics agency saw between 90 and 95 per . cent of students in work or study six months after graduating, while at . 18 universities more than 95 per cent of students were in this . category. Other data released by the agency . last week found that the number of graduates taking menial jobs such as . shelf stackers, rubbish collectors and cleaners has almost doubled over . the past six years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A 57-year-old woman who was found mauled to death by two neighbor's dogs last week had complained to police on at least nine . occasions about the vicious dogs. Friends and co-workers of Klonda Richey say she lived in fear of her neighbor's two Bullmastiffs, both of which were shot Friday by police after they found Richey's naked body strewn outside her house. Documents filed with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department and Animal Resource Center show that Richey reported her neighbors terrorizing dogs on several occasions. Tragic: Cat-lover Klonda Richey, 57 (pictured with former Montgomery County Republican Party Chairman Rob Scott) was mauled to death by two vicious Bullmastiffs outside her Ohio home on Friday . ARC director Mark Kumpf said he was aware of nine complaints about the dogs responsible for her death. Richey called to complain about the dogs at least six times, and her concerns were mostly related to their barking: 'Dog is straining to get to water and food that are empty, advised is ongoing issue'. 'We are aware of additional complaints, unfortunately, the owners have never responded to any of our calls to the best of our knowledge. We are looking into this matter,' Kumpf said. 'She's always been terrified of those dogs,' coworker Tim Bridwell told the Dayton Daily News. 'She told me, and a lot of other people, she was afraid those dogs were going to kill her.' Richey's lacerated body was found naked on snow-covered Bruce Avenue, Dayton about 8:15am, thrashed by her next door neighbors' male mixed breed Bullmastiffs. Richey's next-door neighbors, 28-year-old Andrew Nason and 23-year-old Julie Custer, were taken into custody after the attack. Arrested: Richey's next-door neighbors, Andrew Nason (right) and Julie . Custer (left) were taken into custody on Friday and were held on a . charge of reckless homicide, pending the filing of formal charges .

'My right hand man!' Julie Custer, who was arrested over the death of her neighbor, posted a picture of this dog to her Facebook page in 2012 . They were released Sunday evening as the investigation is on going. WDTN reported Custer, a Wright State University nursing graduate and mother, was the registered owner of the dogs. The Montgomery County Coroner's Office has not released a cause of death yet. Mourners have started putting up flowers outside Richey's home as a memorial. News of the shocking incident has devastated Richey's family and friends, who they described as a caring person who doted on her 20 cats. She had worked at Montgomery County Job & Family Services Administration Services Division for 25 years. 'It's so ironic that this devout animal lover would be killed by animals in such a brutal aggressive way,' colleague Ann Stevens said. 'Every conversation I had with Klonda included cats - she was very passionate about animals and their well being and because of that she always had a special place in my heart.' Richey was also an active Republican party volunteer, according to Dayton Daily News, and campaigned for Mitt Romney. Rob Scott, former chairman of the Montgomery County Republican party, met Richey when he became chairman of the party in April 2012. 'She was always smiling and upbeat and positive, I never heard her say one negative thing about anyone,' he said. 'She always looked on the positive side of life.' It is understood Richey lived alone in her clapboard home with her beloved cats. In the wake of Friday's attack, Montgomery County Animal Control Resource Center officers removed her cats, which were well cared for. They are reportedly being adopted by her friends.

"By . Amanda Williams . The Vatican has disciplined 3,500 priests since 2004 for raping and molesting children, it has today been revealed. Almost 850 of the priests have been defrocked and 2,572 have been given lesser sanctions - such as a 'lifetime of penance and prayer' - over the past decade. Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, revealed the figures during a second day of questionning by a U.N. committee monitoring implementation of the U.N. treaty against torture. Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, has revealed that the Vatican has disciplined 3,500 priests since 2004 for raping and molesting children . Almost 850 of the priests have been defrocked and 2,572 have been given lesser sanctions - such as a 'lifetime of penance and prayer' - over the past decade . He said that since 2004, more than 3,400 credible cases of abuse had been referred to the Vatican . He said that since 2004, more than 3,400 credible cases of abuse had been . referred to the Vatican. In 2013 alone, 401 cases were recorded. He . said that over the last decade, 848 priests had been defrocked, or . returned to the lay state by the pope. Another 2,572 were sentenced to a . lifetime of penance and prayer or some other lesser sanction, which is . often used when the accused priest is elderly or infirm. Tomasi insisted the convention applied only inside the tiny Vatican City state. But he released statistics revealing how the Holy See has adjudicated sex abuse cases globally, and significantly, he did not dispute the committee's contention that sexual violence against children can be considered torture. Tomasi said the lesser sanctions still amounted to disciplinary action. He said that the abuser is 'just put in a place where he doesn't have any contact with the children.' In January it was revealed that Pope Benedict XVI had defrocked 384 priests in the final two years of his pontificate, . He cited documentation that Tomasi's delegation had prepared for another U.N. committee hearing that matched data contained in the Vatican's statistical yearbooks. Tomasi said those figures from January were 'incomplete' and that the data he provided the torture committee Tuesday — the first ever year-by-year breakdown of how cases were adjudicated — was complete. He told the committee that 'there is no climate of impunity but there is a total commitment to clean the house' and prevent more abuse. 'I think we have crossed a threshold so to say in our evolution of the approach to these problems,' he concluded. 'It's clear that the issue of sexual abuse of children, which is a worldwide plague and scourge, has been addressed in the last 10 years by the church in a systematic, comprehensive, constructive way.' In January it was revealed that Pope Benedict XVI had defrocked 384 priests in the final two years of his pontificate . The Vatican has released the first-ever complete statistics on the number of sex abuse cases reported to the Holy See and how they were adjudicated. The vast majority of reported cases concern abuse that occurred years or even decades earlier. The sanctions only cover cases directly handled by the Holy See, not those handled by local diocesan tribunals, meaning the total numbers of priests defrocked or otherwise disciplined is likely far higher. 2004: 713 cases reported, 89 priests defrocked, 641 priests disciplined with lesser penalties.2005: 184 cases, 84 defrocked, 100 disciplined2006: 218 cases, 114 defrocked, 104 disciplined2007: 216 cases, 84 defrocked, 132 disciplined2008: 191 cases, 68 defrocked, 123 disciplined2009: 196 cases, 69 defrocked, 127 disciplined2010: 464 cases, 84 defrocked, 380 disciplined2011: 402 cases, 143 defrocked, 259 disciplined2012: 418 cases, 70 defrocked, 348 disciplined2013: 401 cases, 43 defrocked, 358 disciplined.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A teenager broke down in tears after a dance instructor asked her to perform 'erotically' on stage to the controversial song Blurred Lines, her parents have claimed. Bella Hobbs, 14, was allegedly asked to push her cleavage out, pull her skirt up to her crotch and gyrate her hips during the lesson at The Castle School in Thornbury, near Bristol. When Bella refused, the Year 10 pupil was forced to argue with her Zumba instructor - who was an external teacher from outside the school - in front of friends, her parents say. Scroll down for video . Bella Hobbs, 14, a pupil at the Castle School in Thornbury, near Bristol (pictured above), was allegedly reduced to tears after her Zumba dance instructor asked her to perfom erotically to the controversial song Blurred Lines . She also had to apparently say 'no' four times before the instructor allowed her to sit out of the dance. Now Bella’s 'horrified' parents, Catherine Hobbs and . Neil Castleton, from Thornbury, are demanding an apology from the school. They say the song - which has been criticised for glorifying rape and sexual violence - should never have been played in front of the children. The chart-topping single, written by Robin Thicke, was even banned by some student unions over its controversial lyrics after it was released last summer. Ms Hobbs, 44, a former teacher who now works as a therapist, said: 'I am not a prude, I am a liberal person . and I haven’t got a problem with sexuality, but for a child to feel . worried that what they are doing is dirty and rude, that is wrong.' Ms Hobbs claims her daughter came home from school in a state of distress. Bella told her parents she felt 'dirty' about being asked to perform the moves because they were 'too sexy'. Robin Thicke, left, has been criticised for the lyrics in his song Blurred Lines, which he performed in raunchy fashion alongside controversial singer Miley Cyrus at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August, right . She said: 'Bella said that she was unhappy about the way that she was asked to dance, she said it was dirty. 'When she showed me the dance that she was expected to do, I would have been horrified. 'She said she was told to dance by pushing her cleavage out and wiggling her chest, pulling her skirt up to her crotch and gyrating her hips.' Ms Hobbs also said it must have been hard for her daughter to stand her ground so many times. Melanie Warnes, executive headmaster at the school, pictured above, said Bella's mother and father were the only parents to complain. She said the two PE teachers overseeing the lesson did not notice the song being played . She claims the two teachers observing the Zumba class subliminally endorsed the sexualisation of children by not stopping the dance. Ms Hobbs said she is now concerned about the impact the alleged incident will have on the other children. She said Bella did not understand the song and she had to spend two hours explaining to her daughter why the graphic lyrics were wrong. But Melanie Warnes, the school’s executive headmaster, said Bella’s mother and father were the only parents to make a complaint about the Zumba classes. She said the lyrics would not have been audible underneath the shouted instructions and the general sound of 50 students and children making noise. The two experienced female PE teachers, who were overseeing the lesson, did not notice the song being played, she said. She said: 'We are investigating and we would take it very seriously if any age inappropriate lyrics have been used. 'The teachers were not aware that any inappropriate dance moves had been made.' She added that Bella, as an experienced dancer, had been asked to demonstrate but refused and there was 'no issue made'. She said the song was most likely part of an iPod playlist of lively dance music and the teachers were 'not aware of anybody being uncomfortable'.","Bella Hobbs was allegedly asked to dance erotically during a Zumba class .

"By . Lucy Crossley . and Liz Hull . A baby-faced gang of thugs are today facing life behind bars after stabbing a defenceless teenager to death with a 2ft sword. In a terrifying example of the knife crime blighting Britain, the five – two of them aged just 13 – were part of a gang who chased Sean McHugh, 19, into a launderette and killed him. As he lay dying in hospital, the yobs sent each other a series of chilling messages mocking their victim. Liverpool Crown Court heard gang member Keyfer Dykstra, 14, posted on Facebook: ‘RIP Shorty – we always knew ye was a pussy’. Eleven people ‘liked’ the comment. Baby-faced: Fourteen-year-olds Keyfer Dykstra (left) and Joseph McGill (right) were part of the gang that chased victim Sean McHugh into a launderette before he was fatally stabbed . Cousins: Corey Hewitt, 14, (left) and his cousin Andrew Hewitt, 15, (right) were also found guilty of the 'vicious and brutal' murder after the two month trial . Fourteen-year-olds Keyfer  Dykstra, Joseph McGill and Corey Hewitt, plus his 15-year-old cousin Andrew Hewitt were all convicted of the 'vicious and brutal' attack in Anfield, Liverpool, along with 19-year-old Reese O’Shaughnessy. Recorder . of Liverpool, Clement Goldstone QC, took the unusual step of naming the . young gang members after a jury found them guilty. The boys were also slammed by a detective in the case, who said they had shown little remorse for . their actions, including the suffering heaped upon Mr McHugh and his family. The senior police officer also said he heard the boys laughing and joking as they sat in the dock. Victim Mr McHugh had been walking down the street with friend Josh Williams were walking back from a launderette in Anfield when they were approached by some of the gang. Victim: Sean McHugh, 19, was chased down the street and into a launderette by the gang members, before he was attacked with the weapon and stabbed in the leg, slashing open a major artery . As . Mr Williams sought refuge inside a nearby newsagent, Mr McHugh, who was . known as Shorty, was chased back into the launderette. O’Shaughnessy, . who was carrying a sword stick - a walking cane with a blade hidden . inside - and Dykstra, armed with a knife arrived a short time later and . the gang kicked the back door of the shop open. During the trial, Liverpool . Crown Court heard O’Shaughnessy stabbed Mr McHugh in the leg before the . wounded teenager managed to escaped into the back garden of a nearby . home. Ringleader: Liverpool Crown Court heard that Reese O'Shaughnessy, 19, had been carrying the sword stick . However, prosecutors . were unable to prove just who struck the fatal blow but argued that all . involved in the attack were guilty of murder whether they held the . blade of not. A policeman found Mr McHugh bleeding heavily . from the gaping wound and although the teen was rushed to hospital he . died four days after the attack on September 30 last year. Nicholas . Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the court that the boys referred to . themselves as the ‘Laneheads’, after the gang’s territory around the . Townsend Lane area of Anfield. Rivals Mr McHugh and Mr Williams, were called ‘Village Rats’, because they came from the Walton Village area of Liverpool. As the younger boys were under 18, orders banning their identities from being released had been put in place by the court, a practice common in cases involving children. Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, described the crime as 'difficult and sensitive' and said the trial had been 'particularly traumatic'. Due to the serious nature of their crimes, Judge Goldstone decided that he would lift the anonymity orders. He said: 'I am quite satisfied the criteria for the naming of the . defendants is made out. 'It is in the public interest they be named.' A sixth boy, who always protested that he was not at the scene of the . murder, was found not guilty and released from the dock with his . identity protected. Speaking . after the conclusion of the trial, Detective Chief Inspector Andy . O’Connor from Merseyside Police said: 'Since the attack, none of the . five have shown any remorse for what they did to Sean. 'They even laughed and joked in the dock at court. 'They have shown no thought, or . consideration, for Sean’s family and girlfriend, who are now left to . grieve and to piece their lives together without him. 'The suffering Sean endured before his death and the pain and heartbreak inflicted on his family can never be taken back.' Weapon: The sword stick used by the gang to attack Mr McHugh. The teenager was stabbed in the leg, severing a major artery . Terror: Mr McHugh was chased into the Liver Launderette by the gang, who kicked the door to the back of the shop open and stabbed him in the leg . Escape: Mr McHugh managed to escape the gang but was found bleeding heavily in a nearby back garden. He was taken to hospital but later died . Rachael Barber, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: 'Most of the gang were just children at the time. 'But were willing to use deadly weapons and acted together to attack Mr McHugh, which ultimately resulted in his death.' Reports on the boys’ maturity, psychology and dangerousness will be compiled before sentencing on July 2. Territory: Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that the boys referred to themselves as the 'Laneheads', after the gang's territory around the Townsend Lane area of Anfield .","Victim Sean McHugh, 19, was chased into a launderette by gang of teens .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Al-Qaeda terrorists held a massive military rally just a few miles from the U.S. State Department compound in Benghazi, Libya during the summer of 2012 and called for the murder of U.S. diplomats, it was revealed today. And the U.S. government knew about it by August, a full month before the attack that left the American ambassador and three others dead, official papers state. Black al-Qaeda flags were out in full . force at the June 7-8 event, a two-day rally including 300 armed men . gathered in Benghazi's Al-Tahrir Square. Just . days later on June 11, bombers targeted the Benghazi U.S. mission, . blowing 40-foot hole in the installation's perimeter wall. The larger attack came three months later. The U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi erupted in flames during a terror attack by armed militants on September 11, 2012, just months after al-Qaeda-linked groups rallied in the city with dozens of military vehicles . Ansar al-Sharia, the group behind the Benghazi attack, frequently holds rallies in Northern Africa like this one in Tunisia. The U.S. government knew a similar event happened in Benghazi in June 2012, yet did nothing to shore up security . The Library of Congress report, prepared for a Defense Department intelligence subagency, described the June Benghazi rally in detail, saying it involved 'battalions' of jihadis from several Libyan cities . On Wednesday Investors Business Daily drew on research by the nonprofit American Media Institute to detail parts of a damning August 2012 report by the Library of Congress's federal research arm. The report, delivered to the federal government two months later, predicted al-Qaeda would soon begin employing 'selective terrorism, threats, intimidation and assassination.' It described 'dozens of military vehicles' on display in June, including heavy automatic machine guns, rocket launchers and truck-mounted anti-aircraft weapons. 'They had a crapload . of stuff,' a former U.S. security officer told IBD. 'They were itching to use . it.' Islamists at the event, organized by the al-Qaeda-linked group Ansar al-Sharia, made credible threats that terrorists were prepared to assassinate U.S. personnel in the city. 'It was like a team pep rally before the game, only for jihad,"" a U.S. intelligence analyst told the newspaper. 'Organized and deadly. You saw what followed. People died.' The U.S. military has long known that al-Qaeda's model moves quickly from the establishment of clandestine terror cells to open attacks on Westerners in urban areas . Military hardware is everywhere in Benghazi: A truck-mounted heavy machine gun belonging to Katiba al-A'hrar Libya -- 'Libya shield' -- a group the State Department trusted to help secure the Benghazi compound. They fled when the fighting erupted, and some reports say they joined in the attack . Katiba al-A'hrar Libya posted a photo of this self-propelled antiaircraft gun on Facebook, showing the kind of military muscle jihadi groups in Benghazi had at their disposal . Ansar al-Sharia was later named as the . group most likely behind the September 11 attack, which left the U.S. diplomatic station and a nearby CIA annex in ruins. According to the August 2012 report, American intelligence analysts documented a 'military show of force' consisting of 'a parade in which some 30 battalions from Benghazi, Darnah, Misrata, Al-Nufilyah, Ajdabiyah, and other Libyan towns took part in the first meeting in support of sharia in Benghazi.' 'Islamist leaders pointed out that the aim of the military parade was to ""terrorize"" those who do not want to be judged by God's law.' The unclassified August report, issued under an agreement with the Defense Department's Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office, coincided with a State Department warning, telling U.S. citizens to avoid traveling in Libya. But during the same time the agency refused to provide Ambassador Chris Stevens and his team with long-requested additional security. Flags like this al-Qaeda banner flew above Benghazi in June 2012 during a rally designed to terrify westerners and anyone else who refused to accept shariah law . Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda-affiliated group, has tanks, rocket launchers, and other heavy weapons at their disposal throughout the Arab world. This image was captured in southern Yemen on April 28, 2012 . Ansar al-Sharia openly holds rallies, marches and news conferences in the Middle East, often boasting that they hold power in cities where police presences are nonexistent and government control is weak . The analyst quoted in the IBD story said that the U.S. intelligence community was well aware of the threats documented in the August report. 'We all read the same stuff,' the analyst said. 'It gets circular, going through all the relevant government agencies. That report for the Irregular Warfare office got passed around a lot.' The report also warned that al-Qaeda's senior leadership had issued 'strategic guidance' to followers in Libya, telling them to 'gather weapons, establish training camps, build a network in secret,   establish an Islamic state, and institute sharia.' The State Department did not return a phone call seeking comment. U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was viciously killed during the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attack, and security analysts now believe his death was preventable given available intelligence from the region . The attack was led by Ansar al-Sharia militants, the same group that paraded its military might and made threats of assassinations in Benghazi three months earlier .","A report prepared for the government in August 2012 described a massive military presence of Ansar al-Sharia, the group behind the Benghazi attack .
It warned 'assassinations' would follow, and said the first attack on the U.S. diplomatic station quickly followed the two-day June rally in Benghazi .

"By . Michael Zennie . The first alleged client of a Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute in Maine has ended with the alleged John being acquitted. Former Kennebunk High School hockey coach Don Hill has said he was engaged in a relationship with the woman, Alexis Wright, but he never paid for sex. Justice Roland Cole ended Hill's trial Tuesday after barring prosecutors from entering Wright's business ledger into evidence. Acquitted: Donald Hill, the former Kennebunk High School hockey coach was acquitted of paying for sex with the Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute . The trial heated up Tuesday with the defense suggesting the ledger was mishandled as evidence, but Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan called the claim 'outrageous.' Mr Hill, who has been divorced for years, was one of 68 people charged with paying for sex with Wright. At least 58 have pleaded guilty or no contest. Wright pleaded guilty and is serving a 10-month sentence, but that didn't stop her from giving her husband an entirely different story. She told him that she had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating 'sexual deviancy' in the sleepy town of Kennebunk. Different defense: He said that he had a relationship with Wright (right) and that he did not pay for sex, though her ledger was not allowed to be submitted as part of the evidence against him . Wright appeared in court last week and gave her married name, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back. Wright, 30, now maintains she was a . pawn all along. It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her . business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told . her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he . had hired her as his undercover agent. Wright . claims that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the . brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate . sting operation backed by the state of Maine. The goal, Wright claims she was told, was to catch sexual deviants in Kennebunk. Strong's attorney said Wright's claims are laughable. Pleading the Fifth: Alexis Wright, serving 10 months in jail, took the stand in August and refused to testify against Hill . Wright is claiming that her business partner Mark Strong, a private investigator, told her that he had hired her as an undercover agent . Wright's husband Jason says he believes his wife's story and is standing by her. Prosecutors say she had sex with more than 100 men for money - sometimes five in a day . 'That this woman, who had allegedly taken on 100 or so men to have sex with for money, was investigating for sexual deviancy, is the pot calling the kettle black,' lawyer Daniel G. Lilley told MailOnline. Lilley said it doesn't appear . prosecutors bought her claim. There was no evidence presented at . Strong's trial that he had said he was working for the government. Wright's . husband Jason Trowbridge, however, does seem to believe her. He stood . by his wife in an interview with a TLC documentary called 'Sex, Lies and Zumba.' 'It . sounds crazy. It just made more sense that's what was going on,' Mr . Trowbridge told the documentary. 'Put the pieces together. That fits the . story. 'People think it's a joke and people might always think it's a joke. I'll stand by her story because that's what I saw.' The attorney for Strong, who was convicted of promoting prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail, said Wright's claims are laughable . Wright first made reference to her bizarre claim when she spoke up at her sentencing hearing. She claims that the meticulous records she kept and the fact that Strong had to be watching via webcab during each of her trysts are proof that she thought she was having sex with the men as part of an official government investigation. Wright was called to the stand to testify against Donald Hill, a former high school hockey coach who was one of 68 men arrested and charged with being clients of Wright, according to the Portland Press Herald. Hill, who was forced to quit his job after he was named publicly, maintains that Wright led him to believe he was having a romantic relationship with her.","Divorced former high school coach Donald Hill was acquitted on Tuesday .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Marlon King arrives at Nottingham Crown Court where he was jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving . Former Premier League footballer Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving. The ex Sheffield United striker was driving erratically and eating ice cream behind the wheel when he caused a three-car pile up on the A46 in Nottinghamshire last April, the court heard. The footballer was seen weaving in and out of traffic before slamming on his brakes - causing another driver to perform an emergency stop. Other drivers then smashed into his vehicle, Nottingham Crown Court heard. One driver had to be cut out of his car before spending three weeks in hospital for a fractured and dislocated forearm. King pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving in March. Sentencing King in court today, Recorder Paul Mann QC said: 'I do not regard your case as merely impulsive or silly behaviour. 'It was aggressive. It was arrogant.' The judge handed King 18 months behind bars and a three-year driving ban. The court heard that King committed the offence on his 33rd birthday while driving a white 2011 Porsche Panamera. He was eating an ice cream he had bought from a McDonalds just moments before the crash, which happened at around 3pm on April 26. King was seen weaving in and out of traffic before he undertook Martin Beck, whom he perceived as travelling too slowly in the outer lane of the A46, the court heard. The former footballer slammed on his brakes in frustration, forcing Mr Beck to perform an emergency stop in his black VW Polo. As Mr Beck came to a halt, another driver in a silver Vauxhall Astra who had pulled out behind him, collided with the stationary Polo. The 'concertina effect' forced the Polo into the back of King’s Porsche. Mr Beck had to be cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital after the collision at Winthorpe near Newark. He spent three weeks in hospital and required surgery for a fractured and dislocated forearm. Mark Bush, who was travelling in the Astra, was also taken to hospital for cuts and bruises. The court heard how the ex-footballer was weaving through traffic on the A46 in Nottinghamshire while eating an ice cream from McDonald's. He then slammed on his breaks, causing a three-car pile up . The court heard that King drove off from the scene but was flagged down by another motorist who feared Mr Beck had been killed by the collision. King returned to Mr Beck’s car, where he blamed the driver for the collision. The judge told King: 'You were so pumped up with road rage, you had to start accusing him of being to blame for these collisions'. King, born 26 April 1980,  is a professional footballer who plays as a striker. He was given an 18-month jail sentence following a conviction for dangerous driving today. As of October 2009, King had convictions for 14 offences. He has previously served three jail sentences and has other criminal convictions including: fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance and theft from a person and from a car. He was also convicted of two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London in December 2008. King had his playing contract cancelled by Wigan after being convicted of the sexual assault charges. He was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.","Former Sheffield United striker Marlon King jailed for dangerous driving .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A women admitted to a Chicago hospital following an alcohol binge claims a doctor took photos of her without her consent and then posted them on Facebook. Elena Chernyakova, 23, who is claiming invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress, has filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Dr. Vinaya Puppala, who she already knew through a mutual friend, the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The incident took place on 13 June after Chernyakova was taken to the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, at 3am suffering for overconsumption of alcohol. Elena Chernyakova, left, claims Dr. Vinaya Puppala, right, took photos of her while she was recovering from an alcohol binge in ER at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago . She was allegedly unconscious for the next eight hours and wasn't released until 5.30pm that day. About 15 minutes after she regained consciousness, Puppala, who was on duty at the time and knew Chernyakova through a mutual friend, visited her hospital room, according to the complaint. He allegedly asked to view her medical records, and then returned several hours later to take photographs of her ‘while she was on the hospital bed, crying and attached to an IV,’ according to the complaint. Puppala was seen by hospital security in the hospital taking the pictures and was asked to delete them immediately, which he refused to do. Former Northwestern University student Elena Chernyakova is an aspiring model/actress, although her lawsuit claims she has the 'potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs' Instead he posted the photographs on Facebook and Instagram, along with ‘attached statements of commentary’ about her condition, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Chernyakova never agreed to be photographed, and was not even in a condition to provide her consent. The hospital and Feinberg Medical School ‘substantially assisted’ Puppala in allowing this to happen, according to the complaint. According to her website, Chernyakova is an actress, model, and ex-professional tennis player from Moscow, Russia. She started acting in July 2012 after . graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Communication . Studies, Business, and International Studies. She has appeared in . several films and TV shows, including Superhero Me, Psychotic and . Chicagolicious. According to her website, Chernyakova is an actress, model, and ex-professional tennis player from Moscow, Russia . According to her complaint, she has the ‘potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs.’ The Northwestern Memorial Hospital is investigating the allegations and has said it will cooperate with authorities, but emphasized that Puppala was acting ‘entirely on his own.’ ‘Any invasion of privacy at the hands of our trusted health personnel or extended care team of training fellows is unacceptable and not indicative of the Patients' First culture of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which has zero tolerance for exploitation of private health information, including photography,’ the hospital said in a statement to ABCNews. Puppala is a fellow in the Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship at Feinberg, Michigan, which works in conjunction with Northwestern Memorial Hospital, according to court documents.","Elena Chernyakova, 23, was admitted to a Chicago hospital following an alcohol binge .

"By . James Salmon . Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond is to be grilled by the Serious Fraud Office over alleged bribes . Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond is to be grilled by the Serious Fraud Office over alleged bribes paid by the bank to Middle East investors during the financial crisis. The tainted former chief executive is among a dozen former top bosses who will be questioned under caution by the white collar crime and anti bribery agency. Others are thought to include Mr Diamond’s predecessor John Varley, finance chief Chris Lucas, one of its top paid bankers Roger Jenkins and its top lawyer Mark Harding. All have left the bank, with Mr Diamond ousted in June 2012 after it was fined £290m for rigging Libor interest rates. An interview under caution means the SFO believes it has reasonable grounds to believe the individuals involved knew about or participated in a crime. Mr Diamond, who has denied any wrongdoing, and other former top bankers will be warned before the interview. ‘You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention something when questioned that you later rely on in court.’ The interviews mark an escalation  of a criminal probe which began in August 2012. The SFO is investigating concerns that Barclays failed to properly disclose £322million in fees it paid to Qatari investors during the bank’s two emergency cash calls in 2008. Qatar Holding, part of the Arab state’s sovereign wealth fund which invests its vast oil and gas riches, invested £5.3billion in Barclays in June and October 2008, helping it to avoid a Government bail-out. Mr Diamond was then head of the investment bank and based in New York. Roger Jenkins, the multi-millionaire former boss of Barclays’ controversial tax advisory business and a former boyfriend of supermodel Elle MacPherson, was interviewed before Easter. It is not thought an appointment has been set for his interview. But his inclusion may come as a surprise to some. Mr Diamond, who has denied any wrongdoing, will be warned before the interview . The City watchdog has already said it wants to fine Barclays £50million. Its probe centred on four senior executives, including Mr Lucas and Mr Jenkins, and not on Mr Diamond. The SFO, which was dubbed the Serious Farce Office after a series of botched investigations, has been flexing its muscle. Last week it charged three former US-based Barclays traders for allegedly conspiring to rig Libor interest rates. A spokesman for Mr Diamond said: ‘Mr Diamond will continue to assist wherever he can on anything related to Barclays but is unable to comment on any specific inquiry.’ Barclays is fighting the £50m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority and has denied wrongdoing. It refused to comment.","Bob Diamond is to be grilled by the Serious Fraud Office .

"By . Lizzie Parry . At a glance, Montana Coughlan looks like a normal teenager with no worries in the world. The 16-year-old One Direction fan loves singing, spending time with her friends and trying on make up and new clothes. Yet she knows her health could change in a moment. At any point the teen could be struck down by violent bouts of sickness, vomitting up to 20 times an hour for days on end. Montana, from Sheldon in Birmingham, suffers from a rare condition called Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome which can be triggered by anything from stress to excitement. When struck by a bout of sickness, Montana Coughlan can vomit up to 20 times a day, for days on end . When in the midst of a painful cycle she will be sick repeatedly, day and night and suffer migraines and abdominal pain. Yet despite her debilitating illness, which has meant long periods off school, she is determined to study for seven GCSEs. Montana said: 'For me, tiredness, stress or worry can trigger a cycle. 'I can start throwing up at 11pm and vomit up to 15 to 20 times an hour. 'It’s really hard to deal with because I’m up all night throwing up and then I feel tired during the day. 'My cycles are random now but frequent. They can last for three weeks and then I will be OK for a week.' Before she was struck by sickness, Montana went to stage school and appeared as an extra on the BBC 1 programme Waterloo Road. But everything changed in five years ago when she was in year six. The teenager, pictured with her mother Jackie Coughlan at the home in Birmingham, has been diagnosed with Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, which can be triggered by excitement and stress . CVS is characterised by recurrent, prolonged attacks of severe vomiting, nausea and lethargy, with no apparent cause. It is thought there might be a genetic link. Vomiting persists at frequent intervals, five to six times an hour at the peak, for periods ranging from hours to 10 days or more. It most commonly lasts for between one and four days. Symptoms include: Severe and consistent nausea up to six times an hour, pallor, headaches and abdominal pain, lethargy and dizziness. The onset of CVS can occur at any time but most commonly develops between the age of three to seven years and can persist for periods of time ranging from months to decades. Source: Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK . Her mother Jackie, 51, a hairdresser said: 'It just seemed that every month she had a bug, she was throwing up and it was to the day every month. It would last up to a week, she would vomit three times an hour.' Doctors initially suspected a virus and prescribed Gaviscon. But when Montana’s condition worsened she was referred to Heartlands and then Birmingham Children’s Hospital where specialists said it could be Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). She was issued with a passport letter which meant if she had another sickness episode she would be admitted to a ward to see a consultant straight away. Ms Coughlan, who is also mother to Daniel, 20, said: 'That letter was important because every time we had been to A&E, they would assume that it was anorexia, bulimia or was is it bullying, or a cry for help? 'I would say no. I would have to justify it. It was frustrating.' The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, faces a daily dose of a number of different drugs to help control her condition . Because of the CVS, Montana missed family trips to Venice and London and spent a two-week break to Tunisia in a hotel room being sick. Her studies also suffered. She said: 'I was missing so much school and then going back after long periods. At that age, I really struggled to catch up. 'A vomiting cycle felt like I was being punched in the stomach, I felt like I was being choked and I would have a bad migraine. 'There was no food in me and I would be drinking water because I would dehydrate so much and it would come straight back up.' Montana said she is envious of her friends and just wants to get on with her exams and move on to Sixth Form . Distraught Ms Coughlan eventually got in touch with the Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association who recommended Dr Sonny Chong, a specialist at Queen Mary’s Hospital in London. He ordered extensive tests and then prescribed tablets and vitamins. The mother-of-two said: 'Montana got better for long periods of time and the vomiting wasn’t severe and manageable.' Yet last October the teenager started suffering severe bouts again. Ms Coughland said: 'Dr Chong feels that her body has become used to the tablets. For Montana to be sick is now natural to her, it’s part of her.' Montana has now been prescribed a tablet which is used for chemotherapy patients to cope with severe sickness. She returned to school on a reduced timetable last autumn and plans to take her GCSE exams this month, but in a separate room in case she falls ill. Montana said: 'I want to go to sixth form and do exams with no worry. I’m so envious of my friends who are constantly in school and not missing anything. I want to do coursework and just do normal things.' Meanwhile, Ms Coughland is raising funds and awareness of CVS. She holds raffles at her Castle Bromwich salon and recently organised a 5km sponsored walk at Sheldon Country Park attended by family, friends and local MP John Hemming, which raised £650. She said: 'I want more people to be aware of CVS, some poor person might be suffering from this and think they just have a bug.'","Montana Coughlan suffers rare illness Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome .

A neighbor at the trailer park told WTVR that Inge ran back into the home screaming hysterically. 'Somebody call the police. My baby is dead,' Inge screamed, the neighbor said. He called 911 and emergency services were dispatched to the property. Scene of the tragedy: The incident occurred outside this trailer park home on Tuesday night . Mikayla was taken to VCU Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. While the girl's body has been sent to a state medical examiner to determine the cause of death, Chesterfield County police Lieutentant P.J.

The child's grandfather, Larry Inge, says the girl's mother had stopped at a home to drop off hair products and left the child in the car. Inge was arrested and charged with felony child neglect Thursday. She is scheduled to appear in Chesterfield County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Friday afternoon.","Tabitha Inge, 28, has been arrested for felony child neglect .

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Jill Reilly . Former Co-operative Bank boss Paul Flowers will continue to live in his £300,000, four-bedroom home in Bradford free of charge after pleading guilty at Leeds Magistrates' Court to drugs possession . Disgraced former Co-Operative Bank . boss Paul Flowers will continue to be paid £11,106 a year and live rent-free in his four-bedroom house despite pleading guilty to possessing class A drugs. The . 63-year-old minister, dubbed the Crystal Methodist, remains . indefinitely suspended from the Bradford South Methodist Circuit. Yesterday, . he was fined £525 for two counts of possessing class A drugs - . cocaine and methamphetamine - and one count of possessing class C drug . ketamine. However, the cleric has been allowed to return to the £300,000 home in Bradford bestowed to him by Methodist church leaders while they launch their own independent investigation. Until the committee reaches a conclusion - which could take months - he will also hold on to half his annual salary. In November The Mail on Sunday exposed Flowers as a recreational drug user and he was suspended by the Methodist Church and the Labour Party. He had stepped down as the Co-op Bank's chairman six months earlier over concerns about expenses. Appearing before Leeds Magistrates yesterday, Flowers spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty to the charges before being fined. After the case, a spokesman for the Methodist Church revealed it will now launch its own disciplinary investigation into Flowers' conduct. The spokesman, who was unable to comment on the potential disciplinary action, said: 'It is a confidential process so that all involved can speak freely, and it is independent of the Church leadership. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on camera: Methodist minister Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for drugs in November . 'We cannot give a deadline by which this work will be completed, but we would expect it to be before the summer.' In March, it emerged that Flowers had written to Church leaders seeking to retire from his ministerial post, but no decision on his future can be confirmed by the Ministerial Synod for West Yorkshire until the Methodist Conference in July. Until then, he is entitled to live in his 'manse' - a house bestowed to serving ministers. In court, prosecutor Claire Stevens . outlined how Flowers was arrested after he was filmed handing over £300 . for the drugs in a car in Leeds in November, last year. Ms . Stevens said the footage showed the defendant counting out £300 in £20 . notes as he sat in the car, then handing it to another person in the . vehicle. The . prosecutor told the District Judge that Flowers was a former chairman of the . Co-op Bank, a Methodist minister a former borough councillor and . chairman of governors at a primary school. She said he was interviewed three times by police and he admitted to officers that it was him in the video. Ms . Stevens said: 'He said he had been a cocaine user for the past 18 . months. He cited stress and the care of his terminally ill mother as . reasons for his drug use. 'As . a former chairman of Lifeline, the national drugs charity, he said he . was aware of the effects of cocaine and this was a drug used to keep . himself going.' She said another man Flowers thought was a friend ""sold his story to the Mail on Sunday for greed'. Paul Flowers leaves Leeds Magistrates Court in Leeds after pleading guilty to charges of drugs possession . He stepped down as Co-op Bank chairman in June last year after reported claims of illegal drug use . Flowers stood in front of the dock in court for the 10-minute hearing yesterday. The church will now launch its own investigation into his conduct, allowing his to keep his house and salary until it has reached a conclusion . The Mail on Sunday exposed him as a recreational drug user in November last year . The . prosecutor said no drugs were found in Flowers' possession by . investigating police, and he was prosecuted on the basis of admissions . he made to officers. Flowers refused to comment as he left court and fought his way through a mass of cameras with the help of two minders. Richard . Wright QC, defending, said his client had a current income of £510 a . month through pensions but admitted he had also gained assets following . the recent death of his mother. Mr Wright did not disclose the value of these assets. When Flowers arrived at court yesterdaywith four minders, but the doors had been locked, leaving him to stand on the street for five minutes surrounded by photographers and TV cameras. He said: 'Don't ask me any questions because I won't give any answers.' He . repeated his description of the mass of reporters and photographers as . 'vultures' as he stood and endured a barrage of flash photography, . eventually saying: 'Do you have enough now?' Court staff opened the doors at 9am and let the let the pinstripe-suited clergyman into the building. The . Co-op confirmed last year that it was seeking to recover contractual . payments totalling £31,000 made to Mr Flowers amid reports that he was . also the subject of an inquiry into 'lavish' expense claims. Paul Flowers was a minister for 40 years . Flowers . was caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack . cocaine and ketamine just days after he was grilled by MPs on the . Treasury Select . Committee over the bank's disastrous performance. Last November The Mail on Sunday were handed a damning video showing Flowers, 63,  in his car discussing the . cocaine and crystal meth he wants from a dealer in Leeds. He then counts . out £300 in £20 notes and sends a friend to make the deal. The video and a series text . messages were handed to newspaper by acquaintance Stuart . Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy'. The . text messages prove Rev Flowers was using hard drugs in the days . surrounding his crucial testimony to the Treasury Committee on November . 6. On the day after his appearance at the . Commons, Flowers sent a text reading: 'I was ""grilled"" by the Treasury . Select Committee yesterday and afterwards came to Manchester to get . wasted with friends.' Flowers, who is gay, also boasts of . using illicit substances including ketamine, a powerful Class C . tranquilliser nicknamed 'ket', along with cannabis and club drug GHB. In . one text, Flowers wrote how his plans for a party were 'turning into a . two day, drug fuelled gay orgy!!!' In another, he boasted of how he was . 'snorting some good stuff'. That was sent on the day he was first . scheduled to appear before the Commons committee, but the session ran . out of time to hear him. Stuart Davies, 26, first encountered . the minister via the gay dating mobile phone app Grindr in early . October. The two men exchanged texts and met a few weeks later. Mr . Davies, who admits having used drugs in the past, said he was shocked by . the scale of Flowers' drug taking as well as his double standards as he . cavorted with two other young men. 'After . hearing him bragging about his life, about his connections in . Parliament, his 40 years in the church and his all-round good works, it . just felt wrong,' said Mr Davies. 'He seemed to be  using his status to . get young men off their heads for sex.' Mr Davies decided to expose Flowers and recorded part of a trip they took with a third man, who we will call X, to Leeds to buy drugs. Caught on film: The steps Rev Flowers took to complete a drug deal . In time-marked footage, Flowers says after handing over the £300: 'What else have we got to get?' X replies: 'No, that's it'. Flowers: 'Ket? No?' X says he doesn't think he can get it and Flowers replies: 'Don't worry. We will cope with what we've got.' Mr . Davie said drugs first came up in an chat on . Grindr after their first meeting. He said Rev Flowers asked if he had . used cocaine. 'I'd had the odd line and that's what I told him,' he . said. Having parked up, Paul Flowers counts out £300 in £20 notes before handing the cash over for a drugs deal . The video and a series of damning text messages were handed to The Mail on Sunday by acquaintance Stuart Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy' Some weeks later – on October 29, the . date of Flowers' aborted appearance at the Commons – he sent Mr Davies a . message saying he was, 'snorting some good stuff' and the next day . invited Mr Davies to a party at his house. Shortly before he picked Mr . Davies up, Flowers sent a text saying: 'Have 2 bags of Charlie [cocaine] . here and have ordered another 5... enough? P x' One minute later he adds: 'Also have ket and G [GHB] because they [two other party guests 'A' and 'B'] apparently like them...!' Mr .

"By . Associated Press . It has been five years since Michael Jackson died, yet his career is more alive than it has been in decades. Just last month, the singer moon-walked across a Las Vegas stage in a nationally televised hologram performance. A new album recently debuted at No. 2 on music charts. And a traveling Cirque du Soleil show based on Jackson's songs has logged nearly 500 performances worldwide. It has been five years since Michael Jackson died, yet his career is more alive than it has been in decades (pictured in March 2009, just three months before his death) The result has been an estate that has earned more than $600 million since the King of Pop's untimely death at age 50. Some of the earnings support Jackson's three children and mother. Yet an analysis by The Associated Press shows much more has gone to erase the singer's massive debts and to run the estate that powers his robust posthumous career. As would be expected, the last five years have brought their share of change and adjustment for Jackson's children, known to the world as Prince, 17; Paris, 16; and Blanket, 12. They were at their father's rented mansion on June 25, 2009, when he was given an overdose of the anesthetic propofol in his upstairs bedroom. And they were at the hospital several hours later when he was pronounced dead. It would take more than two years before Jackson's doctor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Prince, Blanket and Paris Jackson pictured on stage at the Michael Forever the Tribute Concert in Cardiff in October, 2011 (The children are supported by the earnings) A father who taught his children philanthropy, threw them lavish birthday parties and meticulously masked them from the paparazzi is gone. Michael Jackson, however, continues to provide. Nearly $20 million had been spent to support Jackson's children and his mother, Katherine, through 2012. Payments to the family have increased each year since June 2009, according to court records. Adulthood will bring a sizeable inheritance for each child. In the meantime, lawyers have busily untangled Jackson's finances, which itself has been expensive. Among the disbursements between mid-2009 and the end of 2012: . More than $91 million on taxes and licenses, including $45 million paid to the federal government for taxes. More than $25 million in compensation for the estate's executors, Jackson's longtime attorney John Branca and family friend and music executive John McClain. The men receive a percentage of the estate's earnings. More than $17 million to lawyers who represent the estate, Katherine and her grandchildren. Nearly $4 million to properly store and archive the trove of personal belongings and unreleased music that Jackson amassed during his lifetime. 'This is a complex estate with unique issues,' said Katherine's attorney, Perry Sanders Jr. 'Under all the circumstances, Mrs. Jackson and the children are certainly being well cared for.' Sanders, who has conducted audits of the estate's spending, said everything is in order and detailed financial records match precisely what has been presented in court. 'It's surprising how big the numbers are, but then when you realize what goes into it - and that a judge has approved those numbers - then it becomes not so shocking,' said Irwin Feinberg, an attorney who specializes in probate litigation. While Jackson craved success, his priority in later years was his children. The trio is a large part of the singer's legacy, and the music, dance moves and business pieces he left behind assure them a comfortable, if not care-free, lifestyle. Jackson's children live with their grandmother in a hilltop home in the celebrity enclave of Calabasas, home to the Kardashian family, Britney Spears and many others. The estate pays for private schools and tutors, a chef, private security and family vacations, giving the Jackson children the stability their father strived to provide. 'Michael's . number one priority was his children, not wealth or fame,' said Tom . Mesereau, the attorney who successfully defended Jackson against child . molestation charges and stays in touch with his family. 'He wanted them to get the best education possible,' Mesereau said. 'He wanted them to be worldly.' Although . the family's privacy is carefully protected - neither Mesereau nor . Sanders would discuss specifics - some domestic drama has become public . in recent years. Brought back to life: Michael Jackson hologram performed in Las Vegas in May (pictured) In 2012, Katherine was absent for 10 days when some of her children took her to an Arizona spa, causing a family rift that resulted in TJ Jackson, an adult cousin of Michael Jackson's children, being named their co-guardian. Paris and Prince were deposed in Katherine's lawsuit against the promoters of her son's planned comeback concerts. Prince ably testified about his father's impact on the children, but Paris was hospitalized during the trial after authorities responded to a 911 call that the teenager had cut herself with a knife and taken 20 Motrin pills. Lawyers and family members, including TJ Jackson, have said she is fine, but offer no further details. Paris, according to relatives, took her father's death the hardest. Prince is still interested in pursuing a career in film production. As a child, he and his father would watch movies together, meticulously dissecting scenes. He recently attended a Hollywood premiere. Blanket practices karate and is looking forward to a summer of swimming, his cousin TJ Jackson said. Mesereau said the family seems to be doing reasonably well. Of their father, the attorney said, 'He's missed very much.'","Some of the earnings support Jackson's three children and mother (nearly $20m in 2012)

"By . John Stevens . and Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nearly three quarters of countries will not accept passports given 12 month extensions under plans to alleviate the crisis, it has been revealed. Home Secretary Theresa May last week announced that expat Britons who need to renew their passports would be given one-year extensions. The emergency move announced in parliament was supposed to ease the pressure of the recent surge in demand for the documents that has seen up to 55,000 people at risk of missing their holidays. Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . Home Secretary Theresa May apologised for the chaos threatening to ruin family holidays this summer. She said 11 per cent of applications were not being processed in time . But now the government has admitted only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports. Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published today on the Government website 'gov.uk'. The list does not rule out more countries accepting the extension as a valid travel document at a later date. The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports. The latest passport scandal comes just days after Mrs May was forced to offer a grovelling apology to families who have missed their holidays because of the chaos at the Passport Office. The Tory Cabinet minister said she and the Government are 'sorry for any inconvenience' they had caused by failing to control the backlog in applications. David Hanson MP, Labour’s shadow minister for immigration, said: ‘A week after Theresa May announced extended passport for residents almost three quarters of the world are currently not accepting them. ‘People are still stuck without their passports unable to travel at what is the busiest holiday period of the year. While it’s good that some will be able to travel on an extended passport, the Government still haven’t got some of the most popular destination countries in the world to agree. ‘Thousands of people will be looking forward to going to places like the USA, Cyprus and Turkey this summer but might not be able to because of the Home Secretary’s passport backlog, and many major business locations like India and China aren’t accepting the extended passport scheme either. It’s just not good enough from the Home Secretary and she needs to urgently get a grip and realise how important this is to people. ‘It’s been months since we first learnt of the passport crisis created by Theresa May’s mismanagement, and yet this news shows again that the government still haven’t realised how serious this is, and simply aren’t doing enough.’ Scroll down for video . Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs the backlog had hit 480,000 - around 200,000 higher than usual . Around 350,000 passport applications are submitted by Britons living overseas to Her Majesty's Passport Office every year. In January responsibility for issuing these documents shifted from the Foreign Office’s seven overseas centres to the Home Office in the UK. Labour say this move has put the Passport Office under huge strain, but Mrs May has insisted the majority of passport applications are being processed on time. The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham . Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get. Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service. The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved. Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved. The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application. But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free. British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents. Mrs May said 11 per cent of applications are not being processed within three weeks. With the backlog at 493,289 - this means some 54,262 are now at risk of missing their holiday. The Tory minister told MPs that the figure was around 50,000. Speaking in a Commons debate on the passport crisis on Wednesday Mrs May said: 'Her Majesty's passport office is dealing with the highest demand for passports for 12 years while the surge in demand usually experienced during the summer months started much earlier in the year.' As a result, a number of people are waiting too long for their passport applications to be processed. 'I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right.' But MPs heard that crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better this summer. Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'We have not yet reached the peak. We actually do need a timetable to get the ""work-in-progress"" working quickly.' He also claimed that Passport Office staff were 'profiting from the public's hardship'. The Passport Office is making almost £13 on each application and should use the money to deal with the delays blighting Britons' holiday plans, Mr Vaz said. He said officials should have realised in January that action was needed to avert the current crisis caused by a surge in demand, after being given updated figures by the Passport Office. 'It appears that the Passport Office is making a surplus of £13 on each application. It should not be profiting from the public's hardship. 'There are still 490,000 applications being dealt with and staff have had to work the equivalent of nearly £1 million in overtime in one month. The surplus from last year, and this, should be used to employ more staff to process the backlog quicker.' Today's Commons debate came after it was revealed that the backlog of passport applications almost doubled in just three months this year. Passport Office chief Paul Pugh admitted almost 500,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year after a surge in applications in the first five months of the year. Mr Pugh, who revealed he earns £104,000 a year, blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications. Unions said the Government had 'lost control of the backlog'. Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed . A spokesman for Her Majesty’s Passport Office said: 'There are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed. 'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years. 'We are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards. 'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades.'","Government announced 12 month passport extension for expats .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Ministers have been accused of ‘losing their grip, on NHS finances after spending on temporary and agency staff soared to £2.6billion a year. Hospitals are hiring agency nurses for as much as £160 an hour as they struggle to cope, particularly in A&E departments. In Kent, one hospital paid 21 locum doctors £1,000 each for a single shift in A&E last year. Agency staff being brought in to help out the struggling NHS are costing £2.6 billion a year (file picture) Figures obtained by Labour show NHS trusts spent £1.2billion on agency and contract staff in 2013-14. Foundation trusts, which have a degree of independence, spent nearly £1.4billion – more than twice the budget. In many cases, the NHS pays commission to agencies providing staff. Liz Kendall, shadow health minister has called hiring agency staff a 'false economy' for the NHS . Typically, agency workers are up to 30 per cent more expensive than equivalent permanent staff, but critics point to evidence that they sometimes cost more than double. Shadow health minister Liz Kendall told the Daily Mail: ‘Labour warned about the dangers of cutting nurses’ jobs and training. Now hospitals are spending billions of pounds extra on temporary and agency staff. It’s a false economy. Patient care is going backwards under this Government, and ministers are losing grip of the NHS’s finances.’ Foundation trusts planned to spend £523million on agency staff in 2013-14, but ended up spending £1.4billion. Costs on non-agency staff were virtually as budgeted. More than one in three NHS trusts in England have plunged into the red. Labour is also warning of a potential crisis in A&Es, with performance deteriorating. Ministers hit back by pointing out that Labour regularly oversaw deficits in the NHS. A Conservative health spokesman said: ‘The NHS has responded emphatically. In some cases, temporary staff have been used to address problems that persisted under the last Government. 'There are now 13,000 more permanent staff than in 2010.’","Hospitals are hiring agency nurses for as much as £160 per hour .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A ruthless gang of kidnappers who cut off the fingers of their victims has been arrested - after a tip off. Polish police swooped in the early hours of the morning in the capital Warsaw where they arrested 15 alleged members. The Mokotowska gang, named after the city district they operated from, were wanted for a series of brutal kidnappings. Horrific: This is the man who was captured by the Mokotowska gang and held hostage for a month as they demanded £500,000 from his family. Every week they failed to pay, the gang cut off one of his fingers . Later they branched out into drug-trafficking, armed robberies and money-laundering. In 2002, the gang kept a man locked up for a whole month after demanding £500,000 from his family. For each week the family failed to pay, the gang cut off one of the victim’s fingers and sent it to them. A year later, the gang kidnapped another man and threatened to do the same thing, but he managed to escape. The gang was arrested after police received a tip-off. Arrest: After 12 years of investigations to catch the Warsaw-based gang, police arrested 15 men in a dawn raid . Raid: Officers back by counter-terrorism police raided several apartments across the Polish capital . The 15 members now face 10 years in jail if convicted. 'On Tuesday morning officers backed by counter-terrorism police entered several apartments across Warsaw and surrounding areas,' confirmed police spokesman Mariusz Mrozek. Besides arresting 15 suspects, police also seized a machine gun, ammunition and narcotics. Quantities of cash, mobile phones and other items were also confiscated.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A footballer and two Far Eastern businessmen have been jailed for plotting to fix the results of lower league football matches. Footballer Michael Boateng, 22, was found guilty along with businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan, of conspiracy to commit bribery following a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Singaporean Sankaran, 34, and Sri-Lankan-born Ganeshan, 44, labelled in court as ‘the controlling minds’ behind efforts to influence the outcome of matches in League Two and the Conference South, were each jailed for five years. Footballer Michael Boateng (right), 22, was found guilty along with businessmen Chann Sankaran (left) and Krishna Ganeshan (centre), of conspiracy to commit bribery following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court . Krishna Ganeshan (left) and Chann Sankaran (right), pictured while under surveillance, were each jailed for five years after being found guilty of conspiring to fix football matches in League Two and Conference South . Boateng, a former defender with Conference South club Whitehawk FC, was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his role in the plot. Sentencing the trio, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said: ‘Professional football and sport play an important part in national life and individuals’ lives in this country. ‘Those who make determined attempts to destroy its integrity for personal gain must expect significant prison sentences so when such acts are discovered a clear signal is sent to others.’ The judge told Sankaran he would be ‘liable to deportation’ back to his home country once he had served his sentence, but it would be a matter for the Home Secretary. He told the co-conspirators their scheme was laid bare by surveillance and covertly recorded conversations following an investigation by the the National Crime Agency (NCA). To Ganeshan, of Hastings, East Sussex, and Sankaran, of Singapore, he said: ‘I am satisfied you were at the head of this conspiracy, you two were the controlling minds. ‘The two of you came to this country in November last year, for the sole reason of visiting clubs to find players you could corrupt to fix matches.’ The co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to throw the results of football matches, including the game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham & Redbridge on November 26 last year, in order to make money . Far Eastern businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan were caught by the undercover investigation attempting to change a large amount of euros into sterling at various money bureaux outlets . Michael Boateng, a former defender with Conference South club Whitehawk FC, was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his role in the plot . He said they had purposefully targeted lower division football clubs because the cost of bribing the players ‘on their modest wages’ was cheaper than approaching players from the higher leagues. ‘This was an, if not sophisticated, then well-planned and determined conspiracy motivated by the expectation of significant gain,’ the judge said. He also said it was ‘sad to see’ Boateng, who it was heard had been a valued church and charity group youth worker in London, appearing in court. His barrister, Denis Barry, told the judge how children in the south London community where he volunteered felt ‘very badly let down’ by a man they had seen as a role model. ‘He has lost his good name in the community,’ he said. The judge told Boateng, from Croydon, London: ‘You allowed yourself to quickly be drawn in to this scheme’, and said he was ‘perfectly willing to corrupt other footballers’ as part of the conspiracy. The co-conspirators had denied trying to throw the results of football matches, including the game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham & Redbridge on November 26 last year, in order to make money from bets placed on the outcomes. Krishna Ganeshan (left), Michael Boateng (centre) and Chann Sankaran (right), pictured while under surveillance en route to a meeting in Croydon . When Ganeshan and Sankaran arrived in the UK earlier that month, they immediately set about building what the NCA described as ‘a network of corrupt players in the UK’, the court heard. There is no evidence that the outcome of match was ever thrown. But, in a conversation recorded in November last year, Ganeshan was heard telling a contact in Singapore: ‘I want to start making money, my pocket is empty.’ He later told the same contact he was expecting to make sums of “75,000 to 100,000’, of which the judge said ‘whether euros, US dollars or pounds, it’s a significant amount of money’. Meanwhile, Sankaran had what the judge called a ‘bogus contract’ relating to a Finnish club, and pretended he was an agent in a bid to get footballers to contact him. Ganeshan had also set up a company called Matchworld Sports Ltd with an address in London’s prestigious Mayfair, for which business cards were printed, but that had never traded and never paid its rent. Judge Inman said: ‘Your only interest was luring footballers in advancing your plan.’ The court heard how the men were snared ‘by their own mouths’ after the NCA bugged their hotel rooms, listening in on their conversations. It also sent in an undercover agent posing as the scheme’s UK investor who handed the businessmen 60,000 euros (£47,000), which they then spent on bribes and placing bets. The two men later handed 450 euros (£358) to Boateng, who was then playing for Brighton-based Whitehawk FC. The judge said the case showed that all professional clubs, including non-league sides, needed to be ‘extremely vigilant’ that the ‘poison’ of match-fixing corruption did not affect them. NCA branch commander Richard Warner said: ‘This is not sport as a football-loving nation recognises it. ‘It is corruption and bribery linked to serious organised crime, and the NCA is determined to stop criminals benefiting from it. ‘The evidence in corruption cases is . often either verbal or visual. Unless you are there when money changes . hands, or plans are made, that evidence is gone. ‘We . had a vital opportunity here to intervene early, secure the evidence to . get convictions, and put a stop to Sankaran’s and Ganeshan’s much wider . and more sinister ambitions.’ Ganeshan (left) and Sankaran (right), were caught on CCTV arriving in Croydon for a meeting with an investor on November 25 during which they were set to receive 60,000 in Euros . The judge said the case showed that all professional clubs, including non-league sides, needed to be 'extremely vigilant' that the 'poison' of match-fixing corruption did not affect them . The NCA said it was working with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association and its investigation continues. A fourth man, Hakeem Adelakun, 23, of south London, was acquitted by the jury of any involvement in the conspiracy. Jurors were discharged from reaching a verdict on a fifth man, ex-Whitehawk footballer Moses Swaibu, after deliberating for more than 15 hours. Swaibu, 25, of Bermondsey, south London, denies a single count of conspiracy and was granted unconditional bail pending a retrial.","Trio guilty of trying to influence result of League Two and Conference games .

"By . Freya Noble . The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year, which marks the transition to longer daylight hours - but for some - it holds more importance than simply seeing more sunshine. For the 20 people living on the Davis Station in Antarctica, mid-winters day is the halfway point of their stay on the continent, and they celebrate in a very unique way. Outside temperatures average around an unimaginably cold -30 degrees at this time of the year, so what better time than to take a dip in balmy 1.8 degree water? Scroll down for video . Jump in, the water's lovely! Staff at the Davis Station in Antarctica celebrate the winter solstice by plunging into a freezing sea 'pool' Hard work: It took a whole day to saw through one metre thick ice when creating the pool . Celebration: In the early morning of the mid-winters day it's tradition for members at the station to take a dip . In a video released by the Australian Antarctic Division, station manager Narelle Campbell gives a fascinating insight into what life is like in one of the coldest places on earth. Each year, to celebrate the equinox and the middle of their expedition, but also to honor those who have been down before them, members of the Davis Station dive into icy waters. It takes the whole day prior to prepare the 'pool' as 'the sea ice here at the moment is one metre deep, so it did take a while for them to get those chunks of ice out,' Ms Campbell says. Appropriate clothing: One of the staff can be seen preparing to jump into the 1.8 degree water in just his yellow board shorts and shoes . Warming up: The sea water is substantially warmer than the -32 degree air temperature . Then, on the morning of the solstice staff take the plunge, stripping off in sub-zero temperatures to immerse themselves in comparatively warmer waters. Following this, they enjoy a more pleasant experience in an outdoor spa created especially for the celebrations. A formal dinner 'toasting all those who have been down before it, and family and friends back home who we haven't seen for quite some time' concludes the evening. Waiting for the sun: It will be mid-July before anyone in Antarctica sees the sun again . That's better! A dip in the spa warms people up after the morning chilly adventure . Group photo: Some of the researchers pose for a photo to wish everyone a 'happy mid-winters' Making light of the fact no one on the continent will see a ship, or any vessel for that matter, until November, Ms Campbell takes a dig at her loved ones for not making the trip to join them for the event. 'We did send an invitation out to many people to attend our party tonight, lot's of excuses why they can't get here...probably because it's impossible.'

Pasadena – home to the Rose Bowl, art galleries, many private schools and its own symphony orchestra – took first place. The Los Angeles suburb has the fifth-highest median home price, many performing arts venues and several nearby country clubs, according to Movoto. Thousand Oaks, California came in at second. It has the lowest number of fast food restaurants per capita of any cities in the top 10, but also boasts the third-highest median home prices and household incomes of any municipality on the list.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Shrien Dewani, the British businessman accused of ordering his wife's killing on their honeymoon in 2010, has appeared in court in South Africa. A judge in Pretoria set October 6 as the start date for his trial and ordered more psychological examinations to be carried out over 30 days to asses his fitness to stand. Dewani fought extradition for three years on the grounds that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress and depression in relation to the death of his wife, Anni. Scroll down for video .

In court today, a clean-shaven Dewani, wearing a . black suit and white shirt, was brought up from the holding cells for five minutes before being led back down. 'We have no doubt that he is fit to . plead,' defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said. Anni died after being shot in the neck during an allegedly staged car-jacking on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010 while she and Shrien were on their honeymoon. The 34-year-old was implicated in his wife's death by three co-accused who agreed to testify for the state in exchange for lesser sentences. He has denied any involvement in the killing.

In the pre-trial conference at court . on May 12, Francois van Zyl told how his client had fared in his month . as a hospital patient. He . said: 'I am informed that he has been fully co-operative and that his . condition has improved. We have been told by treating psychiatrists not . to consult with him for longer than 30 minutes at a time.' He said Dewani lacked the ability to . concentrate for longer than this time but he remained hopeful that his . client would improve enough to 'instruct us properly'.

"By . Stephanie Linning . A mother has criticised the Passport Office and its photo rules after it took her five hours to get a useable snap of her newborn baby for his passport. Six-week-old Lucas Thursby is due to fly with parents Emma Mitchell and Graeme Thursby to Costa Del Sol, Spain, in August. But Miss Mitchell, 29, from Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, wishes she picked a holiday in Scotland after the passport photo session with a professional photographer turned into an all-afternoon marathon. The ones that didn't work: Lucas tries his best at the marathon photo shoot. Rules state that babies must look directly into the camera with a straight face, both ears must be visible and no one else can be in the frame . Strict rules on passport pictures mean . the subject has to be looking directly at the camera with a straight . face, both ears visible and no-one else in the frame. Miss Mitchell said: 'My hands couldn’t be in it at all. I was holding him at the waist and I was scared that his neck was getting sore. 'I think the rules are ridiculous. The are too constraining.' What . the family hoped would be a 15-minute photo shoot turned into an . endurance test that stretched from midday to 5pm before they finally got . a suitable image. That's the one! After five hours, Lucas took a photo that passed the Passport Office's rules. The application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 in the backlog . Mrs Mitchell, a company administrator, said Lucas remained calm, but admitted: 'I was stressed and I was getting upset.' She . added: 'The passport lasts five years. How do you expect strangers to . identify babies from photos, that in a couple of years, they won’t look . anything like? 'I am trying to plan something that is meant to be exciting and fun, but this has put a bit of a dampener on things.' Family holiday: Emma Mitchell and her fiance Graeme Thursby are planning to take their six-month-son Lucus on a to Costa Del Sol, Spain in August. Miss Mitchell called the passport rules 'ridiculous' and 'constraining' The family paid a £90 fee for Lucas’ passport but the photographer is a family friend who gave his time for free. To add insult to injury, the application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 passports in the backlog. 'It . was so difficult,' said Miss Mitchell. 'But I’m not the first and I . certainly won’t be the last parent to struggle with this. 'I just hope his passport comes on time.'","Emma Mitchell needed to take a photo of six-week-old son Lucas .

"By . Sam Webb . Some of the earliest photographs taken of the Wimbledon tennis championships have emerged after 104 years. The black and white snaps were taken by a spectator at the 1910 tournament and many show the prolific champion of the day, Tony Wilding. The images include shots of a primitive-looking Centre Court as well as some of the outside courts that are separated by waist-high netting. Wimbledon is renowned for its tradition and formality but the conservative outfits worn by male and female players and fans are in stark contrast to today's fashion. Some of the earliest photographs taken of the Wimbledon tennis championships have emerged after 104 years. The conservative outfits worn by male and female players are in stark contrast to today's sportswear . Ace: The photographs were taken when the Wimbledon Championships, that started in 1877, were played at its former site on Worple Road, about a mile away from its current home. Pictured is Tony Wilding, considered one of the greatest ever players of the game and Wimbledon champion four times . One snap shows a woman playing a mixed-doubles match wearing a white blouse and floor-length skirt while her partner is sporting a pair of white trousers. The photographs were taken when the championships, that started in 1877, were played at its former site on Worple Road, about a mile away from its current home. Despite being at a different location, the main tennis arena was still called Centre Court. The championships moved to its present site at Southfields in 1922. Stiff upper lip: Almost everyone in the crowd is dressed in suits and formal dresses, despite the June heat . Different era: The images include shots of a primitive-looking Centre Court as well as some of the outside courts that are separated by waist-high netting . Sadly, Wilding was killed fighting in the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France, in 1915 . The pictures have never been published before and are thought to be some of the earliest photos of the Wimbledon chamipionships . Men's doubles: The stylish yet restrictive attire sported by the players would be unthinkable in the modern game . The photos are now being sold at auction by a relative of the man who took them in June 1910. The tournament was the first of four Wimbledon single titles won by New Zealand player Wilding. Wilding was the son of English immigrants to New Zealand and started playing ON the tennis courts at the family home. He won numerous titles all over the world, including four at wimbledon in 1907, 1908, 1910 and 1914. On May 9, 1915 Captain Wilding was killed when a shell exploded on the roof of a dug-out he was sheltering in during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France. He also won his third of four doubles titles in the same year. Sadly, the 1914 tournament, which he also won, was to be his last as the outbreak of war later that summer saw him join the Royal Marines. He died fighting in France a year later. The snaps are being auctioned by Henry . Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge . said: 'Wimbledon is well known for being formal but today's . championships are nothing compared to the Victorian and Georgian period. 'The photo of the mixed doubles match is quite interesting in that the attire worn by the woman is almost like an evening dress. 'When . you compare it to the short tennis skirts and lycra worn by the likes . of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, it is really night and day. 'The . spectators were just as smart with most of the men in smart suits and . even top hat and tails, despite it being the middle of summer. There are . over 20 photographs that were taken by one spectator and have been in . their family ever since. 'They . have never been published before and must be some of the earliest . photos of the Wimbledon championships, given that they are 104 years . old.' The photos are expecting to sell for up to £1,000 on Saturday. Despite the sweltering weather, this tennis fan wore a fur trimmed coat to the tournament. Here she is seen chatting to a player . Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and the eating of strawberries and cream by the spectators . Some things do stay the same: Wimbledon is the only Major still played on grass . The Wimbledon Championships were founded in 1877 - and were held at the All England Club Croquet Club in south west London. It is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments  - the others being the French Open, The US open and the Australian Open. It is the only major still played on grass court after the Australian open moved to hard court in 1988. The All England Club was originally founded in 1868 in the grounds off Worple Road, Wimbledon. Lawn tennis - a game created by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield - was added to the list of activities at the club in 1876. The venue was subsequently renamed 'The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club' - a change celebrated by the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A year later in 1877, the first Wimbledon Championships opened on 9 July. The lawns for play were arranged so that the principle court was in the middle and the others around the edges - hence why the main lawn has the title 'centre court'. Men's singles, the only event, was won by Spencer Gore from a field of 22. It is thought that around 200 sepctators attended the first final - paying a shilling entrance fee. The first Ladies Championship was held in 1884 - with Maud Watson winning the title. She was awarded a silver flower-basket worth 20 guineas. In 1882,  'croquet' was . dropped from the title as the venue was almost exclusivly known for tennis. It was restored in 1899 for sentimental reasons, however. In 1922, the venue moved to Church Road. In 1980, fourt new courts were commissioned - with court number open opening in 1997.","Remarkable stills show how much both the event and the sport has evolved in its 137-year history .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Nigel Hague, 85, completed the wing-walk while on a 45 minute flight from France to England, raising more than £50,000 for charity . The 85-year-old father of Foreign Secretary William Hague strapped himself to the top of a bi-plane and wing-walked over the English Channel in his latest daredevil challenge for charity. Nigel Hague completed the hair-raising stunt to raise over £50,000 for the the Lost Chord charity. The octogenarian was in France as a personal tribute to those who lost their lives in the D-Day military operation - beginning the daring wing walk in Calais and arriving 45 minutes later in Kent. Since he turned 80, Nigel has raised almost £200,000 for the NSPCC with a series of challenges. His first wing walk was in May 2012, and raised £59,000. Speaking after his latest challenge Nigel, of Harley, South Yorks., said: 'When you get to my age you’re not really afraid of anything, although I have to admit doing a wing walk across the Channel is quite a challenge. 'The whole thing went fine, the weather was absolutely perfect for it. The only real problem was a fly that got caught in my googles for about ten minutes. 'It is a an exhilarating experience, but not completely pleasant, and isn’t as dangerous as mountain climbing, I think. 'I was busy working most of my life, with no time to indulge in climbing mountains and other things, it’s all been done in later life. 'My wife said to me ""If you’re fool enough to be climbing mountains, it’s time to do it for charity"". Since then I’ve done sky dives, climbed Scafell Pike and abseiled down a high building, so I guess I’m I doing okay for 85.' He says his son laughs about his endeavours, and thinks he’s 'a bit nutty'. The stunt is Nigel's second wing-walk. The first, completed in May 2012, raised £59,000 for the NSPCC . Nigel insisted that wing-walking was not as dangerous as mountain climbing - which he has also done for charity - but admitted his son William Hague thought his antics were 'a bit nutty' Nigel added: 'He was in Normandy at the D-Day commemorations with the Queen. I said I might swing down there and give him the V-sign and he said if you do you might get a missile up your backside as its a no-fly zone.' Nigel’s first high profile challenge came at the age of 80 in 2009, when he climbed the 3,209ft Scafell Pike peak in seven-and-a-half hours and raised £51,000. This was followed by a 10,000ft skydive in August 2011, and his first wing-walk in May 2012- which combined raised more than £100,000. His latest challenge was for Lost Chord, which operates throughout the UK, visiting 130 residential care homes and day centres a month. The charity aims to improve the quality of life of dementia sufferers using interactive stimuli. Helena Muller, Managing Director of Lost Chord, said: 'We are extremely grateful to Nigel for his support over the years, particularly at the moment as we are surviving on reserves. Nigel has completed two wing-walks, climbed a mountain and done a skydive for charity, raising £200,000 . 'The wing walk event was fantastic and, with the help of S3 ID, we raised a fantastic amount of money for our charity. 'It’s just inconceivable to think that a man at 85 should even consider the death defying feat of being strapped to a bi-plane and hanging on for dear life while it flies all the way to England. 'All those brave soldiers, had they survived, would have been in awe of Nigel’s antics.'Rotherham-based S3 ID Ltd sponsored the wing walk. Derek Gennard, Director at S3 ID, said: 'Nigel has raised a huge amount of money for charity over the years and we were delighted to support him in his latest adventure. 'He has always been happy to help others and we congratulate him on raising these much needed funds for Lost Chord.'","Nigel Hague, 85, raised more than £50,000 for charity with daredevil stunt .

"By . Brian Barwick . Uruguay v England in Sao Paulo, two teams still without a point, but both determined to go out and make one. And for in-form ITV? It was about putting their best foot forward for a peak-time World Cup showdown that should turn out to be the most watched TV programme of the year so far. Adrian Chiles was joined in their Rio studio by Lee Dixon, former England manager, Glenn Hoddle and Gus Poyet. Missing, and missed by his colleagues and the viewers alike, was Ian Wright who had rushed back to the UK following a disturbing break-in at his family home on Tuesday evening. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Townsend with the Adidas Brazuca World Cup ball . Star man: Andros Townsend provided a good presence pitchside for ITV as England lost 2-1 to Uruguay . Primetime: Andros Townsend was placed pitchside by ITV at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo . On site at the Arena Corinthians, ITV were fielding a pair of Townsends, Andros and Andy. Pitchside was Andros, the ‘come from nowhere’ man who helped steer England to Brazil before injury curtailed his World Cup chances, whilst his namesake Andy was in that most current of hot seats, as England match co-commentator to the experienced Clive Tyldesley. It is a role that he has done many times but scrutiny on performance would seem to have been ratcheted up in recent days with Phil Neville’s difficult BBC debut. Neville’s BBC team-mates Danny Murphy and Martin Keown, informed and confident, have impressed in co-commentary. Good to see the engaging Martin O’Neill joining ITV’s World Cup coverage and immediately adding that sense of curiosity and conflict that he so clearly enjoys. Verbally sparring with Patrick Vieira before like everybody else raving at Tim Cahill’s wonder goal for Australia. Missing: Ian Wright's presence was missed but Gus Poyet deputised for the ITV regular . It has also been refreshing to hear both Rio Ferdinand and Neil Lennon express a fan’s wonderment at being ‘privileged’ to be inside the famous Maracana. And often an unnecessary diversion, in this World Cup the inspired choice of crowd shots has added genuine colour and carnival to the TV viewer’s experience. They’d be spoilt for choice again in Sao Paulo. ITV opened the programme with the news we all feared - and expected. Suarez in, not 100 per cent, but on the pitch. And that drove the opening thoughts of the experts. Barmy army: Crowd shots have added carnival and colour to the viewing experience of this World Cup . How fit is fit? How dangerous is dangerous? Andros Townsend still thought fit or nearly fit he was a barrel load of trouble: 'He could nutmeg a mermaid.' 'This is knock-out football and no mistake,' Adrian Chiles offered. Not absolutely true but you knew what he meant. And we all felt it. And in a memorable sequence England players spoke directly to camera of what it meant to them to play for their country. Simple, touching and genuine. ‘You’re not supposed to enjoy watching England in the World Cup, you know that by now.’ Tyldesley and Townsend, Andy, that is, both seasoned England watchers, were off and running. England started well, a Rooney free-kick went close countered with a shot from Rodriguez. ‘A good spell for England’ Tyldesley offered a little later and it was nearly capped with a goal from Rooney. Then in the 39th minute Suarez scores a brilliant header. Fit or not fit, he knows where the goal is. ‘It just had to be Luis Suarez.’ We sort of knew it would be, and Suarez's second - the winner -  just confirmed that. Heartbreaker: Luis Suarez gave Uruguay the lead in the first half in the Corinthians Arena . Big moment: Rooney equalises for England in a period of sustained pressure against Uruguay .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . Italy may have sealed England's World Cup fate by failing to beat Costa Rica on Thursday, but we can't say that Mario Balotelli and Co weren't chasing the game after they were caught offside an incredible 11 times. The last time that many offsides was recorded in a World Cup game was at the 2006 tournament and came from Italy again... twice! The Azzurri managed to rack up 11 offsides against USA in the group stages and Germany in the semi-finals before eventually winning the tournament. There have been 12 occasions of a side getting more than 11 . offsides in a World cup game since 1966, with Englandâ€™s 20 against Kuwait in 1982 the . most. Not again! Italy were caught offside 11 times in their 1-0 defeat to Costa Rica at the World Cup . The Spain '82 tournament will be best remembered by England supporters for Bryan Robson's goal against France after 27 seconds - the fourth fastest in World Cup history. However, it was the group game against Kuwait that brought England their unwanted record. Trevor Francis scored the only goal in the 1-0 victory at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao, but it is  the twenty offside calls that has remained a talking point - that's approximately one every five minutes. Serial offenders! Italy twice racked up 11 offsides in a game on their way to winning the 2006 World Cup . England had already secured qualification as group winners while Kuwait had come into the game after one of the most controversial events in World Cup history when they stopped playing to concede a goal against France after hearing what they thought was the referee's whistle. Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and . president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch and remonstrated until the Soviet referee disallowed the goal - only for the French to score minutes later and win the game 4-1. Record breakers! England's Paul Mariner played against Kuwait in a World Cup game that featured 20 offsides . Deadlock broken: Trevor Francis scored the only goal of the game, but was guilty of missing more chances . Kuwait became the first Asian team to ever face England and put in a decent performance albeit against opposition who had nothing to play for. England were generally in control throughout the game but were guilty of a succession of missed opportunities before Francis and Paul Mariner combined to break the deadlock. The same two players had the best chances thereafter but looked more interested in conserving energy for the more challenging tests ahead. Having topped the group with victories over France, Czechoslovakia and Kuwait, England eventually bowed out in the next round after goalless draws with West Germany and Spain - where Kevin Keegam largely blamed for missing several chances, despite nursing niggling injuries.

"By . David Kent . Andy Murray admits it will be a relief to defend his Wimbledon title without the same pressure that had followed him throughout his career before last year's victory. The Scot ended a 77-year wait for a British champion by defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final and returns to the Championships without wearing that albatross around his neck for the first time. 'It builds to a point where last year was by far the most extreme pressure I’d felt in my career. It’s nice not to worry about it now,' Murray told the Evening Standard. All white on the night: Andy Murray models the new adidas collection he will be wearing at Wimbledon . Tough times: Andy Murray has had to deal with injury problems and changing coach since last summer . Three is the magic number! Andy Murray has been seeded third for his defence of the Wimbledon title . Since banishing the ghosts of Fred Perry last summer, Murray has struggled on tour as a consequence of two defining events - splitting with coach Ivan Lendl and undergoing crucial back surgery. Murray had an operation in September to resolve an issue with his back that had been troubling him for years, and is starting to feel the benefits. 'I was having to change the way I was training to try to deal with the back and it just got to a point where I was like ‘I’m tired of this’. 'I feel better now than I did, not so much endurance wise but in terms of the shots I can play without being in pain,' he says. However, while the physical scars of his operation are starting to heal, the British No 1 is still recovering from the emotional turmoil of ending his relationship with Lendl in March. Relief: Andy Murray admits it will be nice to play at Wimbledon without the usual pressure . At last! Andy Murray ended a 77-yer wait for a British champion after wining last year's Championships . 'It was like a double blow, it was a real setback for sure but only for a few weeks and then it’s time to move on. 'I spent a couple of great years with him but it’s time to try to move on.' Murray has since become the first high profile player to take on a female coach after agreeing to work with Former World No 1 Amelie Mauresmo at SW19. 'Ivan’s game was very consistent, high percentage, very solid, no weaknesses, he just did everything, well, great. Amelie played with more variety and flair, came to the net more, did more top spin,' he said. 'That’s more my sort of style so it might be a bit easier for her to explain those things to me and help me work on my strengths a bit more.' Girl power: Murray has become the first high profile player to take on a woman coach in Amelie Maursemo (L) Best defence: Andy Murray can count on previous experience when he tries to repeat history at SW19 . Murray, who has been seeded third, has been handed a favourable draw and will face Belgian David Goffin in the first round. He admits that successfully defending his crown will be challenging, but at least he can count on previous experience. 'Is it easier to win it a first time or defend it? I don’t know. What I do now is how tough it is to win Wimbledon.'","Andy Murray returns to defend his Wimbledon title at SW19 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A woman who’d fallen into arrears with her rent was let off the payments in return for helping a relative of her landlord find a teenage girl he could rape, a court heard. Muriel Coleman, 50, made no attempt to stop Hassan Akhtar  - whose family owned the flat she rented - repeatedly rape a teenager between December 2012 and March 2013, the jury was told. Akhtar told police Coleman is trying to frame him and it was in fact her he had sex with, an act he said was consensual. Trial: Muriel Coleman helped her landlord find a girl he could rape, a court heard . Coleman, 50, admitted two counts of assisting in the rape of a young woman. Akhtar, 37, denies four counts of rape and one attempted rape. The alleged rapes are said to have happened after Coleman, from Durham, found herself in financial difficulties. Sarah Mallett, prosecuting, said the alleged crimes came to light when the young woman confided in a friend. Concerned, the pal then alerted police who contacted the alleged victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - for an interview. Accused: Hassan Akhtar allegedly raped a teenage girl on several occasions . Durham Crown Court heard Akhtar had targeted the young woman at a flat in the Stanley area of County Durham and at his own home in Northgate, Stanley, while his wife and family were visiting relatives in Pakistan. The jury also heard Akhtar tried to groom the young woman by giving her gifts and promising to help her career. Ms Mallett said despite the teenager asking him to stop the alleged rapes, Akhtar is said to have told her to ‘shut up’ and that ‘men liked it’. She said: ‘The defendant took her round to his house and did the same sort of things. She didn’t want to do it, she just wanted to talk.’ She added: ‘[The victim] went on to say she had punched and kicked the defendant because he wasn’t stopping and she felt frustrated by what was happening.’ Detectives discovered semen which matched Akhtar’s DNA on a sleeping bag and on a camisole belonging to the young woman, the jury heard. The court heard Akhtar told police Coleman went to the shop and told Akhtar she would ‘get him done’. He also told police Coleman was financially hard up and needed money for the rent. Akhtar claims he agreed to lend her the money out of kindness and claims the pair then had sex which they both ‘enjoyed’, but Coleman denies this took place. Coleman will be sentenced for commissioning two alleged rapes at a later date. The trial of Akhtar resumes on Monday.

"By . Leesa Smith . The Balmain Shipyard holds a special place in the history of Sydney as both a depot and maintenance base for the harbour’s ferries for well over 100 years. Now only one of two remaining dry docks in Sydney, along with Garden Island, it was built on the Mort Bay site in 1975 and is part of a precious link in maritime heritage dating back to the colonial days when shipyards dotted the harbour foreshores. Meanwhile, Australia's first dry dock, Mort's Dock, also operated in the Balmain area but is no longer servicing. In Mort Dock's hey day, spanning from the 1850s until the end of World War II, more than a dozen shipyards, boatyards, dry docks and marine engineering facilities were located on Mort Bay and around Balmain. At knock-off time the thirsty painters, dockers and shipwrights would leave their slipways and workshops for the numerous nearby hotels and clubs, creating the lively pub culture and tight sense of community that still binds 'Balmainites' – in places like the 1857 Bar at the Dry Dock Hotel, the oldest licensed pub in the vicinity. The photo of the wharf pile driving team in 1913 was donated by Robyn Burg, whose great grandfather, P.E. Olson, is pictured front row, far right . Brett, who works as a rigger at the dry dock, is one of 65 highly skilled workers who maintain the Harbour City Ferries fleet . The tradition of craftsmanship continues to this day at the Balmain Shipyard as a highly skilled workforce of 65 maintains the Harbour City Ferries fleet of four Freshwater Class and two Lady Class ferries, nine First Fleet catamarans, plus seven RiverCats, four SuperCats and two HarbourCats – as well as naval vessels and tugboats. Mort Bay was the birthplace of heavy industry, where Mort Industries rose like a colossus in 1855 to become the nation’s biggest employer. Between 1940 and 1945, 14 Bathurst Class corvettes and four River Class frigates were built at Mort’s Dock, which proved a crucial cog in the war effort against Japan. The history of Balmain’s ferries indicates the shipyard, at its present site on Mort Bay, has been a base for ferry operations as far back as the 1860s or even earlier, although the exact year of commencement cannot be verified. Now only one of two remaining dry docks in Sydney, the scene is a vast contrast to its hey day from the 1850s until the end of World War II, when more than a dozen shipyards, boatyards, dry docks and marine engineering facilities were located on Mort Bay and around Balmain .

"By . Louise Cheer . Jamie Oliver's association with Woolworths has hit another snag, with the supermarket forced to undertake a product recall on all plush toys from the Jamie's Garden range. The range includes eight characters - Orange, Bean, Banana, Broccoli, Beetroot, Pear, Grape and Tomato. 'All eight characters may liberate stuffing during use and the hands and feet are small parts that are inadequately attached, presenting a potential choking hazard,' the ACCC website said. Scroll down for video . The full range of eight Jamie's Garden plush toys have been recalled by the supermarket giant . 'In addition, the wire in the bean character could pierce the fabric and cause eye injuries or puncture wounds to small children.' The products were sold across the nation in Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets from May 21 to June 16. Another recall was issued earlier this week by the supermarket giant, but it was only for the bean character. Jamie Oliver is the face of the campaign to get kids eating more fruit and vegetables . Customers who have purchased these toys should stop using the product as a precaution and return them to a Woolworths or Safeway store for a full refund. 'Woolworths apologises to its customers for any inconvenience caused by this recall,' the supermarket's website said. It has not been smooth sailing for the Jamie's Garden campaign. It is not the first time the campaign has run into trouble. Earlier this month fruit growers expressed outrage about a 40 cents a crate levy for marketing of Jamie's Garden . Earlier this month, vegetable growers were outraged by the supermarket giant charging them 40 cents a crate to pay for the marketing of Jamie's Garden, in addition to a promotional fee they were already forking over to Woolworths, Ausveg claims. One grower reportedly claimed it would cost them an extra $300,000 for the campaign, while others would be paying tens of thousands. It sparked the group that represents growers, Ausveg, to write to the celebrity chef and pleaded with him to talk to Woolworths about cancelling the fee.","Jamie's Garden toys found to be a potential choking hazard for children .

"By . Louise Cheer . A man who bludgeoned his wife with a pair of bolt cutters then sat down and drank a beer before he called emergency services. Troy Jay Power, 50, pleaded guilty to attacking Penelope Power on July 3, 2012. The couple had been married for 30 years but in the past two years leading up to the attack they had been living in separate bedrooms. Ms Power had started living somewhere else for the majority of the week. Troy Jay Power attacked his wife of 30 years with a pair of bolt cutters (similar to the ones pictured) while she was on the toilet . The Mandurah man appeared in Western Australia's Supreme Court on Friday. The court heard he had asked Ms Power to come to their Dudley Park home on Dadger Street to talk about their separation. He was angry because he believed she was seeing someone else. She had gone to the bathroom when Power forced the door open and struck her repeatedly on the head and face with the bolt cutters, while screaming: 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill myself. I'm not going to jail for anyone.' Ms Power made her way to the lounge room as the attack continued. At one point, Power pushed her to the ground and kicked her. Before he called 000 to raise the alarm, Power grabbed a beer and then threw the phone at Ms Power . As she lay on the floor bleeding and severely injured, Power asked: 'Do you want me to ring an ambulance, or do you want to die?' Ms Power said she wanted an ambulance, but he replied with: 'I will have another beer, and I will think about it.' After he got a beer, Power dialled 000 and, after speaking with an operator, threw the phone at his wife. The court heard that Ms Power was so frightened of what her husband might do if she told the truth that she claimed an intruder had attacked her. The Mandurah man appeared in WA's Supreme Court and pleaded guilty to the Dudley Park attack on Friday . In 2012, Mandurah Mail reported Ms Power had to undergo surgery for her injuries. On Friday Commissioner Kevin Sleight told Power: 'Your wife believed that she was going to die. 'The callousness of your attack is not only demonstrated by the injuries you inflicted, but your response immediately after the attack, by the manner in which you offered her assistance. 'It is very fortunate that your wife did not die. The use of bolt cutters is an aggravating feature because, potentially, blows to the head using bolt cutters was life threatening.' Power was sentenced to six years in prison and will be eligible for parole after four.","Troy Jay Power was sentenced to six years prison after pleading guilty .

"By . Leesa Smith . Former Olympic swimming champion Libby Trickett is five kilograms heavier than her competitive weight and has never been happier. As an elite athlete, Trickett, now 29, didn’t have the opportunity to embrace her feminine qualities. ‘You’re not a woman, you’re an athlete so it’s a very strong distinction between the two because you’re not allowed to have breasts, hips or a butt - those things can’t be there,’ she told the MailOnline. Trickett now exercises seven hours per week instead of the intense 35-hour regime she endured when she was a professional swimmer . Trickett fell into a deep depression for six months when she first retired at the end of 2009, after giving up on exercise which resulted in her gaining 10kg. ‘I tried to rebel against exercising, which you do after doing 35 hours a week of exercise for 10 years, but obviously it impacts on your mental and physical health,’ she said. Unsure of where to turn, Trickett decided to go back to what she did best and got back into the pool. A third gold medal later, Trickett retired again 12 months ago and is now just five kg heavier than her competitive weight, which she has maintained for the past eight months. Those dark days are well and truly over for the Queenslander, who now exercises seven hours a week - one fifth of the regime she endured as a professional swimmer. ‘The second time, l feel like I’m doing it better but being more patient with myself – a lot kinder and doing it with a lot more love,’ she said.  ‘I’m never going to be six foot tall and stick thin. 'I really love my body and I love all bodies – we all have such an amazing beauty that can just shine out of us.’ Champion swimmer Libby Trickett has learnt to love her 'wobbly bits' since retirement . Trickett’s philosophy is to ‘embrace your wobbly bits’. ‘It’s part of you and why can’t we love ourselves for what we are? ‘ she said. ‘I’m very lucky because my husband loves my wobbly bits and embraces them, and thinks I look fabulous, which is very nice for the ego.' She encourages everyone to take on her refreshing attitude to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. ‘I eat really well without restricting myself, so if I want to have pizza or ice cream I do but obviously all in moderation,’ she said. 'I exercise, I’m strong, fit and really healthy, and if this is the weight I come to naturally then why not enjoy it and be happy with it?’ Trickett has had to learn how to allow herself to be hungry. ‘It’s been quite a process for me because I have never been hungry in my life because as an athlete you are constantly fuelling yourself, so I’ve had to learn hunger and understand if I am hungry or I'm just eating because that’s what I’m used to doing,' she said. 'That’s the issue I got into in 2010 - I was just constantly feeding.’ Despite being 5kg heavier than her competitive weight, Trickett has never felt so good .","Former Olympic swimmer Libby Trickett didn't feel like a woman when she was an elite athlete due to the pressures to be at the top of her game .

London-based OwnFone has created the world’s first customisable Braille handset to give visually impaired people more independence and confidence with mobile devices. The company uses 3D printing to add personalised buttons to the front of the phone for specific contacts. London-based OwnFone has created the world's first customisable Braille handset to give visually impaired people more independence and confidence with devices. The phone, pictured, is based on the simple design of previous OwnFone models and costs £60. It is only currently available in the UK . In April last year, India designer . Sumit Dagar unveiled a concept design for a Braille phone. It is built using a grid of . pins that move up and down to create the shapes of words and image. His design uses shape-memory alloy technology to expand and contract to its original shape after use. Dagar demonstrated the phone's capabilities during a 2011 Ted Talk. He said users would be able to touch objects and images of people's faces. He also demonstrated how the technology would help people use maps, play games, and more. The OwnFone phone builder automatically converts contact names on buttons into braille. This technology can also be used to create textures and guide buttons for partially sighted or elderly people who can’t read Braille. OwnFone launched the world’s first custom printed mobile phone in 2012, and last year it released a simple handset for four- to nine-year-olds. The OwnFone Braille device is based on the simple design of these two previous devices, and costs £60. It is currently only available in the UK, but the company’s founder Tom Sunderland is planning to launch a Kickstarter campaign to sell it internationally.

"By . Emily Crane . Health authorities are running tests on five people who came in contact with a horse that died from the Hendra virus in northern NSW. The 31-year-old stockhorse gelding died on Thursday night and the NSW Health Department has since confirmed the animal was infected with the deadly virus. Authorities have quarantined the property, west of Murwillumbah on the state's north coast, to run tests on the horse's stablemates. A 31-year-old stockhorse gelding died on Thursday night and the NSW Health Department has since confirmed the animal was infected with the deadly virus . The horse was found in a dam earlier on Thursday and had been treated by a private veterinarian for very low body temperature prior to its death. 'Three people who handled the horse plus the veterinarian and an assistant are being assessed and monitored by NSW Health,' NSW deputy chief vet Therese Wright said. It's the first case of Hendra discovered in NSW this year. No horses have moved off the property in recent weeks and there are no dogs or cats about, according to Ms Wright. The paddock where the horse was kept 'has regular flying fox activity'. Authorities have quarantined a property, west of Murwillumbah on the state's north coast, to run tests on the horse's stablemates . Horses are believed to contract the Hendra virus from feed contaminated by urine, saliva or birthing fluids from flying foxes. 'Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above,' Ms Wright said. Hendra virus was found in four horses and a dog across four separate mid-north coast properties last year. Horses are believed to contract the Hendra virus from feed contaminated by urine, saliva or birthing fluids from flying foxes . 'Winter is the season when horses have been infected with Hendra in NSW in the past so now is the time to get a vaccine booster for your horse,' Ms Wright said. In Queensland four people have been killed by Hendra virus since 1994.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Rory McIlroy has played his first round of golf since announcing that he will play for Ireland rather than Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The 25-year-old will take part in the Olympics as golf makes its return to the Games for the first time since 1904, but things haven't been going his way during the first round of the Irish Open. Pre-tournament favourite McIlroy blamed a 'sloppy' short game for an opening round of 74 which left him facing a battle to avoid another early exit from the Irish Open. Not the best: Rory McIlroy blamed a 'sloppy' short game for an opening round of 74 . McIlroy has a relatively poor record in his national championship, recording two top-10 finishes in seven appearances and missing the cut last year along with Padraig Harrington, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell. The 25-year-old had the added incentives of being able to move top of the European Tour's Race to Dubai and getting back inside the top five on the world rankings with a good performance, but could only finish three over par in perfect conditions at Fota Island. 'I still drove the ball great and got in the positions that you need to, but short-sided myself a couple of times, hit a couple of loose shots with my wedges and could not get a putt to drop,' said McIlroy, who had carded an approximate 62 in Wednesday's pro-am. 'I was pretty sloppy with the scoring clubs so I might head to the range this afternoon to work on those. I need to do better tomorrow to be here for the weekend.' Struggle: McIlroy reacts after a bunker shot on the 11th during Day One of the 2014 Irish Open . Starting from the 10th, McIlroy hit his third shot to the 537-yard par-five over the green and had to scramble for his par, something he was unable to do on the short 11th after finding sand off the tee. McIlroy split the fairway on the next but had to save par again after coming up short of the green with his approach, while another missed green on the 14th resulted in a second bogey of the day after a duffed chip. A birdie on the par-five 18th took McIlroy to the turn in one over, but another bogey soon followed on the second when a misjudged approach flew well over the green. McIlroy was lucky not to pull his tee shot into the water on the third, but failed to make the most of his good fortune before repairing some of the damage with a birdie on the par-five fifth. After three-putting the sixth and failing to get up and down from a bunker on the seventh, McIlroy at least finished in style with a birdie on the last which prompted the two-time major winner to raise his arms in mock celebration. Incentive: McIlroy could move top of the European Tour Race to Dubai with a good performance . 'Not being able to do much on Monday and Tuesday was really frustrating, but I played well in the pro-am and had a good practice session on the range till about 8pm last night,' added McIlroy, whose clubs only arrived on Wednesday morning after being mislaid in transit from the United States. 'It's tough because I feel like I have been playing well for a while and I am still getting days like this. When you are playing well you should be capitalising on that and not throwing in scores like I did today (Thursday).' Playing partner Harrington fared considerably better than McIlroy, the three-time major winner also making a birdie on the last to return a two-under-par 69. But that was still five shots off the clubhouse target set by Finland's Mikko Ilonen, who carded eight birdies and one bogey to establish a new course record of 64. England's Matt Fitzpatrick, who was the leading amateur in last week's US Open, carded a one-over 72 in his first tournament round as a professional. Not going well: The 25-year-old cut a frustrated figure on the course at Fota Island .","Rory McIlroy plays for first time since announcing he will play for Ireland at 2016 Olympics .

"By . Ian Drury . Anna Soubry said the Coalition was not on course to meet a pledge to cut annual arrivals below 100,000 by next year . A Tory minister has admitted the Government is likely to miss its target to slash immigration after a huge surge in the number of foreign workers. Anna Soubry said the Coalition was not on course to meet a pledge to cut annual arrivals below 100,000 by next year. Figures showed an extra 292,000 people born overseas found jobs in Britain in the 12 months to March this year. It included a huge number from Poland and other ex-Eastern Bloc countries that joined the EU in May 2004. The total employed from those countries was 802,000 – an increase of 115,000 compared to a year ago. An extra 29,000 Romanians and Bulgarians were also at work here, while more than 20,000 of the 292,000 total came from western European countries such as Italy. And there were an extra 124,000 born outside the EU who found jobs in the UK in the last 12 months, taking that total to 2.8million. The Office for National Statistics figures made a massive dent in David Cameron’s 2010 election promise to reduce the number of newcomers. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister conceded to senior MPs he had not brought immigration down as much as he would have liked despite it being a key concern among voters. Yesterday Miss Soubry, a defence minister, said: ‘At the moment we don’t seem to be on course.’ But she insisted on Radio 4’s World At One programme that Number 10’s pledge had been aimed at illegal immigrants rather than those with the right to travel to the UK to work. She said: ‘It was actually about a large number of people who were here who definitely should not be here.’ Her stance was attacked by opponents. Labour immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘The Prime Minister promised no ifs, no buts, that he would get net migration down, yet under his government he has missed his own self-selected target.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government had to do more ‘to address people’s legitimate concerns’. She said: ‘Ministers aren’t doing enough to stop employers and agencies exploiting cheap migrant labour, particularly from Eastern Europe, to undercut wages and jobs.’ On Tuesday, the Prime Minister conceded to senior MPs he had not brought immigration down as much as he would have liked despite it being a key concern among voters . Ukip leader Nigel Farage said immigrants were driving down wages. He said: ‘Britain is becoming the cheap labour economy and I don’t think that is really socially a very desirable place for us to be.’ Mr Cameron, who is enjoying a poll boost because of the burgeoning economy, will hope the figures will not undermine his message on the doorstep and rile Right-wing Tories with the general election just a year away. He received support from veteran Conservative MP Nicholas Soames who warned that the party was packed with too many Eurosceptics. He compared the anti-European debate to that around capital punishment when he first sought election in the late 1970s. He said: ‘In those days the litmus test on the Right of the Tory party was hanging. If you weren’t pro-hanging you wouldn’t get selected. ‘Well now the litmus test is Europe. If you are not very Eurosceptic and prepared to go along with the more strongly held, but I think eccentric views, of some of these Conservative associations, you won’t get selected. That’s a great pity.’","Anna Soubry: 'Coalition unlikely to cut arrivals below 100,000 by 2015'

"By . David Mccormack . Women working at NBC’s Dateline show are regularly asked to pose as ‘sexual bait’ for stories about prostitution, sex trafficking, and sexual deviants according to a female producer who is now suing the network. New York-based Kimberly Lengle, 33, says she quit the program last April after a senior HR director failed to follow-up on her complaints about the practice. ‘NBC filmed Lengle for dozens of scenes using hidden cameras. Some scenes involved her saying and doing things that made her feel uncomfortable and vulnerable because of her sex,’ states her civil suit. Women working at NBC's Dateline show are regularly asked to pose as 'sexual bait' for stories about prostitution, sex trafficking, and sexual deviants according to a former producer . Lengle was hired as a producer for the Dateline series Wild Wild Web by supervisor Dan Slepian in 2012, reports TMZ. According to court papers, Lengle claims Slepian criticized her for not dressing provocatively enough and even asked why she didn’t have any nude photos of herself to send to men looking for ‘personal assistants’, but who were really after sexual playthings. ‘As part of the story development process, the producers required her to engage in sexual role play and serve as bait for the targets,’ the filing said. When Lengle spoke about her concerns to NBC’s Standards Department, she was assured that she wouldn’t have to do anything that made her queasy, the suit states. In her lawsuit, Lengle singles out Dateline supervisor Dan Slepian and claims he criticized her for not dressing provocatively enough . A step too far for Lengle was when Slepian wanted her to post a photo of herself on Craigslist in response to an ad by a sexual deviant looking for a ‘human punching bag.’ ‘She told him that she believed it was dangerous for her to have sent her photograph, which the target could upload to multiple adult websites,’ the suit states. In the end many of the segments never aired. In her lawsuit Lengle also argues that male producers were never required to do stories based on sex. Any non-sexual stories that she pitched were either turned down or given to male staffers. An NBC News spokeswoman told TMZ that Lengle’s allegations were taken ‘very seriously’ but the company ‘determined that her claims were without merit.’","Kimberley Lengle, 33, is suing NBC because she claims she was regularly asked to pose as ‘sexual bait’ for stories about sexual deviants .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today admitted voters are ‘frustrated’ at the pace of action to tackle immigration into Britain. The Prime Minister said voters wanted the government to go further and faster in curbing the numbers of people arriving in the UK. It comes as ministers prepare for figures – to be released on the day of the European elections - which are expected to show net migration from within the European Union has overtaken arrivals from the rest of the world. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show how net migration among people from elsewhere in Europe is on course to overtake those from outside the EU . Mr Cameron has promised to reduce net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving – to less than 100,000 by 2015. But after falling in the early days of the coalition it has started to rise again, fuelled by growing numbers of people arriving from the rest of Europe. Ukip has stepped up pressure on the government with an aggressive campaign, warning the government can do nothing about the issue while Britain remains in the EU. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that he will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ by winning the European Parliament elections on May 22, pushing the Tories into third. Now it has emerged that within weeks new figures will show how net migration from within the EU is responsible for the majority of the population rise linked to immigration. In the year to September net migration stood at 212,000, which the Office for National Statistics said was a ‘statistically significant increase’ from 154,000 in the previous year. David Cameron claimed support for Nigel Farage's Ukip was fuelled by public frustration by the pace of progress in tackling immmigration . More detailed figures show that net migration of EU citizens almost doubled to 131,000 from 65,000 the previous year. An estimated 209,000 citizens from the rest of the EU arrived in the UK, the highest since records began in 1964. At the same time only 78,000 left. It means that net migration from within the EU stood at 131,000, just 10,000 lower than the figure for non-EU migrants. Just two years ago the gap was more than 150,000. The figures expose how government action to tackle immigration is hindered by EU freedom of movement laws. While rules have been tightened for people from outside the EU, little can be done for EU nationals. Mr Cameron admitted the issue has left voters frustrated, which was part of the rason for the surge in support for Ukip. He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I think there are lots of things happening here. First of all we’ve been through a very painful and difficult recession that has caused damage to families right up and down our country, we’re recovering from that, we’ve got more people in work, people are seeing our economy turn round, but it takes time and people feel frustrated by that. ‘Added to that, you’ve got issues like immigration, like reform of welfare, where I would argue this government has made huge progress, but people would like us to go further and faster and they’re frustrated by that.’","Prime Minister says government failing to keep up with public expectations .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Three years after the biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl struck the east coast of Japan, many regions still lie desolate. The clean-up effort is hindered due to the continued risk of radiation to human workers and, as a result, drones have been sent in to record the destruction. During this mission, one drone captured the sheer extent of the devastation as it swept across the Japanese ghost town of Tokioma. Scroll down for video .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The novelty song ‘Yes, we have no bananas’ was written in the 1920s about a shortage of the fruit after a blight in Brazil. But it may need a modern reprise as a fungus is spreading across the planet and could lead to a critical shortage and affect the livelihoods of millions. An international delegation of scientists have met in South Africa to formulate a plan to contain an outbreak in Mozambique, as fear that the disease could spread to Latin America grows. Is bananageddon on the horizon? An incurable fungus called Panama Disease is spreading across the planet devastating banana plants, which could lead to a critical shortage of the fruit and affect the livelihoods of millions of people . Panama Disease or Foc-TR4 has been sweeping through banana plantations in Asia since around 2005 before spreading to Australia and ruining the industry in the Darwin region. It has been devastating plantations since the 1980s in Malaysia, but scientists are unsure of its origin. The fungus infects the roots of the Cavendish variety of the plants and then moves upwards through the xylem, clogging the sap flow and causes leaves to wilt and rot. It can lie dormant in plants for up to three years and possibly in soil. A report suggests that a 3,600 acre plantation in Mozambique is infested with Panama Disease. ‘The future looks bleak’ and the disease could spread to crops beyond Mozambique’s borders, Altus Viljoen, a South African plant pathologist told PopSci’s Dan Koeppel, who has written a book on bananas. The incurable disease, also known as Foc-TR4, has swept banana plantations in Asia in 2005 before spreading to Australia and ruining the industry in the Darwin region. However, there have been cases of the disease in Malaysia since the 1980s. The fungus infects the roots of the Cavendish variety of banana and then moves upwards through the plant's tissue, clogging the sap flow and causes leaves to wilt and rot. Bananas generate $8billion (£4.7billion) every year and the United Nations says more than 400 million people rely on the fruit as their main source of calories. Hungry for action: Bananas generate $8billion (£4.7billion) every year and the United Nations says more than 400million people rely on the fruit as their main source of calories. Here, a boy eats a stew of bananas, beans, potatoes and peanuts in Burundi . Experts are unsure how the fungus arrived in Mozambique but one theory is that Filippino workers who arrived in 2008 to build a new plantation accidentally brought it with them. The fungus is so infectious that just a single clump of earth could have triggered and infestation. Another theory is that the disease was lying dormant in the soil all along and scientists are now analysing the strain of the fungus in a bid to find out if it shares genetic markers with samples from elsewhere. Scientists are trying to come up with a plan of containing an outbreak of Panama Disease in Mozambique, which has ravaged banana plants (stock image) Experts believe the new plantation that has now been decimated by the disease was poorly equipped to contain the spread of the fungus and farms share drainage facilities, which likely spread contaminated water. It is thought that the 2,500 workers walked across the land to and from work, unwittingly helping the disease to spread. A spokesman from Chiquita, which originally set up the Mozambique plantation, said that Panama Disease is of long-term danger to the industry. A breed of old-fashioned banana called Gros Michel was affected by a similar blight and became functionally extinct by 1960. It was replaced by the Cavendish variety, which we eat today. Chiquita is now researching a replacement banana called GCTCV 219, which is a little bit sweeter and resistant to the disease, but takes longer to harvest. Scientists think that the best solution to the problem is variety and in India for example, approximately 600 varieties of the fruit are available. Around 45 per cent of the world’s bananas are the Cavendish variety, so millions could be decimated by the disease. As banana workers move between countries, there are fears that the fungus could spread to Latin America, where bananas are big business. And it could already be there as the fungus has an incubation period of between two and three years.","Scientists have met in South Africa to come up with a plan of containing an outbreak of Panama Disease in Mozambique .

"By . Mark Duell . This dramatic footage captured by police officers on the beat arresting criminals and helping victims was today released, as Scotland Yard begins the world's biggest trial of uniform-mounted cameras. But privacy groups today raised concerns over how recordings made on the cameras will be handled, whether people will know they are being filmed - and if they will be able to access their own copy. The trial will see 500 cameras distributed to ten London boroughs. Firearms officers will also be testing the cameras in training with a view to wearing them if the pilot is successful. It follows criticism of the force following the death 29-year-old Mark Duggan at the hands of armed officers, which sparked the 2011 riots in the capital and further afield. Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the cameras would result in speedier justice for victims, particularly in cases of domestic violence. Scroll down for video . Hands up: In another video, an officer says 'the camera's rolling' while a man sits on the floor of a bedroom . Confession: The man says: 'I robbed him and he didn't give me what I want, so I stabbed him before I left' Police presence: The man is arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, and handcuffed . He said: ‘Body-worn video will not only help us fight crime and support victims but help the Met to be more accountable. 'Our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident' Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police commissioner . ‘Our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident. ‘That speeds up justice, puts offenders behind bars more quickly and protects potential victims. Video captures events in a way that can't be represented on paper in the same detail. ‘And it has been shown the mere presence of this type of video can often defuse potentially violent situations without the need for force to be used. Trial: Constable Yasa Amerat (left) and Constable Craig Pearson pictured in their police car wearing body-worn video cameras, ahead of a year-long pilot scheme by the Metropolitan Police, at Kentish Town in London . Up close: The trial will see 500 cameras distributed to ten London boroughs. Firearms officers will also be testing the cameras in training with a view to wearing them if the pilot is successful . Fighting crime: The Metropolitan Police says the new cameras will result in speedier justice for victims . Fire: The trial follows criticism of the force following the death 29-year-old Mark Duggan at the hands of armed officers, which sparked the 2011 riots in London (pictured) and further afield . ‘I believe it will also show our officers at their best, dealing with difficult and dangerous situations every day but it will also provide clearer evidence when it's been alleged that we got things wrong. That has to be in both our own and the public's interest.’ Controversial incident: The Met wants to repair the damage to its relationship with the community caused by the shooting of Mark Duggan (pictured) The debate over the more widespread use of body-worn cameras by British police comes after a jury at the inquest into Duggan's death concluded in January that he had been lawfully killed after being shot dead by Met marksmen - a conclusion which prompted outrage from his family and supporters. None of the officers involved in the incident in London were wearing body cameras. The . Met has continued its efforts to attempt to repair the damage to its . relationship with the community caused by the controversial shooting. Speaking . ahead of the pilot, the Met said officers taking part in the pilot must . comply with guidelines about when cameras are to be used, but that they . will not be permanently switched on. Camden Borough is the first to take . delivery of the new cameras, from today, with further trials in Barnet, . Bexley, Bromley, Brent, Croydon, Ealing, Havering, Hillingdon and . Lewisham. Officers will store material from each incident and keep it on file for a month unless required for evidence purposes. Sir Bernard said the cameras could have helped in the Duggan case. He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I think as we saw in the recent incident - fairly recent incident - regarding Mark Duggan, there was a great dispute about what Mark Duggan was holding at the time he was shot, and this hopefully would have helped to resolve that.’ Praise: The cameras have been welcomed by former shadow home secretary David Davis (pictured), who said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy ever taking place . Admitted swearing: The Plebgate affair happened in 2012 when former chief whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured) was told by police officers that he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of Downing Street . If officers are found to regularly fail to switch on their cameras when they should do it will be treated as a disciplinary offence, he added. Sir Bernard said the cameras would ‘capture the reality of some of the horrible things we have to deal with from time to time’. Civil liberties campaigners may observe some irony in the launch of body cameras for police. That is because officers have previously used anti-terrorism laws to stop the public taking pictures of them, which is actually legal. Police were warned against using the Counter-Terrorism Act five years ago to stop people taking pictures of officers. Lord Carlile said in a review of anti-terror laws in 2009 that officers who force photographers to delete images could face prosecution. Section 58A of the Counter-Terrorism Act came into force that year, banning photography of police that could be useful to terrorists. The maximum sentence is ten years in jail. Campaigners warned at the time that it could stop the media recording protests or evidence of heavy-handed policing. Big Brother Watch said today that nobody 'should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves'. The privacy group did add that the cameras could improve accountability of the police, but only if they are ‘implemented properly, particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way’. However, the cameras found a strong supporter in the face of former shadow home secretary David Davis. The staunch libertarian said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy two years ago ever taking place. Mr Davis said: 'Had it been recorded then the dispute wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be arguing about who said what.' The cameras have also been welcomed by former shadow home secretary David Davis, who said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy ever taking place. He told The Guardian: 'If there's a disputed event between the police and public there should be video evidence available. ‘And if it's not there then there will be an assumption that it's not been provided, that the police are culpable. 'Plebgate is the obvious case. Had it been recorded then the dispute wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be arguing about who said what.' The Plebgate affair happened in 2012 when former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was told by police officers that he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of Downing Street. Exactly what happened next is still a matter of legal dispute, with 58-year-old Mr Mitchell admitting to have sworn - but, crucially, denying ever calling officers ‘plebs’. Pc Keith Wallis, 53, a Scotland Yard diplomatic protection officer, was jailed for one year in February after he admitted lying about witnessing the row that ultimately led to the resignation of Mr Mitchell. Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, told MailOnline today: ‘No member of the public should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves. ‘There have been too many instances in the past where officers have prevented members of the public from filming incidents involving the police, citing nonsense claims that it is illegal for them to do so. If the police want to gain public support for body worn cameras, then the right to film must work both ways. ‘However, if these cameras are implemented properly, particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way, there is potential for this to improve accountability of the police. ‘That is not to say that they do not risk also damaging the relationship between the police and the public, and the potential for abuse is clear, but if properly regulated, they can improve protection for both police officers and members of the public.’","One video shows police helping domestic abuse victim with blood on her .

"By . Tim Bugler . Killed: Good Samaritan Charlene Reaveley had stopped to help the victim of a crash in Canada . A drunk driver who killed a mother of four after she stopped to help accident victims was yesterday jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Fitness trainer Charlene Reaveley, 30, originally from Fintry, Dundee, died instantly when she was hit by a two-ton Jeep Cherokee travelling at nearly 40 miles an hour. Driver Cory Sater was so drunk that he was ‘oblivious’ to the fact that Mrs Reaveley was at the roadside helping the victims of an earlier accident. Yesterday, Mrs Reaveley’s mother Mary Ogilvie told a court in Canada: ‘Everything near and dear to me was taken away that night.’ The fitness trainer and her husband, Dan, had stopped on Vancouver’s Lougheed Highway half an hour after midnight on a February night in 2011 to help Lorraine Cruz, 26, and her boyfriend, Paulo Calimbahin, after their car hit the central reservation. The couple and their friends Kimberley and Giacomo Debenedictis were heading home from a night out when they saw the Nissan Pathfinder spin and crash. They ran to help the occupants out of their damaged vehicle. Moments later, Sater’s Jeep Cherokee side-swiped the Pathfinder and hit Mrs Reaveley, Miss Cruz and Mr Calimbahin. Both women were catapulted more than 60 feet and killed outright, while Mr Calimbahin lost one of his legs. Sater, a 40-year-old roofer, drove off. His car was found abandoned a few miles away. The single father of two was found guilty last year of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two of drink-driving causing death. Devastating: The drunk driving of Cory Slater (left) also killed Lorraine Cruz (right) who was in an earlier crash . During a three-and-a-half week trial, the court heard he had spent the evening leading up to the crash downing Canadian whiskey and alcoholic ‘shots’, running up a $80 bar bill. In addition to a jail sentence, Justice James Williams, judge at New Westminster Supreme Court, near Vancouver, banned Sater from driving for eight years. Mrs Reaveley had emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, with her family at the age of seven. At yesterday’s sentencing  hearing, observers on the public benches wiped away tears as her mother, her voice trembling, read out an emotional victim-impact statement. She said: ‘Charlene was my only child. I am a mother now, but I do not have my child. Everything near and dear to me was taken away that night. ‘I’m haunted by the memories of her . being buried. She was my only child and my entire world. She’s on my . mind 24/7. As a family, we are in pain.’ Devoted: Mother-of-four Charlene Reaveley stopped to help the victims of another crash on a Canada highway . Toll: The 30-year-old's on-in-law, who suffers from post-traumatic symptoms, was too upset to address the court . She said she still suffered from depression, nightmares and anxiety, and was on medication. Her son-in-law, who suffers from post-traumatic symptoms, was too upset to address the court. His sister read his statement in which he said he had contemplated suicide, but knew he had to keep living for the sake of his four children, who were ten, six, four and one when their mother died. He said the loss of his childhood sweetheart was ‘like losing your sight after 30 years’. Mr Calimbahin said in his statement: ‘Mr Sater took my leg and my job, but more importantly he took my future.’ Sater addressed the court in sobs. He said he tortured himself every day over the deaths, knowing the children had lost their mother. Crown prosecutor Christopher McPherson had called his actions an ‘act of remarkable selfishness, on a par with manslaughter’.","Drunk Cory Slater had no clue Charlene Reaveley, 30, was at the roadside .

"By . Mia De Graaf . To most, Sister Act is a feel-good musical comedy which sees nuns combat crime in San Francisco. But it seems the 90s blockbuster may also be the inspiration for London's latest approach to tackling slavery and trafficking. Drafting in more than 450 nuns from a Spanish order, the Metropolitan Police Force has uncovered 250 kidnapped women in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster over the past year. Inspiration? Whoopi Goldberg's 1992 film follows nuns fighting crime - a scheme now adopted by London police . The European-funded scheme has been backed by Pope Francis, who met with Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Hyland on April 11. Describing the unusual move, DCI Hyland said: 'Women from religious orders are in our cars on operations, at the coal face, on the front line. 'The nuns come out with us. We make sure the premises are safe, then the victims are taken to the houses of the nuns.' Experts have found victims are reluctant to interact with police as they are made to believe officers will beat them. More than 450 nuns from a London-based Spanish order have joined the Metropolitan Police Force . Pope Francis (left) has given it his backing after meeting with senior officers. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right), the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the pontiff's backing is invaluable support for the scheme . Sister Act was one of the highest grossing films of the 1990s. Starring Whoopi Goldberg as a singer-turned-crime fighter, Maggie Smith as mother superior, and Lauryn Hill as a wayfaring teenager, the story is an emotional journey to tackle crime in San Francisco. Goldberg, as Deloris Van Cartier, is a lounge singer in the Reno Lounge, which is run by her mobster boyfriend Vince LaRocca. One night, she sees him kill his chauffeur, and he orders his cronies to kill her too. Reluctantly taking refuge in Poor Clares, Deloris is persuaded to take on the persona of Sister Mary Clarence and live the strict life of a nun. She resists the lifestyle - until she bonds with some of the sisters over a piano. And when she performs a rock-n-roll version of Hail Holy Queen at Sunday Mass, crowds of people - including teenagers - flock in off the street. Newly-inspired, she takes her music to the convent classroom in a bid to get the kids off the path to crime and destitution. As they move through the city, successfully saving people from a life of crime, word spreads and eventually Pope John Paul II travels to witness their work. With the help of plain-clothed nuns, many of whom speak Spanish, officers can communicate more effectively with the women. The sisters, mostly from South America, Spain and India, have been accompanying officers on late-night raids since January 2013. Plans are now being drafted to roll out the scheme across Britain following the unexpected results. Pope Francis hailed the scheme as a model for police forces worldwide. Speaking at a conference organised by the Catholic Bishops' Conference for England and Wales, the pontiff said: 'Human trafficking is an open wound on the body of contemporary society, a scourge upon the body of Christ. It is a crime against humanity.' The scheme, believed to be the first of its kind, echoes the 1992 Whoopi Goldberg classic - now a sell-out production on London's West End. Playing a singer on the run from her mobster boyfriend, Goldberg's character Deloris Van Cartier is put under protective custody in Poor Clares convent. For her safety, she is told to disguise herself as a nun. Indignant, she initially objects to the simple and strict life of the convent. But after befriending some of her fellow nuns at the piano, Deloris is inspired to use music to bring the community together. The . rest of the film is an emotional journey, following the Poor Clares . sisters as they reach out to San Francisco, and work with the . underprivileged teenagers at the convent school, seemingly destined for a . life of crime. Now, with the backing of the pope, cities across the world could see the format cropping up. Sir . Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the . pope's backing emphasises the effectiveness of the project. 'By making such a declaration it encourages governments to take this to a very high priority,' he said.

Rebels detonated 60 tonnes of explosives packed underneath a large Syrian army base, blowing a hillside hundreds of metres into the air, an insurgent in the operation who provided footage of the attack said today. An Islamic Front commander said that his brigade dug a 850-metre (2,800ft) tunnel underneath Wadi al-Deif base, which is surrounded by rebels but has remained inside government control for the entirety of the three-year-long civil war.

'Another attack like this and we won't even need to move in to take the base,' he said via Skype, adding that once rebels take the base they would control all of the south Idlib, which is situated in Syria's northwest bordering on Turkey.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ukip was dragged into a fresh hypocrisy row today after it emerged it has been printing anti-EU election leaflets - in Germany. Nigel Farage's party has campaigned to protect British jobs, slash immigration and pull out of the European Union. But instead of using a British firm to help the party's campaign it took 'full advantage of the European single market' to place its order abroad. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, unveiling the party's anti-EU billboard in the run-up to the elections, has faced accusations of hypocrisy after his party used a German company to print its campaign leaflets . Mr Farage, pulling a pint of 'Proper Job' during a visit to the North-east last month, has faced increasing levels of scrutiny following his party's rise to the top of the polls ahead of next week's European elections . The revelation comes after it emerged the party had hired Eastern Europeans to hand out its anti-immigration flyers ahead of next week's European elections. Latvians were employed by a company called Fast Leaflet in Croydon, south London, to hand out flyers for Mr Farage's party. At the time, Tory MP Gavin Barwell said: 'Ukip’s hypocrisy knows no bounds.' He added: 'They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can’t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.' It also comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke. Mr Farage has also faced personal accusations of double-standards after employing his German wife as his secretary - claiming no Brits would want to work for him. The Ukip leader said ordinary Brits would not want to put in the same hours as his partner, Kirsten, who is paid £25,000 as his secretary by the European Parliament. He was challenged over the appointment after he launched a £1.5million poster campaign for the European elections that warned 26 million unemployed Europeans were 'after' British jobs, driving down wages and leaving British workers begging on the streets. Asked whether there is no British person able to do the job, Mr Farage said: 'No, because I don't think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight, going through emails, getting me briefed for the next day. 'Nobody else could do that job. I don't know anybody who would work those kinds of hours.' He added: 'That is a very different situation to the mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market.' Ukip claimed its poster campaign was a 'hard-hitting reflection of reality' - but it later emerged that it had used an Irish actor to represent a British builder put out of work because of immigration . Ukip's rise in the polls has sparked an increasing number of protests against the party. Nigel Farage's regional organiser in Wales, John Atkinson (centre), was forced to tell supporters in Swansea last month that the party leader would not be turning up because of security issues . Ukip has insisted its latest gaffe, using a foreign firm to print its flyers, was a mistake - blaming the internet for making it hard to know where products are made. The leaflets were distributed in west London to support Paul Motion, the Ukip council candidate for Hounslow in west London. They were printed by Saxoprint, a European firm that employs 400 in Britain and have an office in Chiswick. But according to trade magazine PrintWeek, all of the company’s printing takes place in Germany. Ukip's Nigel Farage was yesterday roundly attacked for stoking fears that Britain would be swamped by Romanians and Bulgarians. Figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year . A Liberal Democrat source it was 'good to see Ukip taking full advantage of the European single market'. But Ukip's Colin Botterill, who placed the order for the leaflets, said: 'I wasn’t aware of it when we ordered the printing. I saw the Chiswick address and thought “fantastic we’re supporting a local business”. ‘I only found out the company was German when I phoned to chase delivery and asked whether I could pick the leaflets up, and was told they were on a plane from Germany. ‘I was a bit disappointed. This is the problem with the internet, you don’t necessarily know where things are coming from.’ He added: ‘We try and support local businesses and in future we want to use local printers. We will be getting a CV off them first.’ The Labour party has also used Saxoprint for materials that have been delivered to households in Reading, promoting its candidate David Absolom. A spokesman said: 'The Labour Party uses a range of firms and most of our print is done in the UK.' Mr Farage has called for an Australian-style points-based system that would only allow skilled people with no criminal records into the country, cutting immigration to 30,000-50,000 people a year. That could see higher numbers of Indian and New Zealanders coming to Britain but fewer eastern Europeans, he said. Mike Gapes, the MP for Ilford South, said Ukip's plans to curb immigration would leave Britain resembling Albania, which shut itself off from the rest of the world during the communist era. Nick Clegg suggested he would not block a referendum in the event of a future coalition . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today hinted he would not stand in the way of David Cameron's plans for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union in a new coalition after the next general election. The Liberal Democrat leader said there would be more important issues for him - such as ""fairer"" taxes - in any coalition negotiations in the event of another hung parliament. His comments come after Mr Cameron said he would not lead another government after the election next year unless there was a commitment to a referendum before the end of 2017. While Mr Clegg said he stood by his position that there should not be a referendum unless there was a fresh transfer of powers to Brussels, he indicated that it was not a ""die-in-the-ditch"" issue for him. 'I am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'Are there die-in-the-ditch issues which I have highlighted in the past which I care about, frankly, even more than this? Yes. I think fairer taxes is something I've campaigned for. 'That is something I care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held.' Mr Clegg said that past history suggested there would be changes to the EU treaties which would require a referendum in the UK under legislation passed by the coalition. 'I have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum,"" he said. 'If you look back at the development of the European Community, and subsequently the European Union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at European level. 'So I think, if history is any guide, it's more than likely to happen again. At that point there should be a referendum, we've guaranteed that in law.'","Nigel Farage dragged into fresh hypocrisy row over EU flyers gaffe .

"By . Lucy Crossley . All they wanted to do was make their lawn look pretty. Fed up with motorists parking on the verge, this couple planted a colourful flowerbed to keep them away. For the past 15 years, they have nurtured daffodils, pansies and hydrangeas, which were admired by all their neighbours. Colin and Kath Halsey have been told they could face criminal damage charges after planting daffodils and pansies on a grass verge outside their home . 15 years after they first planted the flowers in 1999 the couple have been warned by a council official that their 'planting activity' was a criminal offence . But the local council has suddenly decided that the well-kept flowerbed is a criminal offence under the Highways Act. And it has threatened Colin Halsey, 77, and his wife, Kath, 76, with court action unless they dig it up. The trouble started when a council officer inspecting the area warned Mr Halsey, who has lived in the house in Northwich, Cheshire, for 53 years, about his ‘planting activity’. The retired salesman then received a letter saying he could be charged with ‘criminally damaging the highway’ – which carries a maximum £50 fine – if he failed to remove the plants and returf the area at his own expense. The Halseys planted these flowers and bushes on the verge outside their home to stop motorists churning up the grass whenever they parked their cars . The illicit beds were spotted when the council worker carried out an inspection of the village . Mr Halsey was told by a council worker that planting the flowers amounted to a criminal offence under section 131 of the Highways Act 1980, . ‘This situation really upsets us – especially as we have nurtured that flowerbed for the best part of 15 years,’ Mr Halsey said. ‘We spent a lot of money to make the area look nice and now some council jobsworth wants us to get it back to how it was. ‘The front garden used to look terrible with cars churning up the soil. 'All we wanted to do was to stop that for the good of the neighbourhood. All our neighbours liked the flowerbed. When Mr Halsey failed to remove the flowers he was sent a legal letter, accusing the pensioner of adding extra plants . Today the couple were warned they may face a charge of 'removing any soil or turf from any part of a highway without lawful authority' The trouble began when a chestnut tree, which had stood in this spot, was felled and the area was subsequently visited by a council officer . The letter sent to the Halseys from a worker at Cheshire West and Chester Council warning them that the verge should be restored to its original state . ‘The council say if an accident happened on the flowerbed it would not be known who was liable if someone got sued. ‘No one gave a damn for almost 15 years – now we’re being threatened with a criminal record.’ He added: ‘Surely the council have better things to do. The chestnut tree being cut down outside Mr and Mrs Halsey's home . Mr Halsey said that his front garden had looked 'terrible' with cars churning up the soil, and he wanted to stop this 'for the good of the neighbourhood' Mr Halsey suggested that council workers could turn their attentions to sorting out damaged verges in other parts of their street . ‘There must be more important things they need to focus on, like cleaning the streets and sorting the churned-up lawns in the rest of the area.’ The great-grandparents have spent more than £250 on flowers and bedding plants for the verge, which they planted as part of a tidy-up project in 1999 for the millennium celebrations. A spokesman for Cheshire West and Chester Council said: ‘We do have a responsibility to maintain grass verges and it’s very difficult to do that if there are things people have done on their own. ‘What we would like to do in this case is discuss with the residents to see if some kind of formal agreement can be put in place.’ The Halseys planted the flowers on the verge to brighten up the area, and to stop the grass outside their home from ending up like this . Mr and Mrs Halsey's own garden is just as colourful as the beds they planted outside their home . The Halseys, pictured celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary, say that all they wanted to do was make the grass verge 'look nicer'","Colin and Kath Halsey turned a roadside verge into pretty flowerbeds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nearly 12,000 criminals have walked free from British courts with suspended sentences despite having at least ten previous convictions, it was revealed today. A staggering 11,670 repeat offenders had their prison terms suspended last year - with 9,052 of these having 15 or more previous convictions on their record. The suspended sentences were meted out for a range of offences, including theft, molesting children, taking a bomb into a hotel, benefit fraud, burglary and faking a death. Cushy courts: Nearly 12,000 criminals walked free from British courts with suspended sentences last year despite having at least ten previous convictions, says a report by the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank . They were also handed to criminals who had thrown fireworks into a crowd, strangled a cat and had sex with a dog. The latest figures, dating from May 2012 to June 2013, were released today in a report by the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank. Researchers claim they are part of an increasing trend for British judges to suspend the sentences of serious criminals and repeat offenders. Peter Cuthbertson, the report's author and centre director, said that, altogether, 31 . per cent of jail sentences were suspended last year - compared with just . two per cent a decade ago.

Repeat offender: The suspended sentences were meted out for a range of offences, including theft, molesting children, taking a bomb into a hotel, benefit fraud, burglary, faking a death and strangling a cat (file picture) One judge apparently told researchers that suspended sentences are now handed out in courts 'a bit like confetti'. It comes as information released by a Freedom of Information request has revealed that 110,745 criminals with previous suspended sentences were convicted for further offences last year. A shocking 215 of these criminals had ten or more suspended sentences behind them. Freed: Altogether, 31 per cent of jail sentences were suspended last year - compared with just two per cent a decade ago, says the report . Mr Cuthbertson said: 'Thugs and sex offenders who think they are finally going to prison are overjoyed when find out that the prison sentence has been suspended. 'It makes a mockery of justice for victims and puts the public at great risk. These figures show that criminals given suspended sentences go on to commit hundreds of thousands of crimes. He added: 'Suspended sentences should be abolished. Victoria In Australia is currently in the process of abolishing failing suspended sentences. 'In light of similar failings here, England Wales should do the same.' Despite the think-tank's claims that suspended sentences are not effective, courts in many parts of the country are increasingly using them as a way of dealing with crimes. Courts in Hertfordshire have seen the biggest rise over the past ten years - with an increase of 82 per cent in the number of suspended sentences handed to criminals. Just one per cent of sentences in Hertfordshire were suspended by judges in 2002/3, but in 2012/13, the figure was a whopping 36 per cent. Meanwhile, courts in Bedfordshire saw a 26 per cent increase, those in Cambridgeshire saw a 34 per cent increase and there was a 32 per cent rise in Merseyside.

"By . Jill Reilly . and Ian Drury . Britain is to be investigated by the International Criminal Court over claims of war crimes by troops. Prosecutors in the Hague have launched a 'preliminary examination' into allegations UK forces tortured and mistreated Iraqi prisoners between 2003 and 2008. It is the first time the ICC, which usually prosecutes dictators who systematically maim and kill civilians, has investigated Britain for alleged war crimes. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says she has reopened a preliminary investigation into Iraq to examine allegations that British soldiers may have committed war crimes by abusing prisoners from 2003 to 2008 (file photo) It took the first step towards a . formal investigation after studying more than 400 allegations of . beating, sexual assault, mock executions and electric shocks of Iraqi . captives. The claims are made in a 250-page dossier compiled by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers. It raises the prospect of soldiers, . commanders and politicians, including four former Labour defence . secretaries – Geoff Hoon, John Reid, Des Browne and John Hutton – who . are named in the file being put on trial for war crimes. The move provoked anger among ministers and the military. Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK . forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Public Interest Lawyers, intent on . discrediting the Armed Forces, are slinging mud in every direction in . the desperate hope that some will stick. ‘The ICC performs a valuable role in . bringing war criminals to book from dictatorships that will not . prosecute them. That does not apply to the UK, which has the . oldest-established and most highly respected legal system in the world.’ Last night Attorney General Dominic . Grieve said the UK would co-operate fully but that the Government . ‘completely rejected’ the claim that UK forces were responsible for . systematic abuse. The ICC first looked at allegations . of abuse in Iraq in 2006, but decided that an investigation was not . needed because the claims were not serious or widespread enough. In a statement, prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she would review 'new information' she received in January alleging that British officials bear responsibility for wrongdoing . Yesterday ICC prosecutor Fatou . Bensouda said an examination was being opened after ‘new information’ that the UK was involved in alleged systematic abuse of detainees was . received. Mr Grieve said he believed the ICC . would decide there was no need for it to carry out a full investigation . because Britain is already investigating claims of abuse in Iraq. One inquiry collapsed in March when . lawyers admitted there was no evidence to support Iraqi claims that . troops murdered prisoners and mutilated their bodies following a battle . in 2004. The Iraq Historic Allegations Team, . led by former civilian detectives, is currently dealing with a further . 52 allegations of unlawful killing by British forces and 93 allegations . of mistreatment following the toppling of Saddam Hussein. Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon is among those named in the file . The ICC could take several years to . decide whether to take its inquiry further but under its statute can . intervene only when a nation is carrying out no effective investigation. The . Director of Service Prosecutions Andrew Cayley QC - who is responsible . for prosecutions of service personnel - said the UK would co-operate . fully with the preliminary examination by the prosecutor. He . said was confident that the case would not move to a formal . investigation as the UK was already conducting its own inquiry through . the Iraq Historical Allegations Team (IHAT) established in 2010. Under the Statute of Rome which established the ICC, the court can only intervene in cases where there is no effective investigation by the national authorities. 'If the ICC is satisfied that the United Kingdom is genuinely investigating these crimes, they will allow us to do that. 'They may go on monitoring us for a number years in respect of investigations and prosecutions but they will not intervene,' he said. 'Of course in the end it is for the prosecutor of the ICC to determine this, but I am confident based on the work that I've seen that IHAT has been doing, that the court will find that these are genuine criminal investigations that are taking place and they won't take it any further.' The . preliminary examination was launched in response to a 250-page dossier . submitted to the prosecutors office in January by the British law firm, . Public Interest Lawyers, and the European Centre for Constitutional and . Human Rights - a German human rights organisation. Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon and former armed forces minister Adam Ingram are among those named in the file. The . prosecutor's office will now study the dossier alongside submissions . from the British Government and other relevant bodies - a process that . could take several years before a final decision is taken on whether to . move to a full investigation. 'The preliminary examination is the first step in a process,' Mr Cayley said. 'The preliminary examinations can carry on for a very lengthy period. there have been preliminary examinations going on for years.' The IHAT, led by a former civilian police detective, is looking into 53 cases of alleged unlawful killing and a further 93 cases of alleged mistreatment. Today's announcement follows the news in March that a legal firm took £2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of Iraqi men - even though the investigation's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence. Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis who claimed the men were taken prisoner by British soldiers, and later mistreated and murdered. Despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week, the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry confirmed that it has spent more than £22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £2.5million over to Public Interest Lawyers run by the 'committed socialist' solicitor Phil Shiner. Probe: Despite the money that went to Public Interest Lawyers, allegations that soldiers had executed Iraqi captives were unfounded. The above photograph, shown during the inquiry, shows a soldier guarding prisoners . A spokesperson for the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry told MailOnline: 'The . £2.5 million has all gone to PIL [Public Interest Lawyers] but that’s . not just legal costs. It’s also the cost for witnesses: expenses for . witnesses to come over from Iraq and to hear some of them via video link . from overseas.' It is . understood that the money received by Public Interest Lawyers included . covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in . Britain, as the Al-Sweady Inquiry's chairman Sir Thayne Forbes wanted to . see them face-to-face. It . also included the building of - and transport to and from - a 'small . studio' close to Iraq from which an additional 40 family members of the . deceased gave evidence. As Public Interest Lawyers were the only . legal firm working with the Al-Sweady Inquiry, all the expenses of . gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said. Money: Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers, run by Phil Shiner (pictured), received £2.5 million in taxpayers money for representing the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis at the Al-Sweady Inquiry . Public . Interest Lawyers is currently acting for more than 100 clients who . claim their relatives were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed . by UK forces in Iraq. It has . secured more than £3million in payouts, most notably, representing the . family of Baha Mousa - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in . custody in Iraq. The subsequent inquiry cost £13million. Responding . to claims that Public Interest Lawyers earned, as opposed to received . £2.5million from the inquiry, Phil Shiner said: 'The amount of costs PIL . has received from the MoD [not Legal Aid!] for that issue is less than . £70,000.' In the same month the primary strand of the Al-Sweady Inquiry effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody. In a statement released as evidence drew to a close, Public Interest Lawyers accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004. They admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully. The extraordinary concession provoked outrage that British troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names 'dragged through the mud' by publicly-funded lawyers.","Examine allegations that British soldiers may have committed war crimes by abusing prisoners from 2003 to 2008 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . The BBC's director of news is understood to have reprimanded Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman over negative slurs he made about the corporation, before he announced his departure from the show. The presenter branded the corporation 'smug' and complained that the station Radio 1Xtra being played in the lifts was 'hell', during an interview last month. Sources told the Guardian, James Harding sent a note to Paxman condemning his public criticism of the BBC. Scroll down for video . Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman is understood to have received a note from bosses reprimanding over negative comments he made about the BBC, shortly before announcing his departure from the show . They claim Mr Harding said Paxman's comments were 'disloyal' and prompted the University Challenge presenter to reply, denying the accusation and pointing out his long service at the corporation. It comes after Ben Cooper, the controller of Radio 1Xtra addressed Paxman's dislike of his station's work, sending an email telling him to 'take the stairs' if he did not enjoy the lift entertainment. A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline the corporation does not comment on internal issues. Paxman decided to step down from the position he has held for 25 years, last summer. He informed the BBC's director general Tony Hall and Mr Harding at the time, but agreed to stay on to help the team after the appointment of a new editor following a difficult period for the show. The BBC confirmed Paxman will continue to present University Challenge following his last stint hosting Newsnight in June. Speaking earlier this week when Paxman's departure was announced, Mr Harding, 44, who previously edited The Times, said he had . become the 'great lion of BBC journalism' and would be sorely missed. James Harding, the BBC's director of news, is said to have cracked down after Paxman said in an interview that the corporation was 'smug'. Mr Harding reportedly claimed the comment was 'disloyal', a claim Paxman is said to have denied, pointing out his long service to the BBC in his reply . He said: 'Jeremy has led from the front: . fearless, aggressive and persistent. 'He never failed to ask the . difficult questions and always refused to accept glib or deceptive . answers. 'Of course we will miss him but he has set standards for our . journalism that the rest of us must follow. 'We . accept his decision to move on but I think it is fair to say that the . only people really celebrating his decision will be the politicians and . public figures he has so often and so brilliantly held to account.' It is said that rival broadcasters, including Channel 4 have privately expressed an interest in working with Paxman on future projects. It is not yet known who will replace him when he leaves Newsnight in June. Paxman decided to leave Newsnight last summer, but agreed to stay on to help the show through a period of transition as a new editor joined the team. He is set to leave the show after 25 years, in June . James Harding was the former editor of The Times newspaper before he became head of BBC News last year. Mr Harding, 44, was the youngest person to become editor of The Times when he was appointed in December 2007, aged 38. He had previously worked at the Financial Times. He worked at The Times for five years before resigning in December 2012. It was announced in April 2013 that Mr Harding would become head of BBC News and in August last year he officially started in the role. Since taking on the position, which was formerly held by Helen Boaden, Mr Harding has spoken of a desire to double BBC News’ worldwide audience which currently stands at around 250million.","Jeremy Paxman is set to leave Newsnight after 25 years in June .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Public support for staying in the European Union has surged, according to a new poll. More than half the public now say they would vote to stay in the union - while the proportion of voters certain to support Ukip at the next election has slumped to just four per cent. Support for leaving the EU, meanwhile, has fallen to just 37 per cent, the Ipsos Mori survey found. Just a year after David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on the EU, support for Brussels has surged. More than half the public now back staying in the union - compared to just 37 per cent who want to get out . It marks a dramatic shift in public support for Brussels since David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum last year. In November 2012, 44 per cent said they would vote to stay in the EU - with 48 per cent saying they would vote to get out. The growing support for Brussels comes despite polls predicting Nigel Farage is on course to win next week's European elections, ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives. But, according to today's poll, Ukip's may struggle to carry their momentum into next year’s general election. The survey found the proportion of voters certain to vote Ukip drops from nine per cent in next week's European elections to just four per cent at the general election. More than half the public think a vote for Ukip in May next year will be a wasted vote. In contrast, Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems are all likely to do better in the general election that in next week's european poll, Ipsos Mori's survey suggests. A chunk of voters who claim they are certain not to vote Conservative or Labour at the European elections would consider backing the two main parties in next year's Westminster contest. Some 57 per cent of voters said they would definitely not vote Tory next week - but only 46 per cent ruled out backing David Cameron in the general election. For Labour, just over half have ruled out backing the party next week - but this drops to 43 per cent for next year's Parliamentary election. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who insisted his controversial poster campaign against EU migration was not racist, has predicted that his party will win next week's European elections. But today's poll suggests he will struggle to turn seats in Brussels to victories in Westminster . There is also a strong indication that Mr Cameron's pledge to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU carries broad support. Just three in ten Brits are happy to see the country's relationship with Europe 'remaining broadly the same as at present’, which Nick Clegg suggested would be the case during his TV debates with Mr Farage. The same proportion want the relationship 'returning to being part of an economic community, without political links’. One in five would like to see ‘Britain leaving the European Union altogether’, . But moves towards ‘closer political and economic integration’ with the EU is the least favoured option - with just 13 per cent support. Voters are also the least likely to describe themselves as Ukip. Since David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on the EU, support for leaving has plummeted, according to today's poll . When asked ‘Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, UKP, or what?’ just 5 per cent said they thought of themselves as Ukip. This is despite the fact that the party is currently supported by up to 15 per cent of Brits according to polls. Just under a third of the public see themselves as Labour - while a quarter consider themselves ‘Conservative’. Just nine per cent say they are ‘Lib Dem’. Despite this, half of the public agree that the party is highlighting important issues which other parties aren’t taking seriously enough - including 52 per cent of Tory supporters and 44 per cent of Labour voters. Only a third disagree. Opinion is more evenly split as to whether Ukip is out of touch with the modern world -  43 per cent saying they are a party out of touch with the modern world and 40 per cent disagreeing. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'The rise of UKIP is one of the key political events over the last few years, even though many people still don’t see themselves casting a vote for UKIP, especially once the European elections are over. 'But the party is pushing some of the right buttons for the public - even among those who are planning on voting Labour or Conservative. 'Meanwhile, on the issues of the election, after several years of hostility to Europe after the crash, people seem more willing to stay in the EU – though a reduction in its powers is still more popular than further integration.'","Support for staying in EU has surged since Cameron promised referendum .

"By . James Chapman . Ukip is to up the stakes in its controversial anti-immigration campaign for the European elections as the Tories insist only they can give voters a say on Britain’s future in the EU. Ukip leader Nigel Farage will dismiss criticism by some Labour MPs that its key messages are ‘racist’ - unveiling another provocative poster focusing on migration from the EU. Featuring an escalator running up the White Cliffs of Dover, it claims the EU’s free movement rules means Britain has ‘no border’ and ‘no control’ over incomers. Scroll down for video . Upped the stakes: Ukip's latest poster for the election campaign has taken aim at the controversial change of legislation in January this year which opened Britain's borders to immigrants from Eastern Europe . ‘This is in my view the most powerful image of the entire European election campaign. It is designed to bring home to the British public just what membership of the EU means as regards controlling our own borders,’ the Ukip leader said. ‘The White Cliffs of Dover have always been seen as symbolic of Britain’s island status. That status should give us added ability to pick and choose the people who come to live and work in our country. But under EU free movement laws we have no serious control whatever. ‘No doubt the political establishment will react again in mock outrage and throw a new round of slurs and smears at UKIP and at me. 'We’ve been called every name under the sun in recent weeks. But we will not be silenced, and we know that millions of decent British people are on our side and are grateful that we are speaking out.’ Paul Sykes, a millionaire Yorkshire businessman is funding a £1.5 million publicity campaign for Ukip in the European elections, said: ‘This poster goes to the heart of the European debate. Nigel Farage claims the image is the most powerful yet in the European debate ahead of the May 22 vote . 'Over the past 20 years or more, politicians - Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat - have conspired to hide the truth about EU immigration from the British public. ‘They have taken down our borders and handed over control of who who enters the UK to the Eurocrats in Brussels.’ David Cameron will use his local election campaign launch, taking place today in the West Midlands, to make a direct attack on Ukip -- warning voters that backing the upstart party will reduce their chances of having a say in a referendum. The Conservatives will unveil their own poster, showing a referendum ballot-box marked ‘Europe: You Decide’ alongside the words: ‘An In-Out Referendum on Europe. Labour and the Lib Dems won’t. Ukip can’t. We will in 2017.’ Seeking to address scepticism over his pledge, Mr Cameron will say: ‘To those people who say you won’t deliver that renegotiation or referendum, I say: Judge me by my record as prime minister. ‘Others talk about acting in the national interest or standing up to Europe, I do it, time and again - often In the teeth of opposition in Brussels and with a backdrop of uncertainty about whether it can really happen at home. ‘People said I would never veto a European treaty. In 2011 that’s exactly what I did. People said my attempts to cut the European budget would fail. But I secured that cut. ‘People said I couldn’t get Britain out of the eurozone bailout scheme which Labour got us into, but I did just that. And now, we’re not liable to pay for any Eurozone country that needs a bail-out. ‘So I have a track record of delivery - and I believe me, whatever it takes, I will deliver this in-out referendum. Labour won’t. UKIP can’t. I will. David Cameron's approach to the issue is a 'You Decide' campaign. Ed Miliband's party has attacked Ukip's 'xenophobia' and 'lies' ‘I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum. Because the British people deserve their say. And I will make sure they get it.’ Labour’s former European Parliament leader said voters considering backing Ukip needed to be ‘educated’ about its ‘lies’ and ‘xenophobia’. Glyn Ford said Mr Farage was ‘not the worst’ person in Ukip and had some ‘nasty people trailing behind him’. ‘We haven’t educated people as to what they are all about - Ukip voters need to be educated,’ he added.","Image featuring escalator up White Cliffs of Dover unveiled today .

"By . Julian Robinson . Amanda Spencer arrives at Sheffield Crown Court ahead of being found guilty of 16 charges, She has been on trial accused of exploiting nine girls, some as young as 11 . A young woman who started ‘pimping out’ vulnerable underage girls for prostitution from the age of just 15 has been found guilty of 16 charges. Amanda Spencer, 23, is accused of exploiting nine girls - some as young as 11 and most in the care system - before forcing them into a life of alcohol, drugs and sex. Spencer made the girls have sex with men in flats around Sheffield, South Yorkshire, as well as in the city’s Castle Markets, and the toilets of nearby McDonald’s and KFC restaurants between 2006 and 2011. Following a six-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court - and almost 21 hours of jury deliberation - Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution. She was cleared of three counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution. And was also cleared of three counts of inciting child prostitution. Spencer, along with co-accused Kareem Ahmed, 30, was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation. Jurors are still deliberating on 15 more charges against her. Opening the case previously, Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, told the court Spencer would tell the girls to lie about their age and dress provocatively. She would then pocket the cash earned by the girls, seeing it as ‘far more productive and profitable to co-ordinate a pool of prostitutes, than to work for drug money all by herself’. Miss Colborne said: ‘Many of the victims in this case were in the care system or marked as “missing from home” at the relevant time, those still at home experiencing difficulties to varying degrees. ‘All were lacking in self-esteem and the wherewithal or sense to protect themselves from exploitation.’ She added: ‘Amanda Spencer was a fraud, say the prosecution. She hung around the town centre identifying and befriending vulnerable children. ‘She made them feel loved, she gave them a shoulder to cry on, a friend who purported to understand whatever sadness they were experiencing in their lives and in turn lured them into a life of abuse, which she exploited and profited from. ‘She referred to them as her sisters or cousins when asked to account for who they were by people in authority. ‘Although the children knew they were being sold for cash, their own drug and alcohol addiction sere so entrenched that they were incapable to extricate themselves. Amanda Spencer, from Sheffield, has been found guilty of 16 charges and cleared of seven others. Jurors at Sheffield Crown Court are continuing to deliberate on 15 further charges . ‘She told them how to dress more provocatively, to lie about their age and to close their minds to the reality of the sexual experiences, concentrating instead on the drugs. ‘Those who had the temerity to refuse to do as they were instructed felt her wrath. She was violent and they were frightened of her.’ One of Spencer’s alleged victims - who was just 14-years-old at the time - said she liked Spencer when they first met, and they would drink and take drugs together. But she said Spencer quickly became controlling and would threaten to hurt her if she did not do as she was told. She said that, at least twice, Spencer made her have sex with men in the KFC toilets in Sheffield. Another time they were in McDonald’s in Sheffield city centre when Spencer made her have sex with a man in the toilets. ‘I was sick of her getting angry if I didn’t do anything,’ the girl said. Asked how it made her feel she said: ‘Dirty, ashamed, sick.’ Describing Spencer’s attitude, she said: ‘One minute she was my friend, the next she was my worst enemy.’ The girl said if she refused to have sex with the men, Spencer would ‘kick off’. ‘She threatened to do me in loads of times,’ she added. Lee Unwin, 27, pictured left, has been cleared of paying for the sexual service of a child having pleaded not guilty. Another of Spencer's co-accused, Kareem Ahmed, 30, was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, which he denied. Spencer denies a string of charges, including arranging or facilitating a child sexual offence, inciting or causing a child to become a prostitute and arranging or facilitating the prostitution. She is on trial alongside four men who are charged with offences connected with the alleged abuse of the girls - who ranged from the ages of 11 and 20. Lee Unwin, 27, has been cleared of paying for the sexual service of a child having pleaded not guilty. Bashdar Hamadamin, 26, was cleared of a charge of rape having denied the offence. Kareem Ahmed, 30, was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, which he denied. John McLachlan, 65, who was accused of paying for the sexual services of a child, died midway through the trial. A fifth man, who cannot be named, denies three counts of sexual assault, one on a child under the age of 13. The deliberations continue.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Mohamed Dar is on trial at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court accused of stalking two of his neighbours . An Muslim man dressed up like a 'panto' Englishman to taunt his neighbours boasting of his 'joy' over 9/11 and the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby, a court has heard. Mohamed Dar wore costumes, including a red velvet dinner jacket with a pipe and slippers to taunt his alleged victim, leaving her feeling like she was trapped, 'living in a prison'. The 52-year-old of Alfreton in Derbyshire has denied stalking Louise Mountford and Daniel Renshaw at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court. A trial heard Dar also dressed up in an outfit that made him look naked and a red England hat as he tormented residents in his neighbourhood. Dar harassed Ms Mountford and allegedly spoke of his joy over the 9/11 attack and the murder of Lee Rigby during pretend phone calls. Giving evidence she told the court: 'He was pretending to be on the phone and was saying how happy he was about the murder of Lee Rigby and how funny he thought it was. 'He has his phone and has conversations to make you hear it. They are always terror-related like 9/11 was the proudest moment of his life and he said he cried with joy.' Ms Mountford said Dar wrote ‘Free Gaza’ on his house in red spray paint and later wrote ‘Free Palestine’. She said: 'He dresses up. He knows when you are going out and when you are coming back and tries to get a reaction. It’s like a show he puts on. 'He comes out and goes back to get his hat, pipe and slippers as you’re walking the dog. It’s not very pleasant. 'I put my head down and try to ignore it. I started to go to the police because my daughter is four and is very scared.' Dar is accused of reveling in the death of drummer Lee Rigby of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who was attacked and killed in broad daylight . by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, southeast London . Angela Hadfield, prosecuting, said there have been difficulties with Dar and neighbours going back a significant time. She . said: 'Louise Mountford says there has been harassment from Dar. He has . a better knowledge of her day-to-day routine than she does. 'Whenever she leaves the house and is due to return he knows and as soon as the family leaves, he’s there to harass her.' 'I don't like to go into the garden. I don't like to walk the dog. It's like being in prison' - Neighbour Louise Mountford . Ms Hadfield claimed he questioned and measured the height of a new fence Ms Mountford put up for her privacy and allegedly followed her and her family. Dar also allegedly stood on a wall and stared into her home. The mother-of-three, said: 'Sometimes he points his binoculars about. It’s a bit of pantomime.' But she added: 'I don’t like to go into the garden. I don’t walk the dog. It’s like being in prison.' Firefighter Daniel Renshaw also claims Dar phoned his work and made malicious complaints. Dar allegedly accused Mr Renshaw of using threatening behaviour against him, but no police action was taken. The . defendant reported his neighbour for leaving his car engine running . after the firefighter had gone to help push another driver’s car. The court heard Dar would pretend to be on the phone, telling of his 'joy' over the deaths of nearly 3,000 people when the Twin Towers in New York collapsed on September 11, 2001 . Mr Renshaw also claims Dar falsely complained to the fire service that he had made racist, monkey chants. He said: 'He follows me to work. He uses his background and religion to say I have made racial comments. It was a very stressful time.' Defending his client Denny Lau, argued Ms Mountford disliked Dar and implied he used his binoculars for star-gazing and that waving and saying hello was normal. Mr Lau argued Dar’s praying was part of his religion. Dar, who has yet to give evidence, denies stalking Ms Mountford between September 22, and November 13, 2013. He also denies stalking Mr Renshaw between June 3, 2013, and October 31, 2013. The trial was adjourned until May 12.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . On first glance, you might be forgiven for thinking you'd stumbled across an impressive piece of wildlife art. The fine detail - right down to the elephant's trunk and eyes - shows the perfect outline of the gigantic beast. But this is not the work of an artist. Nor is it likely to remain in the spot where it was found for too much longer. Animal art: This incredibly detailed imprint of the elephants was left in the sand when the beast arose from its slumber . This incredible image shows the imprint of Sundara, an eight-year-old Asian elephant, where it fell asleep in the sand at Chester Zoo. Staff at the zoo were amazed when they ventured into the elephants' enclosure and found the perfectly-preserved impression of the animal's head in the ground. The indentation is so clear, it even shows the fine detail of the ridges on the animal's trunk, as well as its ear and eyes. The enclosure's two elephants had fallen asleep on the ground, side-by-side, and - judging by the imprint - Sundara did not appear to move too much during its jumbo slumber. And, in another stroke of luck, it didn't seem to disturb the impressive artwork when it arose from its snooze. Jumbo slumber: Two elephants sleep side-by-side on the sand in their enclosure at Chester Zoo . Elephants lie down on their sides to sleep for around four hours a night and usually turn over at least once. Even elephants that live in a zoo have a natural instinct to be aware of predators, which causes them to wake during their sleep as often as every half hour. They tend to have something to eat and then go back to sleep. Due to their weight, elephants are forced to switch sides during their sleep. The mass of their bodies is so much that it puts pressure on their bones, causing pain and discomfort. The animals are also very light sleepers. If there were a sudden loud noise - either in the wild or in a zoo - an elephant would quickly be on its feet. In their natural habitat, a herd of elephants would not sleep at the same time. There would always be at least one keeping watch. Staff at Chester Zoo (pictured) were amazed when they ventured into the elephants' enclosure and found the perfectly-preserved impression of the animal's head in the ground .",Staff at Chester Zoo were astonished to find a detailed impression of the beast's head where it fell asleep in the sand .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A property tycoon at the centre of one of Britain’s biggest divorce cases yesterday claimed his estranged wife hired eight private detectives to track his movements. Scot Young, who was once estimated to be worth more than £400million, accused wife Michelle of installing ‘covert surveillance’ and breaching his privacy. He told the High Court in London that since 2009 up to eight investigators watched him throughout the day on ‘shifts’ and this had ‘perpetuated’ his health problems. Jailed: Scot Young has been held in contempt of court for failing to reveal details of his finances . Mr Young, who made a fortune as a fixer . for British businessmen and Russian oligarchs, has been accused by . Michelle Young, 48, of hiding ‘enormous assets’ to get out of paying the . £30,000 a month she had been awarded. The pair have been embroiled in a bitter . divorce battle since 2006. Mr Young, 51, told the court: ‘There’s been a . long history (of covert surveillance) since 2009 until today. ‘I believe covert surveillance continues on me and it is highly illegal. This is perpetuating my health problems.’ At a previous High Court hearing, Mr Young was ordered to make a full . financial disclosure or serve the  six-month suspended sentence he was . originally handed back in 2009 for contempt. Michelle Young at the High court for an earlier hearing. Her legal team claims her estranged husband lives a lifestyle of 'considerable wealth' but owes £1million in child maintenance . Mr Young, who represented himself in court yesterday, said the reason he . failed to produce documents detailing his assets was because of ill . health and that he feared people calling him on his mobile phone may . have been private detectives hired by his estranged wife. He said: ‘When you have up to eight individuals on three shifts it is . very difficult to know who is process server and who is a detective . hired by my wife.’ Presenting a medical report, Mr Young revealed he had been sectioned . under the Mental Health Act on December 11, 2012. He said his failure to . comply with court orders to pay his wife was because of this. Family: Michelle and her daughters Scarlet (right) and Sasha, in a photo taken in 2010 . Mr Young, who claims he is penniless after a large Moscow real estate . deal collapsed, said: ‘In the condition I am in, paranoia can manifest . in many ways, especially when you have eight people following you.

It was not a nice experience.’ But Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Mrs Young, said he was ‘sceptical’ about the ‘excuse’. He said: ‘There is a very deja vu element to it, with reference to a similar medical excuse (presented by Mr Young previously). ‘It is a coincidence that at the threat of a committal the same medical . excuse is presented in the same terms, by the same hospital. ‘I deal with this with a great deal of scepticism.’ Mrs Young was previously awarded £30,000 a month to pay for rent and school fees for their two children. The court was told that she is owed £1million in unpaid maintenance. Mr . Fitzgerald said: ‘He has never paid a penny.

"By . Martin Robinson . Many of these vehicles helped seal World War Two victory for Britain, including on the beaches of Normandy, but today they rest in a 'vehicle graveyard' on a former RAF base left untouched since 1963. The closed military site at RAF Folkingham in Lincolnshire is home to an ageing collection of decommissioned military vehicles, farming machinery and lorries dating from the 1940s, which aided the war effort here and in occupied Europe. The hulking machines are parked in line, falling apart and forgotten, at the edge of the 6,000ft-long runway, some swallowed up by bushes and trees. Rusting legend: This DUKW Amphibious vehicle, which was used during the D-Day landings, produced between 1942 and 1945, and used by the British Army up into the 1970s, sits at the closed military site at RAF Folkingham in Lincolnshire . Left to rot: This military-used Caterpillar tractor stands on the spot where it was dumped at a former RAF base left untouched for at least 50 years . Frozen: These ageing vehicles, some of which helped with the war effort, lay still lined up along the Lincolnshire runway . Kept for scrap: This wartime fuel pump engine has been stored at the former RAF site so that spare parts can be sold off . Urban explorer Steve Vernon, 36, photographed the strange collection of derelict automobiles. He said: 'It is quite eerie - the vehicles were stretched along the runway for as far as I could see. I couldn't even see the end of the line. 'Seeing all those old trucks and tractors lined up next to each other in the middle of the countryside is bizarre. 'It is in the middle of nowhere and it was very cold. I wasn't sure I was supposed to be there so I was very careful not to disturb the vehicles.' Forgotten: This disused crane stands among hundreds of other abandoned machines used by the forces up until 1963 . Taken by nature: This bulldozer has been swallowed up by a bush while plants have grown in its tracks over the decades it has lay there untouched . Lost in the undergrowth: This military truck, a Thornycroft 'Antar' Mk 2, lies among the collection of decommissioned military vehicles, farming machinery and lorries . Mothballed: This truck, fitted with caterpillar tracks, stands rusting next to a pile of other equipment at RAF Folkingham . Destroyed: This pan scraper, a piece of agricultural machinery often used for the removal of earth, sand or in mines, lies decaying in the woods around the abandoned RAF Folkingham . Out of service: A disused caterpillar tractor previously used in agricultural work, stands alone surrounded by abandoned parts . On empty: These fuel gauges from a military vehicle are well preserved despite being left untouched for at least 50 years in rural Lincolnshire . RAF Folkingham, 30 miles south of Lincoln, had a 23-year life at the heart of the Second World War effort and later the Cold War. When it opened in 1940, it was used as a dummy airfield, with fake planes and personnel, set up to draw the Luftwaffe away from RAF Spitalgate, just a mile away. Later it was brought into use by the RAF and the U.S. Air Force, primarily as a home for airborne units. Soldiers were dropped into Italy in 1944 and later on D-Day by parachute. After the war, it was a ballistic missile base, with weapons fuelled and ready to fire during the Cuban Missile Crisis in November 1962. But within a year it was closed and is now in private hands. The runway is home to several . decommissioned World War II vehicles including a DUKW amphibious truck - . the model which was used during the D-Day landings - as well as mobile . pump engines and various military trucks. Other pieces of agricultural machinery which litter the landscape include tractors, bulldozers, JCBs and earth-movers. Bizarrely, Mr Vernon, from Doncaster, spotted the severed heads of two deers rotting inside an abandoned crane. 'I saw the antlers poking out of the crane and when I went for a closer look I saw two deer heads in there. One was on the drivers seat and the other was at the back of the cab,' he said. 'They can't have been there long, they were still quite intact. 'I have no idea why they were there, or how they got there.' RAF Folkingham opened in 1940. During World War II it was used as an airfield for airborne units in the RAF and the United States Army Air Force. The airfield was eventually sold off in August 1963 for agricultural use. Today the remains of the airfield are located on private property. The main runway is used as hardstanding for hundreds of scrap vehicles. The vehicles are all owned by Nelson M Green and Sons Ltd who store the decommissioned vehicles for sale of the spare parts. Dramatic: Set in the flat Lincolnshire countryside, perfect for airfields, RAF Folkingham has hundreds of vehicles, lined up next to eachother, along its long runway . History: RAF Folkingham pictured left in May 1944, with the ends of runways numbered in this aerial from the time, and right, the mothballed airfield today . Strategic: Known as bomber country, Lincolnshire was covered in RAF bases, and Folkingham for much of the war was used as a decoy for a base a mile away towards Grantham .","RAF Folkingham in Lincolnshire was used in Second World War and the Cold War before being shut down in 1963 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Harrison Ford is said to be on the verge of announcing some 'good news' after being injured during filming of Star Wars 7 . Harrison Ford is supposedly on the verge of announcing some ‘good news’ after being crushed under the weight of the Millennium Falcon during filming of the latest Star Wars movie. The 71-year-old actor had to be airlifted to the trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after apparently breaking his ankle on the set of Star Wars 7. A source said he clutched his chest in pain as crew members rushed to free him from underneath the prop's hydraulic door after the accident at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire on Thursday. However, while his injuries were rumoured to be worse than initially thought, a publicist for the film has now revealed he could be on the mend. In a statement to Sky News, the spokesman said the Indiana Jones star was ‘hoping to announce some good news soon.’ A spokesman for John Radcliffe Hospital was unable to confirm whether the actor had been discharged from hospital today. It is thought that as well as fracturing his ankle, he may also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis – although he is said to be awaiting results of further tests to confirm the extent of any damage. The latest news comes after his wife Calista Flockhart, best known for her starring role in sitcom Ally McBeal, confirmed she had flown from the US to be at her husband’s bedside. Reprising his buccaneering role from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred. 'Harris was hit by the door and looked in a bad way and was clutching his chest when he was on the stretcher,' a source told The Mirror. By his side: Calista Flockhart, pictured with the star in 2008, flew to Oxford to comfort her husband . The insider added that he was in 'a lot of pain' and his foot appeared 'damaged'. A Lucasfilm spokesman confirmed shooting on the film, which is due to be released in December next year, had resumed following the accident. Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May. The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi. MailOnline has contacted Harrison Ford’s agent for comment.

It's described as a 'Super depressing tee from Depression topped with an allover logo graphic.' The . t-shirt has been reduced from $59 to $9.99, but so far has just one . scathing review: 'Depression is not a fashion statement, UO should not . be promoting social stigma for depression by making it a catchphrase,' wrote the review, giving the item one star. Depressing: Many are offended by this t-shirt being sold by Urban Outfitters . In . fairness to Urban Outfitters, the brand that produces the t-shirt is . Depression, whose philosophy is 'Because living life the conventional . way is depressing.' 'Absolutely disgusting what urban outfitters are selling. Disgraceful. I don't know how that is allowed,' one Twitter user tweeted. 'This is vile, does Urban Outfitters not know how offensive and triggering these tops are?' tweeted another. The offensive t-shirt comes two years after the company pulled a controversial t-shirt . from its website after angry critics condemned it online. The offending item was a gray, V-necked t-shirt with the words, 'Eat Less' written in cursive across the front. The cotton t-shirt was photographed on a very slim, angsty-looking model and paired with a black mini-skirt. Offensive: This t-shirt was pulled from the Urban Outfitters website in 2011 after critics lambasted the retailer for glamorizing eating disorders . Write caption here . The description read, 'Eat less or more or however much you'd like in this seriously soft knit tee cut long and topped with a v-neck.' The Twitterverse exploded in disgust at the perceived glamorization of eating disorders by the clothing giant. Actress Sophia Bush wrote an open letter to Urban Outfitters on her blog addressing the t-shirt. 'You should issue a public apology, and make a hefty donation to a women’s organization that supports those stricken with eating disorders. I am sickened that anyone, on any board, in your gigantic company would have voted ""yes"" on such a thing, let alone enough of you to manufacture an item with such a hurtful message. Not fabulous: A 'Ghettopoly' board game is held by a demonstrator during a protest outside an Urban Outfitters store in Philadelphia. Many in the black community were outraged over the game, sold by the retail chain Urban Outfitters, that has 'playas' acting as pimps and game cards reading 'You got yo whole neighborhood addicted to crack. Collect $50...' 'It’s like handing a suicidal person a loaded gun. You should know better,' she wrote, adding that she intends to boycott the store. The hipster chain has managed to put many different groups offside with its products over the years, including Jewish people (a t-shirt emblazoned with 'Everyone Loves a Jewish Girl' and dollar signs), Irish people (St Patrick's Day shirts that read 'Kiss me I'm drunk, or Irish, or whatever') and African Americans (a board-game iteration of Monopoly called Ghettopoly). In 2012, the Navajo Nation filed suit against the company for creating a line of merchandise including underwear and a drinking flask and called it Navajo.","Urban Outfitters is under fire for selling t-shirts emblazoned with the word 'depression'

"By . Damien Gayle . Facebook is the worst social networking site for internet trolling, and bullying is now more prevalent online than anywhere else, a study has suggested. Some 87 per cent of teenagers who reported cyber abuse said they were targeted on Mark Zuckerberg’s site, while around one-fifth of youngsters were picked on by Twitter trolls, the report showed. Those most frequently victimised were 19-year-old boys. Bullying: Facebook is the worst social networking site for internet trolling, and bullying is now more prevalent online than anywhere else, a study has suggested . According to the report, 49 per cent of those targeted by bullies were victimised off-line, while 65 per cent of teenagers were subjected to abuse in cyberspace. Only 37 per cent of those who had experienced trolling ever reported it to the social network where it took place, the report found. Emma-Jane Cross, CEO and founder of the charity BeatBullying, said many young people were suffering in silence. 'Bullying both on and off-line continues to be a serious problem for a huge number of teenagers and we cannot ignore its often devastating and tragic effects,' she said. 'We work with hundreds of young people being cyber-bullied or trolled so badly that it can lead to depression, truancy, self-harm, or even force them to contemplate or attempt suicide.' Media psychologist Arthur Cassidy said online bullying could have a 'massive impact' on older male teenagers. 'Suicide rates are particularly high amongst this demographic, so it’s worrying to hear that teenagers on the whole are choosing to deal with internet abuse themselves rather than speaking to parents or teachers for help,' he said. Who is affected? The survey says 19 year old boys are the worst hit . 'Whilst some might expect girls to be more vulnerable online, this study shows that older boys are more at risk from trolling and cyber-bullying. 'Many boys feel under pressure to demonstrate their bravado, particularly on the web, but this attitude and male deficiency in coping strategies can make them more vulnerable and open to trolling.' The study, for internet site knowthenet.org.uk, found a number of social networking sites had become 'popular forums' for trolls. Some 13 per cent of the 13 to 19-year-olds consulted claimed they were targeted on BlackBerry Messenger, 8 per cent said they were picked on by trolls on Bebo and 4 per cent said they were victimised on Whatsapp. Researchers also looking at where most trolling was done - with Facebook the most dangerous place to visit online . Fewer than one in five (17 per cent) teens said their first reaction would be to tell a parent and only 1 per cent of those surveyed said their initial response would be to inform a teacher. Around 34 per cent of those who were picked on by trolls said their experiences lasted more than a month. Knowthenet, which released the study, has now launched a 'trolling hub' offering advice on how to deal with online bullying. This can be found at www.knowthenet.org.uk/trolling. Opinium Research consulted more than 2,000 teenagers for the study.","Leading social network used to target teenagers in 87 per cent of reported cases of cyber-bullying .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Mention of sin is to be restored to the Church of England’s baptism service after an experiment dropping the use of the word was abandoned. The Church announced in January that it was trying out new wording that asked parents and godparents to make a single, broad pledge to ‘reject evil’. Among other phrases abandoned in the experimental christening rite were those referring to ‘the deceit and corruption of evil’, ‘the sins that separate us from God and neighbour’, and a promise to ‘fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ against sin, the world and the devil’. Change: The word 'sin' is set to be reinstated during a baptism service after an experiment to abandon it failed . Proposals set to be agreed by the Church of England’s General Synod, meeting in York next month, restore use of the word sin – although they will still go ahead with axing the other phrases. In the new version, parents and godparents would only be required to say that they ‘turn away from sin’ and ‘reject evil’. Changes are being made to adapt to a population that increasingly has no Christian background, the church said. Officials had wanted to avoid putting off people who may be offended by being addressed as sinners. The traditional baptism rite – in use from 1662 to the 1960s – asks parents and godparents: ‘Dost thou, in the name of this Child, renounce the Devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them?’ The Synod will also look at approving a ‘shorter, clearer liturgy’ for all services.","Word is to be restored after attempt to get godparents to 'reject evil'

On Wednesday, 14-year-old Noel . Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab Timothy . Crump, also 14, in the chest three times after school in the Bronx, New York. The two teenagers had been close friends spending their spare time together skateboarding, sharing dirty jokes on Facebook and playing computer games. Scroll down for video . Noel Estevez, 14, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over the death of his former friend, Timothy Crump . Friends and neighbours say that Timothy accused Estevez of stealing his smartphone and that started a campaign of harassment and bullying that resulted in Estevez trying to kill himself. Estevez's hair was hacked, his sexuality questioned and he was teased over his mother's arrest for drug dealing. Estevez, who friends said suffered . from a speech impediment and Tourette’s syndrome, was terrified of Timothy and a group of his friends who took to urinating up the front door of the Estevez home, chasing him down the . street and leaving him too scared to leave his home. Around 3pm on Wednesday, as Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue was being let out the argument between Estevez and Timothy Crump spilled over into bloodshed. Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue in the Bronx: One 14-year-old pupil allegedly stabbed another 14-year-old pupil to death there on Wednesday . Witnesses said that they saw Timothy confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose. Teachers and teaching assistants rushed to the scene to break up the brawl but before they could intervene, Estevez produced a 12-inch kitchen knife and plunged it into his former friend three times. Timothy was rushed to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Estevez has been charged as an adult with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Noel Estevez tried to hang himself in his own apartment on May 28. His father found him in the closet with a rope . Chailyn Oballe, 12, said that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school. 'And . that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like . he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his . pocket and covered it with his shirt.' Differing accounts have been given about the boys' relationship.One has it that Estevez had long been bullied by Timothy Crump. Another that they were all part of the same gang but had fallen out. 'He . used to be part of their group, but I think they threw him out and they . started teasing him,' Jorge Guerrero, 47, the porter at the Estevez building on East Clarke Place in High Bridge, said. Dispute: Noel Estevez, left, allegedly stabbed Timothy Crump, right, repeatedly in the chest, killing him, as they left school on Wednesday . He said that on at least four occasions in the last month he had to mop up urine from outside the apartment. He added that he did not recognise Crump as one of the bullies - but others did. 'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbour Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '[He . would say] things like, ""Ha ha, your mum's a crackhead, you're . stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mum’s locked up.' Another family friend Marisol Perez said it was worse than that. ‘They would move their bowels in front of the door, try and set the door on fire,’ she said. ‘Every time the cops would come, the kids would leave, saying there was nothing they could do about it.' Mrs Estevez and Miss Perez were arrested on June 11 for allegedly selling drugs to an undercover policeman. Both declare their innocence. Charged: Estevez can be seen centre being taken in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second-degree murder and charged as an adult, police said . Miss Arroyo said that Timothy 'found it funny'. She said that he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him.

'His . father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.' Estevez . was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this . week, even though he told his father he did not want to go because of the . bullies. Arrest: A security guard reportedly stopped the fight outside the school, IS 177, and the boy was arrested . 'His father brought him to school this morning and said, ""Don’t worry, just go straight home after school"",' Miss Perez added. But Timothy Crump's neighbours at a homeless shelter said that he was a quiet child and that Estevez was the bully. 'He . wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 'He'd say, ""I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you."" I’ve seen him say it.' A policeman said that Estevez had borrowed Timothy’s mobile, but was unable to return it. Timothy is believed to have asked for the phone’s return or financial compensation. Crime scene: Authorities gather outside the school where the teenager was stabbed after class . Yesterday, Estevez appeared at a Bronx courthouse. His father, Felix, was not present at the court because, said defence lawyer Eric Poulos, he had been threatened by Timothy’s family, although his aunts and cousins did attend. The hearing lasted around 10 minutes and Mr Poulos described months of harassment and intimidation suffered by his client. The family had repeatedly sought help from the authorities, to little avail, he said. Judge Laurence Busching ordered Estevez to be held without bail and scheduled the next hearing for Tuesday.

"By . Hugo Gye . The smallest library in the world has appeared on the streets of New York City - and it has space for just one reader at a time. The bright yellow plastic structure houses 40 books and aims to help city-dwellers take a break from the pace of life in the metropolis by chilling out with a good story. The Little Free Library was designed by a pair of innovative architects using recycled materials to protect the books inside from the elements. Intriguing: A visitor peers in through the side of the world's smallest library, located in Manhattan . Ducking in: The structure, made from an old water tank, has enough space to fit one reader . Collection: A reader browses through the 40 books held by the Little Free Library in Nolita . It was constructed from a plastic water tank and a wooden frame, with holes in the exterior allowing visitors to look in before they enter the structure. Venezuelan architects Marcelo Ertorteguy and Sara Valente said the library creates an 'inhabitable' environment which immerses its users in the experience of browsing and reading books. The library in Manhattan's Nolita neighbourhood has attracted a great deal of interest since it was installed last month. 'The Little Free Library idea was originated about three years ago and rapidly started spreading throughout the country and also popping up in some areas of Europe, Africa and India,' Mr Ertorteguy said. 'It remains a mystery how New York City was one of the very few cities in the country with no libraries.' Bizarre: The library looks strikingly different from traditional buildings used to house books . Project: The structure is one of 5,000 Free Lending Libraries around the U.S. and the world . Design: The architects have spoken of their desire to give New Yorkers a chance to withdraw from the city . The Manhattan library had its origins in a project set up by the Architectural League of New York in association with Pen World Voices Festival, and will remain in place until September. Mr Ertorteguy added: 'We have a big interest to work recycling materials, but what we find much more interesting is to give materials, or objects, new functions. 'For the Little Free Library we wanted to find the perfect object to re-purpose, one that could not only shelter the books from the weather but also one that a person could inhabit - the water tank suited perfectly, the rest was just resolving how to hold it up. 'With the library we wanted to create a place where to slow down, a pocket in New York City's streets where to have the moment to partially isolate from the surroundings and get immersed into another world  - the world of the book you pick.' Surprise: The funky-looking structure has prompted a great deal of attention from New Yorkers . Tight squeeze: Two people can just about fit in to the structure but cannot move around inside . Neighbourhood: The library is located outside a school in the trendy Nolita district of Manhattan . There are currently more than 5,000 Little Free Libraries across the U.S. and internationally, but most are nothing more than outdoor bookshelves which cannot accommodate readers inside. The project is intended to give everyone access to reading material even if they live in areas which are not served by public libraries.","Little Free Library in Nolita neighbourhood lends collection of books out .

"By . Kirk Maltais . Studies nationwide about 'sea star wasting syndrome', or the rash of deaths of millions of starfish, have come up with a new explanation this week. Scientists have been observing the shores of Washington, Oregon, and California in an attempt to figure out why millions of sea stars have been dying since June 2013. Their conclusion is that sea stars are being infected with a disease that can more easily grow in the Pacific Ocean thanks to warming waters providing a better place to multiply. A purple ochre sea star dying from sea star wasting syndrome, as evidenced by its mangled body and disintegrating right leg . A sea star in a mangled form underwater. Scientists are trying to determine if the pathogen is traveling freely in the warm waters or if its coming from the mussels and shellfish that sea stars eat . A sunflower star exhibiting signs that its about to lose two of its arms . An arm from a sick sea star detached from the body. This is known as a ray, 'walking away' from the body . According to scientists, the warmer waters not only allow the bacterial/viral infection a more prime place to develop, but also compromise the immune system of the sea stars, allowing them to be more susceptible to the pathogen causing sea star wasting syndrome. According to research from the University of California Santa Cruz, the disease leaves lesions on the body of sea stars, also causing deformities such as arms disappearing. The end result are carcasses washing to shore in a dried-up, gnarled state. According to a team monitoring the San Juan Islands, off of the coast of Washington, over 40 percent of starfish are now exhibiting symptoms of having sea star wasting syndrome. That number is expected to rise as the summer progresses. 'It’s the largest mortality event for marine diseases we’ve seen,'  Drew Harvell, a marine epidemiologist at Cornell University, told PBS. 'It affects over 20 species on our coast and it’s been . causing catastrophic mortality.' Harvell leads a loose organization of scientists who are struggling to figure out the cause of the mass die-offs. According to her, the warmer Pacific Ocean waters of recent years have facilitated a prime environment for the pathogen to develop. This would not be the first mass die-off experienced by the sea star population. According to scientists, the sea star population experienced hits during the warmer climate related to El Nino years, particularly 1982-83 and 1997-98. However, these dips in population were never as severe as the current outbreak. Students of Oregon State University assist in monitoring the intertidal zone by the Oregon coast from sea stars damaged by the disease's outbreak . A diver takes notes on a sea star. The disease is expected to worsen as the summer progresses . 'My expectation is that within the next month all of the stars will die.' said Harvell . While some scientists believe that the warmer water is weakening the sensitive skins of sea stars, others believe that the pathogen is traveling to them through the food that they eat becoming infected. In a test at the University of California Santa Barbara, two groups of sea stars were fed differently, the first receiving mussels from the same area of the ocean, while the other group was given frozen squid. The group given the frozen squid to eat did not develop the disease, while the animals given the mussels they would  normally eat did come down with the sickness. However, the sample size of the study was to small to derive any hard conclusions from. Sea stars are known as an 'apex predator' in the intertidal zone, surviving on mussels and other shellfish. 'Losing a predator like that is bound to have some pretty serious . ecological consequences and we really don’t know exactly how the system . is going to look,' says Harvell 'but we’re quite certain that it’s going to have an . impact.' Currently, scientists hope that young sea stars develop a resistance to the disease, allowing them to live full lives and for the population to recover from their losses.","Scientists believe that disease, 'sea star wasting syndrome', linked to warmer than usual waters in the Pacific Ocean .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A casino mogul once in favor of internet gaming has had a change of heart on grounds the sites can easily funnel money to terrorists. Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands, is backing a ferocious onslaught against online poker initiatives even as more states legalize the activity only a few years after the FBI shutdown sites across the nation. Adelson, 80, has taken a stance different than most of the gambling industry, which sees online poker as yet another source of revenue in the face of growing regional competition taking tourists away from both Las Vegas and Atlantic City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Internet jihad: Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp., speaks at a 2012 news conference - he has become a ferociously opposed to online gamlbing in recent years after initially supporting it a decade ago . The tycoon’s opposition has been so fierce that a Politico article earlier this year called it his ‘internet jihad.’ The latest salvo in this ongoing war against online poker is a commercial showing two people shaking hands in a dark alley. This cuts quickly to a mother and young child in a poorly-lit bedroom distraught as police sirens blare in the background. ‘An established al-Qaeda poker network could extract enough untraceable money from the United States in just a few days to fund several 9/11-sized attacks,’ an intimidating voice says. ‘Say no to internet gambling.’ It is a strong departure from a 2001 Washington Post interview in which he said online poker was ‘a promising opportunity,’ according to The Verge. Two years later, Las Vegas Sands spent more than $1million to explore the idea of running an offshore gaming operation in the U.K.. according to the New York Times. Also in opposition: Steve Wynn, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd., speaks during a 2011 interview in Macau, China - he has also taken up Adelson's cause . Owned by Adelson: The Sands Expo and Convention Center and Palazzo, in Las Vegas, will take massive hits from online gaming, according to Adelson . He was expected as recently as 2011 to support a bill to legalize online card tables but shockingly came out against a Justice Department ruling granting states the right to allow the operations at their own discretion. ‘It’s a threat to our society,’ Adleson wrote in a Las Vegas Sun editorial, ‘a toxin which all good people ought to resist.’ Online gaming technology is not advanced enough to keep underage players away and prevent money laundering, he argued. Addiction will be harder to curb, land-based casinos will take further hits to business and Facebook will ‘squash’ the whole industry, the titan insisted. He further told Forbes in 2013 that he is ‘willing to spend whatever it takes’ to stop his biggest enemy from proliferating across the country. The baccarat baron has so far spent millions and also amassed an army of lawyers and lobbyists to defeat online poker measures from being passed. Gambling empire: The Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas, are the heart and soul of Steve Wynn's business . Fellow casino billionaire Steve Wynn has also taken Adelson’s side while Boyd Gaming, Caesars Entertainment and MGM have backed poker bills. Critics have claimed both men are out of touch, and that they are against the technology only because they don’t understand it. ‘Sheldon’s old, and Steve is virtually blind,’ a Las Vegas industry insider told The Verge. ‘I’ll guarantee you neither of them have ever been on the internet. I don’t think they understand the world that is there at all.’ Both men have been vocal about their disdain for texting and email, and Wynn ridiculed an online gaming demonstration he recently saw. ‘I’m sure it was impressive if you were a cyber guy,’ Wynn told Politico. ‘But it was bulls**t.’ Almost two-thirds of the country, 63 per cent, opposes online gambling, according to a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll. But 65 per cent say they don’t even follow the issue. Nearly 10 states considered legalizing online gambling last year as Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey went all-in. California and Pennsylvania are reportedly on the verge of making it legal. Adelson appears to be fighting an uphill battle.","Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands, is opposed to online poker .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Brooklyn man is headed to prison after it was revealed in a college application essay that he raped his eight-year-old stepdaughter more than a decade ago. Albert Tarrats, 62, raped the child in 2003 while she slept in her bed, but the horrifying assault only came to light when the victim, now 19, wrote about the attack in 2012. Her mother saw the essay and immediately called police. Following his Thursday conviction, Tarrats faces up to 25 years in prison. Where he was convicted: Albert Tarrats was found guilty Thursday of multiple charges including rape and sexual assault at Brooklyn Criminal Court . ‘Toward the end of their marriage he began to rape me,’ the teen wrote in the essay. ‘I never told anyone till later in life but at that point in my life I was scared.’ She then took the stand last week to testify about the suffering she has endured because of his callous acts. ‘She was very credible,’ one of the jurors told the New York Daily News. ‘The fact that so many years passed made us think she doesn’t have an ulterior motive.’ The victim’s mother divorced the convicted rapist in 2005 and moved to Florida, her daughter went with her. Jurors shot down defense attempts to frame the claims as an attempt to defame Tarrats after her mother’s marriage failed, or to gain sympathy from college admissions counselors. It’s her best effort to try to get the attention of the admissions committee of that college to convince them she was the best candidate for that school,’ Tarrats’ lawyer Earnest Hammer argued during his closing argument, according to the New York Post. Hammer went out of his way to point out her poor grammar and make sure the whole courtroom knew she was not accepted to the school. ‘I’m sure it weighed heavily on her,’ another juror said, ‘and really affected her life.’ The jury found Tarrats guilty of multiple charges including rape and sexual assault. He showed no emotion as the verdicts were read aloud in court. His sentencing is June 30.","Albert Tarrats was found guilty of raping the young girl in 2003 .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The mother of a 14-year-old boy from The Bronx who is accused of stabbing to death a  classmate has said that her son was acting in self-defense after suffering from months of merciless bullying that left him suicidal. Noel Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab his former best friend, Timothy Crump, in the chest three times after school Wednesday. Timothy was rushed to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Estevez has been charged as an adult with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Dispute: Noel Estevez, left, allegedly stabbed Timothy Crump, right, repeatedly in the chest, killing him, as they left school on Wednesday . According to local reports, the two classmates had a falling out over a smartphone, which Estevez had borrowed from Crump but was unable to return. On Saturday, Estevez's mother, Maria Estevez, 52, broke her silence for the first time since her son's arrest, telling the New York Daily News from behind bars that her child was afraid for his life. 'He was protecting himself. I saw him on the news. I saw his face,' said Mrs Estevez from her jail cell in Rikers Island, where she has been held since June 11 after she allegedly tried to sell crack cocaine to an undercover officer. The mother blamed the victim, Timothy Crump, also 14 years old, for pushing her special-needs son over the edge. Unable to take the relentless bullying anymore, in May Noel tried to take his own life, according to his mother. While recovering from the suicide attempt in the hospital, the 14-year-old was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. A week after Noel was released home he allegedly came to school armed with a knife for protection . When Crump jumped his former friend after classes let out, Estevez pulled out the knife and plunged it repeatedly into the other boy's chest, police said. When questioned by investigators, Noel Estevez said he was retaliating against his tormentor, who attacked him without provocation. Noel Estevez, 14, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over the death of his former friend, Timothy Crump . According to Noel's 52-year-old . mother, her son could not take the abuse, which ranged from homophobic . name-calling to mean jokes about his speech impediment to urinating on . the Estevez family’s front door. ‘[Noel] was saying, “They’ll kill me!”’ Maria Estevez recalled to the Daily News. A . teacher at Intermediate School 117, which both teens had attended, . described Crump as 'a predator, a monster' and 'a bomb waiting to . explode.' On her part, Maria Estevez had . some harsh words for officials at her son's school, saying that they did . nothing to protect Noel from the abuse or help him transfer out. Mrs Estevez recalled that her son was so scared of his nemesis that he took to opening the door armed with a knife. Noel’s . mother also said that case workers from the Administration for . Children's Services ignored her concerns for her son's safety, which had led . her to keep him home for a while, and ordered her to send him back to . school. During the . jailhouse interview, Mrs Estevez also shed light on the fate of the . iPhone that started a war between the two former friends, revealing that . she shattered the device after learning that Crump had allegedly stolen . it from someone during a violent mugging, and then let Estevez borrow . it. After Noel was unable . to return the phone to Crump, the boy turned on his friend and . classmate, launching a bullying campaign against him with other teens. Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue in the Bronx: One 14-year-old pupil allegedly stabbed another 14-year-old pupil to death there on Wednesday . Mrs . Estevez recalled that before their feud, the two 14-year-olds would . often play basketball together and even have sleepovers. She added that . she feels sorry for Crump's family. Friends . and neighbors said that Timothy accused Estevez of stealing his . smartphone and that started a campaign of harassment and bullying that . resulted in Estevez trying to kill himself. Noel Estevez, who friends said suffered . from a speech impediment and Tourette’s syndrome, was terrified of Timothy and a group of his friends who took to chasing him down the . street and leaving him too scared to leave his home. Around 3pm Wednesday, as Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue in The Bronx was being let out, the argument between Estevez and Timothy Crump spilled over into bloodshed. Witnesses said that they saw Timothy confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose. Teachers and teaching assistants rushed to the scene to break up the brawl but before they could intervene, Estevez produced a 12-inch kitchen knife and plunged it into his former friend three times, inflicting fatal wounds. Noel Estevez tried to hang himself in his own apartment on May 28. His father found him in the closet with a rope . Chailyn Oballe, 12, said that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school. 'And . that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like . he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his . pocket and covered it with his shirt.' Differing accounts have been given about the boys' relationship. One has it that Estevez had long been bullied by Timothy Crump. Another that they were all part of the same gang but had fallen out. 'He . used to be part of their group, but I think they threw him out and they . started teasing him,' Jorge Guerrero, 47, the porter at the Estevez building on East Clarke Place in High Bridge, said. He said that on at least four occasions in the last month he had to mop up urine from outside the apartment. He added that he did not recognize Crump as one of the bullies - but others did. 'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbor Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '[He . would say] things like, ""Ha ha, your mum's a crackhead, you're . stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mum’s locked up.' Another family friend Marisol Perez said it was worse than that. ‘They would move their bowels in front of the door, try and set the door on fire,’ she said. ‘Every time the cops would come, the kids would leave, saying there was nothing they could do about it.' Mrs Estevez and Miss Perez were arrested on June 11 for allegedly selling drugs to an undercover policeman. Both declare their innocence. Charged: Estevez can be seen centre being taken in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second-degree murder and charged as an adult, police said . Miss Arroyo said that Timothy 'found it funny'. She said that he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him. The treatment eventually left Estevez suicidal, Marisol Perez, said. 'Two . weeks ago on May 28 he tried to hang himself in his own apartment,' Miss Perez added. 'His . father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.' Estevez . was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this . week, even though he told his father he did not want to go because of the . bullies. Arrest: A security guard reportedly stopped the fight outside the school, IS 177, and the boy was arrested . 'His father brought him to school this morning and said, ""Don’t worry, just go straight home after school"",' Miss Perez added. But Timothy Crump's neighbors at a homeless shelter said that he was a quiet child and that Estevez was the bully. 'He . wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 'He'd say, ""I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you."" I’ve seen him say it.' A policeman said that Estevez had borrowed Timothy’s mobile, but was unable to return it. Timothy is believed to have asked for the phone’s return or financial compensation. Crime scene: Authorities gather outside the school where the teenager was stabbed after class . On Thursday, Estevez appeared at a Bronx courthouse. His father, Felix, was not present at the court because, said defense lawyer Eric Poulos, he had been threatened by Timothy’s family, although his aunts and cousins did attend. The hearing lasted around 10 minutes and Mr Poulos described months of harassment and intimidation suffered by his client. The family had repeatedly sought help from the authorities, to little avail, he said. Judge Laurence Busching ordered Estevez to be held without bail and scheduled the next hearing for Tuesday .","Noel Estevez stabbed Timothy Crump, 14, in the chest three times after they left school in the Bronx, New York, Wednesday .

"By . Martin Beckford . Blood from a murder scene will be used to determine if a convicted killer is the father of his victim’s children. In the bizarre case, the murderer, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing his girlfriend to death at their London home, wants to keep in touch with her two young children. He is not named on their birth certificates and refuses to take a paternity test, insisting he ‘knows best’ and that he fathered them. Composite of DNA strands and a couple in the background (picture posed by models) So social workers who are  looking after the children made the highly unusual request to the High Court for permission to use forensic material from the crime scene. They want the issue resolved either way for the sake of the children. Because the knifeman is believed to have cut his own wrists while attacking the woman, blood likely to be his own was found in the house and stored by Scotland Yard. By comparing a copy of the DNA profile of this blood with that taken from the two children, lawyers for the local authority say they can establish if he was their father. None of those involved can be named in order to protect the children’s identities. Both the Metropolitan Police Force and the Home Office opposed the application, as did lawyers for the killer. The authorities said that the highly sensitive database of criminals’ genetic material was not meant to be used to resolve family disputes, and would therefore open the ‘floodgates’ to other requests for samples. There are also strict rules about the use of evidence seized by police, while individuals – even convicted  killers – have the right to keep their medical data private. But Sir James Munby, the president of the Family Division, overruled their concerns and allowed copies of the murder scene DNA profiles to be compared with those  of the children. He argued that the move was justified in this case because the children had the right to know if the man who killed their mother was indeed their father. Sir James said: ‘How can therapy or counselling be arranged, how is the children’s psychological integrity to be preserved, if the paternity issue is not resolved? ‘In these circumstances the balance, in my judgment, comes down in favour of the children.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Murderer is serving life sentence for stabbing his girlfriend to death at their London home .

The incident happened at Caboolture Hospital, in Queensland's south-east, on Thursday. An investigation has been launched into the issue by the health service that runs the hospital as the child's parents face a week-long wait for test results. Scroll down for video . A three-week-old baby is being tested for HIV after hospital staff gave him breast milk from the wrong mother . The baby's grandmother, who said her name was Peggy, told listeners of 4BC radio station in Brisbane of the family's distress, AAP reported. She said the boy was being tested not just for HIV, but Hepatitis A, B and C as well. 'My son and daughter-in-law are beside themselves,' Peggy told 4BC. 'We're on tenterhooks and to have something like that happen at a hospital, who's not doing their job?' The grandmother said a nurse gave a bottle to her daughter-in-law only to return five minutes later and say it was the wrong one. The incident happened on Thursday at Caboolture Hospital, north of Brisbane in Queensland . A Metro North Hospital and Health Service spokesman said they had apologised 'unreservedly' to the parents and the donor mother. 'Medical advice, provided to the families, is because of the good health of those involved there is negligible risk of health impacts to the baby as a result of this incident,' the spokesman told AAP. 'However as a precaution, to give peace of mind and certainty to the families involved, blood and milk samples have been taken for comprehensive testing.' The boy's grandmother called a Brisbane talkback radio station on Friday telling listeners of the family's distress . Results are expected to be available within a week, with a routine confirmation test to occur again in 12 weeks. The spokesman said any issues identified by a formal investigation would be addressed to prevent a recurrence. Staff involved in the incident had been counselled about the importance of following all protocols in relation to expressed breast milk, he said.","The incident happened at Caboolture Hospital, in Queensland's south-east .

The girl lost her right arm last year when she picked up a grenade following a firefight between U.S. and Taliban forces in her village near the Pakistan border. The explosion, which killed her brother, also destroyed her right eye. After doctors at Shriners Hospital For Children fitted her with a prosthetic arm she quickly adapted and resumed painting, something she revealed was her favored pastime in Afghanistan. After a stop at a restaurant Thursday for a soda and chicken nuggets, she headed back to the hospital to be checked out before going home with Najjar. Shah Bibi Tarakhai now has a six-month visa and groups are hoping to get her permanent residency in the U.S. Pediatrician Alexander Van Speybroeck, left, sits next to Shah Bibi Tarakhail, 6, during a checkup . She'll move in with a host family next week. The child broke into a huge grin when reunited with her physical therapist. ""You remember me?"" Vivian Yip asked as Shah Bibi rushed to embrace her. Soon she was demonstrating that, although her prosthetic had lost one of its straps, she hadn't lost any of her skill.

She was stringing children's blocks together with yarn, cutting up a pink sheet of paper and drawing a happy face on it. Then, with Yip's help, she signed her name. She cocked her head, smiled and said ""Thank you,"" when someone praised her work. Just before she returned home last April, Children of War had arranged a lesson for her with prominent abstract expressionist Davyd Whaley, who praised her talent.

After Galerie Michael in Beverly Hills showed her work around, she received an invitation to visit the Picasso Museum in Spain. Whaley has offered her another lesson at the gallery. Before she enrolls in school in the fall, her doctors plan to fit her with a prosthetic eye. They'll eventually treat some of the scars she sustained when the grenade exploded.","Shah Bibi Tarakhail, 6, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday morning on the last leg of a journey from Kabul .

"Three Canadian prisoners who managed to escape their shackles in a helicopter earlier this month have been recaptured and returned to their detention center. The three men had been arrested as . part of a 2010 drug bust called Operation Crayfish that netted weapons, . cars and a plane. They were awaiting trial on charges that included . murder and gangsterism when a helicopter appeared on June 7 and flew . them from a courtyard at the Orsainville Detention Centre outside of . Quebec City  where they were being held under light security. A day before the escape a judge had eased restrictions on the men allowing them to be in the courtyard at the same time on court days after they complained harsh security conditions were impeding their defence. Their . escape set off an international manhunt, and the trio were added to an . Interpol red notice list, reserved for the world's most wanted . fugitives. These three men were recaptured early this morning in Montreal two weeks after their brazen escape by helicopter from a detention center . Surete du . Quebec officers arrested the trio at a Montreal residence at about 1:30 . a.m. this morning. Yves Denis, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge . Pomerleau, 49, are scheduled to appear in court in Quebec City on . Monday, according to CNN. Police . didn't divulge any more details about how they recaptured the fugitives . or who was flying the helicopter, but more arrests in the case are . expected. Police found the escaped prisoners hiding in this apartment in Montreal this morning . This image shows where the escapees apparently slept inside the apartment in Montreal . The Quebec government has ordered an investigation into the incident, which will also look into a similar escape that took place in 2013. In March of that year, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a local tour company and ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal. There they lifted two inmates to freedom using cables. The fugitives in that case were also eventually recaptured. Other memorable helicopter escapes include a Greek prisoner who managed to fly away twice, in 2006 and again in 2009, and Joel David Kaplan's flight from a Mexican jail in 1971. The latter incident inspired a book and a movie. Police officers stand by the front of the Orsainville Detention Centre on June 7 after the inmates escaped .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The petite ballerina who has been comforting Sir Mick Jagger following the suicide of his longtime girlfriend L'Wren Scott cut a solitary figure as she wandered the streets of New York City today. Melanie Hamrick, 27, was the subject of much conjecture when a picture of her and Jagger embracing on a Zurich balcony just 11 weeks after Scott's death was published. Scott's family has reacted to the picture with opposing statements. Her sister Jan Shane called Jagger's behavior 'grotesquely disrespectful,' while her brother has said he has nothing but warm regards for the rocker, whose love for his sister he 'never questioned.' City girl: Hamrick was photographed today as she strode purposefully around New York City . Neighbors: Hamrick lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and L'Wren Scott shared . But . the images of the great-grandfather being hugged and kissed by Melanie, . who describes herself as ‘goofy and awkward’, left Ms Scott’s family . seething. Speaking from . her home in Utah, her sister Jan Shane said: ‘These pictures make me . really wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling. ‘His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister – and then you see these photos. 'He will never change. And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed? The more I think about it – the more angry it makes me. ‘My . sister deserves so much more respect than that. It hasn’t even been . three months. I now believe that he was a bigger part of her troubles . that no one knew about. I am so hurt to know that she was so sad and . hurting inside and felt that she had nowhere to go.’ Jagger, who along with his Rolling Stones band mates, is due to play the ancient . Circus Maximus in Rome on June 22, hasn't commented on the relationship . rumors. But . sources close to Jagger said the tryst between Jagger and Hamrick . followed a chance encounter in a nightclub, but it later transpired that . they had first met three months earlier in Japan, just two weeks before Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49. The . pair didn’t hook up but remained in touch and Melanie ‘reached out and . they met in New York as friends,’ a source told The Sun following . Scott’s tragic death. ‘There was a spark there and she provided a distraction to the emotional hell he was going through,’ said the source. Hamrick, a ballerina with the American Ballet Theater Company, was also spotted alone on the streets of New York earlier in the week. Flying solo: Hamrick's rumored beau Mick Jagger, 70, is currently on tour in Europe . Meanwhile, Jagger celebrated Father’s Day on Sunday by meeting-up with his ex-wife, and two of their children. The singer was seen smiling with former partner Jerry Hall, 57, daughter Georgia May, 22, and son Gabriel, 16, as they left a hotel in Vienna, Austria, ahead of a concert the Rolling Stones gave in the city on Monday night. Jagger's nine-year relationship with Hall ended 15 years ago but the couple, who have four children together, are still close. It was the rocker's first public appearance since it emerged he met leading ballerina Melanie just two weeks before his girlfriend’s suicide. On March 6 this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of the band. Melanie, who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no mention of the Stones concert. A spokesman for Jagger has confirmed that the pair met when Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact details in Tokyo. Running errands: Hamrick was dressed casually in jeans and flat shoes as she wandered around Manhattan . The week before the concert, on February . 25, Jagger had attended a special reception for the ballet troupe in . Tokyo, hosted by U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a . long-standing friend of the rock star, but Hamrick did not attend. She . lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the . home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared. It was there that Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49. Jagger and Hamrick were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking as though they had just got out of bed.Mick, who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved top with slashed sleeves. During the afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water. Still rocking: The aging lothario, performing June 19 in Dusseldorf, Germany, has apparently kindled a new romance with Hamrick just months after his girlfriend's tragic suicide . Longtime lovers: Jagger and L'Wren Scott had been a couple for more than 10 years when she committed suicide . The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the suite. Jagger was flooded with messages of . support after Ms Scott, his girlfriend of 13 years, committed suicide . while he was touring with the Stones in Australia. Soon . afterwards, he issued a statement saying: ‘I am still struggling to . understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this . tragic way. ‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves... I will never forget her.’ Prima ballerina: Hamrick is a dancer with the American Ballet Theater Company . Since the band resumed the tour following Ms Scott’s death, rumours have been rife the father-of-seven has been entertained by several women after the shows. Friends claimed Mick, while performing in Berlin last week, spent the night with an old flame after arranging to meet her in the German capital. And actress and singer Noa Tishby posted a picture on the internet of herself and Jagger sharing a joke in a hotel room during the Stones’ stay in Israel a fortnight ago. A source close to the band said: ‘Mick’s way of dealing with L’Wren’s death was to get back on stage as soon as possible. It wasn’t long though before he was up to his old tricks. ‘The girl in Zurich was just a brief fling but she isn’t the first and won’t be the last. Mick is like an old dog who can’t be taught new tricks. Even before he started singing he was a womaniser and he still is. He knows no other way. ‘I’m not sure what the girl in Zurich thinks, but she is a goner.’ Perhaps all the traveling to be with Mick has affected Melanie’s performances on stage. A review last week of American Ballet Theatre’s production of Cinderella, singled her out for having ‘lamentably weak’ feet in her role as the Winter Fairy.","The American ballerina, Melanie Hamrick, 27, met Jagger in Tokyo in March and they exchanged details .

"By . Damien Gayle . Villagers in Cameroon are living in fear of Boko Haram militants who have been launching raids across the border from Nigera to snatch children, a report claims. Hundreds of troops have been dispatched to the country's north, which shares a long border with Borno, the Nigerian state at the heart of the group's Islamist insurgency. But despite the deployment of some of Cameroon's most-elite units, whole villages have been cleared out and schools torched by Boko Haram raids. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in a video he sent taunting the Nigerian government over the kidnapping of the girls from their boarding school dormitory in April . Villagers told Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford that Boko Haram fighters made daylight raids to snatch young boys to force them to take up arms as child soldiers. One boy described how he was confronted by militants while out working in the fields. After he refused their invitation to join them the situation became tense but he was able to run away. Cameroon shares a 1,243-mile border with Nigeria that is mostly unmanned. Nigeria has accused Cameroon of failing to stop Boko Haram using its territory as a safe haven. But Cameroon's Defence Ministry spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Badjeck, rejected the claim. 'They are not in Cameroon. Why would we allow that? This is bad for Cameroon,' he told Sky New. 'We are suffering too at the hands of Boko Haram.' Cameroonian army soldiers deploying in Dabanga, in the country's north, as part of a reinforcement of its military forces against Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been making sorties over the border .

A Cameroon Air Force Alpha Jet parked following a surveillance flight over the northern border . A military pilot checking a map following a surveillance flight over the northern border . Founded in 2002, Boko Haram was a more or less a peaceful political group that sought the establishement of an Islamic government in Borno state, an area ruled by the Islamic Bornu Empire before colonisation. It turned to violence in the face of a Nigerian government crackdown in 2009 and, in April, soared to worldwide notoriety after kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, a town in Borno. Hundreds have been killed in attacks by the group this year alone. On Tuesday, at least 14 people were killed in the bomb attack in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, which struck football fans watching the World Cup. Witnesses said a tricycle taxi was driven into the outdoor area before the bomb went off. Cameroon shares a 1,243-mile border with Nigeria stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad and including Borno State, the region of Nigeria which is at the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency . Some of the victims killed by a bomb explosion targeting football fans watching the World Cup in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, lie in the morgue in the town's government hospital . Police said the death toll was 14, with 26 people wounded. One hospital worker told the BBC however that he had counted 21 bodies. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Boko Haram was suspected. Police assistant superintendent Nathan Cheghan said rescue workers were being careful for fear of secondary explosions, often timed to kill people who rush to the scene of a bomb blast. Last month an attack on a market place in the city of Jos, Plateau State, which used precisely that tactic to kill 118 in car-bomb blasts timed 30 minutes apart. Other recent attacks include the slaughter of at least 200 civilians in three remote communities in Borno on June 2, a bombing at a football field in Mubi, Adamawa state, which killed at least 40, and attacks on the Borno towns of Gamboru and Ngala, in which as many as 336 are thought to have been killed.","Cameroonian military rejects claims country is a safe haven to terrorists .

"Kenyans have been warned to watch World Cup football matches from 'the comfort of their homes', following two days of attacks which left 60 people dead. Football fans have been urged by the government to avoid 'crowded and unprotected places' after gunfire broke out on Sunday evening as people watched a World Cup game. Somalia's Islamist group al-Shabab said it carried out the attacks in the coastal town of Mpeketoni in revenge for the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia and the killing of Muslims. Scroll down for video . Residents barricade a road as they protest against the recent killings in the village of Kibaoni. Militants linked to Al Qaeda have carried out two massacres in the area - claiming 60 lives . A man observes the remains of destroyed vehicles and buildings in the town of Mpeketoni after the area was attacked by extremists this week. Terror group Al Shabaab have warned tourists they visit the country 'at their own peril' The Kenyan government said security had . been heightened in the wake of the attacks but that bars and restaurants should be extra vigilant. The BBC reports that, in a statement, the interior ministry said: 'Where possible, Kenyans are strongly advised to watch the World Cup matches from the comfort of their homes instead of crowded and unprotected open places.' The government added that security should be increased to ensure they are 'safe from . criminals who may try to take advantage of the World Cup to perpetrate . acts of criminality and violence'. The warning comes after witnesses reported that a white . man speaking 'fluent English' was in charge of the group . which gunned down the victims people on Sunday evening. Several residents in Mpeketoni reported that they saw a pale-skinned man who spoke English and Arabic giving orders to the gunmen. The . eyewitness accounts support the theory that the men were sent by . al-Shabaab by a seasoned foreign jihadi unit now working with the Somali . Islamists. 'I saw a white man who was speaking in fluent British English commanding the rest of the attackers,' said Mary Gachoki, a teacher who lives in Mpeketoni and speaks good English told The Telegraph. The Inspector General of Police said several people have been arrested including suspected ringleaders. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta  said al-Shabaab was not behind deadly attacks on Kenya's coast, contradicting the militant group's claims . David Kimaiyo also said that someone had been arrested for using social media to say that  al-Shabaab was behind the attacks - the deadliest since Somalia's al-Shabab militants killed 67 people in a shopping mall in Nairobi last September. 'We . have arrested several suspects in connection to Mpeketoni incident . including the owner and driver of one the vehicles used by attackers,' Mr Kimaiyo said on Twitter. 'Also . in police custody is a suspect who was operating social media accounts . purportedly used by al-Shabaab to claim responsibility.' Today it emerged that reports 12 women were abducted from the Poromoko district near Mpeketoni were abducted have turned out to be false. Yesterday Kenya's president said al-Shabaab was not . behind deadly attacks on Kenya's coast, contradicting the militant group's claims. Somalia's al Shabaab militant group has said its gunmen carried out the attacks on the town of Mpeketoni on Sunday night and on a nearby village early on Tuesday morning. In comments that could further stoke political tensions in a country where allegiances generally run along ethnic lines, President Uhuru Kenyatta instead pointed the finger at rivals he described as 'hate-mongers', though he did not name anybody. Kenyan police officers patrol Mavuno villages near Mpeketoni after unidentified gunmen attacked the coastal Kenyan town. Hotels are believed to be 80 per cent empty in Mombasa, the country's second city . Kenya police observe the remains of burnt-out cars at a police station in Mpeketoni.  Kenya's tourist board in London has attempted to play down the threats in a bid to save the tourism industy . 'The . attack in Lamu was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated . ethnic violence against the Kenyan community,' Kenyatta told the nation . in an address, referring to Lamu county where the two attacks took . place. 'This, . therefore, was not an al Shabaab terrorist attack. Evidence indicates . local political networks were involved in the planning and execution of . the heinous crime. This also played into the opportunist network of . other criminal gangs,' he said. Blaming . domestic rivals could ease pressure on Kenyatta's government, which has . faced strong criticism about its handling of security and the threat . from Somali-linked militants. Analysts said politicising the issue of security by either side risked undermining efforts to tackle shortcomings. 'We live at a time when our people are vulnerable to reckless leaders and hate-mongers who manipulate them to create hate, intolerance and fanaticism, which makes them easy prey to radicalisation and crime,' Kenyatta said in his address. Though Kenyatta, an ethnic Kikuyu, did not mention him, his comments appeared directed at his opponent and main presidential challenger in last year's election, Raila Odinga, an ethnic Luo, who returned to Kenya in May after a long period abroad. Odinga has been rallying supporters and has urged dialogue with the government. He has condemned the latest assaults. In Sunday's attack, gunmen stormed Mpeketoni, which lies near the popular tourist attraction of Lamu town, and killed 49 people. Then 24 hours later, gunmen raided nearby Poromoko village, going through the town from house to house and ordering residents to recite an Islamic creed, witnesses said. Riot policemen remove a road barricade of a truck burnt by protestors along the streets after the attack in Mpeketoni . Kenya has blamed al Shabaab for a spate of gun and bomb attacks in recent months. Kenya also holds al Shabab responsible for an attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September last year in which 67 people were killed . Kenya has . blamed al Shabaab for a spate of gun and bomb attacks in recent months. Kenya also holds al Shabab responsible for an attack on Nairobi's . Westgate shopping mall in September last year in which 67 people were . killed. Al . Shabaab has said its attacks are intended to punish Kenya for sending . troops to Somalia to confront its Islamist fighters. Kenya has . previously said it would keep its troops in Somalia. Witnesses . in Mpeketoni said they heard the gunmen speak Somali, although that . does not automatically link them to al Shabaab as Kenya has a large . minority with Somali origins who also speak the language. Tribes of Somali origin and other ethnic groups have in the past fought over land and other issues, though that has mostly occurred in Kenya's lawless northern border area. After the 2007 presidential vote in Kenya, ethnic tensions erupted into violence that killed about 1,200 people. In a statement condemning the Mpeketoni attack on Monday, Odinga said: 'This is not time for blame games ... We must as leaders and as a nation rally together to respond to this serious national tragedy.' The new attacks have fuelled public criticism of the government for failing to do more to improve national security. Brutal: Kenyan residents at the scene of one of the bodies of those killed in nearby Mpeketoni on Sunday. Police believe the Poromoko attack was carried out by the same group of Islamist militants . Grim task: Family members wait to collect bodies of their relatives at Mpeketoni hospital in Lamu county  following Sunday night's massacre . Cowardly: At least 48 people were killed in the Sunday night raid and two hotels were set on fire before the gunmen fled into surrounding undergrowth . Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku, who has defended his government's security efforts, has been a particular target for fury. Many . Kenyans have said he should have been fired after the Westgate crisis, . particularly after soldiers involved in retaking the mall from militants . were found to have looted it. Ole Lenku said he sacked a senior regional officer in Lamu county after this week's attack. Kenyatta said security officials, who he said ignored intelligence, would face charges. The series of recent assaults have hammered the vital tourist industry, particularly on the coast. Some hotels in the palm-fringed coastal region say they face closure, while others which offer safaris up-country say bookings are down 30 percent - a worrying sign as the July-to-September peak tourist season approaches. 'This government is full of talk and no action,' said one angry resident in Mpeketoni, speaking as Ole Lenku arrived in the town on Tuesday. 'They keep saying the country is safe and we keep on suffering at the hands of terrorists.' The Red Cross had previously put the death toll for the Mpeketoni assault at 50 but on Tuesday said the total figure was 49. That number did not include victims of the latest attack.","Football fans warned to watch matches from 'comfort of their own homes'

"By . Snejana Farberov . It is an undisputed fact that when you mess you the bull, you get the horns, but what happens when you mess with your wife? A video has surfaced online showing a drunken amateur matador trying to take on a bull during a festival in Peru, only to be forcefully stopped by his more clear-headed spouse. The short clip, which has been uploaded online by Reuters, depicts the raucous, alcohol-drenched celebration of the annual Senor Espiritu Santo festival in the city of Ayacucho, which took place last Sunday. Scroll down for video . She's not messing around: This clear-headed wife pushed her lush husband away from the bull he was planning to fight during an annual festival in Peru . Tough love: The woman smacked the man on the head to discourage him from getting back into the fray and pinned him to the fence . Driving her point home: The caring wife gave her beloved another whack just to make sure he doesn't go near the bull . The event traces its roots to the 17th century when Spanish rulers tried to incorporate indigenous people in their customs and celebrations. Each year, the event culminates in amateur bullfights, which often result in injuries for the wannabe matadors. About 30 seconds into the clip, a woman shows up on screen pushing her 'inebriated' husband away from the action. The visibly angry wife smacks the man on the back of the head, pins him against a nearby fence and then drives the message home with another whack. Not for the faint of heart: The annual Senor Espiritu Santo festival in the Peruvian city of Ayacucho each year culminates in an amateur bullfight .

No time to waste: Spectators in the crowd jumped in to help gored bullfighters and drag them to safety . Other participants of the festival, however, were not as lucky, probably because they did not have loving spouses to look after them. The bullfight held in a makeshift ring quickly got out of control and left at least 10 people injured. Spectators in the crowd jumped in to assist gored and mauled bullfighters and drag them to safety. One young boy jumped on top of a car to avoid the bull's path. According to local media, many of the aspiring matadors appeared to be intoxicated during the festivities.

Crime and punishment: A drunken ring assistant who untied the rope used to protect participants was later lashed by the crowd . Panic ensued when a drunken ring assistant untied the rope used to protect participants from the increasingly enraged animal sporting a pair of massive horns. When the bull was freed, it charged toward the crowd causing spectators to flee. The man responsible for releasing the bull was later grabbed by members in the crowd and publicly lashed as punishment.","Video was taken during annual Senor Espiritu Santo festival in Ayacucho, Peru, last Sunday .

"By . Louise Cheer . At just 19, New Zealand's Brando Yelavich set off on a journey no one had ever embarked on before - to traverse the country's entire coastline. Brando started his trek at Cape Reinga - the most northern tip of the North Island - in February 2013 and will end it there. He is about four months and 700km away from reaching his goal. The now 20-year-old set off with a 50kg backpack that had everything he needed to survive on his trip and planned to live off the land - catching fish, wild birds and wild rabbits - as well as anything else he could get his hands on. A New Zealand man has embarked on a trip to circumnavigate the country's entire coastline - which is more than 7,000km . Brando, 20, has been travelling along the New Zealand coastline, hiking up rocky terrain (left) and paddling through water (right) He started at Cape Reinga - the most northern point of the North Island - in February 2013 and will end his trip there as well . Right now he is about three-quarters of the way to his final destination, making his way up east coast at Mission Bay near Auckland. In the past 17 months, Brando has documented his 7000-plus-kilometre journey on the internet via Facebook, Instagram and his own website at www.wildboy.co.nz. The collection of photographs, taken with Brando's mobile phone or GoPro, include snaps of him walking down endless-looking train tracks, posing in front of picturesque backdrops of mountainous terrain lifted straight out a Lord of the Rings film and exploring what lies beneath the surface of the coast's pristine waters. Brando, who has struggled with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, dubs his epic adventure - where he has climbing, walking, running and swimming - as his version of conquering the world's tallest mountain, Mount Everest. He is on his way up the east coast of the North Island at the moment and has about 700km and four months left to go . The Auckland man left with just a 50kg backpack and has been living off the land (left) and pitching a tent wherever he can (right) On his website, Brando said this adventure had been a dream for several years and it had taken him to some of the highest and lowest points of New Zealand . 'I had wanted to circumnavigate the New Zealand coastline for several years - inspired by the movie, Into the Wild,' he wrote on his website. 'Because of not achieving at school as a result of ADHD and dyslexia, and not being able to get a decent job I decided to wipe the slate clean and do something great which helps others so I decided to support the Ronald McDonald House Charity (I have always loved kids) and carry out my epic adventure to circumnavigate the New Zealand coastline - over 7000km - living off the land, the sea and the kindness of others.' Brando treks for six to ten hours a day and covers 15 to 35km. This works out to be about 100km a week. Mr Yelavich's dad, Todd, told MailOnline Brando had first planned to run the distance but the challenging terrain meant his son had to ditch the idea. 'He’s obviously going up and down mountains along the coast because there aren’t any beaches for him to walk down – it’s all cliffs,' Todd said. 'At first, we didn’t think he was going to follow through with it but when he was four to six weeks out, it started looking like he was going to do it now. 'Once it became reality, we had to take it a lot more seriously,' Todd said with a laugh. So far he has covered 6500km of his trip since he started and learned a lot more outdoor skills, according to Brando's dad, Todd . Brando calls the trip his 'Mount Everest' and is raising money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities . His route from the past two days up the eastern coast of New Zealand, just near Auckland . During the first few weeks of Brando's journey, Todd admitted the family worried a lot about his son, but as the year wore on they became less so. Todd said Brando calls the family almost every day to touch base with them. 'He’s almost killed himself a couple of times falling down banks, but he’s got a lot more skills than when he started,' he said. 'He was pretty fit to start with, he’d been training for it. 'Everything he needs is in his pack. It weighed 50kg at the start and he weighs about 68kg, so the pack was nearly as heavy as he was.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . There was a great deal of optimism when developers began construction on the Al-Waha Shopping Complex but now it lies abandoned and uncompleted, its fountain arid rather than spectacular, host not to shoppers buying the latest must-haves but to refugees from President Assad and the civil war in Syria. The building lies outside Tripoli in northern Lebanon is now home to more than a thousand residents who pay rent to the building’s owners. They try to make it homely and have hooked up rusty satellite dishes to old television sets. There is a small local shop but not everyone has the money to spend in there. Families of sometimes more than a dozen members bed down in what should have been an electronics shop or a fashion boutique and try their best to scrape a living to pay their rent. Al-Waha shopping arcade in Syria is a home to more than 1,000 refugees rather than a plush chopping centre outside Tripoli, nortthern Lebanon . Al-Waha: Its fountain is arid rather than spectacular, its stairs crumbling and the residents have rusty satellite dishes connected to old television sets . The shopping arcade sits on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean in beautiful countryside . Not long after the families began moving in, the owners arrived to demand money even there are no real facilities. The rents are based on where in the shopping arcade the families live – those on the ground floor pay $100 a month while those on the more desirable higher storeys are charged up to $250, according to a video report in CNN. One resident, Saleh Habib, lives with 12 of his relatives in a single room, sleeping on thin mattresses. ‘The worst part is the boredom,’ he told CNN anchor Hala Gorani. ‘We couldn’t find any place better. A real flat costs at least $500 a month.’ The shopping arcade boasts a rooftop restaurant – Cornelia’s – and a fully equipped gym but none of the residents use it as the owners have locked and bolted its doors. Speaking later, CNN's Ms Gorani said: 'Refugees tell me that once they’d settled into the mall, stall owners came demanding rent.' 'Families of up to 15 people live together in what should have become clothing or electronics shops. It costs anywhere between $100 and $250 a month to live here. A fortune for many refugee families,' she added. 'Life here unfolds with predictable tedium. Women cook meals, wash laundry and prepare meals. Men try to find work outside the shopping complex, with little success,' Ms Gorani went on to say. 'There is never a moment of privacy or silence, the refugees here say. The circular mall structure acts like a tin drum. After only a few hours, the constant sounds of children playing and people talking become difficult to bear,' she said.

'I . still think we go to tournaments, whether it be under-17s, under-19s, . under-21s, there are too many pull-outs, it seems to be everyone has got . an excuse, and I can tell you when I was at Tottenham, when full . internationals came around, there were two or three players who did not . want to play for England,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek . programme.

Doubts: Harry Redknapp has questioned the commitment of young English players to the national team cause . 'They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, ""Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don't want to play in that game"". 'That was how it was. I'd say, ""you're playing for your country, you should want to play"".' '(They would say) 'Nah, my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks, I don't want to play' and that is the truth, so it makes you wonder. 'And I think it's only going to get . worse.

'For Costa Rica to top the group by beating Italy and Uruguay, that tells you all you need to know about the group,' he added. 'For me it's the worst Italy team for years.

"By . Darren Boyle . Celebrity chef Annabel Karmel said she wanted to 'curl up' and never get up again after a former employee accused her of sexual harassment. The 57-year-old author and chef fired Mark Salter last June just four months after he had been employed as a sales director. Last month she settled a case with Mr Salter, offering to pay him £3,000. Annabel Karmel, pictured admitted that 'collapsed weeping' in the hallway of her home during the employment tribunal . Mark Salter, pictured, had sued Ms Karmel for £50,000 but according to the chef the case was settled for £3,000 . Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Ms Karmel said the case has had a major impact on her life. She said: 'My career depends on my reputation and here he was trying to wreck it. He didn't have a shred of evidence but it has cost me £60,000 to defend my name.' 'I just wanted to curl up and never get up again. I remember going home and collapsing in the hall and weeping. I just felt it couldn't be happy again.' Mr Salter was initially looking for £50,000 in compensation from the renowned celebrity chef. Ms Karmel added: 'I am speaking out because I want to clear my name. I want to get on with my life but I also want to help other people who have suffered from this. There out to be a register of people who have sued companies and why.' The Sunday Telegraph claimed that Mr Salter has had seven jobs over the past decade and taken three legal cases against former employers. The employment tribunal heard claims that Ms Karmel had made sexual comments to Mr Salter. He also said she wore provocative clothing in a bid to seduce him before dismissing him just four months after he joined her firm. Mrs Karmel had tried to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing publication of her name, her company’s name and the name of her former employee. Her legal team argued that her reputation and status as a ‘well-known media personality’ would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of the case because it involved an  allegation of sexual misconduct. Ms Karmel said he was speaking out at this time in a bid to clear her name after the allegations became public . But the Daily Mail successfully  challenged the order. Employment judge James Tayler ruled it was ‘patronising to the British public to assume that they are incapable of understanding that an allegation is just that until it has been proved’. The judge said ‘the fact that a hearing will involve the airing of information that is personal and embarrassing and engages the qualified right to respect for private and family life’ is not ‘sufficient to outweigh the principle of open justice’. Mrs Karmel contested all the allegations made at the four-day employment tribunal hearing in central London. Last month she agreed terms with her former sales manager following hours of legal wrangling. He withdrew his claim of sexual misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued through her lawyers, Mrs Karmel said: ‘Mark Salter has withdrawn his employment tribunal claim and unreservedly retracted the allegations against me. ‘I have defended his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this matter.’ It has been reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author ‘only employed good-looking men’ and made inappropriate comments about his good looks in front of clients. In between discussions with her legal team she found time to tweet nutritional advice for babies and young children, urging mothers to ‘keep food in large chunks’ for youngsters to hold on to. The food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and ready meals. Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son Nicholas’ fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children. Divorced from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a £20million home in one of London’s most sought after districts with film producer partner Stephen Margolis. Her books carry the seal of approval of Great Ormond Street Hospital and she was awarded an MBE in 2006.","Annabel Karmel said she was speaking out in a bid to 'clear her name'

"By . Darren Boyle . A City accountant fractured her skull and died inches from her front door when she slipped down the staircase to her basement flat after a drunken night out, an inquest heard. The body of tragic Jemma Brownlee, 29, who worked for top accounting firm Deloitte,  lay undiscovered outside her basement flat in Pimlico, central London, for more than 15 hours, the hearing was told. She was found lying in a pool of blood outside her flat - just yards from the apartment where MI6 'spy in a bag' Gareth Williams was found dead - after her mother raised the alarm when she failed to arrive in the West Midlands for a planned visit, the inquest heard. Jemma Brownlee, right, was due to visit her mother Lynn, left, the day after she slipped down the stairs to her London flat and died . Tests revealed Ms Brownlee, a senior tax manager at international accountancy firm Deloitte, had drunk so much alcohol during a night out with friends that she was almost three times over the drink-drive limit, the hearing was told. Her body was only found more than 16 hours after she left a bar in Soho, central London, when a friend was sent to check on her after she failed to turn up at her mother's house in Coventry where she had been due to visit. Assistant Westminster Coroner Doctor Shirley Radcliffe said it was a 'a terrible tragedy for a girl of 29 in such a wonderful position in life and with a successful career' to die in such circumstances. Following a spell at Barclays, Leeds University graduate Ms Brownlee had worked for Deloittes for seven years in its tax division, rising rapidly through the ranks to senior manager. After work on Monday April 14 this year she had been out drinking in Soho, the inquest heard. She had left pals at a venue on Archer Street around 11.30pm, hailing a a cab home, according to a police report read to the inquest. She had been due to visit her mum, Lynne Brownlee, in Coventry the next day. Westminster Coroners Court heard that Ms Brownlee took a taxi to her apartment in Pimlico, London, left, but slipped on the steps and fell down the stairs leading to her front door, right, where her body was discovered . However, when her daughter failed to show up she made a concerned phone call to Jemma's friend and work colleague Amy Wilson, the hearing was told. PC Rhys Davis was called to the scene by paramedics just before 5pm on Tuesday April 15th. In his report, he said: 'Miss Wilson then attended Miss Brownlee's flat on Alderney Street, Pimlico, and found her lying at the bottom of the stairs to her flat. 'A neighbour said she had touched her and found her cold and rigor mortis had set in. 'Her injuries appeared consistent with falling down the stairs.' A paramedic's statement said there had been 'a large pool of blood around her head' and there was no way of saving her, although no precise time of death was given. The inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how the accountant had fractured her skull. Criminal examiners ruled out foul play when they found her shoes strewn across a steep concrete staircase leading down to her basement flat, with her handbag and its contents lying untouched nearby. A toxicologist's report said she had 218mg of alcohol in 100ml of her blood, over two-and-half times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Radcliffe said: 'Clearly she had left the pub under the influence of alcohol and would have been undoubtedly intoxicated, which left her at risk of slipping. 'It is a terrible tragedy for a girl of 29 in such a wonderful position in life and with a successful career, she was a bright and capable woman. 'Sadly, it's a very clear situation and I shall therefore record that Jemma Louise Brownlee has died from cerebal oedema due to ethanol toxicity. 'My conclusion is that she has died as a result of an accident.'","Jemma Brownlee was two-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More than 14million years are lost when lives are cut short by preventable disease, shocking new figures reveal. Cancer, heart attacks, drink, drugs and murders are responsible for thousands of deaths among the under-60s every year, despite being avoidable. New analysis of official figures show that men lost more than 8million years and women 6million as a result of deaths which need not have happened. Heart disease, intentional injuries such as murder and suicide, cancer, and accidents each accounted for around 1.7million years of life lost among men in 2012 . Cancer alone was responsible for cutting the lives of women short by more than 3million years . Men are more likely to die from potentially avoidable causes than women, with about 28 per cent dying from avoidable conditions compared with 17 per cent of women. Lifestyle choices, including smoking, drinking alcohol and eating too much, play a major part in the likelihood of someone developing a terminal illness. The data was released in response to a parliamentary question from Labour's shadow public health minister Luciana Berger, and gave details of the top 10 causes for years of life lost. For example, among men cardiovascular diseases account for 8,075 years lost per 100,000 population. With 22million in the 0-59 years age group, this is the equivalent of 1.772million years lost. The Office for National Statistics found that heart disease was the biggest killer among men aged 0-59 in 2012. It accounted for the loss of 1.7million years which the men would have enjoyed without being taken ill. Christopher Allen, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘These figures are a stark reminder of the way cardiovascular disease can cut short people’s lives, robbing families of their loved ones far too early. ‘What makes this so tragic is that CVD is largely preventable if we take action to prevent it early on.’ “Conditions like coronary heart disease and stroke don’t just happen later on in life, they can affect anyone at any age, so the sooner you make more positive changes to your lifestyle the better. “Keeping physically active, following a healthy diet, and keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol in check can all help towards reducing your risk of developing CVD. Those aged 40-74 in England can also take advantage of their free NHS health checks, which encompass not only CVD, but diabetes, dementia and kidney disease.” Some 23 per cent of all deaths were the result of avoidable causes, with rates highest in Wales and the North East of England. From 2001 and 2006, heart disease was the single biggest cause of avoidable deaths, but since 2007 cancers and non-cancerous abnormal tissue growths have taken over as the leading cause. Just over 1.76 million years were also lost as a result of 'intentional injuries', which includes murder and suicide, and 1.75 million were lost to cancer. A further 1.68million years were wiped out by road accidents and accidental injuries, 944,000 linked to alcohol and drugs, and 188,000 from lung diseases and flu. Among women, cancer was the biggest cause of preventable loss of years, erasing 3million years when they died early. Labour's shadow public health minister Luciana Berger urged the government to 'get to grips with the scale of this challenge' Intentional injuries resulted in 705,146 years being lost, heart disease 695,00 years and road accidents and accidental injuries 692,000. Miss Berger said: 'These figures reveal the startling numbers of years of life that are lost from people dying before their time. This is a tragic waste of human potential. 'It is highly regrettable that the Government has chosen to prioritise a costly and unwanted reorganisation of the NHS. 'Ministers must urgently get to grips with the scale of this challenge. Public health must be a real priority.' More than 1.6million years were lost as a result of lives cut short by drink and drinks. Simon Antrobus, chief executive of drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction, said: ‘What these figures show is that too many people are dying because of the devastating effects of drug and alcohol addiction. ‘Lives are being destroyed because we are failing to recognise and confront these problems especially when those addicts do not conform to certain stereotypes. ‘Drug and alcohol abuse can literally affect anyone at any time - you don’t have to be young or famous.’ Addaction has seen a ‘significant jump’ in middle-aged women who are accessing help to beat alcohol problems in the last three years. ‘We desperately need a more evidence based approach to treating people. This means targeting not just the individual addict but their families, to ensure they get the professional and pastoral support they need to get clean or sober. ‘Tackling these problems will not just reduce the appalling waste of human life, but will help to slash Britain’s £40 billion addiction cost.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Whilst it is great news that fewer people are dying from avoidable causes, there is still more to do so that everyone has the same opportunity to lead a healthy life. ‘We want to be among the best in Europe at reducing premature mortality and ensuring people live not only longer, but well. ‘Excellent work is going on right across the country to meet the challenges our five biggest killer diseases bring. ‘We are supporting this work nationally and working with the NHS and Public Health England to identify health issues early on, target resources and make every contact with the health service count.’","Data calculates how long people would have lived if illness was prevented .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain is ready to offer logistical support for the US to launch airstrikes against insurgents in Iraq, it emerged today. Ministers have made clear the UK will provide repairs, spares and technical back-up if Barack Obama orders military intervention to target the extremist militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis). It came amid reports the Cabinet is divided over to extent to which Britain should become involved in any action, with public anger still running high about the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. A US B52 bomber takes off from RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire after the start of the Iraq war in 2003 . President Obama says he is prepared to take 'targeted and precise' action in Iraq, and up to 300 military advisers to help train and advise Iraqi forces will be deployed to the country. Last week Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the UK would not stand in the way of action that is ‘well-judged and well-targeted’. More detail has now emerged about the type of support which could be provided. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith 'we have got to do what we can' to support the in any action it takes. In practice this is likely to mean supply and maintenance of aircraft, and could see US planes taking off from British bases . Mr Duncan Smith, Tory leader at the time of the Iraq War, said: 'We have to do what we can to support the Americans. 'The Government has said it's not going to be doing any airstrikes or putting soldiers into Iraq but I think there are lots of other things we can do to help support them - make sure they get the right spare parts and support in maintaining those kind of aircraft and equipment and also support the Americans where they need it in terms of supply, et cetera.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Britain will 'do what we can' to support the Americans . Asked if British bases could be used, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that an 'awful lot of Iraq' was not being run by Isis, indicating that bases in that country could be used. But he added: 'The Government's position has been quite clearly that we will do what we can to support what the Americans want to do in terms of this. We are not going to be, as I understand it, joining them. 'But what we will be doing is helping the Iraqi government and helping the Americans to stabilise the situation. 'We should be in no doubt that Isis are a really nasty, brutal operation. We have seen some of the dreadful pictures of what they have been doing in the cities and towns that they control.' The Sunday Times reported that there was a split within the Government over how much support the UK should be prepared to offer Mr Obama if he does decide to launch airstrikes.

Yesterday they captured Rutbal, Qaim, Rawa and Anah, bringing them within striking distance of the Haditha dam (left). Meanwhile government forces have been amassing in Baghdad (right) The newspaper said opposition to providing support for the airstrikes was led by veteran Tory minister Ken Clarke, backed by Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi, Commons Leader Andrew Lansley and Liberal Democrat ministers. The report said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told the cabinet Britain should keep open the option of backing US airstrikes and in the National Security Council made clear he thinks the UK should 'absolutely be doing anything the US asks'. The chancellor George Osborne warned the Cabinet that Britain's interests are at stake because the conflict could drive up oil prices - an intervention seen by his colleagues as evidence that he wants all options on the table. Their position is supported by Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, the newspaper reported. Mr Duncan Smith said: 'If Isis was to eventually take over Iraq that could cause complete chaos in the Middle East, that would affect us even indirectly in terms of the cost of running our country, the West would suffer dramatically, that's the shallowest part of it. 'The reality is it's a very dangerous situation.'","UK will not take part in military action but offers Obama logistical support .

"By . Jonathan Petre . University students are spending six hours a day or more on social networking sites, looking at YouTube or sending text messages to friends, according  to new research. The findings come as academics complain they are having to expel students from their lectures for not paying attention. The survey, by accommodation providers Unite Student, found that 75 per cent of undergraduates spend between half an hour and two hours a day on Facebook or Twitter, with one in ten poring over the sites for at least three hours.

And officers did a double-take when the driver and passenger stepped out, both dressed as the comic book superhero in blue costumes - with Superman's iconic 'S' logo printed on their chests. After stopping the car on Saturday night, Central Motorway Police Group tweeted: 'Even Superman needs insurance. We don't work for Lex Luthor, but we had to remove Superman's wheels from the road.' Images of the two not-so superheroes soon spread across the globe. The Oklahoma County Sheriff tweeted his West Midlands counterparts: 'Nice work! Not even Superman has a chance against police Kryptonite. He's much better at flying than driving, anyway. Stay Safe.' The comment brought a swift response from the British officers: 'Great to have our American colleagues following us. Stay safe out there.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Drivers are to be given an extra time to avoid getting hit by fines when their parking ticket runs out. Traffic wardens have been told to allow up to 10 minutes ‘grace’ after a ticket has expired before slapping a penalty notice on windscreens. The new rules are aimed at curbing over-draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists, with CCTV cars banned from enforcing rules on on-street parking. Traffic wardens  will be told to allow an extra 10 minutes for drivers to return to their cars before slapping a penalty on the windscree . The announcement marks a new front in ministers’ pledge to end the war on the motorist. Many drivers complain of returning to their moments after their ticket has run out to find an over-zealous traffic warden has already hit them with a fine. Critics say concerns about penalties for parking could be forcing some people to abandon town centres in favour of out-of-town complexes where parking is often free. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Popping to the shops should be simple and pain free. ‘Slapping people with hefty fines is akin to criminalising shoppers and makes high streets or parades no-go zones for drivers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles accused town halls of 'criminalising shoppers' ‘By making 10-minute grace periods mandatory we can bring common sense back to parking on the high street and ease every traffic warden's finger off the ticket trigger.’ The rules are expected to come into effect in the autumn, and will mean that a driver who pays to park for an hour will effectively have up to 70 minutes before they will be fined. The AA welcomed the move to limit the ‘ticketing on an industrial scale’ which has hammered hard-pressed motorists. Ministers have also ordered an end to the use of CCTV spy cars to enforce on-street parking. Official figures show councils which use CCTV cameras to enforce parking rules raise £49.35 per household each year, compared with £5.69 per household in council areas which do not have them. The Local Government Association has heavily criticised government plans to ban the use of CCTV cameras, with parking wardens only allowed to film if vehicles break the rules. But Mr Pickles said: ‘CCTV spy cars can be seen lurking on every street raking in cash for greedy councils and breaking the rules that clearly state that fines should not be used to generate profit for town halls. 'Over-zealous parking enforcement and unreasonable stealth fines by post undermine the high street, push up the cost of living and cost local authorities more in the long term. 'Today the Government is taking urgently needed action to ban this clear abuse of CCTV, which should be used to catch criminals, and not as a cash cow.' If drivers are unable to buy a ticket because meters are out of order they will no longer be fined. Controversial CCTV spy cars will also be banned from being used to target parked cars on an 'industrial scale' There will be a new right for local people to demand a review of charges and yellow lines in their area. Parking penalty charges will also be frozen until the election. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'These measures will deliver a fairer deal for motorists, ensuring that parking enforcement is proportionate, that school children are protected and buses can move freely, and that key routes are kept clear.'","A period of grace to be given for motorists to return to their parked cars .

"By . Martin Beckford . A police scientist has been awarded almost half a million pounds in compensation after he was left distressed by handling dead bodies after the Asian tsunami a decade ago. The forensics expert helped identify some of the 230,000 victims of the disaster that engulfed Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand in 2004. He developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to the UK. He felt let down by the police quango that employed him for not providing him with counselling after his harrowing experience. Sri Lankan villagers walk past the ravaged town of Hambantota in the wake of the devastating tsunami . The man, who has not been named, has been on sick leave for much of the intervening decade while pursuing his compensation claim. Now he has received a total of £464,000 as part of a deal that will end his employment contract with the police professional body, now known as the College of Policing. The compensation payment, one of the biggest made to a police worker, was so large that it had to be listed in the Home Office’s annual accounts, published last week. In the section on losses and special payments, it stated: ‘A compensation payment of £464,000 was paid by the College of Policing in respect of an employee who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.’ Phi Phi Island, in Thailand, was one of the many coastal areas to suffer severe devastation in the tsunami . The College of Policing, which replaced the man’s former employers, Centrex and the National Policing Improvement Agency, said: ‘In 2005, the Home Office put together a deployment of policing experts to help in the response to the Sri Lankan tsunami. ‘Following a review of the 2005 deployment the College of Policing recognises that there were matters Centrex could have dealt with better, including post-incident support.’ The forensics expert was one of about 60 police officers and civilian staff from the UK who helped out in the aftermath of the earthquake in the Indian Ocean. It is estimated that more than 230,000 people were killed in the Boxing Day disaster. In total police forces have paid out an estimated £85 million to employees over the past five years. Last year The Mail on Sunday revealed that police officers are routinely paid sums of up to £500 for carrying out ‘outstandingly unpleasant’ tasks such as recovering decomposed bodies from rivers.","Police forensics expert awarded £464,000 in compensation after handling dead bodies in wake of tsunami which ravaged Thailand, Sri Lanka and India .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . When nobleman Sir Nicholas Moseley built Moseley Old Hall in Cheadle, Cheshire, in the 1660s, it was not only the most desirable dwelling in the vicinity – it was pretty much the only one. Miles of open fields stretched out from the house in all directions, dotted with only the odd farm dwelling. Back then, Manchester was a  small weaving town miles away. Fast-forward 400 years and the urban sprawl of Greater Manchester has engulfed what had been countryside right up to the doorstep of this grand old manor house. Manor home: Moseley Old Hall in Cheadle, Cheshire, was built in the 1660s and now stands rather majestically in a cul-de-sac of modern housing . Moseley Old Hall now stands rather majestically in a cul-de-sac of modern housing after what remaining land that belonged to the house was sold by a developer in the early 1980s. The five-bedroom, four-reception room house is now on the market  for £375,000 after its owner, businessman Leon Mazurek, died in 2011. It has been left to his brothers Tad and Jan to sell the property. This, as Tad admits, is not a straightforward task. While Moseley Old Hall may be steeped in history – Bonnie Prince Charlie is believed to have stayed in the house during the Jacobite rebellion of the 1740s – it is not to everyone’s taste. For a start, the house will need a substantial renovation to render it fit for what most would consider modern living. Leon Mazurek not only avoided updating it – he positively revelled in its period charms, keeping its primitive central heating system and filling it with old furniture and artworks. So Tad and Jan have opted to sell this historic property using the modern method – an internet estate agent, emoov.co.uk. ‘It can be difficult selling a house like this as it requires a very niche buyer,’ says Tad. ‘We wanted to spread our net as wide as possible  to find one. Beamed in: Tad Mazurek is selling the 17th Century Grade II listed home on behalf of his dead brothers estate . ‘The trouble with going to a local . estate agent is that everyone around Cheadle knows about this property . as it’s the oldest and possibly the most famous for miles around.’ Russell . Quirk of emoov.co.uk, which launched in 2010 with a grant from Dragons’ Den’s James Caan, believes his company is ideal for vendors such as the . Mazureks. ‘We guarantee extensive coverage both nationally and . internationally so they have certainly spread the net with us in their . search for that niche buyer. ‘The . difference between us and traditional local estate agents is that . properties with us will appear on all of the property-search websites – . Zoopla, Prime Location, Right Move, the lot. Most traditional agents put . their properties on only one and spend the rest of their marketing . money on advertising in local newspapers. What’s more, I can afford  to . spend more on marketing as I don’t have to spend money on high street . premises as traditional agents do – we have two offices to cater for our . entire operation.’ These . lower overheads also offer an attractive bonus for vendors using . emoov.co.uk. Rather  than charging people selling a percentage of the . property’s sale price, emoov charges a flat fee of £395 plus VAT, . whatever the price. Quirk . says the firm recently facilitated the sale of a property in London’s . fashionable Belsize Park for £3.15 million but the vendors paid only . £395 plus VAT. Memories: A marking on the old house from 1663 adds further to the historical feel of the property . There is one drawback – emoov does not send representatives to oversee viewings of properties. The vendors must show prospective buyers around themselves. It does, however, offer mortgage advice, conveyancing referrals and information on the local area around properties for sale. Tad Mazurek is more than happy to do the viewings of Moseley Old Hall. He is particularly keen to point out the features of greatest historical interest, such as the chunky original lock and key in the original timber back door, which he gleefully demonstrates is still in fine working order. Inscriptions dating from the house’s early days in the 1660s on a flagstone in the garden and on an oak beam above the front door also catch the eye. And Tad enthuses about a supposed secret passage from the house to a local church – though neither  he nor his brother has discovered  its whereabouts. Upstairs, via the original solid-oak staircase, Tad points out the only room his brother modernised: the bathroom. But since this work looks likely to have been carried out soon after Leon Mazurek bought the house for £120,000 in 1992, new owners  will probably want this room redecorated first, as it looks simply dated rather than historical. Tad stresses that though the house is Grade II listed, new owners can change anything as long as it does not alter the structure of the property. Certain areas of the ceiling on the upper floor will require immediate attention, and even those wishing  to maintain the historical spirit of  the house will undoubtedly want to modernise the kitchen. With its low ceilings, original oak beams, solid internal doors and leaded windows, Moseley Old Hall will appeal to someone – but they  will have to have a taste for the historical without requiring the services of a traditional estate agent.

And seeing him dressed in a red and white suit, driving a red and white car and living in a red and white house, it is hard not to take notice.
