Sophia, three, and Sadie, two, spent weeks with the help of their mother Maggie Storino replicating the famous moments from 2013's biggest movies.

A mother-of-four was so ashamed by a picture taken of her during a day at the Ascot races that she embarked on a health kick and shed more than 5st in weight. Melody Feldsted, 33, from Slough, saw her weight creep up after the birth of her first child when she was 18. At her heaviest she weighed 16st 3lb and wore size 20 clothes. Today, after slashing her calorie intake by 25 per cent, hitting the gym and quitting cigarettes, her weight is a healthy 10st 11lb and she can fit into size 10 outfits.

Mrs Felstead, a former shop assistant, said: 'I looked at the photo and thought, ""oh my God, that can't be me"". 'I looked overweight and unhealthy. I wondered how I'd allowed myself to get like that, and why anyone had allowed me to go out looking so large. 'I hated the way my legs looked fat, and my face appeared very wide. It was a nice dress and I didn't do it justice at all. I couldn't stand the thought that it had been shared with other people - I asked my friend to take it down.' Mrs Felstead, who is 5ft 6in tall, saw her body shape change after the birth of her sons Jordan, now 15, Bradley, 11, Brendan eight, and Mikey, three. Her weight topped 13st following the birth of her youngest son, and Mrs Felstead saw the pounds pile on rapidly following her decision to quit her 20-a-day smoking habit in January 2011.

She said: 'I wasn't consciously aware of . eating more, but I was gaining weight. I expect my metabolism slowed . down and I was subconsciously substituting cigarettes for snacks. 'I enjoyed biscuits - custard creams, shortbread and Jammie Dodgers. I took me a long time to realise that eating biscuits adds a lot to your daily intake.' As her weight crept up, Melody became more and more self-conscious. 'I . was really embarrassed about the way I looked in a swimsuit - I looked . far too large and unhealthy.

She began going to the gym three times a week, tackling a wide variety of cardiovascular exercises including running and cross training. She also began counting calories, slashing her intake. Within a year she'd lost five stone. She said 'I didn't change the food I was eating - I just made sure I ate sensible portions. I didn't want to make too many drastic changes because I wanted the changes to be sustainable.' Today she typically eats porridge with blueberries or raspberries for breakfast, followed by soup with sliced bread for lunch, and a portion-controlled square meal with her children, such as spaghettibolognese or lasagne.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 28 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 28 February 2014 . President Obama has issued a harsh warning to Russia against intervening in the political turmoil in the Ukraine. He confirmed that the United States is 'deeply concerned' about the presence of Russian military forces in Crimea, solidifying earlier reports that Russian troops had been spotted in the area. 'There will be costs for any military intervention in the Ukraine,' Mr Obama said in an unscheduled press statement Friday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Issuing a warning: President Obama said that the U.S. was 'deeply concerned' about the reports of a Russian military takeover in the Ukrainian town of Crimea . Disapproving: The President said that any Russian military intervention would be 'deeply destabilizing' for the Ukraine and would incur worldwide condemnation . The Ukrainian government accused the Russians on Friday of attempting to over take Crimea amid the country's ongoing political turmoil following fatal protests and the disappearance of their president. Russia has been carefully watched throughout as there are fears that they will try to take over the country amid the turbulence. Mr Obama stressed that the United States has told Russia that they can play a role in the situation but should only have the same type of involvement as all other international players. Under watch: Putin has not confirmed or denied any connection to the troops but they are widely understood to be Russian forces . 'They can be part of an international community's effort...However we are now deeply concerned about reports of military movements taken by Russian forces,' Obama said. 'We have been very clear about one . fundamental principle: the Ukrainian people deserve the right to . determine their own destiny.' 'Any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing. 'It would invite the condemnation of world.' Mr . Obama said that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin two days . ago and Vice President Joe Biden had called Ukraine's acting President . Oleksandr Turchynov today to express America's solidarity with them, . saying that the United States 'supports his government's efforts'. 'Right now the situation remains very fluid... I commend the Ukrainian government's restraint,' Mr Obama said. Throughout . the day Friday, men described as Russian troops deployed at airports . and a coast guard base, giving ominous signs of the Kremlin's iron hand . in Ukraine's confrontation. The . sudden arrival of men in military uniform patrolling key strategic . facilities prompted the Ukraine to accuse Russia of making 'a military . invasion and occupation'. Armed men took control of two airports in the Crimea region on Friday in what Ukraine's government described as an invasion and occupation by Russian forces, stoking tension between Moscow and the West . President Obama's unscheduled press . conference came after American United Nations ambassador Samantha Power . issued her own strong warning, saying the the United States 'calls upon . Russia to pull back the military forces'. 'The United States stands with the Ukrainian people in determining their own government,' Ms Power said. Secretary . of State John Kerry delivered blunt warnings to Moscow against military . moves in Crimea that could further inflame tensions. Kerry and White House spokesman Jay Carney both said any Russian military intervention in Ukraine would be a 'grave mistake'. They did not, however, spell out any consequences for such an intervention. Kerry . said he called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the second . time in two days to press the Kremlin to keep its promise to respect . Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Scary situation: A turbulent political crisis turned even more frantic as the first appearances of masked guards in the Crimean city of Simferopol on Thursday . Questionable: The masked soldiers do not have any identifying insignia but are believed to be Russian in origin, and President Obama confirmed that during his Friday afternoon press conference . Kerry told reporters that Lavrov had once again repeated Russian President Putin's pledge to do just that while also pointing out that Russia has broad interests in Ukraine, including a major naval base in Crimea. But Kerry, in comments that . highlighted Washington's rising suspicion of Moscow, said the U.S. is . watching to see if Russian activity in Crimea 'might be crossing a line . in any way.' He added . that the administration would be 'very careful' in making judgments . about that. Carney echoed Kerry's comments at the White House. 'While . we were told that they are not engaging in any violation of the . sovereignty and do not intend to, I nevertheless made it clear that that . could be misinterpreted at this moment,' Kerry said. Two soldiers stand on top of a Russian armoured personnel carrier as it is parked on a road near Bakhchisarai, in the Crimea . A solider on board a Russian armoured personnel carrier, one of a convoy of up to nine vehicles which was spotted on the move in the Ukraine, around 20 miles from Sebastapol on Friday . 'There are enough tensions that it is important for everybody to be extremely careful not to inflame the situation and not send the wrong messages.' Oleksandr Turchynov, who stepped in as president after Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev last weekend, said the Ukrainian military will fulfill its duty but will not be drawn into provocations. The news comes as the UN Security Council announced it was holding private consultations to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. However, any action by the Security Council is highly unlikely because Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member and can block any enforceable measures. Ukraine's ex-President Yanukovych has made his first public appearance since being ousted, telling a news conference that he was going to fight for his country's future . Rhetoric: Secretary of State John Kerry made his own warning at an earlier Friday press conference . On his way into the meeting, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said 'I have no idea' what could come out of the session. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the private meeting would be about de-escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and guaranteeing Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, Ukraine International Airlines says it has canceled flights to and from the regional capital of Crimea due to the closure of the airspace over the peninsula. The airline said it has canceled flights to and from Simferopol airport on Friday evening and Saturday. British Prime Minster David Cameron said today he is concerned by the situation in Crimea, and it is important that Russia respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. 'We are particularly concerned by the situation in Crimea - every country should respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. 'Russia has made that commitment and it's important that Russia keeps its word. The world will be watching,' he added.","The President confirmed the Russian military forces have moved into the Ukrainian region of Crimea .

Debbie wears: 1965 pink vintage Jean Muir dress and jacket from a selection at williamvintage.com, silver croc courts £460 Gian Marco Lorenzi, studded cuff/bracelet £370 Bijoux de Famille at theboxboutique.com, cat ear sunglasses £425 Anna-Karin Karlsson at theboxboutique.com . She was one of the biggest sex sirens of the 1970s, whose picture adorned the bedroom wall of a generation of teenage boys. And four decades on, Debbie Harry has managed to remain as timeless as one of her chart-topping hits. The 68-year-old Blondie frontwoman appears remarkably unchanged from the days when she was better-known as the Punk Princess because of her eccentric sense of style and wild performances on stage. The star last night became the first-ever woman to win a lifetime achievement prize at the prestigious NME awards in London and used the event to reveal she and her band will be playing Glastonbury this year. And despite approaching her 70th birthday, the star appears to have lost none of her ability to shock, praising the antics of controversial stars such as Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga. The singer said that their often highly sexualised performances were more entertaining than artists who preferred bland stage shows. ‘If you look back, one of my statements early on, in a naïve way, was that “sex sells”, she said. ‘Men in rock bands have been doing it since the get-go and I think it is part of the entertainment world, because you have to present something theatrical. ‘There are bands that just stand there and play and look very dour, but I’ve always admired people like Bowie who create a character and dress flamboyantly. ‘They’re telling a story and I like people who have a strong sense of themselves and their comfort zone, and are not afraid to do what they do. ‘The obvious and best example is Lady Gaga, because she has gone to the extreme. She has sort of taken the Leigh Bowery route with all the fetishy things, her look is so strong and sexual. ‘It’s almost to the point of being scary, but the audience likes to be scared some times.’ 'Sex sells': Blondie singer Miss Harry in 1987 . Frontwoman: Miss Harry with Blondie arriving for the 2014 NME Awards, where she became the first woman to win the lifetime achievement award . Blondie enjoyed phenomenal success in the late 1970s – topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with hits such as Heart Of Glass and Sunday Girl – before splitting for  the first time in 1982, when Harry launched a solo career. The group re-formed in 1996 and reached No 3 in the UK charts with comeback album No Exit. They have been touring on and off ever since. The singer has made no secret of having cosmetic surgery, saying she has previously undergone work to remove sagging skin and jowls on the lower part of her face. Talking about how she manages to keep performing on stage, she told the Daily Mail in an interview at The Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hyde Park ‘Learning to manage your stress is very important. And not letting stress take over your body which is not always easy. And diet and exercise. Success: Miss Harry wears orange trousers £250 and matching orange top £250 by Tibi at Harrods, black sheer mac £750 by Schumaker at Harrods, Dalmatian/white leopard heels £465 Bionda Castana, skull ring £275 and silver black stone ring £179 both Thomas Sabo . Outspoken: Despite approaching her 70th birthday, the star appears to have lost none of her ability to shock, praising the antics of controversial stars such as Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga . ‘Can I throw myself and rolling around on the floor? I don’t really do that anymore. I’ve become interested in having good vocals. Our songs are complicated and it takes a lot of effort and concentration to hit those notes now. ‘I try not to throw that away. I used to throw it away, and heave myself around and get wild. But that had something to do with youthful energy and so on. I suppose my focus changed. I guess there are times when I give way to wild behaviour. ‘I do physical and vocal warm ups before I go on stage. I didn’t do a lot of exercise for a long time but now I find I have too.’ She's got presence! The icon gave photographers a wave as she left BBC Radio 2 on Thursday, while clutching her snakeskin-print handbag . She has previously admitted that she’s . worried about losing her looks– but doesn’t regret having taken the . rock ’n’ roll lifestyle to excess. She . said: ‘As far as ageing goes, it’s rough. It’s hard. I rely on looks a . lot. Women’s calling cards, unfortunately, are based on their looks. ‘But I’m glad I’ve had all the radical experiences in my life. I have a better perspective. ‘I try my best and I really am healthy. I exercise like a fiend and do all that stuff that recovered drug addicts do.’ Blondie’s new album is called Ghosts Of Download.

Troubled: Richie Incognito has been admitted to a psychiatric unit, according to reports . Disgraced former Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito has been involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility following a string of bizarre outbursts, according to reports. Incognito, who has been named as the ringleader of a bullying culture within the Miami Dolphins, went to the facility in Arizona late on Thursday night - just hours after confessing to smashing up his own Ferrari with a baseball bat. TMZ Sports reported that the trip to the unit came after an emotional conversation with a friend, in which they agreed that the stress of the NFL investigation and Incognito's parents' divorce was taking its emotional toll on him. Incognito concluded that he needed help but they realized they were too drunk to drive to the hospital - so called police and asked to be taken there, TMZ reported. But once at the hospital, Incognito reportedly had second thoughts and asked to leave - however, an involuntary commitment order was secured and he is still being held there, awaiting an evaluation. The police would not confirm the latest developments on Friday morning. On Thursday morning, the 30-year-old former linesman reportedly took a baseball bat to his $300,000 car in a fit of rage. When MyFoxPhoenix asked . him about the damages on Thursday, he said: 'Oh that was that was just . me venting, that was self expression, that's a piece of art. Damage: It came just hours after he smashed up his own $330,000 Ferrari with a baseball bat, pictured . 'The happiest day of my life was when I got that car and now the second happiest day will be when I donate it to charity.' Police had gone to Incognito's home in Scottsdale after a neighbor called to report the damage, including dents to the hood and half a baseball bat sticking out from its grill. When . officers arrived, they found Incognito and the car were missing. When . they later called to ask if he wanted to report a crime, he confessed . that he did the damage himself. The attack, first reported by TMZ, is just the latest bizarre outburst by Incognito, who was suspended from the Dolphins on November 3 following allegations that he led a bullying ring that forced tackle Johnathan Martin to leave. On Friday a report was released which named him as the ringleader within the Dolphins' locker room, prompting a Twitter rant from Incognito that he couldn't be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages'. He also criticised former teammate Martin, saying the report would 'bury' the claims against him. However, on Monday and Tuesday night . he returned to the social networking site to 'apologize for acting like a . big baby the last few days'. He added: 'This has all been so much on . me and my family. I just want to play football.' Incognito also changed tack with Martin by calling him his 'brother' and saying 'no hard feelings'. Suspended: Incognito, left, was last week named as the leader of a bullying ring in the Miami Dolphins locker room which targeted fellow player Johnathan Martin, right, a tackle who left the team mid-season . Last week, after a report was published naming Incognito as the figurehead of the alleged bullying ring, Incognito launched into a Twitter rant before apologising to teammates and coaches . Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe. The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults. Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough. Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'","Incognito, who was suspended from the Dolphins last year after being accused of bullying players, was 'admitted to the unit on Thursday night'

Charged: Ryan Quinton, 27 (pictured) has been charged over the death of his new bride on December 30 . The family of a bride killed in a sports car driven by her allegedly intoxicated new husband as they left the wedding reception, are standing by their son-in-law. Ryan Patrick Quinton, 27, has been charged with DUI, first degree vehicular homicide, laying drag, reckless driving, and a failure to maintain his lane over the December 29 crash which claimed the life of 25-year-old Kali Shay Dobson. Quinton had a blood-alcohol level of 0.114, well above the legal limit in Georgia of 0.08 for over 21s, when he lost control of the Pontiac Firebird and careened down an embankment on Highway 5 near Old Canton Rd in Georgia. Dobson, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected from the car which landed on top of her. She died at the scene. Now Dobson's family have come out in support of Quinton, saying he like their own child. 'He is my son and a brother to my daughters now and an uncle to my grandbabies. We support him in any way we possibly can,' Dobson's grieving mother, Linda Jordan, told The Marietta Daily Journal. 'We can’t stand to see something happen to him. We’re behind him. Whatever it takes, we’re right there for him.' Jordan said the family had already suffered enough and would struggle to cope with a lengthy court case. 'We shouldn’t have to endure all this, too,' Jordan said. Heartbroken: Linda Jordan (right), the grieving mother of Kali Dobson (left), said she will always back Dobson's groom, Ryan Quinton .

Chris Thomas told Channel 2 that he was driving along Ball Ground Highway when he spotted Quinton wearing a shredded tuxedo and stumbling along the road. 'His shirt was all torn up and he was . bleeding,' he said. 'He had blood all over his face and blood coming out . of his hands and stuff and just looked bad. And it scared me to death.' He comforted the sobbing man as they waited for emergency responders. He held the Quinton's hands and they prayed together.

A luxury London flat has become one of the most expensively to be sold publicly this year after an anonymous buyer forked out a phenomenal £27million for it. The stunning five-bedroom apartment is in the uber-exclusive One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, and has panoramic views over the Royal park. The flat, which measures 4,200 sq/ft, was sold over the past week to an anonymous buyer for £26.9million - an incredible 165 times the average price achieved in England. Exclusive: London's One Hyde Park development, where a luxury flat has just been sold for a phenomenal £27million - making it one of the most expensive apartments to be sold publicly in the UK this year . It works out at £6,400 per square foot, putting it among the most expensive in the capital. If the typical new house in England - which is 920sq/ft - achieved this sort of price, buyers would be forking out a whopping £5.9million on a home. One Hyde Park, which was built as a joint venture between Christian Candy and the former prime minister of Qatar, and interior designed by Candy & Candy, is seen as one of the world’s best apartment blocks. Completed in 2011, it is made up of 86 residential apartments and a number of exclusive shops including Rolex and McLaren Automotive. There is secure parking in the basement and residents have access to a private spa, gym, swimming pool and cinema. The £27million apartment was sold following bidding battle between two parties with London estate agent John Taylor sealing the deal. The formal reception at One Hyde Park: The 4,200 sq/ft flat boasts five bedrooms, all en-suite. The new owner will now have to pay £1.88million to the government in stamp duty, but pay no more than £1,361-a-year in council tax . Even at that whopping price, it is unlikely to even be close to the most expensive sale of a residential property in London this year. Most high-value central London properties change hands in private deals between publicity-shy tycoons. And the flat is by no means the most expensive in One Hyde Park. In May it was revealed that another apartment in the same development was up for sale with an asking price of £65million - a price only the world's richest could afford. That flat was also five bedrooms but is almost twice as large, with a floor space of 9,000sq/ft. The apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of 'pavilion C', on the 8th floor, enjoying some of the city's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property. Panoramic: The spacious living areas of this £65million flat in the same block have views across Hyde Park on one side and across Knightsbridge on the other . Opulent: The luxury sitting room has been created by the Candy & Candy interior design team . Airy: The 8th floor living space has views over the treetops of London's Hyde Park . Comfort: With three reception rooms, there is no shortage of places for the eventual buyer of the apartment to entertain . Subtle decor: The interior of the flat is decorated in muted tones .

A Florida man who told of how he managed to pry himself free from the clutches of a large bear after he was attacked in his front yard, has been found to be lying. Josh Hennessy, 36, claimed he was sitting on a folding chair under an awning outside his father's trailer in the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento on Thursday when he heard a rustling in the bushes and a bear chased him. It has now emerged that the story about as real as Goldilocks and what happened to Mr Hennesey was that he chased the bear, tripped and then fell. Josh tosh: Hennessy explained orignally during a TV interview how he managed to escape a bear that attacked him at the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento . Hennessey suffered cuts and scrapes on his hand, arm, hip and leg, but this was from falling rather than being attacked by a bear . Photos of Josh Hennessy's 'injuries' were posted on Facebook by his wife Courtney Allstead-Hennessy . The attack would have been the second in Central Florida since December . Hennessy claims this to be a bite mark from the bear that attacked him. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission say that it's not true . Spike in bear-nuisance complaints: Florida's bear hotline had 6,700 complaints in 2013 - the most ever. Seen here is a black bear spotted in the backyard of a home in Holly Hills, Florida . '(I) kind of looked over (and) thought it was somebody walking through the yard (and) I just wanted to go over and see who it was real quick because I don't really like people in the yard. 'As soon as I got into the dark, he just came out at me.  It was a black bear, so I didn't see it until he was there.' Hennessey said he wrestled the bear, which dragged him out into the street but neighbours poured doubt over his story from the moment he had spoken, and Florida Fish and Wildlife officials agree . 'His injuries last night did not come from a bear...Mr. Hennessy saw a bear, chased it up the paved road, during the chase he fell in the road,' Greg Workman, Florida Fish and Wildlife spokesman, said. Neighbors said they have seen the bear in the neighborhood and have never had any issues. 'It seems very minor to me,' said neighbor Joe Frost. 'Bears don't attack us, bears eat our trash.' Neighbor Melody Beard didn't think anything of the bears in the neighborhood, either. 'We don't bother the bears and they don't bother us,' Beard said. A brief examination of Mr Hennessey's wounds show that the grazes and cuts he received were consistent with tripping and falling rather than being chased by a grizzly bear. His wife, Courtney Allstead-Hennessy, 33, posted photos of the injuries on her Facebook page although no reference has been made to the made to the fact that the story was not as dramatic as first portrayed. Scene: Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento, Florida . Hennessy says he was sitting on this porch when the bear appeared . 'It's bull. It's phony. It's fake,' said Phillip Sulatycki, 36, who lives on the street behind Hennessy to the Orlando Sentinel. 'Anybody who has lived here in this park as long as I have, which is 15 years, knows the bears don't attack nobody. You drive up by them, they run. I literally come out my door at 1:30 in the morning to get in my car to go to work and, if the bear's sitting there, he's just looking at you. If he does anything, he just grunts.' Ninety-nine percent of the conflicts reported in the last 32 years do not involve human contact, according to officials. Josh Hennessy, 36, had only been living with his father for one month at the mobile home park before he chased a bear, tripped and fell - then lied about his encounter . There has been a spike in bear-nuisance complaints in Central Florida recently. Wildlife officials have asked to Florida state legislature for more money to tackle the problem. Florida's bear hotline had 6,700 complaints in 2013, the most ever. The majority of them came from Central Florida. Bears have been spotted in or near Apopka, Lake Mary, Umatilla, DeLand and DeBary. Shy by nature, they have become bolder in neighborhoods where they have found trash, pet food and birdseed to eat.","Josh Hennessy, 36, was sitting on the porch of a mobile home in Oak Springs, Sorrento, about 9.30pm Thursday .

The Montana newlywed who dropped off a cliff 'face first' indicates his wife pushed him 'with two hands,' according to a new claim by prosecution attorneys. Cody Johnson died just eight days after he and Jordan Graham, 22, got married. Graham claims she is not guilty and will go on trial for murder on Monday. ABC news reports that expert witnesses will be called and jury selection will last one to two weeks. Excited: Cody Johnson's mother testified in court about how her son was excited to marry Jordan . Graham holds to her story and her attorney claims that Johnson fell by accident during a physical altercation. The argument allegedly started because Graham was having second thoughts about the marriage. Graham's federal public defenders will ask jurors to believe that while Graham thought she married too young, she loved Johnson and was only trying to remove his hand from her arm when he fell off the steep cliff. Prosecutors say that Graham's lack of cooperation with investigators indicates she may be hiding the truth. Documents collected by federal prosecutors also describe an email from a person named 'Tony' that said Johnson had fallen to his death and called for an end to the search. Investigators say the message was sent from an account using a computer registered to Graham's father. The prosecution believes that 'Tony' is an identity she faked. Explain herself: Jordan, seen here at an October court appearance, will be faced with the task of explaining her bizarre behavior in the days after her husband's death when she lied to family, friends and the police . Friends say that Graham cried uncontrollably on the day of the wedding . 'One of the police theories is that the new bride ""snapped"" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer. The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed. 'Prosecutors have to prove that she intended to kill him that this was not an accident,' legal analyst Ada Pozo told ABC News. Graham left Glacier Park alone and her husband wasn't reported missing until he didn't show up for work . The prosecution argues Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'. As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change. Having first told authorities that her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he died. 'This case is going to come down to whether the jury believes that she really regretted this marriage so much that she just pushed him off the edge literally,' Pozo said. A friend of the accused murderer told the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea of marriage than actually being married. 'She loved picking the wedding dress and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she sobbed uncontrollably.' The defense will try to make Graham's lifestyle seem 'reckless.' Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened,.' Graham cryptically told authorities that Johnson's body was a place he wanted to see 'before he died'","Jordan Linn Graham and Cody Lee Johnson were married only eight days before the couple had a fight resulting in Johnson's death .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:50 EST, 26 February 2014 . General Motors has doubled the number of small cars it is recalling and brought the total up to 1.6 million cars after announcing the new additions on Tuesday. Now up to six different models have been recalled because a faulty ignition switch used in the cars has been linked to multiple fatal crashes. Just two weeks ago, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. It has now added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts, Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars. Danger on the road: Saturn Ion compacts made between 2003 and 2007 (this model is from 2004) have been added to the list of recalled GM cars due to a faulty ignition switch that has been linked to 13 fatal crashes . Adding to the list: Now 1.6 million cars have been recalled including Pontiac Solstice models from 2006 (pictured left) and 2007, as well as Chevrolet HHRs from the same period (a 2006 model at right) The company was immediately lambasted by a well-known safety advocate who says GM knew of the problem for years and waited too long to recall the cars even though people were killed because of the problem. GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags. The problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front-seat deaths. In the fatalities, the air bags did not inflate, but the engines did not shut off in all cases, GM said. It was unclear whether the ignition switches caused the crashes, or whether people died because the air bags didn't inflate. Glaring problem: In the report that they filed in issuing the recall, GM noted that they first discovered a problem with the ignition switch in 2004 in cars like the Chevroley Cobalt SS (the 2005 model shown) The vehicles being recalled include: Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s from the 2005 through 2007 model years; Saturn Ion compacts from 2003 through 2007; and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007. Most of the cars were sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. According to a chronology of events that GM filed Monday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company knew of the problem as early as 2004, and was told of at least one fatal crash in March of 2007. GM issued service bulletins in 2005 and 2006 telling dealers how to fix the problem with a key insert, and advising them to tell customers not to dangle too many items from their key chains. That warning was not widely heeded, however, as the company's records showed that only 474 vehicle owners got the key inserts. GM thought the service bulletin was sufficient because the car's steering and brakes were operable even after the engines lost power, according to the chronology. Threatening: The company issued a notice about the problem but less than 500 drivers came in to have it checked, and 31 subsequent crashes occurred (including in models of Saturn Sky like this 2007 one) By the end of 2007, GM knew of 10 cases in which Cobalts were in front-end crashes where the air bags didn't inflate, the chronology said. In 2005, GM initially approved an engineer's plan to redesign the ignition switch, but the change was 'later canceled,' according to the chronology. 'They knew by 2007 they had 10 incidents where the air bag didn't deploy in this type of crash,' said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the consumer advocacy group Center for Auto Safety. 'This is a case where both GM and NHTSA should be held accountable for doing a recall no later than the spring of 2007.' GM North American President Alan Batey said in a statement that the process to examine the problem 'was not as robust' as it should have been and said the GM of today would behave differently. Addressing the issue: Now, because the faulty switch is in so many cars, more than 1.6 cars are effected (including 2005 models of the Chevrolet Cobalt) 'We will take an unflinching look at what happened and apply lessons learned here to improve going forward,' he said. GM spokesman Alan Adler said that initially the rate of problems per 1,000 vehicles was low, so the company did not recall the cars. NHTSA issued a statement that didn't address why the recall wasn't done sooner. The statement said the agency is communicating with GM about how long it took to identify the safety problem, but didn't specify if any action would be taken. Dealers will replace the ignition switch for free, but Adler said it will take some time for the parts to be manufactured and sent to dealers. No time frame was given for making the repairs. 'We are deeply sorry and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can,' Batey said.","Six different Chevrolet, Saturn and Pontiac car models have been recalled .

Victims of the Asiana Airlines plane crash suffered severe road rash, suggesting they were dragged as the aircraft smashed into the ground, doctors have revealed. At a press conference on Sunday morning, Dr Margaret Knudson, the chief of surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, listed the devastating injuries the victims suffered, from head trauma, paralysis, broken spines, abdominal injuries and inhalation issues from the thick smoke. She said that some of the passengers had also suffered chest injuries, likely from seats in front smacking into them on impact. Surprisingly, the patients did not suffer any severe burns, she said. More than 180 passengers were treated at local hospitals after the Boeing 777 crash landed on Saturday morning, severing its tail and bursting into flames. The list of the injuries gives further insight into the terror the passengers endured as the plane smashed to the ground. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Dr Margaret Knudson, chief of surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, has revealed that the victims of the Asiana Airlines plane crash suffered head trauma, paralysis and broken spines . At the press conference, Dr Knudson said San Francisco General treated 27 adults and 26 children from the crash. Of the 19 still at the hospital, six remain in critical condition, including one child. 'A couple have severe road rash, suggesting that they were dragged over something,' she said, adding that these injuries were 'everywhere - the back, extremities, face'. 'It's like an injury from a motorcycle crash when someone is not wearing leathers,' she said. 'We don't know how they got it but we were a little surprised to see it.' The passengers treated at the hospital had all been sitting in the back of the plane when it crashed into the ground and came to a standstill just off the runway, she said. Most are now conscious. She said that not all of the unconscious . patients have been identified, and hospital staff suspect that two . stewardesses could be among them. Survivors: Passengers arrive at San Francisco General Hospital on Saturday after the crash landing . Lucky escape: Passengers are pictured outside San Francisco General, where six victims are still critical . One female patient told Dr Knudson that she had seen seats in front of her crash into her chest. She had been unable to move as she was restrained by a seatbelt. But the doctor dismissed suggestions that the victims would have avoided chest injuries if they had not been wearing their belts, saying: 'If you were thrown out, you certainly would be worse [off].' Those in critical condition suffered head trauma and severe abdominal injuries and one will require further surgery on Monday, she said. Dr Knudson praised the quick response of her team as well as the triage staff on site, saying they promptly sent the most critical patients to the hospital. 'Two of them would likely not have survived' without this quick thinking, she said. 'This is the largest [incident] I've been involved with,' added Dr Knudson, who served with Air Force medical staff in Iraq in 2008. 'We were really well organized and everyone did their job perfectly.' Destruction: Miraculously, more than 300 passengers aboard the plane survived the horrific crash . Crash site: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 at the San Francisco International Airport on Saturday . Victims were rushed to hospitals after the Boeing 777 from Seoul, South Korea to San Fransisco crashed landed on arrival in California. Investigations are now underway to determine what caused the plane to crash. The president of Asiana Airlines said it did not appear an engine fault was to blame. Passengers have said that they believe the plane was too low when it approached the runway, suggesting that the aircraft smashed into the sea wall dividing the airport from the bay. Passengers have described how police officers . threw utility knives up to crew members inside the burning wreckage so . they could cut away passengers' seat belts. Horrifying pictures taken by survivors showed passengers jumping down emergency . slides and hurrying away. Thick smoke then billowed from the fuselage, . and TV footage later showed the aircraft gutted and blackened by fire, . with much of its roof gone. Investigation: Officials have not concluded what caused the crash and a probe could take months. Pictured, NTSB investigators conduct their first site assessment of the plane on Saturday . Two Chinese school girls, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, died in the crash and their bodies were found on the runway. They were part of a group of 29 students and five teachers who had set off from Jiangshan Middle School - a highly competitive school in Zhejiang in eastern China. Remarkably, the remaining 305 people on board survived but more than 180 people suffered injuries. The others escaped physically unscathed. 'I was near the plane and took a look inside,' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said on Sunday. 'It was nothing short of a miracle that we had literally 123 people walk away from this.'","Doctors from San Francisco General Hospital said six victims - including one child - are still in critical condition after Saturday's crash .

One person's trash really is another person's treasure in Brazil, where a group of garbage collectors are making spectacular art out of landfill. The catadores, as they're known, of the ASMARE cooperative in the city of Belo Horizonte spend their days sifting through piles of old, discarded material. With the help of local artists and volunteers, they then transform the junk they find into furniture, jewelry or works of art. Trash to treasure: A catadore sifts through the trash at the Jardin Gramacho landfill site in Rio de Janeiro . Jewels: The necklace and earring combination, . left, has been fashioned from disused lighting and wire while the one . pictured right uses artificial roses . 'I have two jobs,' collector Edimar Ferreira, 39, told CNN in its documentary On the Road to Brazil. 'I go and collect the trash and then I transform it into art. I make small sofas, wooden benches, tables, and other plastic adornments.' He added: 'We have a phrase: 'o seu lixo e o meu luxo,' roughly translated as ""your trash is our luxury.""' According to CNN, catadores are a common sight not just in Belo Horizonte but in cities and towns all across Brazil. A 2010 estimate suggested there were . roughly one million catadores in the country though only a small number . are affiliated with a cooperative or organized group. Teamwork: The artists and catadores of the ASMARE cooperative pose together in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte . All sorts: Paper, cans, bottles and other recyclable objects are all turned into art or jewelry and sold . The . people - often formerly homeless or ex-convicts - search for cans, . bottles, metals and other recyclable materials in the street trash. But the living they can earn has dwindled over the years. To help them out, groups like ASMARE teach the workers how to transform the recyclable trash they collect into art or other useful items. All the treasures the trash collectors . create at the organization are sold at a nearby shop and the profits are . divided evenly among the catadores. With . the art sales and their usual income from collecting recyclables, a . catadore affiliated with ASMARE earns around 1,700 Brazilian Reais or . $800 U.S. dollars a month - a respectable wage. Recyclables: Some one million catadores sift through trash for recyclables in cities across Brazil . Homeless: Many of ASMARE's workers are the formerly homeless or ex-convicts . 'The . art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own . carts, and then for the catadores' children to learn how to make crafts . and other art pieces with the material collected,' ASMARE founder and . president Dona Geralda told CNN. Mauricio Soares, an artist who heads the ASMARE creative program, says helping catadores to produce art also encourages other citizens to see them in a more positive light. 'In Brazil the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin,' Soares told CNN. 'Therefore, linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility.' He said the program also promoted recycling and helped people rethink what is trash and what isn't.","The catadores, as they're known, of the .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:56 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:24 EST, 12 January 2014 . Lonely Planet has ignited a furious row after placing Sydney Opera House above the Great Barrier Reef in a top ten list of ten must-see destinations in its latest Australian edition. The decision provoked outcry as the Queensland attraction is on the list of Seven Natural Wonders of the World and one of the richest marine environments on the planet. And there was further grief as a review described ninth-placed the Gold Coast – also in Queensland and a thriving hub of tourist activity - as ‘brash, trashy, hedonistic, and over-hyped’. Taking the top spot: Sydney Opera House is the best attraction in Australia, according to Lonely Planet . Runner up: Queensland's Great Barrier Reef was pushed into second place in the latest edition of the travel guide . 1.Sydney Opera House (NSW) 2, The Great Barrier Reef (QLD) 3. The Museum of Old and New Art (TAS) 4. Uluru (NT, below) 5. Melbourne (VIC) 6. The Daintree (QLD) 7. The Great Ocean Road (VIC) 8. Byron Bay (NSW) 9. Gold Coast (QLD) 10. The food and wine trail (SA) ‘Surfers prefer elsewhere, and paradise has been tragically lost’, the guide claimed. To add to Queenslanders' gripes, the travel guide also claims Cairns Esplanade lagoon is ‘saltwater’ when it is actually chlorinated. Megan Bell, from Cairns dive-operator Quicksilver, told The Cairns Post: ‘We believe that the Great Barrier Reef should be the top destination because it’s the world’s largest living organism, it’s interactive, it’s engaging and it’s a natural icon.’ ‘While the Opera House is beautiful, we have an underwater symphony of thousands of reef fish and corals’. While Queensland might be aggrieved by the top 10, it’s not all bad news, with the capital Brisbane named as country’s coolest city in Lonely Planet’s latest guidebook. Australia government statistics claim two million people visited the Reef in the year ending December 2012, much less than the 8.2 million annual guests of the Sydney Harbour icon. The Opera House, which supports more than 12,000 jobs, was designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon and opened in 1973. Alex Blake of Ocean Hotels and Tourism says it is important to the Cairns region and wider Australian tourism that the Great Barrier Reef is duly recognised. 'We need to remind Australians what they have in their backyard ... with tourism returning to strength we need it to be number one to get the word out,' he told The Cairns Post. The full list features three Queensland destinations, two from New South Wales and two from Victoria and one each from South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania. Disappointing: However, the guide was scathing about Surfers Paradise and its attractions .","Great Barrier Reef comes in second while Uluru only makes it to fourth .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:22 EST, 8 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 9 December 2013 . Witnesses have told how a Utah . man who was allegedly attempting to cover up the murder of his wife . kissed her head, rubbed her feet and wondered aloud why she . would shave her legs when she was planning to kill herself as she lay dying. During the first day . of a preliminary hearing for Conrad Truman, 31 - an Orem man charged . with murdering his wife Heidy in September 2012 in order to claim her . life insurance policy - a court heard how Truman came up with . multiple explanations and narratives regarding the death of his spouse . as part of a botched cover-up. Truman . has been charged with first-degree murder and obstruction of justice, . with prosecutors alleging he murdered his 26-year-old wife so as to . receive more than $878,000 from her death. Police say Conrad Truman, 31, killed his 25-year-old wife Heidy on September 31, 2012, at their home in Orem, Utah, and then told several inconsistent stories about what had happened to her . Orem . Police Cpl. William Crook was on patrol the night of Sept. 30, 2012, . and was dispatched to 220 S. 1180 West on reports of a shootin, according to KSL Utah. He said he arrived at the home to find . Conrad Truman in the doorway, screaming for help, with blood on his . hands and some of his clothes. He . followed Truman up a set of stairs to the kitchen and saw a woman . laying face down, bleeding due to an apparent gunshot wound. 'It was clear (the blood) was coming from her head,' he said. In a 911 call played in court, Truman was sobbing and hysterical, yelling incoherently. Crook described Truman as 'irate and agitated' when they arrived. 'He was yelling,' Crook said. 'He was yelling to save her, he was yelling at her to stay alive, that sort of thing.' Tragic: Police say Conrad Truman pressed a pistol against his wife Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in their suburban Utah home. She was 26 . Paramedics arrived and police told Truman to step aside so they could treat Heidy Truman. 'He immediately just became irate, disorderly, threatening, just totally out of the norm,' Crook testified. 'He threatened to kill me and everybody I know if I didn't save Heidy.' Crook said Truman told him he and his wife had been drinking and got into an argument. Truman said his wife had gone to take a shower and that he had tried to go in, but was sent away. He told Crook that he then heard a pop. 'At . one point, he did say that he thought a bullet must have come through . the wall, through the sheet rock on the outside,' Crook said. Truman was arrested during a traffic stop in July after police received a warrant for his arrest following an extensive investigation . Heidy had life insurance policies totaling more than $878,000 at the time of her death - with all of the money payable to her husband . Truman said his wife wasn't suicidal . or depressed but couldn't offer a clear timeline or explanation of what . had happened before she was shot. 'Everything he said was just random and out of order - it made no sense,' Crook told the court. Two . guns were found inside the home, including one that Truman yelled at . 'like he was mad at the gun' and another that police spotted underneath a . chair Truman was sitting in. Police began to suspect that the woman's death was not a suicide. 'After . seeing his demeanor, after seeing the second gun, the way things were . playing out, it seemed to me that it was going to be a crime scene,' the . corporal said. Orem Fire . Battalion Chief Russ Sneddon said Truman interfered with the care being . provided to his wife, 'plus the statements he was making was disturbing . and of a threatening nature'. Sneddon said Truman was the first and only person to threaten to kill him in his 17 years as a paramedic. He said Heidy Truman was still breathing, though it was 'labored' when paramedics arrived around 11 p.m. Dr. Edward Leis, Utah's chief deputy medical examiner, said Heidy Truman's . time of death was just after 12:30 a.m. on Oct. 1, 2012. Leis said he determined Heidy Truman was killed due to a gunshot wound to the head and that the manner of death was homicide. The physical evidence alone could have pointed to either a murder or a suicide, but not an accident, Leis said. The gun was apparently fired at a close range. 'The physical findings of the wound were consistent with the (gun) barrel being pressed up to the skin's surface,' Leis said. According to charging documents, Truman told his brother-in-law that a black man had entered the house, and he had seen the man run out just before his wife was shot . A toxicology report showed a blood alcohol level of 0.07, but no drugs in Heidy Truman's system. Orem Police Sgt. Orlando Ruiz said he went to the hospital to interview Conrad Truman and that he asked the man what happened. Truman said the couple had watched TV that night and had disagreements about various things, but no real arguments. But . Ruiz said Truman also proclaimed that if someone killed his wife, he . would kill them and that he couldn't understand if it was a suicide. At one point, Truman also said he wanted to shoot himself. Heidy Truman's mother, Janet Wagner, testified that her daughter was never suicidal, never even had suicidal thoughts. She said Heidy Truman had just bought a new, expensive car and that they had planned a trip for their birthdays. Utah Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Edward Leis testifies at Conrad Truman's preliminary hearing in Fourth District Court in Provo, Utah, on Friday . Renee . Flitton, a victim's advocate in the Orem Department of Public Safety, . said Truman told her that his wife had been murdered. He said he had heard someone yelling outside his home prior to the gunshot, and saw a man wandering around and talking to himself. She said Truman had been jittery when she met him at the couple's home, but she got him calm enough to go to the hospital. When they were walking in, she said Truman took her by the arm and said they needed to 'find the killer that shot my wife'. Flitton testified that she was there in the hospital when Truman Conrad hugged his wife's body, told her he loved her and apologized for not protecting her. But minutes later, he asked why his wife would shave her legs before killing herself. According to charging documents, Truman told his brother-in-law that a black man had entered the house, and he had seen the man run out just before his wife was shot. Defense lawyer Ron Yengich questions Orem Police Cpl. William Crook at Conrad Truman's preliminary hearing in Fourth District Court in Provo, Utah, on Friday . Later, Truman allegedly said the shooting was accidental and provided several theories of suicide. 'The inaccuracies of Conrad's multiple stories, the claims of Heidy being murdered, and Conrad seeing a black male run out of his home are blatant examples of Conrad's dishonesty,' the charges state. Truman was charged almost nine months after his wife's death. Police and prosecutors have said money was Truman's 'primary motive' in killing his wife. Several life insurance policies had been taken out for Heidy Truman, and, combined with other benefits, he stood to receive $878,767 in the case of his wife's death, despite her $43,000 annual salary, the charges state. But Truman's family has said the couple were not only happy, but financially secure. At the end of the hearing, which will continue on Dec. 12, Judge Samuel McVey will determine whether there is enough evidence against Truman to order him to stand trial.","Conrad Truman was arrested at a traffic stop in July and charged with the first-degree murder of his wife Heidy, 26 .

After 24 hours the application page had been visited 8,540 times - but just 223 people succeeded in signing up to the list. Council officials apologised on Twitter for the crash, which lasted around 30 minutes.

The list costs £25 to join but successful applicants will have to fork out between £1,100 and £1,800-a-year to rent the huts, often little more than a wooden shed. A council spokeswoman said between 80 and 90 beach huts become available each year and plans to build 79 new huts by 2015 have been given the green light by councillors.

Peter Francis lived a double life for years, infiltrating radical anti-racist groups on behalf of his Special Branch employers. The officer, who claims one of his tasks was to ‘dig dirt’ on the key witness in the Stephen Lawrence case – Duwayne Brooks – says he immersed himself in his work, seducing female members of the groups he joined and even participating in violence. The son of a German mother and a New Zealander father brought up in Norfolk, his parents divorced at the age of 12 and Mr Francis said his childhood left him with ‘a lot of suppressed rage’ and aggression, useful qualities for posing as a left-wing activist. Scroll down for video . Peter Francis lived a double life as he spent years infiltrating radical anti-racists groups . Francis originally wanted to join MI5 but joined Special Branch after four years in uniform . Initially wanting to join MI5, he was told by a teacher he was not ‘posh’ enough – an Oxbridge background was deemed essential. But the career adviser said he might have more success joining Special Branch. To this end, he enrolled with the Met and graduated top of his class from Hendon police college in 1986. Following four years in uniform, he joined Special Branch. His undercover unit was known by colleagues as the ‘hairies’ because they grew long hair and beards to resemble the agitators they targeted. They adopted false identities – acquired by stealing the identities of real people who would have been about the same age but died as children – and were given a flat, vehicles and ‘cover’ jobs to help them blend in. At short notice, Mr Francis was told he would have to pose as a Trotskyite and infiltrate one of the anti-racist groups which had grown in popularity following Stephen Lawrence’s murder. Strangely for someone who was supposed to be keeping a low profile, he was given a big leaving party before his deployment – knowing he would not see his police friends for at least five years. Mr Francis claims his superiors . ordered him to monitor Stephen’s family and even smear the campaign. He . told the Guardian their aim was to calm the growing movement around . Lawrence’s death and ‘stop it in its tracks’. One of his first objectives was to gain the trust of a key anti-fascist leader at London’s Kingsway College. Posing as a dyslexic mature student – he enrolled at the college and quickly made himself known by punching a man who made a racist remark to a dinner lady in the canteen. The leaders of the group were impressed by his zeal and enlisted him to join marches against the BNP. He set out to prove himself to the group, even attacking the police during a weekend demonstration so nobody would suspect he was working as an undercover officer. They were so convinced that they allowed him to take an active part in the violent demonstration against a BNP bookshop in Welling, south-east London just weeks after Stephen Lawrence’s murder. Duwayne Brooks (left), who witnessed the murder of his friend Stephen Lawrence (right), was targeted by Francis during the undercover operation . Mr Francis was on one of the 550 coaches of demonstrators who travelled to the march, and said he turned up prepared to participate in ‘the biggest ruck since the poll tax riots’. Officers decided to pounce when Stephen’s friend Duwayne Brooks, who witnessed the teenager’s fatal stabbing, said he had attended the Welling demonstration. Police started to trawl through footage of the disorder and charged Brooks with criminal damage five months later. The intelligence was their first major breakthrough as they tried to undermine the Stephen Lawrence case because it showed Duwayne was a ‘violent activist’, Mr Francis told Channel 4’s Dispatches. A judge later threw out the case over an abuse of legal process. The trust he managed to gain in Welling allowed him to become the Hackney and Islington branch secretary of Youth Against Racism in Europe – a leading left-wing organisation that acted as a front for some of its more militant members. Francis retired in 2001 and later received an out-of-court settlement from the Met . His rise was partly due to his willingness to take on time-consuming, boring administrative roles. But his involvement was so extensive that he had to be careful he did not end up running the group he was sent to bring down. Mr Francis lived in his cover flat six days a week and rarely saw his wife and two young sons. He immersed himself completely within the group – even sleeping with two members. ‘You can’t be in that world full time for five years and never have a girlfriend or boyfriend,’ he added. ‘People would start to ask questions.’ While sex with activists was considered acceptable, there was an unofficial rule that you must ‘never fall in love’ while undercover. He eventually returned to normal duties in 1997 and was awarded a special commendation for his outstanding performance in a ‘prolonged sensitive operation’. Mr Francis was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He retired in 2001 and later brought legal action against the Met, receiving an out-of-court settlement.","Peter Francis, who worked for Special Branch, went undercover for years .

The NYPD has for the first time released an interactive map that shows all serious crimes committed in the city - confirming the increased danger of living in a poor neighborhood. Enabling New Yorkers to finally see how their street matches up against other boroughs, the map reveals that incidences of the seven major felony crimes - including murder, rape and robbery - are more common in neighborhoods where the average income is lower. New York Police and the city's Information Technology and Telecommunications Department unveiled the new map on Sunday despite the force's insistence that the statistics have been available on their website since 2003. Color coded: The darker the neighborhood precinct the more crime per thousand people is committed. From this map areas of Brookyln, The Bronx and Times Square Manhattan have experienced most violent crime since January . A comparison of this map based on 2010 Census Information and the newly released interactive crime map from the NYPD shows that shootings and murders are more prevalent in poorer neighborhoods of New York . However, despite the notable exception of Times Square, where the majority of crimes are petty robberies, most seriously violent crime occurs in Crown Heights, Harlem and the Bronx. Indeed, last month NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told the New York Daily News, 'Last year, 97 percent of all shooting victims were black or Hispanic and reside in low-income neighborhoods.' However, some lower income neighborhoods in New York do not conform so readily. Sunset Park, Borough Park and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn are relatively safe despite their average lower incomes. Times Square: As expected Time Square is the crime hotspot of NYC - but suffers relatively little violent crime - with the majority of the almost 2,000 crimes reported since January 2013 being robberies . Details: The map can be enlarged to show as near to possible where each crime was reported. Larger circles mean multiple crimes were reported in the vicinity . And despite their reputations, Washington Heights and Inwood in upper Manhattan do appear to be safer than the public would give them credit for. The launch of the map provides felony crime information for this past year, the current year and by next month within the current year. NYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said: 'With unprecedented population levels, New York City is safer than ever, with homicides on pace this year to fall below recent historic lows. 'This administration has relied on data to drive its crime fighting, and this map helps enhance New Yorkers' and researchers' understanding of where felony and violent crime persists.' The public can search basic data on felony crime occurrence by address, Zip Code, or police precinct and displays all recorded crimes at the nearest street or intersection to the reported location. This map shows that large swaths of Brooklyn and all of Staten Island to be areas relatively free from serious crimes . One of the worst neighborhoods for crime in New York is Harlem and this map shows the number of robberies between 1st Jan and Oct 31st this year . Number 1: Manhattan as a whole suffers greater crime than some parts of the other four boroughs . New York City, New York State, USA --- Police officers stand behind police tape on the scene where a New York City traffic police officer was hit and killed by a vehicle in Midtown, New York . Filters can be applied to the map which shows crimes per 1000 residents as a shaded map which is graduated in color to dark where incidences are highest. Commissioner Kelly said the city is safer than ever, but the map helps New Yorkers and researchers understand where major crimes persist. Previously, the only crime data posted online were weekly reports broken down by precinct, but they weren't posted in the form of an interactive map. Before his mayoral election victory, Bill de Blasio had criticized the NYPD for its failure to respond to one-third of freedom of information requests.

The self-confessed Satanic serial killer who claims to have murdered more than 22 people may have kept a record of the slayings. Elizabeth Dean confirmed an ex-boyfriend of daughter Miranda Barbour, 19, gave her a diary he claimed was her's just as the teen appears to have revealed a motive for the supposed killings - revenge. Miranda Barbour told the New York Post from jail that she would have let Troy LaFerrara, 42, of Sudbury, Pennsylvania go had he stopped groping her when she said she told him she was barely 16-years-old - she was molested at age 4. Dean did not deny the horror journal was filled with details on the murders, but stopped short of confirming exactly what was scrawled on its pages. The Craigslist killer: Miranda Barbour says she will kill again if let out from behind bars . 'There are things in here that just can’t be true,' she told the paper. 'Some of this I just don’t believe. 'I don’t believe she has done any of what she is saying, and I don’t know why she is saying all of these things,' Dean continued. The mother also confirmed a claim made by her daughter that she was molested at age 4, saying she immediately went to police and the man was arrested. Revelations of the murder memoir come as Miranda Barbour claims she is confessing to the killings so she remains behind bars. 'I’m saying all this for me, I want to remain in prison,' she insisted. 'I told my lawyer I wanted to plead guilty to this. 'If I get out of here, I’d do it again,' she continued. Still in love: Elytte Barbour gave a different version of events during his own prison interview, but says he's still enamored with his teen bride despite the dozens of killings she has confessed to committing . Her conversations with a reporter from the Daily Item, a local paper, also shined a light on the killer couple's murder plans. She and husband Elytte Barbour decided he would hide in the backseat of her car and jump out when she said 'did you see the stars tonight?' Had LaFerrara backed off and decided against trying any sexual activity with the 'underage' woman, she would have let him go. Hubby did not respond to her two utterances of the phrase, so she had to improvise. 'He still didn’t jump up, so I hit him in the leg and then he popped out.' Victim: Barbour's father said he would hold the hand of his victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara, while watching his daughter get executed. Colleen is pictured with husband Troy on their wedding day in 2011 . Elytte Barbour strangled LaFerrara with an electrical cord while Miranda Barbour stabbed him repeatedly in the chest until he was dead - they carried out the sinister plot on Elytte's 22nd birthday. They dumped his butchered corpse in an alley and went looking for cleaning supplies to clean the blood from her car, she said. 'There was just so much,' said the teen. 'It was everywhere.' The pair then went to a strip club before returning to the crime scene the next day to see police everywhere, . 'I saw all the police and said, ‘Well, I guess they found him,' she recalled. The shocking details come almost two weeks after her husband professed his love for her in an interview with CNN. Elytte Barbour told the network from Columbia County Prison in Pennsylvania that the news hasn't changed the way he feels about Miranda Barbour, 19. Just another family: The killer couple blended inauspiciously into the crowd at a fair last year . 'I still love her,' Barbour said over a secure telephone line from the jail where he's awaiting trial for allegedly luring a man through Craigslist, strangling and stabbing him 20 times with his love, three weeks after they were married. Speaking to CNN Wednesday, heacknowledged, 'Everyone wants to know about her credibility,' but wouldn't comment on whether her confessions were valid. However, he said she was upfront with him in 'about 50/50' of the alleged slayings, with respect to specific names of victims and the locations of the murders. He insisted he'd been cooperating with police so far, adding 'It seems like I have my life or death on the line right now.' The interview comes after his father-in-law Sonny Dean said he would support his daughter's execution if she is found guilty and even hold the hand of the victim's widow as she'd killed. Dean said he believes his teenage daughter may have been involved in one other murder besides the . November 11 fatal stabbing of LaFerrara. But he denied that she has killed 22 people - as she claims - and branded her a 'manipulator.' Police said LaFerrara met Barbour through her Craigslist ad, which offered companionship in exchange for money. Barbour, like the fictitious serial killer Dexter, said she only killed 'bad people.' 'Killer': Miranda Barbour (with a police officer in December) has been involved in more than one murder, her father has claimed. She is also accused of stabbing a man to death after meeting him on Craigslist . Investigators allege Barbour stabbed . LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as her husband, Elytte . Barbour, held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck from the back seat . and then dumped his body in an alley. The . self-confessed teenage serial killer has claimed to have been involved . in a satanic cult and that she had a favorite knife which she added . notches to every time she slayed another victim. Dean told The Daily Item that his daughter was a heroin addict and is a liar and manipulator, but he doesn't think she is a mass murderer. 'Miranda lives in a fantasy world,' he said. Barbour . told The Daily Item last month that she had killed fewer than 100 . people but stopped counting at 22. She said she lured a man into an . alley in Alaska and watched as the leader of a satanic cult to which she . belonged shot the man before telling Barbour it was her turn. 'Believe very little of what Miranda says,' said Dean, of Texas. 'She has a long history of extreme manipulation and dishonesty. Investigation: Miranda Barbour is pictured right in her mug shot and left with her baby son. The father of the child died when her boy was one and authorities are now looking to see if his death was suspicious . 'She is good at manipulating people. She is the most manipulative person I have ever known.' It is possible she participated in a killing in Alaska, he said. He also did not dispute her claim of being a satanist. 'The reason I think that the Alaska incident is a possibility is that Miranda ran away from home at least two times that I remember, both for over a 48-hour period,' he said. 'Once was around the age of 13 and once was sometime the following year, when she was 14. I don't know what took place during either of those 48-hour periods.' Dean also said she had been in and out of treatment centers after she became hooked on heroin, and that she was so persuasive she was able to talk her way out of the centers. 'We couldn't stop it from happening and she was out.' he said. He . said once Miranda became hooked on drugs they refused to let her out of . the house unsupervised - meaning she could not have carried out the . many murders she has claimed. Scene: Miranda Barbour grew up in North Pole, Alaska (pictured), where she said she killed some victims. She later traveled south to North Carolina . Parallels: Like the fictitious serial killer Dexter (pictured), Barbour said she only killed 'bad people' 'Once . all this stuff with drugs started happening we locked our house down,’ he said. ‘She wouldn’t have had the chance to do any of these things she . said.’ Dean said he prays for peace and comfort each morning for LaFerrara's . family, especially the victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara. In . a prepared statement to the family, he said if a jury decides his . daughter should be executed, 'I would stand side by side with you, take . your hand, and silently pray that some good may come of this.' According to a police affidavit, Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing LaFerrara until she and her husband were presented with evidence.

Clutching a brimming glass, at 9.21am yesterday he became the first customer to be poured a pint at a motorway service station pub. Tom, 37, a businessman who declined to give his surname, had stopped off at The Hope and Champion at junction 2 of the M40 to claim the first pint at the controversial pub, which can serve alcohol from 9am. But he confessed that he thought the idea was ‘completely ridiculous’ and did not finish his London Pride beer before driving off. 'I don't normally have a pint at nine in the morning. Scroll down for video . First to the bar: Tom from Beaconsfield was the first customer to have a pint at the pub this morning at 9.21am . 'It is ok for the truckers, the local pubs round here get lots of truckers but I think 9am at a service station is a bit silly,' the businessman said. Road safety charity Brake called service station pubs ‘a dangerous temptation’ for motorists, but many of the first customers dismissed concerns. Mike Murchland, an automotive analyst on his way from Oxford to Heathrow airport for a business flight to Sweden, was first through the door at 5.15am. 'I stopped here because it is a bit different, the services here already has more places than you can eat at in a week but it is nice to sit down and catch up on emails,' he said. 'I don’t have a problem with it being a pub, I think you’d have to be pretty desperate to come to a motorway service station for a drink - I can think of easier places,' said the father-of-two as he enjoyed an alcohol-free breakfast. Sue Higgins, a solicitor also tucking into breakfast, pointed out that shops at the services at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, sold alcohol. ‘I don’t see any problem at all,’ she said. ‘You can buy a drink at all the other . places. This is just more civilised,' adding: 'If people can’t control . their drinking habits that’s there own problem.' Another customer at the pub on the M40 this morning.

In a survey by the RAC, 64 per cent of people opposed pubs in service . stations, but Iain Bruce, a 55-year-old construction worker eating at . The Hope And Champion, noted that there were plenty of pubs on A roads. ‘If there is a group of you travelling and a couple want a pint then that is fine as passengers,’ he said. The . pub, which is owned by the JD Wetherspoon chain, is open from 4am until . 1am seven days a week and is licensed to sell alcohol from 9am. Unlike other Wetherspoons, it does not advertise alcohol drinks promotions at the bar, and displays responsible drinking campaigns in its reception.

"By . Sam Greenhill . PUBLISHED: . 13:05 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:19 EST, 26 June 2013 . A billionaire's wife raided his safe while he was playing golf to find out what he was worth, a court heard yesterday. She never had full access to her secretive husband’s vast wealth and he only gave her ‘an allowance’, it was said. When their relationship broke down and divorce loomed, she opened his safe in search of documents about his finances, the High Court was told. Admission: A judge at the High Court heard that a woman 'illegitimately' looked in her husband's safe while he played golf to gain financial information ahead of their divorce . Yesterday a judge condemned her actions and branded her guilty of a ‘serious breach of candour’. The names of the couple, who have a 26-year-old son, were kept secret on the orders of the judge. But they were described as a family . who ‘enjoyed all the trappings of vast wealth, an international . lifestyle with property in different countries, antique furniture, fine . art, fully staffed households, private jets, boats and yachts’. Their 27-year marriage began to break . down after the wife began an affair, according to the husband, 52. He . then had an affair of his own – and, in 2009, a son with his mistress. The wife, 57, said she believed her . husband could be worth many hundreds of millions of pounds. She said he . had been ‘described in the Press as a “billionaire”,’ and he had . threatened to ‘disappear’, with her getting ‘nothing’, if she divorced . him. In February this year, she won a court order freezing £20million of assets belonging to her husband. Among other things, it prevented him from selling their luxury villa in . Marbella, Spain, bought in 1990 for £800,000 but now worth £10million. But Mr Justice Mostyn said the freezing order was ‘flawed’ because the . wife had neglected to mention that she had broken into her husband’s . safe when she applied for it. High life: A previous ruling that the husband couldn't sell off a property in Marbella, Spain, (pictured) among other assets was discharged by a High Court judge . Ruling: Mr Justice Mostyn QC said the wife had 'seriously breached her duty of candour' by accessing her husband's safe . She had been collecting documents for . ten years, but claimed they had been ‘left lying around’ or had been . ‘ripped up and placed in the rubbish bin’. She said she had also . occasionally removed paperwork from his briefcase and a filing cabinet. But the judge said that was ‘not the whole truth’ and the woman had admitted raiding her husband’s safe. ‘On the occasion in question, [my . husband] was out playing golf,’ the woman had said. ‘He always kept the . key to the safe in his bag. I went into the office, removed the key and . opened the safe. Given his secrecy about financial . issues, I wished to obtain as much information as possible as I . suspected that we would divorce at some stage.’ Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘The failure . by the wife to state in her affidavit in support of her freezing . application that some of the documents derived from her accessing the . husband’s safe was a serious breach of her duty of candour.’ In refusing to renew the ‘draconian’ freezing order, the judge said it was fatally flawed, with the figure of . £20million just ‘plucked out of the air’. He said freezing orders ‘usually poisoned’ such cases, leaving husbands ‘enraged’ and relationships remaining ‘forever soured’. The husband is suing his wife for . damages for breach of confidence and misuse of private information. The . case will be heard first, before divorce proceedings, next January.","A High Court judge heard that the woman had opened the safe 'illegitimately'

Prosecution: Sir Peter Fahy will be charged with health and safety offences over the shooting of Anthony Grainger, the Crown Prosecution Service said today . A knighted chief constable has been charged over the death of an unarmed man who was shot by police officers from within his force. Sir Peter Fahy is accused of health and safety offences after Anthony Grainger, 36, was killed by police marksmen in March 2012. The unarmed man was shot during an operation by Greater Manchester Police to arrest suspected armed robbers. The senior policeman will not appear in the dock himself but is named on the charge sheet as the 'corporation sole' - or human representative - for the force. If the conviction is successful, Greater Manchester Police will face an unlimited fine. Previously, the Metropolitan Police were convicted of health and safety offences after shooting Jean Charles de Menezes dead on the London underground in 2005. They were ordered to pay £175,000 plus legal costs. The marksman who killed Mr Grainger could have faced a charge of murder - but the Crown Prosecution Service . decided a jury would be likely to rule his actions were necessary. The father-of-four was shot after his car was stopped in Culcheth, Cheshire, as part of a pre-planned operation. It . later emerged that the unarmed father of two had earlier been wrongly . suspected of stealing a memory stick containing the names of police . informants. The Mail on . Sunday reported that he and two associates were put under surveillance . in an operation involving nearly 100 officers, and that armed teams were . briefed that he might open fire at police, despite there being no . evidence of him having access to weapons. The IPCC found no vehicles were in Mr Grainger's vehicle at the time. Shot dead: Mr Grainger, a father-of-two, was unarmed when he was killed by a police marksman in March 2012 . Scene: Mr Grainger was shot by police in Culcheth, Cheshire, when his Audi was stopped by officers as part of a pre-planned operation . One . round was discharged by an officer carrying a Heckler and Koch MP5 . carbine and this passed through the car windscreen and struck Mr . Grainger in the chest while he was in the driver’s seat. Two . Hatton rounds were fired into the car’s tyres by an officer carrying a . shotgun to disable the vehicle. The car had been stolen and had false . registration plates. A CS canister was also deployed by hand into the vehicle by one of the firearms team. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: 'We have completed our review of the evidence provided by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in relation to the death of Anthony Grainger. 'After careful consideration we have decided that the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, should be prosecuted as a corporation sole for failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Shooting: Mr Grainger was killed by police in March 2012. Although the force could face a fine, the officer involved will not be prosecuted . 'In addition to every employer’s responsibility towards their employees, the law also imposes a duty to ensure that work is carried out in a way that ensures, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons outside of their employment are not exposed to risk. 'The chief officers of police forces are treated as employers for this purpose. It is alleged that there were serious deficiencies in the preparation for this operation that unnecessarily exposed individuals to risk.' A spokesman added that the officer who fired the fatal shot would be unlikely to be convicted. The CPS said: 'In the circumstances of this case, our assessment of the evidence is that a jury would accept that the officer did believe his actions were necessary and that the level of force used in response to the threat as he perceived it to be was proportionate. 'The basis for the officer’s belief in the necessity of his actions is relevant to the criminal proceedings under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act and it would be inappropriate to publish any further detail at this time. Shot: A bullet hole in the windscreen of a red Audi that police opened fire at in Culcheth, Cheshire . 'There is also insufficient evidence to prosecute the officer for gross negligence manslaughter or misconduct in public office.' GMP could not face a charge of corporate manslaughter because the force had no relevant duty of care towards Mr Grainger. Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: 'Since Mr Grainger’s death 22 months ago, Greater Manchester Police has co-operated fully with the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Crown Prosecution Service and HM Coroner. Our sympathies remain with Mr Grainger’s family and we deeply regret the loss that they have suffered. 'Mr Grainger’s family, and the officers involved, have had to wait a long time for this decision to be reached and we share the frustrations over those delays. 'However, we understand that it was vitally important that the investigation was carried out thoroughly to establish all the facts. 'Now that a charging decision has been made regarding the force itself, it is equally important that these legal processes are allowed to take their course unimpeded in order to seek a resolution for both the family of Mr Grainger and the force. 'The Independent Police Complaints Commission investigated this matter independently and we await the official publication of their report. This matter also remains the subject of an inquest, so Greater Manchester Police is unable to make further comment at this time.' The first hearing will be at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 10. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Greater Manchester Police chief charged with health and safety offences .

But on Thursday there was not much to chuckle about as the stand-up comedian was arrested for public intoxication after passing out on the floor of Caesars Windsor in Ontario, Canada, according to TMZ. The 52-year-old sitcom star, who was given his big TV break by Sandra Bullock, was reportedly put in a 'drunk tank' to sober up though no charges were filed. On Friday the La native offered a funny statement: 'Tied one on last night. Not feeling great this morning. I was trying to sleep it off, unfortunately, it was on the casino floor.' That's George Lopez: The comedian was spotted passed out on the floor of a casino in Canada on Thursday and subsequently arrested for public intoxication . Hard working: The 52-year-old, seen here in September, was at the venue to perform his stand-up act . The Freddie star was seen on his left side with his stomach exposed as his black sweater had pulled up. He was wearing jeans and black shoes. The grey-haired artist almost looked as if he had fallen asleep on the plush gold and purple carpet of the establishment. His legs were slightly parted and his right hand was laid out on the floor near his head. Onlooker Chad Maura had taken a photo of Lopez and posted it to his Twitter account as security looked down on the comatose star. Soon after they had alerted police. Pals: Sandra Bullock, seen here with Lopez in 2010, gave him his start in 2002 when she produced his sitcom . Police told People.com: 'We can confirm that at 11:25 p.m. Windsor police officers received custody of a male from the OPP Casino Enforcement Unit, The male was subsequently released with no charges.' George - who made a fortune from starring in a self-titled sitcom from 2002 to 2007 (which Bullock executive produced) - had performed earlier in the evening before the incident occurred. He is also scheduled to give another performance on Friday evening. George - who hosted a late night show from 2009 to 2011 - has had health problems for over a decade brought on by a genetic condition that has caused his kidneys to deteriorate. His wife Ann donated one of her kidneys to Lopez in 2005 and the transplant worked. In 2010 the couple split and the following year they finalized their divorce. Together they have a daughter, Mayan.

Robert Kennedy was thousands of miles away when his sister Kerry was acquitted of drugged driving this morning since he presented an award at a humanitarian event in Hollywood Thursday night. He was seen cozying up to his actress girlfriend Cheryl Hines at the Unite4: Good humanitarian awards event on Thursday night and the pair happily posed for photos together on the red carpet. The couple started seeing each other since 2012 and their relationship was put under scrutiny after his estranged wife Mary Richardson Kennedy killed herself in May 2012. United front: Robert Kennedy Jr accompanied his girlfriend Cheryl Hines to the Unite4:Humanity event held in Los Angeles on Thursday as the jury was still deliberating in his sister's drugged driving case . Still together: Kennedy and Hines started dating shortly before his estranged wife Mary killed herself in May 2012 and he has since moved to Los Angeles full time to be closer to Hines . Robert has since relocated to California, leaving the family home that belonged to Mary in New York and starting a life together with Hines, 48. The two avoided public events in the wake of his wife's death, but have been seen at a number of ceremonies in recent months. He was at her side when she was awarded her plaque on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last month, and now it was his turn to take the spotlight. Kennedy, who has campaigned for environmental causes for years, was one of the presenters at Thursday night's ceremony. Other side of the country: Robert's sister Kerry Kennedy looked happy as she left the White Plains courtroom on Friday with her mother Ethel by her side . Answering questions: Kennedy thanked her supporters and legal team after the verdict was reached Friday . The event was hosted by Andy Samberg and brought together figures like Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the formal dinner and awards gala on the Sony Pictures Studio lot. 'I would like to thank Variety for coming up with another award because our stiletto heels spend far too many nights during the year in their little silk bags,' joked Louis-Dreyfus, poking fun at the frenzy of events that cluttered the weeks leading up to Hollywood's biggest night on March 2. Louis-Dreyfus received the creative commitment in television award for her work with Heal the Bay, an environmental advocacy non-profit dedicated to making Southern California coasts clean.

Backstage: The trio had a quiet moment during the evening which kicked off one of the biggest weekends in Los Angeles as the Oscars will be held on Sunday . Clinton joked that he was the warm-up act for Sean Penn, who later presented De Niro with the creative commitment in film award and Clear Channel president John Sykes the media social visionary award. Not the only politician: Bill Clinton also spoke at the event and posed for a selfie with Demi Lovato in a relaxed moment . In his address, Clinton mentioned the positive influence of the late Nelson Mandela. Steve Coogan, who starred in the Oscar-nominated 'Philomena,' presented the real Philomena Lee with the everyday hero award. After receiving his honor, De Niro handed 'his partner in crime,' Scorsese, the creative conscience award for his work on film preservation through The Film Foundation. 'Are you kidding,' joked De Niro. 'The creative conscience award? Have you not seen Wolf of Wall Street?' Scorsese said that since his foundation's inception in 1990, around 640 films have been restored and preserved. For her work as a UNICEF ambassador, singer Selena Gomez was awarded the young humanitarian award. She lauded fellow do-gooder, Demi Lovato, who received the evening's young luminary honor, saying, . 'I am so thankful for you for inspiring me every day. We're here at 21 years old using our voice to help this generation, though sometimes I feel like we're the only ones holding down the fort.'

Police outside the apartment of actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman on February 3 in the West Village, New York City following his tragic overdose . According to the New York medical examiner on Friday, acute mixed drug intoxication was the cause of death. One of the drugs found in Hoffman's system was benzodiazepine - a psychoactive drug with sedative and muscle relaxant properties that can be used to treat anxiety disorders. The other prescription drug found in Hoffman's system amphetamine was an 'upper' - such as  Adderall - and can be used to give an enhanced feeling of wakefulness and focus. Mixing the heroin and cocaine together is known as 'speed-balling' and is the same deadly combination that claimed the lives of actors River Phoenix, John Belushi and Chris Farley.

So no wonder they’re pulling out all the stops to look their best on Sunday – no matter what the cost. Manhattan-based dermatologist, Dr David Colbert, whose clients include Michelle Williams, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz, has set up a temporary pre-Oscar beauty clinic in Beverly Hills where actresses can swing by for a 20-minute version of his signature Triad facial. Naomi Watts (left) raves about Dr David Colbert's Triad facials and says it is her 'absolute favourite treatment.' Rachel Weisz (right), Michelle Williams and Heidi Klum are also fans . The famous Triad facial costs between $800-$1,200 (£550-£700), dependent upon the type and strength of chemical peel used and the number of laser pulses performed. The three-part facial, which takes around 30 minutes, combines microdermabrasion (to gently exfoliate), laser toning (to help boost collagen production) and, for the after-glow, lavender flower acid combined with Dr Colbert’s own line of products. Dr Colbert also unveiled his new new Tone Control Facial Discs - individual pads that promise a 'brighter complexion and even out skin tone' The 20-minute version in Los Angeles . already has a raft of celebrity fans: Robin Wright, Emma Stone, Rachel . Weisz, Michelle Williams and Heidi Klum have all booked in for the Triad . this weekend. The treatment claims there is no redness, so you’re red carpet-ready as soon as you leave. 'We offer a mini version of the Triad that’s tailor made for Hollywood’s Oscar red carpet,’ says Dr Colbert. 'It gives immediate results and, most importantly, there’s no downtime.’ Naomi Watts, who will be presenting an Academy Award during this year's ceremony, is a long-time fan of the treatment. ‘It is my absolute favourite treatment,’ she told Pret-a-Reporter magazine. ‘David and I have been friends for many years, nd over the years he has been taking care of my skin.' But the Triad facial is not the only treatment on offer in Beverley Hills . While in town, Dr Colbert is also unveiling two new products: Illumino Body Oil; $100 (£60), and Tone Control Facial Discs, $72 (£43) for 20 discs – individual pads that promise a ‘brighter complexion and even out skin tone.’ The Illumino Body Oil is a spin-off of Dr Colbert’s hottest-selling product Illumino Face Oil. ‘Michelle, Rachel and Naomi all use it under their make-up to give them a glow,’ he says. The body oil is a lighter weight version with hydrating passion fruit, orange and argan oils plus anti-aging retinol. ‘It’s for a sleek look overall and gives a nice healthy glow,’ says Dr Colbert, who added that many of the town’s top actresses will be gifted bottles in their Oscar goodie bags. ‘I think we will see it on some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood on Sunday’s red carpet.’ And you don't need to be a Hollywood star to reap the benefits. Both products are coming to the UK in March, and will be available at Space NK stores and online. Tone Control Facial Discs will be priced at £65, whilst the Illumino Body Oil will be £90.","Manhattan-based dermatologist-to-the-stars has a 'pop up' clinic in LA .

A lottery winner who separated from his wife after scooping a £148million jackpot is in a new relationship with a stable girl 16 years younger than himself, it has been reported. Adrian Bayford is seeing 27 year old horse groomer Samantha Burbidge, who worked at a stable in Thurlow close to Haverhill in Suffolk, where the 43-year-old lives. She is believed to have now quit her job and moved into his five bedroom home after a whirlwind three week relationship. Scroll down for video .

It was also reported that the pair are currently enjoying a holiday at a £500-a-night resort in the Maldives. Miss Burbidge posted a picture on Facebook of her standing on a sun-drenched beach. A friend of the couple told The Sun on Sunday: 'They are like love-struck teenagers. They can barely take their hands off each other.' Mr Bayford split from his wife Gillian, 41, in November and the couple announced that their marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after scooping Britain’s second biggest lottery prize. Mr Bayford – who actually bought the winning EuroMillions ticket – blamed the stresses that their massive jackpot brought for the collapse of their nine-year marriage.

Miss Jarosz, who lives in a terraced home close to Mr Bayford’s new £500,000 property in Haverhill, Suffolk, works as a nightclub bouncer and is thought to have met him while he was on a night out. Mr Bayford told the Mail at the time of the split from his wife: ‘Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful. Things happen. Sometimes in life you have to move on.

Michael Le Vell has admitted to taking cocaine in the weeks leading up to his sex abuse trial because he had reached the 'lowest ebb' of his life. The Coronation Street actor, who was cleared of 12 charges including rape last year, said it was the ‘first time’ he had tried the drug and claimed it was a 'moment of weakness'. Le Vell, 49, who is expected to return to the ITV show this month, said: ‘The first time I ever did cocaine was in the lead up to my trial.’ Scroll down for video . Revelation: Michael Le Vell has revealed he took cocaine in the lead up to his trial, last September . He told the Sunday Mirror: ‘…I had never felt so low – I knew I was innocent but everything was closing in on me and when someone offered them to me, I just agreed.’ The trial saw Le Vell open up about his alcohol consumption, with the actor admitting he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous after developing a habit where he drank up to nine pints every night. He also admitted taking the drug after he was cleared, but said he stopped before returning to play Kevin Webster, the mechanic in the soap. The actor, who tried the substance after a friend offered it, added: ‘I never thought I was the sort of bloke who would like cocaine but it was the moments of weakness when I was at the lowest ebb of my life.’ Le Vell faced a two-year nightmare from the time he was first accused of sex assaults in September 2011 until he was cleared last year. After his first arrest prosecutors said they had dropped the case months later — but in February last year he was charged with a string of historic offences. Last . month, Le Vell reportedly had a showdown with worried family members . after concerns his drinking session were affecting his work, but the actor denied his habit had led to drug-taking. There were claims he would reach a local pub at around 12pm most days and stay there for the afternoon. Cleared: The Coronation Street actor, pictured here after being cleared of all charges, said he never thought he would take drugs . Acting first: Michael has expressed his excitement at returning to the cobbles, back to work at Coronation Street . He had pledged to stop drinking, but friends and relatives said he was 'drinking more'. The show's bosses gave him six months to recover from the trial, and it was alleged they had offered him help to quit the habit. Le Vell, who has played mechanic Kevin on the hit soap since 1983, divorced his wife of 25 years Janette Beverley, who he has two children with, in 2011 after they became estranged. She claimed alcohol turned her husband into a . 'ticking time bomb' and she would be subjected to his frequent outbursts leaving her emotionally exhausted. Last year his ex-girlfriend, Chilean Blanca Fouche, 31, told how the star – who is separated from wife Janette, 48 - left her devastated by jilting her only days after he was cleared of 12 sex abuse charges, including rape. He then grew close to long-term friend Emma Dodd, 28, and spent time with her over Christmas. In January, he met 38-year-old Louise Gibbons after being introduced by friends at a pub and are now said to be in a relationship. On Valentines Day, the pair were pictured sharing a kiss after emerging from a pizza restaurant near his home in Hale, Cheshire. After his arrest, scriptwriters explained . away Le Vell's absence by saying his character was in Germany visiting . his father, but he will return to the screen full time this spring. On his return to the show, he will reportedly aim to rebuild his . relationship with his on-screen ex-wife Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, who has . meanwhile been dating Tim Metcalfe. Stuart Blackburn, Coronation Street’s . executive producer, told The Mirror: ‘I can’t wait to have Michael back – . We were all watching the news for the end of the trial and there were . cheers going up around the set when the result came through. It was just . a sense of relief. ‘The new set is like a fresh new start for Michael, it’s all about the future now.’ A spokesman for ITV said: 'We will be meeting with Michael to discuss this situation.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:27 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 1 March 2014 . Concerns: Evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death . Newly discovered evidence has suggested that a Texas father executed ten years ago for killing his three daughters in an arson attack may have been innocent. Cameron Todd Willingham was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis, that was later discredited, and testimony from a jailhouse informant. But a note found in the case files suggests that the prosecutor may have concealed a deal with the informant, Johnny Webb, who claimed Willingham had confessed to him. Before Willingham was executed in 2004, a prosecutor argued that Webb's testimony was enough to prove his guilt, after the arson analysis was found to be sub-standard. In recent weeks however, lawyers seeking a posthumous pardon for Willingham claim the inmate who provided testimony did so to gain a reduced sentence, the New York Times reported. If that had proved to be the case in the lead up to Willingham's execution, it could have been enough to clear him of guilt. 'It's astonishing that 10 years after Todd Willingham was executed we are still uncovering evidence showing what a grave injustice this case represents,' Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project, which is working on the case, said. Willingham's case has been scrutinized by advocates who argue the state may have executed a wrongfully convicted man. Fire science experts already have refuted much of the methodology used in his case. Webb and the trial prosecutor, John Jackson, have both denied any deal existed during Webb's testimony. Doubt: New evidence suggests Willingham, pictured here with one of his daughters, may have been wrongfully convicted . Crime scene: Willingham was accused of killing his three children in a fire at this house in 1991 . Lawyers from New-York based Innocence Project filed an official request to have Willingham exonerated because of the discredited arson analysis and efforts to cut Webb's sentence. In November, one of the project's lawyers, Bryce Benjet, was going through files when he found a box of photocopies, which included a handwritten note on the inside of the district attorney's folder. The note, which is not dated or signed, allegedly stated that Webb's charges were to be listed as a lighter robbery charge 'based on coop in Willingham'. Mr Benjet described the discovery to the New York Times as a 'rush of excitment', adding: 'This is what we've been looking for.' Mr Scheck . said the case has suggested a weakness in the . justice system. If Webbâ€™s testimony 'was really based on a deal and . misrepresentation, then the system cannot be regulated ... you cannot prevent the execution of an innocent . person [in those circumstances].' Justice: Willingham's cousin, Judy Cavnar, holds up a photo of him playing with one of his children at a press conference in 2006 . Jackson, the prosecutor who later became a state . district judge, has maintained that Webb did not receive leniency. He . told the Associated Press on Friday that he had not seen the note, but . believed it was likely referring to efforts he made to get Webb out of . prison after Willingham's trial due to threats on Webb's safety. 'The . file may certainly reflect that we tried to get sentencing shortened, . but it had nothing to do with any agreement relative to the Willingham . trial,' Jackson said. He said imprisoned members of the Aryan Brotherhood had threatened Webb due to his role in Willingham's conviction. 'We certainly had an interest in not seeing a primary witness in the case killed while he was in prison,' he said. The decision of whether to pardon Willingham will rest with Governor Rick Perry. Willingham's family said if he was pardoned they would not press for damages. His cousin, Patricia Cox, added: 'We're not asking for compensation, we're asking for justice.'","Cameron .

Football star Wayne Rooney has splashed out on Botox treatment after signing a new £300,000-a-week contract, it has been claimed. Plastic surgeons speculated that the Manchester United striker, 28, who has previously had cosmetic surgery to replace his thinning hair, underwent treatment which has prompted a striking change in his appearance. Mr Rooney has appeared in recent television interview with a remarkably smooth forehead, while only a few months ago he had a much more wrinkled brow. Disappearing lines: Wayne Rooney seemed smooth-faced in a recent interview, left, despite his more furrowed appearance in October . Leading surgeons have claimed that the dramatic change in Mr Rooney's appearance between the images in October and his appearance now is 'consistent' with using the controversial treatment. However, a spokesman for Mr Rooney strongly denied the claims. If the claims turn out to be true, Mr Rooney would join male celebrities including music mogul Simon Cowell and Celebrity Big Brother winner Rylan Clark in championing the skin-smoothing product. On the pitch: Mr Rooney is pictured above playing Greek team Olympiacos in the Champions League last week . New contract: The striker has recently signed a £300,000-a-week contract with Manchester United . Taimur Shoaib, of La . Belle Forme clinic in Glasgow, told the Sunday People: 'He's got a nice . youthful, smooth appearance. With his newly-inflated salary, the cost of Botox, the trade name for Botulinum toxin, is unlikely to worry Mr Rooney. With Harley Street clinics offering treatments for £200 a time, just one week's pay could buy 1,500 treatments. The chemical decreases muscle activity in the area it is injected. It effectively paralyses the muscles, which reduces the appearance of wrinkles. Injections tend to be effective for between three and six months. Botox has some non-cosmetic uses, and is used to treat migraines and treat excessive sweating. 'His forehead looks very good. The changes . we see would be consistent with someone having Botox.' Meanwhile . James McDiarmid, from the McDiarmid Hall Cosmetic Surgery Clinic in . Cheltenham, Glocuestershire, said: 'In my opinion he has had Botox to . his frontalis muscles.' Mr Rooney's first cosmetic procedure - the hair transplant, was carried out in 2011. Days after having the operation he tweeted to confirm the £30,000 operation. He said: 'Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not? I'm delighted with the result.' The father-of-two had a follicular transfer in which hairs are moved from donor areas – usually at the back of the head – and then replanted in bald areas. He had previously written about his hair loss in his autobiography. He admitted staring at himself in the mirror and thinking: 'Bloody hell, you're going bald and you're only a young lad.' Mr Rooney's publicists today strongly refuted the Botox claims, telling the MailOnline they are 'total rubbish.'","Manchester Utd striker, 28, had smooth forehead in recent TV appearance .

The former San Diego State running back who mysteriously went missing this week after leaving the NFL Scouting Combine has been found, telling friends he spent days alone in a Florida airport under the instruction of God. Adam Muema, 21, was found Thursday at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, ex-Oklahoma linebacker Corey Nelson confirmed to UT San Diego. The airport is near the athlete performance facility where players spent the past two months training for the NFL. Muema, the fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history, had not been seen or heard from since Sunday, when he left training saying that Lord had told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy. Found: Former San Diego State running back Adam Muema, 21, had not been seen since leaving the NFL Scouting Combine on Sunday. He was located on Thursday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport . Adam Muema has previously said that he speaks to God through numbers and that the Lord told him to leave the combine on Sunday for the benefit of his career . Adam Muema landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Monday afternoon. He is believed to have stayed there until Thursday, according to friend and fellow NFL star Corey Nelson . He said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team. He then failed to show up in Florida. Now it has emerged Muema had spent three nights in the Florida airport. His Southwest flight had landed at 1.30pm Monday. Muema made contact with Nelson on Thursday and asked him for a ride. When Nelson arrived, he said Muema was still dressed in NFL-issued combine gear. When asked to describe Muema’s demeanor on Thursday, Nelson said the running back seemed 'focused, cheerful and very wise'. 'He said he was at the airport for three days straight,' Nelson said. 'He was telling me when I picked him up that God told him to stay at the airport and don’t do anything. Just stay there. That’s what he did for three days straight. 'On the fourth day, he told me he couldn’t do it anymore. He decided to call me.' Muema apparently tweeted this message after leaving the combine on Sunday . Friend: Muema was picked up from the airport by former Oklahoma linebacker Corey Nelson . News that Muema had been found and was safe came as a relief to family and friends. Source told UT San Diego his behavior at the annual combine was strange and religion-driven. After leaving, he gave a phone interview from Indianapolis International Airport explaining his reasons. The 21-year-old said he was 'following God' when choosing not to work out at the combine, told that if he skipped workouts, he'd fulfill his dream of playing for the Seattle Seahawks. He also said he uses numbers to communicate with God and that he believes in Lord Rayel, a person who claims online to be the second coming of Christ. After meeting with Nelson, Muema, who is from Covina, is believed to have left Florida on a flight to Los Angeles. Nelson and Muema met in January at the same facility in Florida and bonded over religion, with both sharing a close relationship with God. However Nelson says they have had to 'agree to disagree' over Muema's belief that Lord Rayel is the Messiah. Raelism is a UFO religion founded and lead by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Rayel or Rael. Rayel claims that on December 13, 1973, . while riding his motorbike to his office in France, he met with extra . terrestrials near a volcano who told him they had created humans in . laboratories. Muema is a believer in Lord Rayel, or Ra-El, who claims to be the Messiah after visiting another planet in 1975 . In 1975 he claims to have met with them again and traveled to their planet. These UFO' are called Elohim and Raelians believe messengers or prophets of the Elohim - such as Buddha and Jesus - were instructed to inform humans of each era. Rayel claims to have received the final message of the Elohim and that his purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and, if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they could be welcomed by them. Rayel said he was told to build an embassy near Jerusalem to spread the message of Elohim and the meaning of the universe. Followers, such as Muema, believe him to be the Messiah.","Adam Muema sat out session in Indianapolis last Sunday because God told him to .

"By . Natalie Pinkham . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:08 EST, 2 March 2014 . I first met Mirela when she was three years old. She had big brown eyes, a mop of brown hair, skinny arms and legs and a bloated belly. Home – if you could call it that – was a decaying orphanage for 300 children in the Romanian city of Slatina, three hours west of Bucharest. She had nothing. No toys, no possessions. Even her clothes were rotated with the other orphans. Yet, despite the deprivation, Mirela was a cheeky little thing who made a beeline for me every playtime. And when I left – after spending the summer of 1999 as a 20-year-old volunteer at the orphanage – I’d often think of her. Brighter future: Orphaned Romanian teenager Mirela in her new bedroom with racing presenter Natalie Pinkham, who raised the money to find a home for Mirela and her siblings . Over the years, it was easier to imagine she’d been adopted and  was safe and happy, so that’s what  I did. But deep down I knew that was unlikely. For a while, the West did everything it could to help the orphans of Nicolae Ceausescu’s dictatorship. Inevitably, though, the world moves on. People’s attention shifted elsewhere, but what of Mirela? Three years ago I decided to go back to Romania to find out. All I had was a photo. I didn’t even know her surname. It took me weeks to find her. I searched the sewers of Bucharest where many homeless orphans seek shelter and spoke to prostitutes who had been in state care. I discovered her in Slatina in a cramped two-bedroom flat with ten other children. She was no longer  a toddler but a severely disturbed 13-year-old. Years of neglect and being tied to a radiator – that’s how we found her – had done their worst. According to the child psychiatrist Professor Michael Rutter, the brain shrinks when a person goes without love. So it was with Mirela. She couldn’t talk or interact and hit  herself constantly. It was so sad to look into her eyes. They were dead. What had she  seen and experienced over the past  decade? She was also painfully thin and couldn’t walk very well. Orphaned: Mirela aged three, seen in a picture taken by Natalie while she was a volunteer at the orphanage, was a happy toddler with a bleak future . I couldn’t abandon her again. This time I vowed I would find Mirela  a home, somewhere she would  be safe. In truth, I had absolutely  no idea how I was going to do this, but shortly afterwards I was hosting a charity event when I met someone from Hope and Homes,  an incredible organisation that is working to close all children’s institutions worldwide. I told them I wanted to build a house for Mirela. They set up a sub fund for her and helped me find a plot of land and get planning permission. They also gave me the credibility of working with experts who are leaders in their field. Then there was the small matter of finding £200,000. So began more than two years of constant fundraising. I held an event at the House of Commons with the MP Caroline Nokes and another at the Mayfair nightclub Mahiki. I climbed ten peaks in ten hours, launched a Twitter campaign and held online auctions. When I married my husband, Owain Walbyoff, a TV executive, in 2012, we sold the wedding pictures to Hello! and put the fee towards Mirela’s fund. At one time I found it hard to reconcile my job as Sky’s Formula 1 pit lane reporter with Mirela. Seeing all the wealth was so far removed from what I was seeing in the children’s projects I was by then beginning to visit. Yet, in a way, it’s been the home that F1 built. Racing forward: Natalie took help from her friends in the F1 world to raise money . A female racing driver called Alice . Powell organised a karting day and my fellow Sky Formula 1 presenters . pitched up. McLaren and Red Bull sent their pit crews down and Jenson . Button gave me memorabilia for an auction. Everyone says that F1’s an . elitist sport but these people didn’t owe me anything, they just wanted . to help. There were also . bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. The authorities said they would . facilitate my ‘adoption’ of Mirela but on the condition that I took her . siblings – which I’d always wanted to do – plus eight other children I . didn’t know. A couple of them were like feral animals and so . institutionalised it scared me being in the same room with them. It wasn’t how I’d envisaged it. I have made a documentary for Channel 5, A Home For Mirela, and in all honesty some scenes are quite disturbing. This isn’t the nice happy ending of opening this cosy little home and having kids running around laughing. I admit I found it quite hard to take and there were a few reflective nights until I pulled myself together. As Hope and Homes has taught me, these are exactly the sort of children we should be helping. The ones who aren’t pretty to look at, the last ten per cent that nobody wants. Last December, we moved in. Mirela supposedly understands little of her surroundings, but the first moment we walked in her face changed. She pulled off her coat and started running around touching things, smelling things. I had wanted Mirela to be socialised around ‘normal’ kids so she could mimic behaviour, raise her game and start communicating. But experts believe the environment she is in – with space, a garden, her own possessions – will help build a sense of identity she’s never had. She has her own room, her own wardrobe covered in stickers and toys and clothes donated by friends in England. At the end of the trip, when I said goodbye to Mirela, she reached out, hugged me and began stroking my face, something she has never done before. I have no doubt she understands a lot more than we think. It was an end and a beginning. The Romanian authorities have agreed to fund the home and I will continue to raise money to safeguard its future. This is where we start to try to reverse some of her symptoms and also gain a better understanding of the impact of institutionalisation.

Harriet Harman pulled out of  a keynote speech yesterday as the controversy raged over her alleged links to a paedophile group. The Labour deputy leader had been expected to make the closing speech at a special party conference called to approve Ed Miliband’s bid to reforge the party’s relationship with the trade unions. She sat on the conference platform but failed to speak and Mr Miliband ended up addressing the packed event twice. Silent partner: Harriet Harman next to Ed Miliband at the conference yesterday . The conference overwhelmingly backed Mr Miliband’s plans for a new ‘one member, one vote’ party leadership election system and an end to union members being automatically ‘affiliated’ to Labour. Miss Harman’s silence took the gloss off Labour’s announcement last night that ex-Foreign Secretary David Owen, who famously turned his back on the party in 1981 to form the SDP, was once more backing Labour after yesterday’s move. Lord Owen praised Mr Miliband for a ‘brave and bold reform’ and said he had made a donation of more than £7,500 to the party, although he stopped short of rejoining. The rule change came amid mounting pressure on Miss Harman, former legal officer for the National Council For Civil Liberties, to apologise over its connections with a vile group that campaigned to legalise sex with children. Lord Owen praised Mr Miliband for a 'brave and bold reform' and said he had made a donation of more than £7,500 to the party . BY PAUL CAHALAN . A senior civil servant who worked under former Labour  Home Secretary Merlyn Rees is  at the centre of an investigation  into whether Government  money was used to fund the Paedophile Information  Exchange group.Clifford Hindley was assistant secretary in charge of the Home Office’s Voluntary Services  Unit which, it is alleged,  funnelled tens of thousands of pounds to the PIE. A Mail on Sunday investigation has uncovered that lifelong bachelor Hindley, a former Methodist minister who died in 2006, is the focus of a Home  Office inquiry over claims that large sums were given to the group in grants. After leaving the Home Office, Hindley wrote a paper arguing that the age of consent for homosexuals should be lowered in line with heterosexuals and another on homosexuality in classical Athens, looking at relationships between men and under-age boys. The shocking allegations were first revealed by this paper last year, as Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill, launched an urgent investigation. That investigation is now  believed to be considering claims that tens of thousands of pounds  of taxpayers’ money could have been channelled by Hindley and the VSU to the PIE, mostly while Merlyn Rees was Home Secretary between 1976 and 1979. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the allegations  and the permanent secretary has commissioned a thorough, independent investigation.’ Miss Harman, who worked for  the NCCL . from 1978 to 1982, has expressed ‘regret’ over its links  to the . Paedophile Information Exchange but refused to apologise. She arrived at the Labour . conference at London’s Excel Centre with husband and fellow Labour MP . Jack Dromey. He also faces questions over his role in the civil rights . group, to which the Paedophile Information Exchange was affiliated from . 1975 to 1983. Miss Harman, who sat next to Mr Miliband, had been expected to round up the debate with a traditional rousing speech. Her place was taken by Labour MP Jon Ashworth while Mr Miliband’s second speech closed the event. Last night, a spokeswoman for Miss Harman said her participation had never been set in stone. She said: ‘It was never fixed.’ The programme change came  as many Labour MPs continue to express private anger over Miss Harman’s handling of the NCCL row. She has insisted she ‘never had anything to do with PIE’ and that she is the victim of a ‘politically motivated smear campaign’. But she was left isolated when former Labour government colleague Patricia Hewitt, who was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974 to 1983, last week admitted  it had been ‘naive and wrong’ in its dealings with PIE. Mr Dromey, an NCCL executive committee member in the 1970s, has denied claims he did not do enough to try to expel the paedophile group and insists he challenged PIE at the council’s 1976 conference. Mr Miliband has made reforming the party’s trade union links a litmus test of his leadership, even though he won the 2010 contest largely thanks to union support. The changes, sparked by the alleged rigging of a party candidate selection by the Unite union in Falkirk, mean the next Labour leader will be elected by a one member, one vote system, rather than through the electoral college in which unions have a third of the vote. And instead of being automatically affiliated to Labour, union members will in future be invited to opt in as a party supporter for £3. Delegates backed the plans, with 86 per cent voting in favour. Len McCluskey, boss of the giant Unite union, expressed defiance saying the changes would not mean the end of union influence over Labour. ‘This is our party and we are going nowhere,’ he said. BY DAN HODGES - FORMER LABOUR ADVISER . Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges writes Miliband hoped the conference would be his 'Clause 4 moment' Ed Miliband had hoped yesterday’s Labour special conference would prove to be his Clause 4 moment. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out like that. He gave quite a good speech about getting people to re-engage with the political process. There was some decent mocking of Cameron’s attempt to rebrand himself leader of ‘the Worker’s Party’. But although he managed to put a brave face on it, yesterday was the day Labour’s leader marched his troops to the top of the hill and then marched them swiftly back down again. Or, more accurately, it was the day he marched his troops to the top of the hill and then allowed Unite leader Len McCluskey to march them back down to the ExCeL centre in London’s Docklands. In the ExCeL’s Platinum Suite 2 there was a sense of being at a rather low-key motivational conference. Or a slightly more upbeat humanist wedding. Somewhere on the road to Docklands, Ed has managed to lose his way. And it’s worth remembering where the journey began. In the aftermath of the Falkirk scandal – where Unite was found to have attempted to rig the candidate selection for the safe Labour seat – an enraged Miliband threw down the gauntlet to the unions. They had been practising what he called: ‘A politics that was closed.  A politics of the machine. A politics that is rightly hated.’ Turning his fire directly on Unite’s leader, he ratcheted up the rhetoric: ‘Instead of defending what happened in Falkirk, [Len] McCluskey should be facing up to his responsibilities. He should not be defending the machine politics involving bad practice and malpractice that went on there, he should be facing up to it.’ Then Miliband set out his terms. The union’s financial stranglehold on his party would finally have to be broken. Trade union members would have to make a conscious decision to sign up directly to Labour, by-passing the general secretaries. And he would bring an end to the days when those general secretaries could spend limitless sums endorsing the leadership campaigns of their favoured candidates. This was all combative, indeed, historic stuff. But rather than drive forward with his reforms – as Blair, Smith and Kinnock did – Miliband has engaged in a series of subtle, and not so subtle, tactical retreats.The funding proposals will not now be implemented until 2018 or 2019. In other words, never. The requirement to ask individual trade union members to ‘opt in’ to membership of the party has been placed in the hands of an ‘Implementation Group’ that will not report until some point towards the end of the year. And the spending cap on elections has been shelved all together. Somewhere on the road to Docklands, Ed managed to lose his way - writes Dan Hodges, who attended the special conference . Even the commitment to introducing one member, one vote to leadership elections – the one significant move for which Miliband does deserve credit – is not all that it seems. By abolishing the rights of his MPs to influence those elections, and knocking down the electoral college wall between ‘ordinary’ Labour party members and trade unionists, he has in effect increased the size of the votes in the control of the unions from 33 per cent to around 60 per cent. All of which is why, when it came to the crunch, McCluskey raised the card containing his union’s mighty block vote and gave Miliband’s ‘reform’ plans a fair wind. Tellingly, Labour’s leader made no mention in either of his speeches to the events in Falkirk that had precipitated this special conference. But, in an equally telling intervention, McCluskey did. ‘My union has done nothing wrong,’ he declared to loud cheers. Before pointedly adding: ‘This is our party and we are going nowhere.’ And he’s right. They’re not. Nor, for that matter, is Ed Miliband. Yesterday was billed as the most historic constitutional turning point for Labour in almost a century. But it wasn’t. The fact is that as the Falkirk crisis swirled around him, Miliband panicked, and made a series of commitments he was unable to deliver. Everything since then has been an exercise in helping him extricate himself from the hook he’d clumsily impaled himself on.","Labour deputy was due to make closing speech at special party conference .

Not so scared: Crows will have to be shooed away thoroughly by farmers before they can be shot . Britain’s farmers must try to shoo away birds before they can be shot for damaging crops, according to new plans from the Government’s wildlife advisers. And anyone breaking the rules could face prosecution, with a maximum six months in jail or a £5,000 fine. The new proposals have caused uproar, with farming and countryside groups labelling them ‘ludicrous’. At present, if farmers have a problem with pigeons or crows eating wheat or stealing chickens’ eggs, they can decide the best option is to shoot them. They only need to be ‘satisfied’ that scaring or other measures such as netting would be ineffective or impracticable before reaching for the gun. But officials from the Government’s wildlife advisers Natural England now want to ensure that other methods are tried before farmers shoot. Under their proposals, it would be a legal requirement for licensed gun owners to take ‘reasonable and appropriate steps’ such as ‘scaring’ to resolve any problem before resorting to firearms. The new rules are included in a shake-up of the General Licence, which allows licensed gun owners to kill pests such as magpies, crows and rooks. Simon Clarke, of the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, said: ‘What are we supposed to  do – go out in bright shiny clothes, waving our arms and making a lot of noise before shooting? And who is going to wander round fields checking whether every pigeon-shooter has tried to scare away the pest birds before shooting?’ The Countryside Alliance’s Tim Bonner said: ‘This is ridiculous and shows Natural England has no understanding of pigeon control or the damage pigeons can do.’ Charles Nodder, of the National Gamekeepers Organisation, added: ‘You don’t go out waving the white flag before you shoot. It’s ludicrous. We will support proposals that make sense but will oppose impractical suggestions tooth and nail.’ Blight: Farmers say crows, pigeons and other birds pose a huge risk of damage to their crops . But a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds spokesman said: ‘The licence gives landowners the right to remove individual birds that are causing a problem, but we’ve always questioned the validity of those who appear to just go out and shoot birds for the pot, which is not allowed.’ The changes are contained in a consultation process initiated by Natural England last week. In a statement, Natural England said: ‘The requirement is that people take reasonable steps to resolve problems by means that are lawful and don’t require a licence. ‘For example, many farmers will use gas-guns or scarecrows to deter birds. However, this is often not wholly effective and lethal control will also be necessary. This is appropriate as the farmers  are clearly doing everything reasonable and practicable.’ But the NE plans have met with derision on social network sites, with one Facebook user asking: ‘Are they paid a bonus for stupid ideas or is this par for the course?’","Those breaking the rules could face six months in jail or a £5,000 fine .

He became the world’s richest  manservant when left a £30 million fortune by his playboy boss who  cut his heir out of his will. But now Kent Adonai – who was Lord Glenconner’s valet and carer for 30 years – has struck a secret deal to share the windfall with the peer’s grandson. The 51-year-old had been facing a legal battle with 20-year-old Cody Tennant, who became the fourth Baron Glenconner when the former owner of Princess Margaret’s favourite island retreat died in 2010. Close: Lord Glenconner with Kent Adonai, the manservant to whom he left £30million when he died in 2010 . He had expected to inherit the family estate – only to discover his grandfather rewrote his will seven months before his death aged 83. The Scottish university student was backed in his battle by his family, including Glenconner’s widow, Lady Anne, who was also shocked to learn she had not been left a penny. Mr Adonai, who cannot read or write, hired a top legal team on  St Lucia, Glenconner’s home after leaving Mustique, where he once hosted Royalty. The inheritance included the peer’s Indian-style mansion, jewellery, art and antiques, and 192 acres of shorefront development land. Legal battle: Cody Tennant, the fourth Baron Glenconner, now stands to gain millions after a deal was struck to share his grandfather's fortune . However, appearing before a judge last week at the East Caribbean Supreme Court, Mr Adonai’s representatives agreed he will share the property with the new baron. A court insider told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The lawyers who represent Kent and Cody respectively each handed a sealed brown envelope to the judge. The deal was in them. 'My understanding is that Cody is getting a share in the land that potentially will make him a multi-millionaire.’ Cody’s lawyer Peter Foster – also speaker of the St Lucia Parliament – said: ‘Yes, there was a dispute over the will and now it has been settled amicably.’ He declined to put a value on the property relinquished by Mr Adonai, but added: ‘The way it has been settled is to the mutual satisfaction of all parties.’ Although the grounds of the challenge have not been revealed, one legal expert said it may have involved a clause in which Glenconner directed the servant to ‘apportion’ the fortune ‘to himself and heirs in whatsoever manner he wishes as I have discussed with him’. ‘One might argue that Glenconner expected Kent to look after his heirs, including Cody and Lady Anne,’ the expert added. ‘It also might have been argued he was elderly and not in his right mind.’ Lady Anne has also pointed out that her husband was battling cancer when he died. The Lord Glenconner at his home on Mustique in February 1985: When he died Glenconner was sitting on one of the Caribbean's most desirable pieces of land and had plans for a potentially lucrative resort development . Mr Adonai has always maintained that, along with inheriting land worth millions, he was also saddled with Glenconner’s debts which, he claims, left him impoverished. He says this was the reason he sold the peer’s belongings two years ago. However, at the time of his death, Glenconner was sitting on one of the Caribbean’s most desirable pieces of land and had plans for a resort development that was to include seven villas priced up to £7 million each. ‘Developers are vying for land in the area,’ a Caribbean property specialist said. ‘Cody and Kent each stand to earn millions.’ Mr Adonai’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.","Kent Adonai's had been facing a legal battle with 20-year-old Cody Tennant, who became the fourth Baron Glenconner when his grandfather died ."
"By . Linda Franklin . PUBLISHED: . 17:59 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 27 February 2014 . Unrepentant: Linda Franklin has no regrets about sleeping with a married man . Exactly a year ago, I instigated the end of one of the most fulfilling, exciting and enduring relationships of my life, by dumping my lover of 12 years. There was no drama, accusations or poisonous words exchanged. Instead, we'd just made love and were lying in my bed with a cup of tea when I casually mentioned we shouldn't see each other any more. Matt finished his tea, dressed, kissed me goodbye and walked out of my life. I haven't seen him since. It was without doubt one of the most selfless and generous things I have ever done. By finishing with Matt, a married father of a little boy, I was setting him free to be the good husband I knew he could be. This wasn't done out of a sense of guilt or propriety: I'd been sleeping with Matt before and after his marriage. I did it for the sake of his son, who deserved his father's full attention, and I did it for Matt. I sensed he was finally ready to put his indecisive, philandering ways behind him and devote himself to his family. Though sad to see him go, I didn't regret my decision. I'd always seen our time together as a loan which eventually would have to be called in. And that's why I never had any regrets about deceiving his wife. As I saw it, I'd borrowed someone's fiance, then husband, and returned him with interest. If it weren't for our affair, I'm sure he'd still be dithering about whether to marry and wouldn't have started a family. In fact, so encouraging was I that he commit to marriage and family life with another woman that I can't help thinking my lover's wife owes some of her happiness to me. I met Matt when he was 30 and I was 47, after a mutual friend invited us for a drink one evening. I'd been divorced for five years following the collapse of my 12-year marriage. My former husband had gone to live in the U.S. after meeting someone on a work trip; our sons were just three and six when he left. Since my sons had specific learning difficulties and needed a lot of extra help, my time was taken up with looking after them. I'd gone on some dates and remained hopeful that romance wasn't over for me, though it wasn't at the top of my list  of priorities. So, I could hardly believe my luck when Matt walked into the bar. He was tall and broad with thick, curly hair and green eyes: good-looking and smiley. I wasn't remotely worried by the fact he was so much younger than me. Toy boy: Linda was 47 when she started her affair with Matt, who was 17 years younger than her . I like to think I am an attractive woman and I know age is seldom an obstacle when two people are attracted to each other. Besides, older women bring something very different to a relationship. Without the ticking of a biological clock, we tend to be more relaxed than younger women about relationships. That night, there was a definite chemistry. I had to get back home early to relieve the babysitter, but I gave Matt my number. A week or so later, we met for coffee and things developed from there. His job in IT meant he worked flexible hours, so he was able to visit me when my sons were at school. In many ways I was using Matt. He was an ego boost, a distraction, a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then . It wasn't just a physical relationship, though, of course, that was important. A typical afternoon for us involved a cup of tea, some time in bed and a catch-up on our news and problems. Matt was always happy to talk about my sons, while I gave him general life advice. I never hoped or assumed the relationship would go any further. In fact, Matt put it perfectly one afternoon a year after we met: 'You're 17 years older, so nothing long-term is going to happen. Let's just enjoy it for what it is, for as long as it lasts.' Ever the pragmatist, I was happy to agree. After all, we were at different stages in life. Did I love him? Yes, at first I suppose I did a little bit, but as time passed, I came to see him for what he was: a charming and handsome man, but ultimately an unfaithful and immature one. I knew he'd drive me nuts if I lived with him because he was a ditherer and seemed incapable of committing to a long-term relationship. I know people are going to assume I was being used, but I don't see it that way. In many ways I was using Matt. He was an ego boost, a distraction, a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then. We agreed we were free to date other people, and we did. I knew Matt wanted to marry and have a family. My priority was my sons. A new relationship would have been wonderful, but it isn't easy to find that when you are a full-time parent without any weekends off. I also came to see that the reason my relationship with Matt worked so well was that we avoided the mundane and domestic. Brief encounters: Linda said she enjoyed her physical relationship with Matt which was not encumbered with domesticity (posed by models) Familiarity never bred contempt because we only saw each other in a succession of brief romantic encounters. He never met my sons; I never asked about his girlfriends. I felt no jealousy or resentment. My time with Matt was more than enough for me. In 2009, I knew, from the scant information I received from him that Matt had started seeing someone seriously and they'd moved in together. I was surprised he still wanted to carry on with our arrangement. I could see what I got out of it, but why was he keen to keep seeing me when he had a girlfriend at home? His answer was simple: 'I just need to.' I saw that as a sign of his immaturity and unwillingness to commit. Thank God I'm his mistress, not his partner, I thought. Obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and I didn't pose a threat to his marriage . The relationship did have its pauses, sometimes for several months, as Matt dithered over the direction his life was taking. It was during a break in 2010 that I received a text that he'd married his girlfriend. He'd never even told me they were engaged, but in my heart I wasn't surprised. I knew it was what he wanted, though I didn't have high hopes for the future of his relationship. Part of me felt sorry for the poor woman. I was surprised, however, when several months later he called to suggest we meet up. It was curiosity, in part, that made me agree. I know many will argue that I should have reminded him of the vows he had taken only months earlier, but knowing Matt as I did, I knew he'd blunder into another clandestine affair - possibly with a  woman less discreet and trustworthy than me. So, he came round and we ended up in bed. We didn't discuss the wedding or his wife. We just picked up where we'd left off several months before. I never saw Matt's marriage as my moral issue, it was his. If he took chances, that was his problem. Obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and I didn't pose a threat to his marriage. One day in the summer of 2011, Matt asked for my advice. He said his wife, who was 37, wanted to start a family. But he wasn't sure. Advised him to start a family: The mother-of-two believes she has made her lover a better husband . Exasperated, I urged him to get on with it. Time and biology waits for no man, I said, and he could end up regretting not being a father for the rest of his life. Their son, Max, was born within the year. A few months later, he was back in my bed. Our snuggly, post-coital chat involved him complaining that he had no time for himself. Life was all work and looking after mother and baby, he grumbled. I reassured him that it might seem like an endless slog at that point, but it would pass and that he and his wife would one day have fun together again. I told him he was doing well and explained that my former husband and I had slept in separate rooms for six months after our first son was born. Matt said he felt much better after hearing how life as a new parent had been for me. The next time I saw him, he was much happier. He had bonded with his son and seemed to have taken a giant leap into manhood, so determined was he to do the best for his new family. He was proud of his wife and child, and I was delighted to see he'd found his stride as a family man. The time was right to cut him loose and make him commit. I saw our relationship as the last piece in the puzzle. His little boy needed Matt in a way I didn't. It was only fair on them to force his hand. That was a year ago. I miss him, occasionally, but I sincerely hope he is making a go of family life and is happy. Do I feel regret or guilt? No - far from being the villain of the piece, I see myself as a fairy godmother. I think Matt's affair with me did his marriage the world of good.","Linda met Matt when she was 47 and he was 30 .

Millionaire's wife Kim Maher, 47, has been acquitted of assaulting a pensioner following an appeal . A millionaire's wife who was involved in a brawl in a posh restaurant has been acquitted of assaulting a pensioner following an appeal. Kim Maher, 47, from Hale, near Altrincham, Cheshire, had a conviction overturned when a key witness failed to appear at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester. Mrs Maher, who is married to wealthy businessman Vincent Maher, was convicted in October of attacking 65-year-old David Snelson at the upmarket Hale Grill in Altrincham, Cheshire. Her husband had also been accused of assaulting Mr Snelson but he was cleared when the case was heard at Trafford Magistrates' Court in October. He was cleared when a key witness, Richard Davies, a chef at the Hale Grill, who was working the night the disturbance took place, told the court that he had not seen Mr Maher involved in the incident. Mrs Maher, who lives with her husband in an exclusive gated development, where house prices exceed £1million, just outside the village, has now challenged her conviction and was acquitted when Mr Davies failed to show up for the appeal hearing. The defendant's lawyer, Paul Anthony Lawton, told the court that Mr Davies was able to observe the disturbance in the restaurant through a hatch from the kitchen - and his evidence had called the alleged victim's account into question. Mr Lawton said: ‘The reality is that Mr Davies destroyed the credibility of Mr Snelson.’ He also told the court that Mr Snelson had accused Mrs Maher of grabbing him and spinning him around before her husband attacked him by poking him in the eyes. But Mrs Maher was acquitted when Mr Davies, who was a witness for both the prosecution and defence, failed to turn up at court. The prosecution told the court there had been several attempts to contact Mr Davies but that he was no longer working at the Hale Grill or living with his father as he had been at the time. A police officer had spoken to the witness over the phone and told him about yesterday's hearing. Mrs Maher, who is married to wealthy businessman Vincent Maher, was convicted in October of attacking David Snelson, 65, at the upmarket Hale Grill in Altrincham (pictured) She had her conviction overturned when a key witness failed to appear at Minshull Street Crown Court . Judge Adrian Smith was reluctant to adjourn the case to wait for the witness who had 'chosen not to come'. Instead, he asked the prosecution to seek advice from the CPS. Mr Lawton said: ‘I think the whole incident is what the old recorder used to refer to as a brouhaha.’ He said there had clearly been a disturbance in a public place. He explained that Mr and Mrs Maher knew Mr Snelson but there was a suggestion that they had fallen out with him. Judge Adrian Smith overturned Mrs Maher's conviction and the original punishment of £100 fine, £20 victim surcharge and £300 costs. He instead ordered her to be bound over to keep the peace and refrain from any disorderly behaviour for 12 months. Judge Smith said that by agreeing to be bound over the defendant accepted a degree of responsibility. The Mahers live in this exclusive property in a development just outside the village of Hale . The Mahers live in an exclusive property in a development just outside the village of Hale, near Altrincham.

The Queen’s great-granddaughter Savannah Phillips had plenty to smile about as she showed off a goldfish won at a fairground yesterday. The three-year-old daughter of Princess Anne’s son Peter and wife Autumn bagged her prize on a visit to the Beaufort Hunt Point-to-Point in Gloucestershire with her parents and little sister Isla. Later she enjoyed  a children’s swing ride. A new pet! Autumn Phillips proudly brandishes the goldfish that her mother won for her in a carnival game . There was sunshine over much of Britain yesterday but, wisely, Savannah and her family wrapped up in coats and wellies... forecasters say more rain is on the way. Autumn showed off her North American exuberance as she speared three cards with darts to win the fish. She whooped and cheered after she coolly clinched a darts hat-trick in the carnival game that her husband had tried and failed at minutes earlier. Then, showing off a typical mother's . selflessness, she handed the prize pet to her delighted eldest daughter . to take care of while they carried on their family fun day. Triumph! Autumn Phillips coolly spears three playing cards with darts in a carnival game at the Duke of Beaufort's Point-to-Point races at Didmarton, Gloucestershire, then, right, whoops with delight . A prize for you, darling: Autumn hands the spoils - a goldfish - over to her daughter, Savannah, for safe keeping . What would we do without mums? Autumn's win came after her husband, Peter, failed to make the hat-trick . The country fair was blessed by pale winter sun, although judging by the coats and woolly hats worn by Peter, Autumn, Savannah and their youngest child Isla, one, temperatures stayed stubbornly chilly. Both parents wore dark, well-insulated jackets, jeans and boots, their wintry look offset by dark glasses. Autumn accesorised with a white bobble hat. Savannah's look echoed that of her mother and father, but for a bright red jacket, while her younger sister's grey coat was paired with Union Flag wellies and a pink, orange, blue and green bobble hat. Fun of the fair: Savannah smiles contentedly as she enjoys a roundabout ride with other children . Isla looked on enviously as her big sister smiled contentedly on a roundabout ride that the one-year-old was not yet big enough to try out herself. The tiny one looked most content in her mother's arms, pointing and smiling at the many sights and delights laid by the duke. The current Duke of Beaufort, David Somerset, 86, is a well-known as a lover of horses and equestrian events. But he has faced his share of brickbats. Look mummy: Peter and Autumn's youngest daughter, Isla, points as her sister enjoys the merry-go-round . I want a go! The one-year-old seemed captivated by the ride, but is still to young to have a go herself . He was embroiled in controversy in December when his hunt, said to be Prince Charles's favourite, was investigated for rampaging through a Cotswold town - allegedly in pursuit of a fox. Fox hunting as a sport was banned in England in 2004. Residents claimed around 40 horses from the Duke of Beaufort’s Hunt followed a pack of hounds who sped through Tetbury, Gloucestershire, in pursuit of the animal. Family fun day: Peter takes the strain for a bit by carrying Isla as they move from stall to stall at the fair . Dressed for warmth: The whole family were well insulated against the cold, despite the pale winter sun . And in 2009 the Duke, who is one of Britain's richest men, faced criticism after he cashed in on a  400-year-old aristrocratic right by charging hard-up taxpayers £280,000 to build a bridge over his riverbed. The Duke - worth an estimated £130million - demanded £281,431 for the walkway to stretch over the River Tawe, Swansea, which is more than 100 miles from his family seat in Badminton, Gloucestershire. His family owns the bed of the River Tawe after Charles II gave it to his aristocratic ancestors for trout fishing rights. Laughing and joking: Autumn smiles for the camera as the family stroll by, enjoying the fresh air . Weeeeeee! Savannah shows off her jumping skills . Last month the Duke's son, Lord Edward Somerset, was jailed for two years after repeatedly beating his wife in a series of drink- and drug-fuelled rampages over two decades. Peter and Autumn have been together since 2003 and married since 2008. Savannah, the Queen's first great-grandchild, was born in December 2010; Isla was born in March 2012.","Princess Anne's son and his family were at the Duke of Beaufort's Point-to-Point races in Didmarton, Gloucestershire ."

Breaking silence: The outraged former paratrooper said he is an obvious target as he lives a secret life . A soldier facing questioning in the new Bloody Sunday investigation has spoken of his fury after suspected IRA bomber John Downey was given a police guarantee he would not face trial. Breaking his silence after 32 years, the former paratrooper – one of the few to have spoken out since Bloody Sunday – said it was appalling that Downey had escaped prosecution for the 1982 Hyde Park terror blast, which left four soldiers and seven horses dead. An Old Bailey judge last week ruled Downey could not be prosecuted because Northern Ireland police had wrongly guaranteed him immunity. The ex-soldier meanwhile has received a letter from the same force warning his identity may now be exposed because of a fresh inquiry into the Londonderry massacre. Condemning what he called ‘double standards’, the ex-soldier said: ‘So much for British justice. Being named could end my life.’ It has also emerged that 187  suspected IRA killers received ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ letters from the  Police Service of Northern Ireland saying they would not face trial for historic terror offences. Last night, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, the former paratrooper said at his Ulster home: ‘Downey receives a letter promising him he will not have to face justice and I am warned I face another investigation. Why don’t they just throw the Bloody Sunday paratroopers to the IRA wolves and be done with it? ‘I’ve had Bloody Sunday hanging over me for more than 40 years, even though I didn’t even fire a shot on the day. This has been a lifetime of suspicion and fear that our anonymity will be lifted. Who cares about us? Everything has swung the terrorists’ way.’ The soldier, who observes strict security procedures to protect himself and his family, has previously given detailed evidence on oath about Bloody Sunday to the Saville Inquiry – the judge-led investigation into the incident in which 13 civilians died. This newspaper has seen his statement to Lord Saville and photographic evidence that he belonged to a  company from the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (1 Para), which was sent into the Creegan area of Londonderry to counter a civil rights protest on January 30, 1972. In December last year the soldier received a letter from the C2 Serious Crime Branch of the PSNI warning him that he faces a new legal ordeal. Terror: Rioters confront paratroopers on Bloody Sunday 42 years ago near Hyde Park . The letter – one of the first to have ever been made public – reads: ‘The PSNI will seek to make contact with and re-interview former military  witnesses who provided evidence to the public inquiry or persons who may have information deemed relevant to the current police inquiry. ‘During the Saville inquiry it was ruled that anonymity be granted to any soldier who gave evidence unless his name was clearly already in the public domain. 'That ruling does not automatically carry over to the current police investigation. Anonymity will be a matter for the criminal court to consider afresh should criminal proceedings arise.’ 'So much for justice - this could end my life' The soldier has refused to reply to the letter and says he will not willingly be interviewed again by police. This stance could result in his arrest should detectives take the view that he is compromising their inquiries. To his dismay, the same soldier received another letter in January, this time from the Ministry of Defence’s Directorate of Judicial Engagement Policy, based in London. It warned that the criminal investigation into Bloody Sunday was ‘now beginning to gather momentum’. The letter, signed by the Caron Tassel, a senior civil servant at the Directorate, continued: ‘I do understand that receipt of this letter (and one from the PSNI) may cause you some concern. 'Please be assured it is our policy to ensure appropriate support is provided to our people, whether serving or veterans, in circumstances when their actions while on operations come under judicial scrutiny.’ The ex-soldier is determined to protect himself and his family. Aftermath: The blast left dead horses strewn across the streets and killed 11 military personnel . Since leaving the Army and settling in Northern Ireland, he has maintained rigorous procedures to ensure he does not give Republican terrorists clues  as to his identity and whereabouts. Decades of discipline could be  shattered if he is ever brought to trial over the Bloody Sunday deaths. In a bid to find civilian witnesses to the tragedy, the PSNI has even resorted to putting up billboards appealing for people to come forward – a move described as ‘grotesque’ by Tory MPs. The ex-soldier also told this newspaper of his concerns over the administrative error that saw Downey receive a ‘comfort letter’ telling him he would not face prosecution. 'I live a secret life - I am an obvious target' He said he was worried similar mistakes could lead to his own family’s whereabouts being made public – and then their being targeted by the IRA. He said: ‘John Downey apparently received his “comfort letter” by mistake. Well that was a colossal mistake and an insult to the families of the British soldiers killed on that day in Hyde Park who desperately wanted him to face justice. ‘If an official can make a mistake on that scale it’s not remotely unlikely the wrong button will be pressed  by somebody inside the PSNI, or the office of any lawyers used by the MoD, and a document will be released in an un-redacted form. ‘Another real possibility is that Republicans could infiltrate the PSNI’s Serious Crime Branch. Security clearance doesn’t count for much. If they get one guy in there I could be taken out, and given that I’m living over here I’d be an obvious target for them. The soldier with his fellow Paras, whose identities are protected, could face an inquiry at the Old Bailey . ‘For these reasons I live a covert life, a secret life and regard all strangers very warily indeed. All information about me is on a strict, need-to-know basis. I have a cover story and I stick to it. ‘It would be a coup for the IRA to take out a Bloody Sunday paratrooper and we’ve seen with the recent letter bombing campaign  targeting Army recruitment offices in England that they got the capability and the will to carry it out. 'But why should I leave my home? I live in the UK and I should be able to live here without being harassed. This is my right and I am going to protect it. After all, I served my country.’ The PSNI’s new investigation into Bloody Sunday is expected to take several years and requires soldiers to testify again because the evidence they gave to the Saville Inquiry is not admissible in a criminal probe. More than 100 soldiers gave evidence at the hearings after receiving assurances nothing they said would lead to criminal action being taken against them. Lord Saville’s findings were deeply critical of the Army. Responding to his report’s findings in 2010, David Cameron described the shootings as ‘unjustified and unjustifiable’. Up to 15 ‘shooters’ – those Paras who shot into the crowd – are expected to face the closest scrutiny from the PSNI. Defence sources said last night that the first formal requests for Bloody Sunday veterans to be interviewed under caution are expected ‘very soon’. A MoD spokesman said: ‘The police are still investigating the events of that day and only when that is complete will the relevant authorities be in a position to decide the next steps. The MoD takes very seriously its obligations to former soldiers who face allegations of wrong-doing while on operations.’","Former paratrooper one of few to speak out after 42 years of silence .

Masked robbers who lured a couple more than 600 miles to buy a car before ambushing them and stealing £5,000 from them at knifepoint have been jailed. Sajid Hussain, 26, and Shahid Sadik, 24, tricked Michael Irvine and his girlfriend Louise Cogle into travelling from their home in the Shetland Islands, thinking they would be buying a car in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The couple had travelled by plane and train from their remote home to buy a white Audi Quattro they had seen advertised for sale for £5,995 on Auto Trader. Sajid Hussain, 26, (left) and Shahid Sadik, 24, (right) were jailed for a total of 16 years for stealing £5,000 from Michael Irvine and his girlfriend Louise Cogle after luring them 600 miles to buy a car . Miss Cogle paid a £500 deposit for the car and they brought a red suitcase with them containing £5,000 in cash. But . when the couple arrived on August 10 last year, they were ambushed by men wearing balaclavas and armed with a gun and a plank of wood. Prosecutor . Simon Haring told Bradford Crown Court Hussain cocked the gun before . pointing it at Mr Irvine’s face and shouting: 'I am going to take the . bag. I am going to shoot you.' The prosecutor added that the Audi was sold legitimately the previous month to another buyer. Judge John Potter said the gun, which has not been recovered, was either realor a very realistic imitation. Witnesses described Miss Cogle 'shaking uncontrollably' at the scene. Judge Potter said: 'It can be readily assumed that anyone subjected to such a serious incident in wholly alien surroundings to them would have been significantly affected by what occurred.' Drug dealer Hussain, who was on bail at the time for supplying heroin and cocaine to police officers working undercover, was jailed for ten years after being convicted after trial. Terror: Prosecutor Simon Haring told Bradford Crown Court Hussain cocked the gun before pointing it at Mr Irvine's face and shouting: 'I am going to take the bag. I am going to shoot you.' Hussain, of Bradford, received a seven-year sentence for robbery and three years for peddling Class A drugs, to be served consecutively. Sadik, also of Bradford, who was on prison licence for aggravated vehicle taking at the time of the offence, was sentenced to six years and three months in prison after pleading guilty on the first day of his trial. Speaking after the sentence, social worker Miss Cogle, 38, said: 'I have never experienced such a fear in my life. Afterwards my body was trembling and my legs were wobbly. It went on for hours.' She was signed off work for two weeks and was offered counselling by her employed Shetland Islands Council and Victim Support. The mother-of-three said: 'I felt fragile for weeks, and couldn’t tell the story without breaking down in tears.' Mr Irvine, 49, a foreman at the Shetland Catch fish factory, said: 'Police officers told us we were lucky to be alive - and that is all we were caring about.' Miss Cogle said they had no reason to suspect anything was untoward. She had done a vehicle history check on the DVLA’s website and had been in regular contact with the seller. The cash and their passports have not been found. Miss Cogle added: 'At least we are alive.

Serial hoaxer: Partially-sighted Jacqueline Hustler, 48, made several bomb threats in hoax phone calls to shops, charities and hospitals . A judge today branded a serial hoax caller a 'menace' to society after she made terrifying calls to hospitals, charities and shops threatening them with bombs. Partially-sighted Jacqueline Hustler, 48, was already on bail for making bomb threats to five different Marks & Spencer stores and five hospitals when she threatened the Samaritans, a social worker and even her own mother. Bradford Crown Court was told Hustler only made the phone calls because of 'uneven flag stones' in her 'unsuitable' property and loneliness. But Judge John Potter refused to accept her vulnerability as an excuse, telling Hustler: 'I have absolutely no hesitation at all in naming you as a menace to your community. 'Your actions, in my judgement, are deliberate and designed to cause significant harm and distress throughout the community.' Hustler was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after she admitted nine counts of communicating false information with intent. The court heard how she had already faced court action in 2011 after admitting making more than 200 hoax calls to emergency services in West Yorkshire. But prosecutor Jo Shepherd today told the court how Hustler, who is estranged from her children and lives alone in Bradford, West Yorkshire, began making a fresh barrage of calls on October 29 last year, ringing M&S stores in Bridlington, Castle Donington, Kendal, Bradford and Derby. Hustler whispered down the phone when staff at each store answered that there was a bomb outside the main door of the shop, in the form of a brown paper box. Calling the Castle Donington store, she told them her name was Marcus and that the bomb would go off in half an hour. Panicked staff evacuated the store and police were called, but no bomb was found. At Kendal, Hustler told them her name was Marcus Cartwright, before bizarrely telling the staff member she had a young girl with her who was unconscious. Threats: Bradford Royal Infirmary was among the hospitals that Hustler called claiming there was a bomb in the vicinity . 'It’s my daughter Linda. I’ve given her ecstasy tablets but she thought they were sweets. The ambulance needs to hurry up, she’s not breathing,' Miss Shepherd described Hustler telling the staff member. The court also heard that she contacted several hospitals and charities, including two to Eccleshill Community Centre, two to Bradford Royal Infirmary, one to Dewsbury District Hospital, one to a MacMillan Hospital in Bradford and one to Westmorland Hospital in Kendal, Cumbria. She sent a mixture of text messages to the hospitals and also made phone calls herself - again threatening that there was a bomb in the vicinity. Police traced the mobile phone number back to Hustler, who denied making the calls. But while on bail for these offences, she committed further hoax calls on December 7 last year. The court heard Hustler only made the calls because of 'uneven flag stones' in her 'unsuitable' property and because she was lonely . She again called the Bradford Royal Infirmary and Eccleshill Community Hospital, as well as voluntary charities including the Samaritans in Bradford, the Morley Street Centre and even a social worker who had worked with Hustler in the past. Text messages read by an automated voice told terrified staff at the Eccleshill Community Hospital, which offers rehabilitation for patients over 65 who have come from hospital, that there was a bomb in reception. Hustler rang the hospital to whisper bomb threats down the phone approximately three times. She also sent three text messages to her previous support worker telling her there was a bomb in her office. As well as ringing hospitals, she also made a four silent phone calls to 999 on December 7, Miss Shepherd told the court. She even sent her own mother, Margaret Foster, five text messages which read ‘pervert’. Again, Hustler was arrested where she denied sending the messages or making calls but pleaded guilty when she appeared at Bradford Magistrates in December. Jailed: A judge at Bradford Crown Court described Hustler as a 'menace' to society and jailed her for three-and-a-half-years for nine counts of communicating false information with intent . Hustler, wearing dark glasses and carrying a black stick, was helped into the dock by her barrister Sophie Drake. She said the reason Hustler had made the calls was because the property she is living in is unsuitable because of 'uneven flag stones', loneliness and because of 'anger towards her mother'. Ms Drake added: 'She doesn’t appear to understand why she behaves in this way... She says she hates what she does.' But Judge Potter said this did not excuse Hustler's actions, telling her: 'I make it very clear that your vulnerability in the community and your physical disabilities provide absolutely no excuse for the way in which you deliberately behaved in the course of the commission of these offences.' Calling the phone calls a 'campaign of bomb hoaxes', the judge added: 'Suffice to say that one can readily imagine, given the terms of each phone call made, significant alarm, distress and therefore harm being caused.' Judge Potter told Hustler: 'Your targeting of institutions such as hospitals are a significant aggravating factor in this case. 'Members of the public simply going about their lawful business were evacuated from a number of places, no doubt causing them at the very least inconvenience and almost certainly significant alarm and distress.'","Jacqueline Hustler, 48, faced court action in 2011 for hoax phone calls .

Robert Tiffin, 46, pleaded guilty to stabbing and slashing Lisa Banks 27 times in the North Shields barber shop where she worked. Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 46-year-old mother-of-two had already left Tiffin after growing tired of his violent and controlling behaviour, including a recent threat to behead her. Murder: Robert Tiffin pleaded guilty to stabbing and slashing Lisa Banks 27 times in the North Shields barber shop where she worked. The 46-year-old mother-of-two had already left Tiffin over his violent behaviour . The court heard how, after Ms Banks refused to go for a drink with her husband, he waited until she was alone in the Sole'O barber shop on Nile Street in North Shields, before carrying out a frenzied knife attack. He left a trail of blood leading from the barber shop to his flat over the road, from where he would regularly watch Ms Banks while she worked. Prosecutors claim Tiffin attempted to carry out his threat to behead Ms Banks during the attack, as she suffered multiple wounds to her neck. After the murder he stole from Ms Banks' body and then met a friend for a drink. Tiffin, who muttered obscenities at Ms Banks' grieving family and complained they were looking at him in court, was jailed for life with a minimum of 24 years. Judge James Goss QC told Tiffin: 'It was a savage and sustained attack and you subjected her to pain and suffering before her death. 'No sentence of this court can undo or compensate for the loss you have caused. 'Not only has a good life been horrifically cut short but those left behind will suffer that loss for the rest of their lives.” Crime scene: Robert Tiffin waited until Lisa Banks was alone in the Sole'O barber shop on Nile Street in North Shields (pictured) before carrying out a frenzied knife attack. He stabbed and slashed her 27 times . Ms Banks, who was expecting her first grandchild at the time of her murder, met Tiffin in 2011 and they were married within months. Her family disapproved of the relationship, however, and tried to persuade her to leave him, the court was told. Eventually Ms Banks did move out of their flat on Nile Street, North Shields, and went to live with her daughter nearby. But Tiffin continued to bother her, with Ms Banks telling her family that retained contact in order to keep the peace. The court heard how, on September 7 last year, Tiffin waited for Ms Banks' employer to leave the shop before attacking her. It is thought he may have used a kitchen knife from his flat to brutally murder his wife, with most of the wounds inflicted while she was lying on the ground. She had 11 slashes to her neck and head, two stab wounds to her chest and 14 to her arms. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard how Lisa Banks - a 46-year-old mother-of-two - had already left Robert Tiffin after growing tired of his violent and controlling behaviour, including a recent threat to behead her . Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said the owner of the barbers, Bruce Jeffrey, found Ms Banks' body the next day. He said: 'There she was lying in the staff room, very obviously dead...The hot tap was running and there was a trail of blood leading from the shop to Tiffin’s flat.' Prosecutors said Tiffin went back to the murder scene afterwards, stealing Ms Banks' £130 wages and jewellery. After the murder Tiffin tried to pay for a bus fare to Newcastle with a blood-soaked £5 note, before visiting a former parter in Whitley Bay and then going drinking. He was arrested the next day.","Robert Tiffin, 46, admitted killing hairdresser Lisa Banks in frenzied attack .

Georgia lawmakers on Tuesday voted to allow bars and churches to decide for themselves whether to let gun owners carry weapons into their buildings. The measure heads for the state Senate after the members of Georgia's House of Representatives approved the legislation with a 119-56 vote, according to the chamber's Twitter account. The rights of gun owners became a major political issue in 2012, when the United States experienced a rash of mass shootings, including a massacre that claimed the lives of 20 first-graders and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut. Lock and load: With state Senate approval, Georgia will become one of several states that allows guns in bars . Gun-control and gun-rights advocates have turned their respective efforts to statehouses after gun control legislation stalled in the U.S. Congress. Under the Georgia bill, churches and bars would be allowed to decide whether to allow weapons inside their buildings, according to the legislation's sponsor, Rep. Rick Jasperse, a Republican. 'We don't need to be penalizing law-abiding citizens and taking away their Second Amendment rights,' Jasperse said, referring to the U.S. Constitution's right to bear arms. The legislation would also allow secondary schools to decide whether to allow teachers and administrators to carry weapons. Sponsor: The bill's sponsor, Rick Jasperse, says people have a Constitutional right to bring guns into bars . Georgia is one of several states either considering - or that already - allowing guns in bars. The first state that voted to allow guns bars was Tennessee in 2009, followed by Arizona, also in 2009. In Arizona, bar owners have the right to not allow guns into their businesses, but they are required to put a government-issued sign in the window explaining that guns are not allowed. Twenty states' laws don't address the issue of guns in bars, which conceivably means people can carry guns in bars if they have the proper permits. Arizona: In Arizona, bar owners who don't want guns in their businesses are forced to put a government-issued sign in the window . 'The legislation does not represent the majority of people of Georgia, but only a small number of gun advocates,' said Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, a Democrat who voted against the bill. If the bill passes, gun owners will also be able to take their weapons into governmental buildings if security screenings are not in place, but guns would remain prohibited in courthouses and prisons.","The bill would let bars and churches decide whether they want to allow guns inside .

A pensioner fought off three raiders with her walking stick after they stormed into her home and threatened her ill husband. Margaret Holding, 66, who lives with her seriously ill husband Reginald, 72, was forced to act when the gang entered her home in Tern Hill, Shropshire, on Tuesday. The raiders told the pensioner they had seen a man run into the couple's semi-detached property and they were trying to catch him. But Mrs Holding didn't believe their story and threatened the gang with her stick until they left. Margaret Holding, 66, threatened a gang of three that stormed her home with her stick until they ran away . Mr Holding, a retired plumber, who suffers from heart, kidney and lung problems as well as diabetes, was upstairs at the time and phoned the police from the bedroom. After Mrs Holding forced two of the men out of the back door, she then pursued a third raider who ran upstairs and started rifling through the couple's bedroom. The retired hotel manager again used her stick to force the man out of her house. All three of the gang fled the house empty-handed. Another man who was acting as a look-out in the garden also ran away. The gang entered the woman's home through a back door and said they'd seen a man running into the house . Mrs Holding said: 'We had left the back door open as our nephew might have popped in but when we heard a noise and called out there was no answer. 'When we went out to the hall we saw the men, it was really scary. I saw one of the men go upstairs so up I went with the walking stick. 'They were trying to claim someone was hiding under the bed or behind the wardrobe but I said ""that’s impossible"". I said: ""Get out now, get out now before I hit you"". 'He was saying: ""don’t hit me, don’t hit me, don’t hit me"", and I was saying: ""I’m going to hit you, I’m going to hit you, I’m going to hit you"". Margaret Holding, pictured with her ill husband Reginald, 72, said she is convinced the gang would have hurt the couple if she didn't act . 'I didn’t want to hit him because I was worried what the other would do to my husband, otherwise I would definitely have hit him. 'The men were very threatening and I am convinced if I hadn’t done anything they would have hurt myself and my husband. 'He then went downstairs and I went into another room, where another one was, and I told him to get him out. I threatened to hit him too. I should have hit him. 'Luckily they left through the back door, they seemed quite frightened. 'I attacked the men to protect my poorly husband, who needs oxygen 15 hours a day. I was more concerned about him because he’s not in good health. 'I’d do it again if they came back. We were both really shook up afterwards. Police are now hunting the men - described as white and in their early 20s . 'It was frightening at the time because everything is happening so quickly. I just wanted them out and I got them out. 'They could have turned nasty. But right now I just feel angry, angry that they have been in my house.' West Mercia Police are hunting three men who are described as white and in their early 20s. Two are thought to have Irish accents. All were wearing dark clothing. A force spokesman said: 'Thankfully, when the elderly woman picked up her walking stick and asked the three men to leave they all decided to take note of her warnings and flee the scene. 'The three men ran back out of the rear door where it seems a fourth man had been waiting for them. The men all then made off on foot and were not seen again.

A fifty-seven stone 'gentle giant' died following a five-hour battle to dismantle part of his home to get him to hospital. Popular former wrestler Clive Carpenter, 61, who went by the name Car-gantula, was taken ill on Christmas Eve during the fire service strike, died following a rescue operation to free him. The operation involved four ambulances arriving at his home in a quiet cul-de-sac in Dover, Kent, and nine paramedics working together to try to get him out of the house. Paramedics had to allegedly place Mr Carpenter into a specialist larger-size ambulance outside his house . He died in hospital on Boxing Day, two days after the rescue operation. Clive, a divorcee who lived alone, had diabetes and had not been out of his house for three years, according to neighbours. His next door neighbour Geraldine Rudge, 63, who was friends with Clive for more than 30 years, explained how the wrestler's daughter Beverley called 999 for help. She said the first 999 call was made at 5pm on Christmas Eve and he arrived at hospital at 10.20pm that evening - more than five hours later. She said: 'He was not feeling too good, so his daughter Beverley called the ambulance. She had called round to see him. 'The paramedics weren't happy with his breathing so they wanted to take him into hospital but unfortunately, because he was so big, they had to call for a specialist ambulance.' Clive was a professional wrestler during the 1980s and fought household names of the sport . The rescue team, which didn't involve firefighters as they were on strike, went inside the three-storey townhouse where they found Clive lying on the floor in the lounge. Mrs Rudge said: 'He was lying on the floor, he couldn't sit because he was so big. They lifted Clive onto a specialist board, it wasn't a normal stretcher. 'It was like the sort of thing you see in a mountain rescue operation. 'It had a sling and a harness attached to it which helped keep Clive in place on the board so he didn't fall off of it. 'He was a lovely bloke, smashing. Everybody in the neighbourhood knew him' Clive Carpenter's neighbour, Geraldine Rudge . 'But they had to get him down a small flight of stairs which lead from the lounge to the front door. His son Scott was sawing off the banisters to widen the area. 'They also had to remove some panels from either side of the stairway so they could get him out of the house. It just wasn't wide enough because of Clive's size. 'He was lifted over the stairs and then carried out to an ambulance. There were nine ambulance workers involved.' Mrs Rudge, who was with Clive's two children Beverley, 41, and Scott, 36, when the tragedy happened, said the paramedics had to place him into a specialist larger-size ambulance outside his house. Mrs Rudge said she believed the popular man died of heart failure. Clive was a professional wrestler during the 1980s and fought household names of the sport, such as Big Daddy, all over the world. But when he retired his weight began to gradually increase. Mrs Rudge added: 'He was already a big guy but when he finished wrestling he became larger and larger. He tried to get help, but he loved his food. He was happy. 'He struggled to move about, he couldn't leave the house. It became worse over the past five years. 'I used to see him every day for a chat and bring him shopping.' She said he was diagnosed with diabetes about five years ago and last left the house three years ago. Paying tribute to her friend, Mrs Rudge hailed him as a 'gentle giant'. She added: 'He was a lovely bloke, smashing. 'Everybody in the neighbourhood knew him. He loved his fishing but hadn't gone out to do that for a long while.'","Clive Carpenter had diabetes and 'had not been outside for three years'

A sales clerk at a luxury mall has opened up about the 'culture shock' she experiences serving affluent customers who spend exorbitantly without batting an eye. Carmen Maria Machado, who works at a mall outside Philadelphia, wrote in the New Yorker that watching absurdly wealthy shoppers casually purchase luxury goods has had a negative psychological impact on her, leaving her depressed, antisocial and disinterested in other people. The writer explains: 'The mingling of my financial status and . my customers' abundant wealth results in a kind of daily culture shock . to which I have yet to adapt.' Culture shock: Carmen Maria Machado, a sales clerk at a mall outside Philadelphia, has explained that watching wealthy shoppers casually purchase luxury goods has had a negative psychological impact . Explaining that she earns about ten dollars an hour, Ms Machado writes: 'Every day, I park my run-down car among BMWs and hybrids. The mall rats who hover around the doors smoking cigarettes wear brands of designer jeans I've only ever heard about in songs.' On an average day she watches wealthy shoppers of all ages casually spend more money than she could ever dream of. One such customer was an eleven-year-old girl who came into the store and nonchalantly purchased $50 worth of high-end moisturizers. Another was a man in his twenties who bought a pair of shoes that cost more than her own monthly rent. And the most memorable customer of all was a woman who purchased every single product Ms Machado recommended without checking a single price tag. 'She had just walked in, just because,' explains the writer. 'And she didn't look at the price of anything, not for a second. It just looked so easy.' After coming home from a day of work at the mall, Ms Machado reports feeling depressed, anxious, dissociated and 'utterly immune to it all'. What's more, she finds herself feeling antisocial and indifferent about others and their needs. The . above symptoms are not unique to Ms Machado; according to recent . research, this type of emotional numbness is experienced by countless . others who are constantly exposed to money. 'She had walked in just because, and she didn't look at the price of anything. It just looked so easy' Indeed, a 2006 Science Magazine study called The Psychological Consequences of Money found that overly exposing people to money has the effect of making them 'disinterested' in others. 'Reminders of money, relative to . nonmoney reminders, led to reduced requests for help and reduced . helpfulness toward others,' reads the study. It continues: 'Participants primed with money preferred to play . alone, work alone, and put more physical distance between themselves and . a new acquaintance.' Not . only does witnessing others' wealth make people depressed and . disinterested, but comparing others' wealth to our own may also affect a . person's happiness. Financial disparity: 'There is something shocking about working in a place like this,' Ms Machado writes. 'It is the presence of money - lots of it - and the ease with which it moves around me' A 2011 study published in Psychological Science found that Americans are happier when 'national wealth is distributed more evenly than when it is distributed unevenly'. This is because increased financial inequality makes us less trustworthy and less convinced that we live in a fair society, according to the research. For the wealthiest 20per cent, however, levels of income equality was not found to affect their happiness. 'There's something shocking about the presence of lots of money, and the ease with which it moves around me' While the economy may be in recovery, research has found that the wealthy have reaped the benefits of the recovery much more than the poor and middle-class. As a retail worker, Ms Machado is an extreme case of someone witnessing firsthand the financial disparity between the rich and the not-so-rich, meaning her case is perhaps more elevated than the average American. Still, it sheds light on a phenomenon affecting almost everyone, to varying degrees. 'There is something shocking about working in a place like this, especially around the holidays,' she writes. 'It is the presence of money - lots of it, more than I have ever seen in one place before - and the ease with which it moves around me.'",Carmen Maria Machado makes $10 an hour working as a sales clerk at a luxury mall outside Philadelphia .

Backlash: David Cameron was criticised over the weekend for only releasing a partial list of guests at his country retreat . The public are ‘right to be suspicious’ about David Cameron’s refusal to name all of his guests at Chequers, the former sleaze watchdog said. Sir Alistair Graham said the Prime Minister risks ‘damaging public trust’ unless he reveals the full list of those wined and dined at his grace and favour country retreat. Mr Cameron faced a backlash at the weekend after releasing a partial list of Chequers guests, which does not include those whose hospitality was paid for by the Conservative Party. Critics said the decision meant the public could be kept in the dark about secret lobbying by businessmen, supporters and donors. Tory sources tried to neutralise the row by revealing no significant donors had attended meals at Chequers since at least March 2012. They pointed out that – unlike Ed Miliband – Mr Cameron has kept his pledge to list all dinners with party donors. But Sir Alistair, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘If David Cameron is serious about transparency, as he says he is, then he should make available the names of all those coming to Chequers, apart from purely private family and friends. ‘The point about transparency is that we need to know who has access to the Prime Minister, regardless of who paid their dinner bill. Until we have got that the public are right to be suspicious.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman declined to say how many Chequers guests the Tory Party had paid for. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said there was a growing perception Mr Cameron was using Chequers to host ‘some sort of play-date for top Tory donors’. Grace and favour: Mr Cameron, centre, is pictured at Chequers last year meeting Afghan president Asid Ali Zardari and Afghan president Hamid Karzai . But Tory sources accused Labour of ‘rank hypocrisy’, pointing out that Ed Miliband had failed to publish regular lists of meetings with union barons and other donors since pledging to in 2012. Details released by Conservative Central Office reveal Mr Cameron has hosted no meals at his official residences for major donors since the ‘dinners for donors’ row in March 2012, when he was forced to admit seeing at least 15 donors – who had given the party £23million – in a series of secret lunches and dinners at Number 10 and Chequers. However, Chancellor George Osborne held a dinner in his Downing Street flat in October 2012 for City tycoon Michael Spencer, a major Tory donor who called for the abolition of the 50p top tax rate. The data also reveals Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and other ministers have attended several dinners with businessmen who give more than £50,000 a year to the Tories.","David Cameron was criticised for releasing a partial list of Chequers guests .

Three people are dead and 31 are missing after a Quebec nursing home burned to the ground early Thursday morning. Flames engulfed the 52-unit complex in L’Isle Verte, about 140 miles north of Quebec City. Three are confirmed dead, but officials fear the death toll will rise as only five of the home’s residence did not require round-the-clock care. A further 20 people were rescued from the inferno that saw flames shooting several stories into the air as firefighters battled extreme temperatures dropping below zero. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Three are dead and more than 30 missing as a result of the raging fire . 'A night in hell': A local fire chief called the combination of raging flames and bitter cold hellish . ‘A night of hell,’ ‘Fire Chief Yvan Charron told Dimanche. Authorities spoke Thursday of the grim reality now facing the tiny town of just over 1,500 people. ‘About 31 people are on the list of people that Quebec police are looking for. This is very bad news because they have challenges moving around. It is very bad news,’ said Francois Lapointe, the member of Parliament for the area. ‘We're down to hoping that some of those 31 people were not there.’ The majority of the unaccounted for people are confined to wheelchairs and walkers, some of them have Alzheimer’s disease, acting mayor Ginette Caron added. Engulfed: The nursing homes west wing was completely engulfed in flames and burned to the ground. Killer inferno: The fire is confirmed to have taken three lives . Haunting: A neighbor told media he watched a man try in vain to save his mother's life, he instead watched her burn to death . ‘These are elderly, some of which are very limited mobility,’ Mr Charron added. ‘Others were afraid and they hid under blankets.’ Mario Michaud, who lives across from the scorched nursing home, told Dimanche of the horror he witnessed after waking up just before 12:30 a.m. ‘I saw smoke. The fire started on the second floor… I saw the fire fighters,’ he said. ‘A woman on the second floor was shouting and she went out on to the balcony. Her son went to get a ladder but he couldn't get to her. She burned to death. ‘Her boy, he broke down.’ He added to the Globe and Mail. ‘It wasn’t pretty.’ No escape: Many of the more than 30 residents missing or unaccounted for were infirm and unable to move without a wheelchair or walker, a local official said . Terrifying: Another local said he watched as a woman's balcony caved in - the collapse dragged her from safety and back into the out of control fire . Volunteer fire fighters from at least 20 separate barracks responded to the blaze, according to Dimanche. They had to battle both the towering flames and temperatures plunging to minus five Fahrenheit. Their efforts were not able to keep the complex from completely burning to the ground. ‘Some are still looking for their parents but we’re certain that our mother has died,’ another local told the Globe and Mail. ‘She was on the balcony and there was too much smoke … the building has collapsed so she’s still in the rubble.’ Authorities have said it will take several hours to sift through the charred building for victims. Another woman was found wracked with guilt outside the blaze – she had recently placed her parents in the facility. ‘I didn't send my parents to see them burn there,’ Marielle Marquis, the president of a local seniors club, recalled to the Globe and Mail. Devastating: A firefighter appears to be in disbelief at what he's seeing the day after a fire tore through the nursing home and the water used to fight the blaze formed a thick glaze over the smoldering remains . Bitter cold: Temperatures plunged well below freezing, and howling winds dropped wind chills down to as low as minus-20 Fahrenheit at times . Frosted: The charred remains were covered in ice by sunrise . The 20 residents rescued from the raging fire lived in the complex’s newer east wing, the Globe and Mail reported. It had a firewall that blocked the flames from reaching them.’ The building’s older wing touts an automatic sprinkler system on its website, but official filings show it has only partial sprinklers, according to the Globe and Mail. The facility was first opened in 1997, according to the Montreal Gazette. A cause has not yet been determined. Canada’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on the tragedy. 'On behalf of the entire country, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who passed away following the fire at a seniors’ residence in eastern Quebec last night,’ he said. ‘My thoughts and prayers are also with those who remain unaccounted for and all those who have been injured.’ Frozen: The brutal cold froze all of the water used to try to douse the flames . Where to begin?: A police officer walks past through the devastation the after the nursing home burned to the ground . Search underway: Fire fighters now begin the grueling task of searching through the charred, ice covered building for victims of the killer fire . Quebec Premier Pauline Marois offered her condolences from Davos, Switzerland. ‘I want to extend my condolences to all the families affected by this terrible fire,’ she said. ‘I have been in touch with my office and we are doing everything we can to support the community and families. ‘It’s a private center but we’re talking about human beings, so we’ll do whatever we can.

House Majority leader John Boehner has rented his DC apartment from a tanning bed lobbyist. The perpetually-tan Republican from Ohio has repeatedly denied that he has ever gone to a tanning salon. It has long been known for years that Boehner has rented his two bedroom basement apartment in DC from John Milne, a lobbyist. Hot property: Boehner pays $1,600 in rent for a 2-bedroom basement apartment in DC that is owned by a lobbyist . Now it has been revealed that one of the groups that Milne represents is the American Suntanning Association. The Daily Caller reported the connection between Milne and the tanning booth group but Boehner's ties to Milne were originally reported by The Washington Post in 2006 when he was the House Majority leader and President George W. Bush was in office. Connections: Boehner has known lobbyist John Milne (pictured) for years ever since the Ohio Republican met Milne's wife Debra Anderson in the 1990s . At the time, Boehner's spokesman stressed that though Boehner had known Milne's wife, Debra Anderson, since the 1990s, their friendship had never been used to enhance his lobbying interests. 'John Milne does not lobby John Boehner on any issue and has not lobbied him on any issue during the time period in which John has been renting the property,' Boehner's then-spokesman Don Seymour told The Post in 2006. One of the new high-profile clients that Milne has taken on since then was the American Suntanning Association, and they hired Milne’s company, mCapitol, to represent them for $90,000 earlier this year. They undoubtedly wanted the company to fight for their interests when it was revealed that the Affordable Care Act includes a proposed 10 per cent sales tax against tanning beds. In reference to the newfound, Milne told The Daily Caller that there has never been any salon-style bed in the house where Boehner rents. 'There is not nor has there ever been a tanning bed in the residence!' Milne wrote in an email. In spite of Boehner's unseasonable complexion- and this new connection to tanning enthusiasts- he has repeatedly denied ever using such a contraption to get his unusual glow. The perpetually-tan Republican from Ohio has repeatedly denied that he has ever gone to a tanning salon . This is not the first time that Milne and Boehner have had overlapping interests as mCapitol has represented a number of clients in the restaurant industry. They would have been especially interested in the Small Business Tax Fairness Act- of which Boehner was one of the co-sponsors. Though Boehner’s spokesman may deny the role their personal relationship has influenced whatever work they have done together, those connections are a major selling point for the company itself. ‘At mCapitol Management, we specialize in forging business and government relationships for our clients,’ the company’s website states.","Boehner has repeatedly denied using tanning beds .

Making a statement: Luq Mughal, 21, turned his tuition in using only single dollar bills . A college student in Utah has taken an unusual path for a protest against rising tuition costs by paying for the upcoming semester in single dollar bills. Luq Mughal is a student at the University of Utah and already gets a discounted rate because he is an in-state student and his father is a member of the faculty. He still finds the cost of school to be overwhelming, especially as a new 5 per cent hike was approved by the school's board of trustees. 'The people making the prices are not actually aware of how hard it is on the students,' he told The Salt Lake Tribune. The 21-year-old decided to mark this visual protest because he struggles to meet his financial costs which include cost of living expenses on top of tuition. 'By no means am I the saddest story on campus. Thereâ€™s a lot of people here just as bad and probably worse,' he told the paper. Mr Mughal, who works on the weekends in order to earn his tuition money, had to stop by several different banks in order to collect the 2,000 $1-bills that he needed to make his point when he turned in the money in time for the Tuesday tuition deadline. Rising costs: University of Utah's tuition increased by 5% last year, which is more than the average 2.9% for four-year in-state programs across the country . Effort: Mr Mughal, whose father is a teacher at the university, works weekends to help cover his tuition costs . Though he was alone in his protest this year, more students have given assurances to support him next year. It doesn't seem like the problem is going anywhere either as in-state tuition to the Salt Lake City school has more than doubled over the past decade from $2,742 for the 2002-2003 school year to $6,511 for this years' students. The school did not put out a specific statement in response to the complaints, but told the Salt Lake Tribune that the school is regularly ranked as being one of the highest-value institutions of higher learning. According to The College Board, Utah stands below the national average for public university college tuition. The average annual tuition for a four-year in-state program was $8,893 this year. That rate increased by 2.9 per cent from the 2012-2013 school year.","Luq Mughal, 21, decided to show his anger at the University of Utah's decision to raise tuition by paying his tuition in a tedious way .

A haunting new short film starring Elle Fanning portrays the horrors of bulimia, but some say the depiction is somewhat too accurate. Directed by Rodrigo Prieto with the help of his 19-year-old daughter Ximena, who was anorexic in her early teens, The Likeness stars Elle Fanning as a girl troubled by body image issues as she tries to physically tear her own skin off in self-disgust. But while some claim the film truthfully captures the psychological agony of an eating disorder, others warn that it is more harmful than helpful for those who actually struggle with disordered eating. True life: Directed by Rodrigo Prieto and his daughter Ximena, 19, The Likeness stars Elle Fanning as a girl with body image issues who tries to physically tear her own skin off in self-disgust . Reflection: Suddenly, her face turns into disjointed patches of peeling skin, a horrifying scene that is meant to symbolize the bulimic's distorted self-perception . Lynn Grefe, president of the National Eating Disorders Association, told Today.com: 'The whole feeling of feeling worthless, and ugly - I think it portrays that incredibly well.' She added, however, that the disturbing footage may act as a trigger to someone still struggling with an eating disorder or body image issues. And Ximena agrees. 'I definitely would say if someone is in the midst of dealing with an eating disorder, it's triggering,' she said. 'You’d have to be in a somewhat stable place to confront this emotion.' The eight-minute video begins with a tour of a dark house filled with emaciated models and dazed-looking revelers, none of whom look at the camera as it pans by them. Mr Prieto says that he originally wanted the models to stare at the camera, but he was dissuaded by his daughter. 'Ximena told me no, no, no, the worst . feeling is when everybody ignores you,' he explained. 'That's why nobody . is looking at the camera; everybody is doing their own thing.'

A representative at Project Heal told MailOnline: 'Fanning's character, as she bemoans her own distorted reflection, accurately depicts the way in which someone with body dysmorphia may feel, to see horrifying flaws that truly are not there.' She added, however, that the 'grotesque and harsh' imagery could have a negative effect on people who struggle with disordered eating. 'What I wanted to do is represent what she's feeling and what's in her mind' 'As someone who battled an eating . disorder, we know the horror all too well and watching someone else go . through it can be triggering and overwhelming if not in a good mental . place,' she said.

A Highland castle once said to be haunted by a man hanged for stealing sheep, was placed on the market today for £2.25m. Standing augustly in the centre of Dornoch, the grand building is a stone's throw away from the Scottish town's prestigious golf course and opposite the 12th-century cathedral where Madonna christened her son Rocco. The castle, which dates back to the 15th . century, commands extensive views along the coast towards the beach in . nearby Sutherland and across the Dornoch Firth to the purple hills of . Ross and Cromarty. Haunted castle for sale: Potential buyers who aren't scared by the price might be more worried by stories that the ghost of a sheep thief was seen after being hung. However, a previous owner has had the building exorcised . But despite its great vantage point it was never intended for military purposes and was converted into a hotel in 1947. Dornoch Castle played its part as a school, a jail and a courthouse, but it is perhaps best known for being haunted by a thief called Andrew McCornish who was imprisoned in its dungeons and then killed for snatching ewes and rams. Marion Mackenzie, the daughter of the Sheriff Substitute of Sutherland, was the first person to claim to see McCornish's ghost at the end of the 19th century. She said she saw a grey-haired man with a 'weird face', thick grey stockings and knee breeches sitting in her father's study when she came in from the garden to get some honeycomb for tea one day. When she returned to the room with her family the apparition had gone. Converted castle: The B-grade building in Dornoch, near Sutherland, was given permission to become a hotel in 1947. It boasts a bar with an open fire (pictured) and some of the original brickwork . But the legend says that McCornish's ghost reappeared later that night next to the bed of Marion's uncle, the Minister of Avoch, while he was sleeping. Ms MacKenzie's uncle is reported to have woken up and told the ghost he would call his brother, who was the Sheriff, if he did not go away. The ghost has never been seen since. After listening to his brother and daughter's description of the ghost, Sheriff Mackenzie recognised it as McCornish. Despite Andrew's disappearance, the castle's new owner in 1922 took no chances and had the building exorcised before moving in. Rising above the town: Dornoch cathedral is at the heart of the Scottish town and Madonna had her son Rocco christened here in 2003 . The property was renamed Dornoch Castle Hotel in 1947 and was featured in a programme about haunted hotels on the American Travel Channel in 2003. It was originally built as the home for the Bishops of Caithness and then subsequently gifted to 11th Earl of Sutherland in 1557. Although it was set on fire during a dispute between the McKays and Murrays in 1570 and then rebuilt, some of the original building does remain. Despite being a category B-listed castle, which means it is of regional importance, permission was granted to turn it into a 25-room hotel. Boasting a restaurant for 90 people and a bar with an open fire, it still features some of the 15th century brickwork and is a popular wedding venue. Just a five-minute walk away lies the Dornoch Firth, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, making it a prime spot for twitchers, walkers and cyclists to visit. Taking a swing: Golfers tee off at the prestigious Dornoch club which is only a short hit away from the castle . Visitors with small planes and helicopters can also make use of the nearby Dornoch Airstrip. Kevin Maley of Strutt & Parker who are selling the property said: 'Dornoch Castle Hotel is a quite stunning building, full of atmosphere and history, yet it also has all the luxuries one could expect from modern life. 'From general tourism to sports specific visitors and also weddings, this is a great opportunity for someone who wants to enter the hospitality industry or expand their portfolio.' Prices for castles vary sharply from £375,000 which was asked for Kilmartin Castle in Scotland to the medieval Tulira Castle in County Galway, Ireland which was put up for sale for £5.5 million.","Built around end of 15th century, castle given to Earl of Sutherland in 1557 .

The last time that Scarlett Lewis saw her son Jesse, he was writing the words 'I love you' on her frosty car door before he went off to school. The mother-of two captured the six-year-old grinning next to his handiwork, a picture that she now holds close to her. Jesse was one of 20 children killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook elementary school last Friday. A portion of an interview with Jesse's father Neil Heslin aired on Wednesday night, where the visibly shaken dad talked about how his young son was so excited about Christmas. 'I don’t have much family so it’s kind of a quiet time for me he made Christmas happy for me and joyful and I said to him “Jess, we'll make it as best we can” and the next day the tragedy happened, it occurred and I thought “Boy was he wrong about that,”’ Mr Heslin said on CNN. Heartbreaking loss: Jesse Lewis, six, was one of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre where 20 children and six adults died . Mother's love: Scarlett Lewis, 44, described her beloved son Jesse as a blessing and a gift . Jesse's mother holds on to her final- and favorite- memories of her son include the times they spent cuddling up together to read a book before they drifted off to sleep in the same bed. She told People: . 'With Jesse, I have absolutely no regrets. I loved him to pieces, he . knew it, and I knew he loved me to pieces. That is a blessing. Jesse was . a gift.' Ms Lewis, who did not live with Mr Heslin, had planned to leave work early on Friday so that she could go to school to make gingerbread houses with her youngest son, who was excitedly awaiting the Christmas tradition. The mother first heard news of the shooting at around 9.30am on Friday when a friend texted her but was not initially worried. However she decided to follow Jesse's father  to the school. When she arrived, the roads were packed with traffic as desperate parents tried to find their children. Ms Lewis told the magazine of her rising panic when she could not find Jesse anywhere. Amid the confusion, the mother ran to a house next to the school where she had been told some children who escaped had been taken in. Jesse was not among them. Brave boy: Neil Heslin (left) was told by state troopers that Jesse ran into danger and had been trying to help other children . Far from joyful: Neil Heslin said that his son Jesse Lewis was really excited to Christmas, saying it was going to be the 'best one ever', but now that Jesse is dead Heslin says that is far from the truth . Ms Lewis and Mr Heslin returned to the firehouse . for the agonizing wait to find out what had happened to their son. She told People: 'I just kind of knew. All the other kids were . gone; we're just sitting there.' Jesse's extended family began to gather - uncles, aunts and grandparents. Ms Lewis's other son, 12-year-old JT, arrived after being collected from school. The boy sobbed as he waited for news of his younger brother while Ms Lewis said she somehow found the strength to reassure her son. The family waited for hours as daylight faded, hugging each other for support and holding on to hope while they waited for news. Ms Lewis gave authorities a description of Jesse - his cropped, brown hair, jeans, stripy shirt and sneakers. A doctor finally broke the news to the family that there had been no survivors among the missing children. Victims: Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner. Second row: (L-R) Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski. Third row: (L-R) Daniel Barden, Jack Pinto, Catherine Hubbard, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler. Fourth row: (L-R) Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: (L-R) Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza . Jesse Lewis was one of the first-graders who had been hidden in a closet by teacher Victoria Soto when the first gunshots rang out at the elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. When the gunman entered the classroom looking for the children, he came face-to-face with 27-year-old Miss Soto who tried to throw him off by saying the children were in the auditorium at the other end of the building. However six of the children then tried to run from their hiding place and were shot dead by the gunman. Miss Soto and a teacher's aide were also killed. Mr Heslin was told by state troopers that from the way his son Jesse had been found, it was clear the six-year-old had run into the face of danger to help other children get away. The father told the New York Post: 'I wish my kid stayed put. But that’s . Jesse. I can see him making that choice and just doing something. My boy . died the way I would have died if I was in that position. 'Jesse grew up on a farm. He’s tough. That would be my little guy to try to get out of there.' Distraught: Gene Rosen, a retired psychologist and grandfather, told how a distraught mother had come to his door looking for her son but he was not there . Twenty-eight people died in the shooting rampage, including 20 children all aged six and seven, six adults at the school, the gunman who took his own life and his mother Nancy Lanza, who was shot before the massacre. A retired psychologist who lives next door to the school described earlier this week how he was leaving his home when he discovered six children sitting in a neat semicircle at the end of his driveway. Gene Rosen, 69, took the four girls and two boys into his home, and over the next few hours gave them toys, listened to their stories and called their frantic parents. A couple of hours after the last child left, a knock came on his door. It was a frantic mother who had heard that some children had taken refuge there. She was looking for her little boy. 'Her face looked frozen in terror,' Mr Rosen recalled, breaking down in tears. 'She thought maybe a miracle from God would have the child at my house,' he said. Later, 'I looked at the casualty list ... and his name was on it.'

A federal judge today found that the National Security Agency's wholesale collection of millions of Americans' phone records is legal and a valuable part of the nation's arsenal to combat terrorism. U.S. District Judge William Pauley said in a written opinion that the program ‘represents the government's counter-punch’ to eliminate al-Qaida's terror network by connecting fragmented and fleeting communications. In ruling, the judge noted the September 11 attacks and how the phone data-collection system could have helped investigators connect the dots before the attacks occurred. Justified: .S. District Judge William Pauley found that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' phone records is legal and a valuable part of the nation's arsenal to combat terrorism . Massive haul: The NSA-run programs pick up millions of telephone and Internet records that are routed through American networks each day . The government learned from its mistake and adapted to confront a new enemy: a terror network capable of orchestrating attacks across the world. ‘It launched a number of counter-measures, including a bulk telephony metadata collection program - a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data,’ he said. Pauley's decision contrasts with a ruling earlier this month by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, who granted a preliminary injunction against the collecting of phone records of two men who had challenged the program. The Washington jurist said the 'almost Orwellian' program likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search.

Different opinion: U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon granted a preliminary injunction earlier this month against the collecting of phone records of two men . ‘We are pleased with the decision,’ Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. In . arguments before Pauley last month, an ACLU lawyer had argued that the . government's interpretation of its authority under the Patriot Act was . so broad that it could justify the mass collection of financial, health . and even library records of innocent Americans without their knowledge. A government lawyer had countered that counterterrorism investigators wouldn't find most personal information useful. Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in response to revelations about secret program made by NSA analyst Edward Snowden (pictured) The ACLU sued earlier this year after former NSA analyst Edward Snowden leaked details of the secret programs that critics say violate privacy rights. The NSA-run programs pick up millions of telephone and Internet records that are routed through American networks each day. In a 54-page decision, Pauley said the program 'vacuums up information about virtually every telephone call to, from, or within the United States.' ut he said the program's constitutionality 'is ultimately a question of reasonableness,' and that there was no evidence that the government had used ""bulk telephony metadata"" for any reason other than to investigate and disrupt terrorist attacks. 'Technology allowed al Qaeda to operate decentralized and plot international terrorist attacks remotely,' Pauley wrote. 'The bulk telephony metadata collection program represents the government's counter-punch.' President Barack Obama has defended the surveillance program, but indicated a willingness to consider constraints. The ACLU had no immediate comment. The White House was not immediately available for comment. A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman said the department is pleased with the decision. ep.

The nine year-old boy who made it past security and onto a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas may have been on his way to visit someone he met online. The child made it to at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport by himself, slipped through a security checkpoint and then . boarded a Delta Air Lines flight before he was discovered by suspicious flight attendants. When Las Vegas police met the boy upon landing he told them that he had a 'video game buddy' who lived in the city who he was there to visit. Leaving: A 9-year-old runaway passed through this security checkpoint at Minneapolis airport without a ticket . A security video shows the boy at the airport terminal on Wednesday, the day before his trip, officials said. He . took a bag from the carousel that did not belong to him and ordered . lunch at a restaurant outside of the security checkpoints, MAC spokesman . Patrick Hogan said. He ate and then told the server he had to use the bathroom, left the bag and never returned to pay. The owner of the bag was identified . and the bag was returned to him, Mr Hogan said. At this point, this is a . Delta and [Transport Security Administration] issue,' he added. 'This . is a rare incident.' In a statement to Minneapolis TV station KARE-11, Delta officials said: 'We are investigating the incident and cooperating with the agencies involved.' Leaving: The runaway boy flew to Las Vegas from Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport on a Delta plane like this one, pictured. It was only discovered mid-air that he had no ticket . KARE-11 reported that authorities believe the nine-year-old boy is a runaway from the Twin Cities. 'He had to pass three levels of security,' said Terry Trippler, an air travel expert with ThePlaneRules.com, to the TV station. 'He had to pass three levels of security.

'You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment.' Mr Tippler said that security introduced after 9/11 obviously still has major flaws. 'While we are safer in the air, this proves there are still gaping holes,' he added. According to a surveillance video, . at 10.37am, the unaccompanied boy arrived at the airport on a . southbound light-rail car.

Trey Radel, the Florida congressman who pleaded guilty to a cocaine charge in November, has resigned from Congress despite his earlier promise to forge ahead and remain in his job. He delivered a resignation letter to House speaker John Boehner on Monday. 'Unfortunately, some of my struggles had serious consequences,' he wrote. 'While I have dealt with those issues on a personal level, it is my belief that I cannot fully and effectively serve as a United States Representative to the place I call home, Southwest Florida.' Radel, a former radio talk show host and television journalist, took a leave of absence from the House of Representatives after a stint in rehab. It was unlikely that the first-term Republican would run for re-election. Several challengers have cropped up in . his heavily Republican Naples, Florida district, including Sean . Hannity, the popular talk show host and Fox News Channel personality. Scroll down for video and Radel's letter . Rep. Henry 'Trey' Radel  pleaded guilty in November to buying cocaine and now plans to resign from Congress . Sean Hannity has the nation's second-largest radio audience and a hit evening show on Fox News, but he could trade it all away for a chance to put his conservative beliefs into practice as a U.S. congressman . The Tampa Bay Times reports that Hannity 'has spoken to people about running for Congress from Naples.' Asked about the possibility during his January 22 Fox broadcast, he conceded, 'The answer is yes, I think about it.' Hannity . will be in Washington on Tuesday to attend President Obama's State of . the Union address as a guest of hyper-conservative Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert. Also in the mix is former state representative Paige Kreegel, who finished third to Radel in a 2012 primary and has the support of a super PAC with $1 million already in its coffers. Former Rep. Connie Mack – who held Radel's seat until last year, may also run to replace Radel. The congressman's office confirmed his departure on Monday but didn't offer further comment. A House Republican source told MailOnline that the timing of the congressman's resignation is related to an investigation by the House Office of Congressional Ethics, which was poised to recommend official sanctions against Radel. That committee will now cease its work without issuing a formal report. The investigation was triggered by an OCE rule requiring action, or a written explanation of why no action was taken, within 30 days. Zoned out: Radel has appeared in the past alongside prominent GOP leaders like House Speaker John Boehner  (L) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R), but his days in the limelight may be over . Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics . in Washington, a liberal-leaning watchdog group, demanded an . investigation on November 21, the day after he entered his guilty plea . in court. 'Rep. Radel's resignation is welcome, though overdue,' the organization's president,Melanie Sloan, said Monday. 'The timing, however, is certainly suspicious.' 'Why now? It’s not as if the Republican leadership just learned of the cocaine bust over the weekend. It seems possible his resignation is intended to stymie the ethics investigation that might have elicited damaging information about other members of Congress and congressional staff.' Congressman Hannity? He's admitted that the thought has crossed his mind . The Republican . Party of Florida had called for Radel's resignation shortly after he . announced his entry into an intensive inpatient drug rehab program. He pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in November, and drew a one-year probation sentence. 'I'm profoundly sorry to let down my family, particularly my wife and son, and the people of Southwest Florida,' he wrote on Facebook after his arrest for buying 3.5 grams of coke from an undercover police officer on October 29.. 'I struggle with the disease of alcoholism, and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice. As the father of a young son and a husband to a loving wife, I need to get help so I can be a better man for both of them.' Lee County, Florida Sheriff Mike Scott, a Republican, has been a source of unrelenting pressure on Radel since his public troubles began. 'While Radel returned to his Congressional office following a microwave stint in rehab and a gaggle of rehearsed apologies, I have hundreds of inmates in our jail that are unable to return to their home due to similar or lesser drug offenses,"" Scott wrote this month on Facebook. 'The sad reality is that Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress. I have fired Deputies for less.'

An Indiana teenager who helped save two children after they fell into an icy reservoir in 2010 was killed on Sunday in a tragic shooting in an Indianapolis suburb at the hands of one of her own friends. Aubrey Peters, 16, was pronounced dead at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis late Sunday after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest inside Noblesville home, police said. Noblesville Police Lt. Bruce Barnes said officers arrived at the home shortly before 11:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a person shot. He said they found Peters unresponsive. Scroll Down for Video . Tragic: Aubrey Peters, 16, was allegedly shot dead by her friend at his family home on Sunday night after they were fooling around with handguns inside the house . Police questioned three other people who were inside the house and arrested Jacob Travis McDaniel, 20, on preliminary charges of reckless homicide and pointing a firearm. McDaniel appeared in Hamilton County Superior Court today where a probably cause affidavit outlined how the 20-year-old was showing Peters a shotgun and handgun immediately before she was fatally shot. One witness, Dajuan Williams, said that 'McDaniel tried to get Aubrey to hold the gun, but she didn't want to,' reported the Indianapolis Star. It was at that point that McDaniel dropped the magazine from the handgun, pointed it directly at Peters, took the safety off and pulled the trigger. Charged: Jacob McDaniel , 20, has been charged with reckless homicide after his friend, Aubrey Peters, 16, died of a gunshot wound at his family home on Sunday . Court documents from today said that McDaniel though the gun was not loaded, but instead a round was fired into Peters' chest. 'Aubrey clutched her chest and said, 'What just happened?' the affidavit says. Panicked, McDaniel tried to concoct a story for the group. 'McDaniel then stated, 'The story is the gun fell off the table and went off,' according to the affidavit. Medics arrived soon after the shooting and failed to revive Peters who was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Vincent's. McDaniel's bond was set at $25,000. He will next appear in court on February 21 for a pretrial hearing. Scene: Aubrey Peters was shot dead at this Noblesville house in Indianapolis on Sunday night after she was reportedly shot by her friend Jacob McDaniel . Peters' grandfather, Randy, who has raised her since she was 8 months old, said the family is devastated. 'She had a 3.9 GPA. A great student, a great kid,' he said. He said he doesn't know what happened and doesn't know McDaniel. He said his granddaughter left home Sunday to study. The American Red Cross of Greater Indianapolis honored Peters in 2011 for helping to save two young girls who had fallen through the ice on Morse Reservoir the year before. Hero: In 2010 Peters and her grandparents rescued sisters Sydney, (pictured left, aged 4) and Jessica Moore (pictured right, aged 7) from a frozen reservoir behind their home .

One girl reached shore safely, but Peters' grandfather pulled the other out and resuscitated her. Peters told WISH-TV at the time that seeing the girls struggle in the water was 'terrifying.' 'It was like watching someone die, and I hated it,' she said. Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Gregson recalled honoring Peters Monday and lamented her death. 'She stood out â€” they always do when they're younger,' Gregson told WRTV.

North Korea fired four suspected short-range missiles into its eastern waters on Thursday, a South Korean defense official said, in an apparent effort to protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military exercises that Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for invasion. The launches, however, weren't expected to raise tension as North Korea routinely tests short-range missiles and it has recently sought better ties with South Korea in what outside analysts say is an attempt to win badly-needed foreign investment and aid. The rival Koreas this month held their first reunions of Korean War-divided families in more than three years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mystery: The North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery . The projectiles that landed off the North's eastern coast were believed to be short-range missiles with a range of more than 200 kilometers (about 125 miles). The South Korean Defense Ministry officials who discussed the launches spoke anonymously, citing ministry rules. The officials said they were trying to learn exactly what North Korea launched and that South Korea has bolstered its monitoring on North Korea. Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified military official, reported the North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery. Tension: The Koreas remain in a state of war, officially (pictured is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un applauding as he is welcomed by members of the military at an undisclosed location) Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North . Korea studies at Seoul's Dongguk University, played down the . significance of the launches, saying the North appears to have intended . to protest the South Korean-U.S. military drills that began Monday or to . grab international attention as there has been little progress over a . push to resume disarmament-for-aid negotiations. Yang . Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in . Seoul, said the North also needs such launches to examine its weapons. Last . year, North Korea furiously reacted to the same South Korean-U.S. military drills by issuing a torrent of fiery rhetoric and threats to . launch nuclear missiles against Seoul and Washington. Last year's drills . came after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test. The U.S. took . the unusual step of sending nuclear-capable bombers in a show of its . resolve to protect its ally. North Korea hasn't issued any harsh rhetoric against the current drills. Pyongyang earlier threatened to scrap the arrangement for the family reunions but later allowed them to proceed after high-level talks with Seoul. South Korea on Monday offered sending vaccines and disinfectants to North Korea after the country recently reported its first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease since April 2011. Earlier Thursday, North Korea presented to the media a South Korean missionary who it says was arrested last year for allegedly trying to establish underground Christian churches in the country. South Korea urged North Korea to quickly release him. The Korean Peninsula officially remains at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Robin Roberts and Josh Elliott had a chance to shake Pope Francis' hand as the two Good Morning America anchors traveled to Vatican City to attend todayâ€™s year-end public mass. Today's mass held in St Peter's Square was the final papal audience of 2013, capping off a year of renewed public popularity due to the new Pope. The anchors were two of thousands that gathered in the square for mass and were lucky to have the Pope shake their hands while he greeted some of the awaiting masses. Papal audience: Josh Elliott and Robin Roberts met Pope Francis during his final public audience of the year today . Robin, who previously visited the Vatican before her bone marrow transplant two years ago, said that she was very emotional during the meeting as she saw it as a reflection of how her life has changed. She told the Pope, whose popularity has surged since he was elected earlier this year, that she has been praying for him every day. Josh tried to connect with the Pontiff on a more personal level, attempting to speak Italian to the 77-year-old. When that failed, he switched over to English and drew on his schoolboy roots from Loyola High School, saying: 'I'm a Jesuit boy.' Jesuit roots: Josh tried using his Italian to make an impression but ended up switching to English and calling himself a fellow 'Jesuit boy' to Pope Francis . No longer live from New York: The anchors remoted in to the normal GMA program . Pope Francis has won over Catholics and atheists alike since being elected in March to replace Pope Benedict and was selected as the Time Magazine Person of the Year. Robin called it 'a profoundly moving experience to say the very, very least.' During their stay, the anchors toured the Vatican, met with the famed Swiss guards who are tasked with protecting the Pope, and interviewed a newlywed American couple. They were in town taking advantage of a program that stipulates that the Pope will meet with any couple who have gotten married in the past three months if they travel to the Vatican, wearing the clothes they got married in and bring their marriage license with them. 'It was amazing to have Pope Francis come up to us personally,' the husband said to GMA. His home team: Pope Francis held the trophy that the Argentinean soccer team San Lorenzo brought to show him at the public audience in honor of their recent win . The cohosts and newlyweds were not the only ones to win some special attention from the head of the church, as he showed his personal biases with a special ceremony on today for his beloved San Lorenzo soccer team after they won the Argentine championship. Today's service was Francis' last general audience for 2013, during which the pope received birthday wishes (it was his birthday yesterday) and someone even offered him a sip of mate, the traditional Argentine tea. The Vatican also released year-end statistics on Francis' papacy, saying at least 1,548,500 tickets had been distributed over the course of Francis' 30 audiences in his first nine months in office. For comparison's sake, 810,000 tickets were distributed in Benedict XVI's first year in 2005, during which he held 32 audiences after his April 19 election. In 2005, the Vatican said 2.85 million people had participated in Benedict's public events that first year, which included all his Masses, Sunday blessings and World Youth Day events in Cologne, Germany. Francis drew 3.7 million people alone to his concluding World Youth Day Mass in Rio de Janeiro in July, though statisticians put the actual figure at less than half that.","The morning news hosts traveled to the Vatican for today's final papal audience of 2013 .

Most daughters idolise their mothers, so when Jessica Smith's four-year-old told her she wanted a 'big tummy' like hers she knew she had to do something drastic about her 18-stone frame. In the days that followed, she went on a strict liquid diet and documented her weight loss by taking daily photos of herself in the same outfit in front of her bedroom mirror. Every day, she'd monitor her progress by flicking through the photos on her smart phone and seeing the visible changes to her waistline. Incredibly, in the first week, she . lost 10 pounds and says the difference in her physical appearance in the . 'day one' picture to the 'day seven' photo was huge. Naturally, . the fantastic results spurred Jessica to continue with her diet, and . six months later the mother-of-three had shed an incredible six stone - . taking her from a size 26 to a svelte 12. Jessica, left, at her goal weight of 11 stone, and at her heaviest of 18 stone, right . Speaking to The Sun she said: 'Taking pictures of myself really helped me track my weight loss. Sometimes it's hard to see the difference when you're looking in the mirror every day and it can be disheartening for slimmers if they can't tell their hard work is paying off. 'Like most people on diets, at times you can get depressed and there's a temptation to pig out if you're not seeing the effects of your hard work quick enough. But my timeline of pics on my phone helped me to stay focussed and on the straight and narrow. 'I was devastated when my beautiful daughter told me she wanted to be fat like me and I didn't want her grow up thinking obesity was normal. 'Overweight people need to know the effect their lifestyle is having on their children. It was a real eye-opener for me.' Growing up, Jessica says she was . always curvy and bigger than her peers. But it wasn't until the birth of . her third child, Cerys, now 17 months, that she started to pile on the . pounds. 'Throughout my . early 20s my weight fluctuated between a size 14-16,' said Jessica, a . full time mum who lives with her husband Ryan, 24, a photographer, and . their three children Pheobe, five, Ethan, four and Cerys, 17 months, in . Powys, Wales. 'But leading up to my wedding in July 2011 I was really strict on myself and determined to fit into a size 12-14 dress. 'The . problem was that after the wedding I resumed my bad eating habits and . regained all the weight I'd lost. But it wasn't until Cerys arrived in . August 2012 that I really piled on the pounds.' Jessica at 16, left, and 17 stone, right . Shockingly, around this time Jessica admits she was packing away 4,000 calories a day - double the recommended amount for women. She . says: 'Ryan's 6ft and eats like a horse. Stupidly, I thought I could . graze all day like him and I'd be fine, but at 5ft 7ins I couldn't get . away with it. 'On a daily . basis I was gorging on McDonald's three times a week, greasy takeaway . and sugary snacks and cakes. What's more, I was eating late at night, . mainly out of boredom, in front of the TV. It wasn't healthy and I felt . miserable most of the time. Not only was I harming myself - but giving . my kids a bad role model because they thought the way I looked was . normal. 'Simple things like . picking the kids up required a major effort because my gigantic belly . would get in the way. I was so unhealthy that I'd huff and puff over the . smallest task.' But the wake-up call Jessica desperately needed came in April 2013. 'One . afternoon Phoebe came home in floods of tears,' continues Jessica, 'I . sat her down and asked her what was wrong. She told me a mum at the . school gates had commented on how skinny she was. 'Confused, . I asked her why that had upset her and she replied, 'because I want a . big tummy like you'. I burst into tears and hugged her. I was riddled . with guilt and in that moment I realised I had to do something drastic . about my weight once and for all. 'I . was her idol and I'd let her down. By being overweight I'd unwittingly . presented this distorted view of the world and made her think being fat . was normal.' Jessica at 16 stone, left, and 15 stone, right . That night Jessica told Ryan she was going on a strict diet and he said he'd support her totally. She . says: 'I started looking at diet plans and decided the Cambridge Diet . Plan was the best one for me. I'd used it when I lost weight for my . wedding and I knew I needed something really strict to kick-start my . weight loss. 'On other . diets, I'd cheat or make excuses - but you can't really cheat on this . one because the 'meals' are set out and you have weekly weigh-ins with . your consultant.' The regime is strict - Jessica had to swap her fat, starchy meals for three liquid shakes a day at the expense of Â£40 a week. At first she felt miserable and constantly tired, but she hated being 18 stone 12 more than any other feelings. 'It . was really tough,' she admits. 'I'm a foodie and I used to love sitting . down with Ryan and the kids and tucking into a hearty meal. But taking . daily photos of my weight loss spurred me on and stopped me from . relapsing. 'I deliberately . bought new leggings and a tight top so I could monitor the weight loss . properly. I only wore the clothes when I was weighing myself in front of . the mirror and taking a pic. I didn't want to stretch them as it might . not give a true representation of what I'd lost. 'Soon, . Phoebe wanted to know what drinks I was having as meal replacements. So . I explained that mummy had eaten too many bad foods like sweets and . chocolate and had become fat as a result.' Incredibly, . Jessica shed 10lbs in one week - taking her down to just under 18 . stone. On top of her diet plan, Jessica did 100 stomach sit-ups a day . and pilates three times a week to strengthen her muscles. Jessica at 14 stone 12, left, and at 13 stone 10, right . 'It was amazing,' she recalls, . 'the diet was hard core and sometimes I'd burst into tears when I put . the kids' dinner on the table because I was so hungry and craving solid . food. But then I would take my phone out of my pocket and have a quick . flick through the pics to remind myself why I was doing this. It was . just the incentive I needed to help me through the bad times.' As . the months rolled by, the weight continued to drop off. By October, six . months into the diet plan, she weighed 12 stone and was a size 12. She . says: 'I couldn't believe it. I looked like a new woman! Friends who . hadn't seen me for a while didn't recognise me when they saw me. They'd . do a double-take and ask if it was me. 'And . it wasn't just my diet I'd radically changed, it was my life-style too. Before, when I met up with friends I'd scoff cakes and guzzle hot . chocolate laced with cream - now I'd order a herbal tea instead. Last . month, Jessica started introducing solids back into her diet. She now . has a shake for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch and a low carb . dinner in the evening, such as steamed fish with vegetables. Jessica at 13 stone, left, and finally her 12 stone target, right . 'Although I'm happy with my weight loss I'm determined not to drift back into my bad old ways. I want to reach my target weight of 10 stone and be a size ten. I still take photos every day and I'm shocked when I look through the old ones and see how big I was. It's terrifying to think I was carrying so much weight around with me and putting my health at risk. 'I have so much more energy nowadays and l enjoy running around with the kids now. Ryan loves my new shape and is looking forward to treating me to a new wardrobe this Christmas. Although I was devastated by my daughter's comment at the time, looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It gave me the wake-up call I so desperately needed.'","Jessica Smith lives with husband Ryan and three children in Powys, Wales .

Members of the CRB ruled that a 49-second scene showing the boy masturbating - and a three-second close-up of his erect penis - was likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.

The PCSO charged with blackmail, rape and misconduct in a public office . Relaxing in sequinned slippers at a wedding, Kabeer Yousaf looks every inch the family man. But the 30-year-old police community support officer has been accused of extorting money and sexual favours from prostitutes. Yousaf, whose alleged offences include rape and blackmail, was arrested during a long-running investigation into the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe as sex workers. The Scotland Yard civilian employee, pictured at what is believed to be a Punjabi family wedding, is suspected of demanding cash in return for keeping quiet about their activities. Anti-corruption investigators believe he pocketed hundreds of pounds while working his beat in Upton Park, East London. The married PCSO appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged with blackmail, rape and misconduct in a public office. Watched by his mother and other family members, Yousaf was remanded in custody after the brief appearance. The court was told he is accused of blackmailing women at a brothel on St Stephen’s Road near Upton Park Tube Station. According to the charge, he visited the illicit business in September and offered to keep police away in return for £500 a week. It is claimed he also gave the women a mobile phone number – which ended in 999 – and told them to call him directly if they had any problems. Yousaf allegedly later reduced the payment to £500 a fortnight. The rape charge states that the PCSO demanded that one of  the women perform a sex act on him on December 22 in lieu  of payment. The third charge, misconduct in a public office, involves the alleged offences of blackmail and forcing the woman to perform a sex act while on duty. Yousaf was arrested 24 hours before his court appearance as part of what the Met described as an ‘ongoing investigation’ by its Human Trafficking Unit. It is understood the force is examining suspected trafficking of women from Albania into London by a crime gang. This inquiry is unrelated to Yousaf’s case. Yousaf worked in the Green Street East ward of Newham borough, alongside PCs, a sergeant and an inspector. His role involved high-visibility patrols, meeting members of the community and dealing with low-level antisocial behaviour. Claims: The PCSO is thought to have pocketed hundreds of pounds while working on his East London patch (library image) The PCSO has ambitions to be a fully-fledged police officer and had recently completed a course to help him qualify. A Met police spokesman confirmed Yousaf was charged with rape, blackmail and misconduct in a public office last Friday. ‘The arrest follows an ongoing investigation by the Human Trafficking Unit,’ said. ‘The officer will be suspended from duty.’ Yousaf was ordered to appear  at Southwark Crown Court on January 24.

Former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, who was handed a 35-year sentence for a string of child sex offences, has lodged an application for permission to appeal his prison term. The Court of Appeal move by the disgraced rock star, whose sentence is made up of a custodial term of 29 years and a further six years on licence, was confirmed by the Judicial Office today.

His two accomplices, who can only be named as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively. The court was told that after sexually touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child. He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself. Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

Despite the high-profile guests, it looked-like a decision had been taken to keep the checks low-key and a paper sheet was being used for monitoring who was entering the Palace. The method of checking off members of the Royal family on a paper copy is reminiscent of bouncers turning away partygoers at a nightclub. If your name's not down, you're not coming in: Two officers check to see who has made it for the Christmas lunch .

The esteemed members of Her Majesty's family descended en masse to Buckingham Palace for a festive feast this afternoon.. It's a rare occasion which sees the entire Royal family gathered around the table. Only twice a year does the Queen summon the entire extended Royal Family to the Palace for her pre-Christmas dinner. And while some would expect the distinguished guests to arrive in expensive cars driven by chauffeurs, Viscount Linley and his daughter took a far more humble approach to their mode of transport. The beaming pair arrived in a tiny blue Fiat 500, with a pair of dice dangling from the rear view mirror. Prince William drove his wife Catherine in for the dinner, but there was no sign of their only son Prince George .

They were joined by other members of the Royal family including Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Kate wore a festive red coat while her husband, the second in line to the throne, looked smart in a blue suit and glasses as he drove them into Buckingham Palace. However, there was no sign of the couple's son, Prince George, who is third in line to the throne. But a baby-seat could be seen strapped into the back seat's chair behind Prince William. The Queen, who appeared to be wearing a peach jacket and a string of pearls, could be seen peering out of the window as she was driven into the palace.

Camilla looked all smiles as she was joined by her husband Prince Charles for the Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace . She will be dining with Prince Edward, Princess Beatrice and Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, along with other members of her large extended family. Crowds braved the rain to line the path of the Mall in London to greet the Royal family, which included both immediate and extended relatives f the Queen. While everyone else drove in and waved to the crowds from their seats, Prince Edwards chose a far more subtle approach to arriving - strolling in on foot in his wax jacket from the direction of Clarence House. The Prince, who arrived an hour early, barely caught the attention of the crowds. Another pedestrian was Vice Admiral Sir Tim Lawrence, the second husband of Princess Anne.

He said: 'I went up to him and said if I could take a photograph of him - and then well I didn't wait for the body guards to push me out of the way, I just took a picture.'

He was allegedly looking at pornographic websites the night his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was shot and killed, it was reported in the South African media last week. Nathi Mncube, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We have sent officials who are meeting with Apple today with the purpose of unlocking an iPhone. 'We followed the mutual legal assistance processes. 'With or without this evidence, the trial will still continue on Monday and we feel that we have more than enough evidence regardless, but any evidence we can lay our hands on is critical.' If convicted of murder, Pistorius (left at London 2012 Olympics) faces up to life in prison. The trial is due to start on Monday. Lieutenant General Vineshkumar Moonoo, who is leading the investigation, said in June: 'I cannot say Pistoriusâ€™s memory failure is suspicious but the mobile phones were clearly in use up to the time of the killing.' Pistorius, who competed at the London Olympics in 2012 against able-bodied athletes, told a court he had thought she was an intruder when he fired four shots from a handgun through a bathroom door.

In a televised ruling in a Pretoria high court, Judge Dustan Mlambo said it was vital that impoverished South Africans who feel ill-treated by the justice system be given a first-hand look at the trial. 'The justice system is still perceived as treating the rich and famous with kid gloves whilst being harsh on the poor and the vulnerable,' he said. 'Enabling a larger South African society to be able to follow first-hand criminal proceedings which involve a celebrity, so to speak, will go a long way into dispelling these negative and unfounded perceptions.'

Deborah Washington has filed a lawsuit against AlliedBurton Security Services claiming their staff at Cumberland County Hospital forcibly removed her adult son even though he was dying or already dead. She claims that the guards took A'Darrin Washington, 30, from the hospital, carried him from his wheelchair to a waiting taxi, buckled him up and sent him home even though he was gravely ill. Mr Washington was found dead in the back of the taxi when he arrived home 45 minutes later. He had been discharged from the hospital on November 22, 2011 after undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and fungal pneumonia - after initially being misdiagnosed. A nurse had called for security to escort him from his bed to the lobby to be discharged because he was 'uncooperative' and 'refusing to talk or move', the lawsuit said, CourtHouseNews reported.

New findings by the Pew Research Center show nine in 10 Americans celebrate the holiday but many people view it as more of a cultural celebration steeped in traditions like gift giving and getting together with family rather than a time for religious reflection. While about seven out of 10 Americans said they typically attended religious services to mark the holiday when they were children, only 54 per cent say they plan to attend Christmas services this year. Scroll down for video . Only half of Americans see Christmas as more of a religious holiday these days .

Bernie Goetz, the 'subway vigilante' who shot four panhandling youths on a New York City train in 1984 is fighting low-level drug charges. Goetz was arrested in November on misdemeanor drug charges after police say he was nabbed in a sting selling $30 worth of pot to an undercover officer in Union Square Park, Manhattan. Manhattan prosecutors offered him 10 days of community service on Wednesday to resolve the case - which Goetz turned down. Bernie Goetz walks out after appearing in Manhattan criminal court on Wednesday where he said he would fight minor drug charges against him . The 65-year-old admitted on Wednesday outside court that he had the drugs but he says he is fighting the charges because he was coerced into taking money for the pot and because police are too aggressive. He asked the woman if she wanted to get high, then went back to his apartment, where he has lived for decades, and returned with marijuana, authorities said. He was arrested on charges of criminal sale of marijuana. In 1987, Goetz was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of weapons charges after the 1984 shooting of four black youths and spent 250 days in jail. He says the young men had sharpened screwdrivers and were trying to mug him. Goetz's actions prompted a debate over race relations and frustration with high crime rates of New York in the 1980s. With . New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for . standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who . had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense. Goetz ended up serving eight months in jail, but his legacy lasted much longer than his time in the big house. Courting controversy: Bernhard Goetz leaves Manhattan criminal court in New York today .

He went on to become an activist for a tougher focus on crime, and he proceeded to run for mayor of the city in 2001 and the city's public advocate in 2005. Neither bid was successful, but Goetz traded in on his given nickname by opening an repair store called Vigilante Electronics. His case came back up in the press in December 2011 when one of the four men he shot killed himself in an apparent suicidal drug overdose on the 27th anniversary of the attack. James Ramseur was found dead in the Paradise Motor Inn in the Bronx. Ramseur was the youngest of four teens who surrounded Goetz on the 2 train on December 22, 1984. Believing the group was about to rob him, Goetz pulled out a .38 calibre revolver and fired, striking each of them once. Ramseur was shot in the chest, but survived. The other teenagers - Barry Allen, Troy Canty and Darrell Cabey - were also hospitalized and were not killed. Cabey was left paralyzed by the bullet that struck him.

'I'm no angel, but I've never harmed a soul': Florida truck driver Dicky Joe Jackson (pictured) was jailed for life with no parole for selling meth to help pay for his son's bone marrow transplant . It is a case that could well have inspired the morally ambiguous plot to the hit TV series Breaking Bad. A father has spoken from his prison cell 18 years into a life sentence with no parole about how he was convicted for selling crystal meth to help pay for his son's life-saving medical treatment. Florida truck driver Dicky Joe Jackson, now 55, hit out at the harshness of his term, saying: 'I know that what I did was not right or legal, even in a . life and death situation, as ours was. 'I’m no angel, but I have never harmed a soul. 'There are people in . here doing less than me for contract killings and child molestation.' Jackson was serving his second sentence for drugs offences in 1989 when he learned that his two-year-old son Cole had been diagnosed with an extremely rare autoimmune disease. Known as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, the condition causes recurrent viral infections, lowers blood platelets and causes suffers to bleed and bruise easily. Doctors said Cole probably had less than three years to live unless he had a bone marrow transplant. Luckily his 12-year-old sister, April, was a match - but the operation would cost $250,000 and the family had recently lost their health insurance, he said in an interview with online magazine Salon. The family managed to raise $50,000 with a huge fundraising campaign that encouraged celebrities including the band Alabama and Ronald Reagan to donate memorabilia for an auction. They secured a further $50,000 from a children's charity, but then struggled to find the rest. Dilemma: Jackson's predicament is similar to that facing the fictional Walter White (above), a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer in Breaking Bad . Admitting . he was 'desperate' and that the ordeal had 'made a crazy person out of . me', Jackson accepted the offer from a local meth dealer to drive . payloads of the drug from California to Texas for $5,000 a time. But a year into the arrangement, in 1995, Jackson was arrested for selling half a pound of meth to an undercover officer. The judge later found him guilty of . conspiring to possess, or possessing, with intent to distribute 81.5kg . of the drug and handed him three life sentences without parole. He had previously been convicted of possessing half-a-gram of meth, which he would use to keep him awake on long drives, in 1988. Jackson was convicted after being caught selling half a pound of meth to an undercover officer (file picture) Then a year later, he served a 12-month sentence for transporting a kilogram of cannabis. Nevertheless, . some feel he has become a victim of America's draconian drugs laws . which currently has 3,278 inmates serving life terms with no hope of . parole, often for relatively minor offences. His predicament is similar to that facing the fictional Walter White, a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer in Breaking Bad.

They quashed speculation their relationship is on the rocks after throwing a star-studded Christmas party with a guest list to rival the Oscars. And after putting their wedding on hold, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are now vowing to spend more time together in 2014  -  having even attended counseling sessions, MailOnline can reveal. After being separated for work over the past few months, the couple have now made plans for a New Year sunshine break in Mexico. A source said: 'Jen and Justin love each other, they are fully commited. they had hoped to be married by now but work commitments this year meant their plans went astray. 'They have had some counseling. They both regret not spending more time together this year and they're determined that next year will be different.' What split? Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux quashed rumours their relationship is on the rocks as they attended a Christmas get-together at good friends Emily Blunt and John Krasinski's LA home on Saturday . Committed: Jennifer Aniston and fiance Justin Theroux, seen together in September, will spend New Year in Mexico . The couple recently moved into their newly renovated $21million Bel Air residence - where they threw a holiday bash earlier this month - but a friend said that Jennifer has conceded she will set up camp in New York when Justin begins filming HBO series The Leftovers next spring. Their continuing closeness could be seen as Justin, 42, dropped, former Friends star Jennifer, 44,  off at pal Emily Blunt's baby shower in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon - stopping in to say hi to the Brit actress before picking up his fiancee a few hours later. Engaged since August 2012, they have been discussing wedding plans, as the source said: 'Jen and Justin are looking at it like it's a party for their friends. They've downgraded the scale of their wedding. 'Justin is adamant it will happen in 2014 but that it will . be more 'spontaneous and organic ' than they'd previously wanted.' While promoting her movie, We're The Millers, this summer, Jennifer insisted: 'We already feel married,' adding: 'We're really just happy and in love.' Interestingly, Jennifer is believed to have taken advice from Gwyneth Paltrow - who dated her ex-husband Brad Pitt before she married him - after the Oscar winner managed to pull off a quiet, no-fuss wedding to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin a decade ago. Gwyneth and Chris attended Jennifer and Justin's holiday party alongside friends including Courteney Cox, Chelsea Handler, Robert Downey Jr., Kathryn Hahn, Jason Bateman, Tobey Maguire, Isla Fisher and Will Arnett. Although Jennifer will spend Christmas with family in LA and Justin will be on the East Coast with his family, they will see in the New Year together in Jennifer's favourite vacation spot, Cabo St Lucas. The pair vacationed in the same spot last December with Devil Wears Prada star Emily - now six-months-pregnant - and husband, Office actor John Krazinski, alongside Jimmy Kimmel and his wife Molly McNearney. Expecting: Pregnant actress Emily Blunt keeps up her fitness by taking her dog for a hike in Hollywood on Saturday . Something to smile about: The couple arrived at the house each carrying a small present wrapped in lilac paper with a white bow on top before leaving a little while later with Jen in particular looking to be in good spirits . Jennifer joined a star-studded guest list at Emily's baby bash, including Kristen Bell and Amy Adams. A source told US Weekly that despite the obvious star power, the shower was 'very small and intimate', with only about 15 guests. 'It was an intimate shower for a few close girlfriends,' an eyewitness said: 'It was very small and low key.' Snacks and Perrier water were provided for the attendees, according to the magazine, and pink balloons decorated Emily's Hollywood Hills home. There was also a raspberry fruit cake tart for dessert, and each of the guests gave a little toast to the mom-to-be, raising glasses of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label to her. Things started winding down around sunset, the eyewitness noted: 'Jennifer Aniston was greeted by Justin Theroux, who came back to pick her up. She was the first guest to leave. Everyone else left soon after.' Earlier that day, the 30-year-old mom-to-be enjoyed a hike at Hollywood's Runyon Canyon with her dog as she stays in tip-top shape during her pregnancy. Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night: Despite the visors of their Mercedes-Benz partially obscuring their faces, it was obvious from their smiles that both had had an enjoyable afternoon as they headed home as night began to fall . Who needs a reason to party! While their hostess is pregnant with her first child, it seems unlikely the friends were celebrating the impending birth as she is only six months along, instead probably a festive catch-up and exchanging of gifts . House Of Lies star Kristen Bell, who welcomed her first child, daughter Lincoln, on March 28, arrived bearing a gift. The 33-year-old flew solo, leaving Parenthood star husband Dax Shepard, whom she wed on October 17, to care for their daughter.

Before then, she had not been seen for a number of weeks and her absence from official photographs has led to speculation she could have fallen out of favour with a husband who is swift to deliver punishment to anyone who shows the slightest sign of disloyalty. ‘It's certainly safe, even when there . is a bit of disruption like there is now - a bit of trouble or chaos - . there's even more need for cultural or sporting exchanges,’ said Rory .

Self-confessed nerds Logan Fernandes and his wife Brooke live in Avon, Indiana with their two children – 4-year-old Kal-El (named after Superman’s real name) and 2-year-old Harley Quinn (named after one of Batman’s enemies). The couple, who met at high school, have been married since 2003, but when they first tied the knot money was tight and they hadn’t been able to afford a big wedding with a proper reception. Logan Fernandes gave his wife Brooke a 10th wedding anniversary present she will never forget when he surprised her with a full-scale nerd wedding which included groomsmen all wearing different superhero logos under their shirts . This photo captures the moment that Brooke walks in and discovers that her husband Logan has secretly arranged their wedding - complete with a reception - 10 years after they first got married . Every year since, Logan has made an extra special effort to celebrate each anniversary with a big surprise. About 18 months ago he decided that he would organize the biggest surprise of all for their tenth anniversary – and have the big wedding that Brooke had always wanted. Amazingly he managed to keep the whole complicated affair a secret from his wife right up until the big day - ten years and one day after they first got married. All of Brooke’s family and friends were in on the big surprise and Logan even managed to get his wife to try on a wedding dress to size it, by convincing her that it was all for his sister’s (fake) wedding. The couple's 4-year-old Kal-El, named after Superman's real name, wore a cape and acted as ring bearer on the big day . Will you be my Player Two? The couple's wedding rings were displayed in a box that included a note saying 'Be my player two?' and the rings were labeled Player 1 and Player 2 .

The moment that Brooke walks into the room and discovers what her loving husband has organized is captured in an amazing photo that Logan first posted on his Reddit account last Thursday. ‘The ceremony began with a video playing that I made of the story of our lives up until that point, including all my behind the scenes wedding planning,’ explained Logan.

When you’re holding a christening, there are plenty of things to remember – but surely an important one is ensuring the star of the day is buckled up on the way to church. However, Lord Freddie Windsor’s four-month-old daughter Maud was carried on the lap of her mother Sophie Winkleman instead of in a car seat, an offence that can carry a £500 fine. Lord Freddie’s father Prince Michael of Kent was also spotted driving to the christening with his wife Princess Michael and their daughter Lady Gabriella in the back seat – neither of whom were wearing seatbelts. Risk: Lord Freddie Windsor's four-month-old daughter Maud was carried on the lap of her mother Sophie Winkleman instead of in a car seat . Embarrassingly, Prince Michael is patron of the Commission for Global Road Safety and last week handed out prizes for his acclaimed International Road Safety awards scheme at the Savoy hotel in London. The royals were spotted on the way to the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace of Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina Windsor, who is 42nd in line to the throne. Lady Frederick – who gave birth at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in  Los Angeles on August 15 – is based in America as she pursues her acting career. Another royal baby in 2013: Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor with their daughter, Maud, in the State Apartments at St James's Palace following her private christening . The 33-year-old most recently appeared in last year’s Titanic, a mini-series by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes. Last night Edmund King, President of the AA, said: ‘You could be kind by suggesting as this couple live in America they may have come to Britain and not been able to find a child seat for their car. That has happened to me when I have hired a car abroad and it is a frightening experience. New regulations governing the use of child car seat came into force in September 2006 . It . was announced then that the standard fixed penalty for not using a . child restraint is £30 but if the case goes to court the maximum fine is . £500. Seat belts must be . worn by adult passengers who are classed as 14 and over. The law states . that children must be seated in a child or booster seat to protect them . adequately from road accidents, up until they are 12 years old or 135cm . tall. It has been . revealed, however, that over a quarter (26 per cent) of parents do not . know this law, and 26 per cent have used a seat that does not fit . properly. Almost half (47 . per cent) have foregone the use of a seat when in a vehicle other than . their own, such as a taxi or friend’s car, and 27 per cent have used a . seat that would not be recommended by safety experts, such as a second . hand model. One in 20 parents admitted they have never used a child or booster seat. ‘However, the laws are clear and are in the Highway code - and the AA view is that a child in a car is far safer being held in a proper car seat or child restraint. ‘That goes for all members of the public and irrespective of whether you are Royalty.’ Freddie Windsor’s wife Sophie Winkleman - who gave birth to her daughter at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles on August 15 - bases herself in the United States to pursue her acting career. Car child seats and seat belts must also be used in America by law - but the ages of when children must be restrained does vary in different states. In the UK the maximum fine which can be imposed by a court for not wearing a seat belt or similar restraint in a car is £500. The RoSPA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) charity has a website relating to the use of child care seats which states: ‘Failure to wear a seat belt or failure to ensure that a child passenger uses an appropriate child restraint or wears a seat belt according to the legal requirements described above, could affect any claims against your motor insurance cover. ‘You could also face civil proceedings for damages, if you failed to safely carry someone else’s child. But of course the most serious penalty of all could be that you or a passenger loses their life!’ Others seen not wearing belts at the christening included Sophie’s mother-in-law Princess Michael of Kent and her daughter Lady Gabriella. Car safety charity Brake has recently warned parents that 700 children under eight years old are killed or seriously injured in road accidents each year, but that the use of a child or booster seat can greatly reduce the risk of a fatality. Support: Sophie said her husband Lord Freddie Windsor was 'very brave' during the labour as she 'just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head' Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive of Brake, said earlier this year: ‘It’s vital that parents, carers and of course the wider driving public understand how best to protect children on roads, and its worrying to find common misunderstanding about child car seats. We recommend parents always use a correctly-fitted suitable child or booster seat until a child is 150cm tall.’ On Monday Maud Windsor wore the same Honiton lace christening gown as Prince George of Cambridge who was christened at the same venue in October. On that occasion the young Prince was seen in his car seat both arriving and leaving St James’s Palace - and he was famously carried by Prince William in a car seat when he left hospital shortly after being born . Many hospitals have a policy which will not allow them to discharge a new-born baby unless parents can show they have a car seat installed in their vehicle. Proud grandfather: Prince Michael of Kent arrived with his wife and daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, pictured. Embarrassingly the Prince Michael is patron of the Commission for Global Road Safety . The Department for Transport refused to comment on the matter. The awards are said to ‘recognise achievements and innovations which will improve road safety.’ According to his awards website ‘ all road users are asked to identify those whose initiatives make our roads safer and nominate them for an award.’ Embarrassingly for the Prince the last awards ceremony and Gala Presentation was held less than a fortnight ago. A spokesman for Prince Michael of Kent yesterday told the Daily Mail: ‘No Comment.’","Four-month-old Maud carried on the lap of her mother Sophie Winkleman .

An overweight barman who went on a diet to get a girlfriend is now fighting off the ladies after becoming a dead ringer for One Direction's Zayn Malik. Connor Sayer, 20, tipped the scales at over 14 stone due to his habitual heavy drinking sessions and a love of takeaways. But Connor decided to get in shape to land a girlfriend, lost four stone - and developed an uncanny resemblance to the X-Factor heartthrob. Heading in the right direction: Connor Sayer, 20, after he turned his life around by losing four stone and restyling himself as a Zayn Malik lookalike . And after slimming down to 10 stone, he is now is swamped with offers from girls - and modelling agencies. Connor is even juggling two girlfriends at the same time. He said: 'I was always the funny guy, the guy who made you laugh but who was always single. I was the token fat lad of the group. 'All my mates were skinny and had girlfriends, and so I overcompensated by being arrogant and thinking I was cool. Before and after: Connor, pictured (left) at fourteen stone, shed four stone to get a girlfriend and is now fighting off the ladies after becoming a dead ringer for Zayn (right) Spot the difference: After slimming down to 10 stone, he is now is swamped with offers from girls - and modelling agencies - and is currently looking for work as a Zayn Malik (right) lookalike . 'In reality, I was just self-conscious and insecure. I didn't realise I looked anything like Zayn Malik until my friends told me I should start modelling. 'I put some pictures up on Facebook and I was inundated with messages from girls telling me how much I looked like him. 'Now, when I go to the pub or go out on a night out, girls just flock to me asking me for my number.' Connor, of Doncaster, Yorkshire - the same county as Malik - piled on the pounds late in his teens, although he admits he was a chubby school kid. He said: 'I was always the fat one, but when I started drinking, that's when it got worse. I hated being around my mates who were skinny and had girlfriends. That's what makes him beautiful: He piled on the pounds with heavy drinking sessions and takeaways - before turning over a new leaf with the popular 5:2 diet . 'I used to just laugh off my problems and I would drink five days of the week, and never do any exercise. 'I tried to lose weight in the past, but with no girlfriend to notice, I gave up pretty quickly.' Connor, who works part-time as a barman, decided enough was enough, and after reading an article about the 5:2 diet, he decided to give it a go. Fasting for two days a week, and eating healthily on the other five, Connor saw the difference almost immediately. As he was: Connor tipped the scales at more than 14 stone and described himself as the 'class clown' who no one took seriously . 'The first two weeks were the toughest because my body had to get used to being denied food,' he said. 'After that my stomach shrank and I wasn't able to eat what I did before. 'I started cycling four miles every day and the weight just fell off.' Connor lost four stone in total, and the transformation has turned his life around. He approached an agency and is now modelling part-time, but he says the best thing about looking like Zayn Malik is the attention he gets from girls. He said: 'It's a massive compliment that girls even find me attractive at all, as I still see the same lad, just a bit skinnier. 'My confidence has increased enormously, and I can't go to a pub without getting propositioned. And if they think I'm really him, who am I to tell them otherwise? 'I'm not a huge fan of One Direction, but after people told me I looked like one of them, I started listening to them. Now, I'm a total One Directioner.'

Friends star Matthew Perry was involved in a heated TV debate last night in which he claimed that questioning drug addiction is 'as ludicrous as saying Peter Pan is real'. The American actor, who has battled drink and drug abuse, appeared on BBC's Newsnight to argue in favour of specialist courts where former addicts sit as lay magistrates dealing with abuse-related crimes. Fighting the opposite corner, Mail on Sunday journalist and anti-drug campaigner Peter Hitchens railed against the idea and what he described as the 'fantasy of addiction'. After the clash, Newsnight editor Ian . Katz tweeted that he had dispatched a producer to take Perry and Mr . Hitchens out of the building through different exits. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Campaigner: Friends star Matthew Perry, who has battled drink and . drug abuse, appeared on BBC's Newsnight to argue in favour of specialist . courts where former addicts sit as lay magistrates . Counter-argument: Anti-drugs campaigner and Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens countered that more people take illegal substances since possession was effectively made legal . Aftermath: Newsnight editor Ian Katz said he had sent a producer to escort the two guests out via separate exits after their row . 'You are making a point that is as ludicrous as saying Peter Pan is real,' Perry, who reached fame as sitcom character Chandler Bing, retorted. At one point he referred to the Mail on Sunday columnist as 'Santa' and told him to 'read something other than your book' in reference to Mr Hitchens' essay The War We Never Fought: The British Establishment's Surrender To Drugs. Mr Hitchens, who has previously debated drugs policy with former heroin addict and comedian Russell Brand, countered that more people take illegal substances since possession was effectively made legal. 'This is a very serious subject and you treat it with immense levity,' he told Perry. 'The policy which you so smugly and loftily advocate, this policy has led to disaster in Western countries for decades.' Heated debate: Matthew Perry appeared alongside former social worker Baroness Meacher and opposite Peter Hitchens in the debate hosted by Jeremy Paxman . 'The policy which you so smugly and loftily advocate, this policy has led to disaster in Western countries for decades.' Perry spoke openly about his troubles with addiction. 'I'm a drug addict and if I have a drink I can't stop,' he said, adding: '(you say) I'm choosing to do that. 'It's an obsession of the mind and an allergy of the body. For example, if I think about alcohol I cannot stop. It's about controlling that'. Peter Hitchens responded: 'People have problems with drugs and drink. People like taking them and don't want to stop. It doesn't mean they have a disease. 'There is an immense fashion at the moment for dismissing the ability of people to take control over their own lives and to make excuses for them. 'For more than 50 years we have treated alleged addiction as not a crime, we have treated it as a disease, and now we have many more drug users than we did then'. Behind the scenes: Matthew Perry (right) has battled drink and drug addiction since starring in hit U.S. comedy Friends (pictured) Troubled: Matthew Perry has long struggled with addiction to alcohol and drugs, which at its worst was a bottle of vodka a night with 30 or so tablets . A think tank has been arguing that drug addicts should become magistrates in special drugs courts. The idea, from the Policy Exchange, will help people quit, they say, . Mr Perry has flown into the UK from America to give it his backing. Before he appeared on Newsnight he opened the Policy Exchange talk on Monday evening with ‘I’m Matthew and I’m an alcoholic.’ The actor last night admitted his struggles with alcohol started when he was just 13 years old after he consumed a bottle of wine at a friends party. During his high profile career Mr Perry told how he struggled with alcoholism, admitting he would drink a bottle of vodka a night in his home. Admission: Matthew Perry spoke at the Policy Exchange last night and started his speech with 'I'm Matthew and I'm an alcoholic' Mr Perry backing drugs courts said: ‘In America this system is the one thing republicans and democrats agree on. Because it rehabilitates and it also saves money. ‘We have come here today to show Downing Street our programme, a programme which will save lives and money. And I don’t know many politicians who would remain popular if they ignored a system which would save lives and save money.’ Perry has seen his career flounder after becoming one of the world's biggest stars in Friends. He told ABC News in May that he . became an expert at hiding his troubles from co-stars Jennifer Aniston, . Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow. He . went to a 28-day program in 1997 for Vicodin addiction and saw his . weight fluctuate wildly over the next few years - once dropping as low . as 145 pounds. Perry . again entered rehab in February 2001 to treat an addiction to the . opioids Vicodin and methadone, as well as amphetamines and alcohol. His problems began when he checked . into a Minnesota clinic after he became addicted to the painkiller . Vicodin, following a jet-ski accident. At . his lowest ebb, he was drinking two pints of vodka a day and swallowing . up to 30 tablets. At the same time, he was admitted to hospital with . agonising pancreatitis - an inflammation often caused by drink and drugs . abuse. At the time he also crashed his car into the porch of a house. Close: Matthew Perry has admitted he became an expert at hiding his troubles from co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow . Incident: At one of his lowest point Matthew Perry damaged his brand new Porsche and caused £10,000 worth of damage to a Hollywood mansion after a crash . During his rehabilitation he told fellow addicts at a counselling session that his wages of £550,000 a week were responsible for his addiction to tranquillisers, according to a U.S. magazine. Close: Matthew Perry said his father John Bennett Perry, left, had warned him to not to be a 'big shot' after his Friends success, but he admitted he 'forgot all about it' when Friends became a worldwide hit . 'I could go out and do whatever I wanted, buy anything I wanted and overkill took over. I wanted it all - and I took it all,' he said. 'My dad advised me years ago that if I became successful not to become a big-shot . . . but I forgot all about his warning after Friends took off. 'I became a spoiled Hollywood party boy and to make matters worse I started to hate myself. That's when I looked for an artificial high and got into trouble.' Following the final series of the sitcom in 2004, which followed the messy private lives of a group of six New Yorkers, Canadian Perry has suffered a slump. In 2006, he landed the lead role as a TV writer in the much-vaunted Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip. But it was dropped by U.S. network NBC after one series because of poor ratings and mixed reviews. Perry's attempts at a film career have been equally disappointing. He starred as a chronically depressed film writer in the quickly forgotten movie Numb, which was mauled by critics and flopped at the box office. He has admitted to suffering from depression, and has said he locked himself away for days on end in his Hollywood Hills home to escape the pressure of fame. He has also fought a long battle with addictions to drink and prescription drugs. He . has since turned his life around and has turned his former beachfront .

Adeline Munguia, 19, who attends California State University vanished last Thursday but has since been found 'with no signs of foul play' The 19-year-old college student was last seen boarding a bus from Cal State University to downtown LA. She was found today in Montebello - eight miles from campus . The investigation was ongoing into where the student had been and why she had not made contact, the spokesman said on Monday. It is not clear if Miss Munguia, who is a California native, is from Montebello. Police earlier told MailOnline that Miss . Munguia lives in the college dorms and was last seen boarding an MTA bus . by herself from the campus to downtown LA. Detectives had been looking into all of her social networking activity for clues as to where the 19-year-old may have gone. The officer said it was not known if the young woman shared details of where she was going or if she was meeting anyone with friends. She was last seen on surveillance footage at 3.30pm on Thursday wearing a pink top with thin straps, black pants, open-toed shoes, carrying a beige and brown purse. She appeared to be looking down at her phone. Tinder is a dating app where potential dates connect with each other using profiles with limited information - typically just a few pictures, first name and how close geographically that person is to you. The app was launched by college students in California last year. Users 'swipe' a potential date's profile to the right on their smartphone screens if they like it. If two people do the same, they can then instant message each other to arrange a meeting. Tinder is a location-based social networking app that allows mutually interested users to link up with each other - simply by swiping the screen of their smartphone. It has quickly become known as a dating and even a 'hook up' app with 1.5billion profiles created since its launch. Of those, 5 million users are now accessing the app on average seven times per day. The app is currently generating 10 million matches every day. Tinder was launched at a campus party at the University of Southern California in 2012. It quickly spread to other college campuses before catching on among the wider population. It is most popular with men and women aged 18-35. Tinder is the fastest growing free dating app in the U.S. Once the app is downloaded on to a smart phone, users are asked by the app to allow access to their Facebook profile. An individual's Tinder profile (like the example pictured right) is then set up using just a first name, age, sexual orientation and a handful of photos. Immediately the faces of people between a certain age range and within a certain radius  appear on screen. Each individual uses their touch-screen phone to 'swipe' that face to the right if they like it, and left if they don't. The face profiles then continue in a steady stream. If both users swipe to 'like' each other, a chat box appears - and a private conversation can begin.

Eleven children who were forced to sleep in cages by their adoptive parents have reached a $2 million settlement after years of legal wrangling. The agreement, which still needs a judge's approval, was made with an Ohio . county where three of the children had lived before they were placed in . the home outfitted with wire and wood enclosures. The adopted and foster children were between 1 and 14 in 2005 when authorities took them from the home near Norwalk, where they lived with their adoptive parents, Michael and Sharen Gravelle. The Gravelles spent two years in prison for abusing some of the children. They had always maintained that they kept some of the children in the cages for their own safety. Locked up: Michael and Sharen Gravelle, pictured in Norwalk, Ohio in 2007, were jailed for 2 years after their adopted children were found sleeping in cages. The children have just won a $2 million settlement . They lost custody in 2006 and all 11 of the children were placed with foster parents. The oldest two are in college and have used the money from earlier settlements to pay for tuition, said Jack Landskroner, an attorney for the children. The rest are doing well, Landskroner said, though some scars remain. The children were wrongly portrayed as troubled during the trial of the Gravelles, he said. 'These kids were good kids,' Landskroner said. 'It's amazing the positive results you see on children who are placed in a loving, caring home.' The settlements, he said, will allow them to move forward now. There have been seven public and . private financial settlements with counties and agencies that had a role . in placing the children in the home and some of the professionals who . were charged with their placement and overseeing their care. The . latest and final settlement was agreed upon last week when officials in . Stark County, where three siblings lived before being placed with . Gravelles, signed off on the $2 million payout. Cruel: The children, aged between one and 14, were locked up in caged made from wood and wire . Confines: The adoptive parents claimed that the children were locked up because they were dangerous . The county will pay $100,000 while the rest will come from its insurers. County officials maintain they did nothing wrong. Stark County had assurances from another county where the Gravelles lived that they were fit to be adoptive parents and that the children would be monitored, said Ross Rhodes, who oversees the civil division of the Stark County prosecutor's office. 'With the benefit of hindsight, these children were placed in a very bad situation,' Rhodes said. Officials in Huron County, where the Gravelles lived, agreed to a $1.2 million settlement in 2010. Terms of the other settlements were confidential and not released. The investigation into how the children ended up in the home led the state to increase oversight in cases of multiple special-needs children in one home.","The children were between the ages of 1 and 14 when they were found in Norfolk, Ohio home in 2005 .

This year's list of global billionaires has revealed that Mark Zuckerberg made the most money in the world in over the past 12 months. Forbes reports that the Facebook founder's net worth nearly doubled, going from 2013's estimate of $15.2billion to $28.5billion as a result of the social network's increasing share price. That still wasn't enough to earn him the top spot, however, as Microsoft founder Bill Gates came in at number one after slipping from the position four years ago. Scroll down for video . Back at the top: Bill Gates was the 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years but was dethroned briefly by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim up until now . Going up: Mark Zuckerberg's net worth nearly doubled to $28.5billion since Facebook's share price is now up 130 per cent over the past year . Sheryl Sandberg is arguably the most famous of the 34 women who are new to the list this year, and she just made the cut with $1.05billion after Facebook's share price increased dramatically. Nigerian fashion head turned oil magnate Folorunsho Alakija who is worth $2.5billion. Denise Coates from the United Kingdom who made her $1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site Bet365.com. Estee Lauder's granddaughters Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Jane Lauder have been added to the list. Gates held the title of 'richest man in . the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years, but he was succeeded- . briefly- by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim Helu for the . past four years. Gates, who now spends most of his time in . philanthropy, earned his spot back as his net worth increased by . $9billion to $76billion after Microsoft's stock had a promising year. That stock jump put him ahead of Mr Slim Helu who came in at $72billion. Zara owner Amancio Ortega held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor Warren Buffett and Oracle head Larry Ellison came in fifth place. The rest of the top ten show the power of American family connections, as sixth and seventh place went to Charles and David Koch respectively. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson came in . eighth place, followed by Walmart heirs- with Christy Walton and family . coming in ninth and her brother-in-law Jim Walton came in 10th. Their relatives Alice and S. Robson Walton also got their own spots on the list, meaning that the Walton family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world. Christy . Walton's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the . richest woman in the world, but that doesn't mean that there wasn't a . great deal of change for women on the list. Titans of tech: Google co-founders Larry Page, . left, and Sergey Brin, right, came in 17th and 19th with $32.3billion . and $31.8billion respectively . Jan Koum from WhatsApp, $6.8billion . Brian Acton from WhatsApp, $3billion . Evan Williams from Twitter, $3billion . Kenneth Feld of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, $1.8billion . Alexandre Grendene Bartelle owns the Brazilian shoe company that produces Havaianas flip flops, $1.5billion . Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox, $1.2billion . Vince McMahon from WWE, $1.2billion . Michael Kors, fashion designer, $1billion . More women than ever were included this year, with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645. That jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year, as only 138 women were on the list in 2013. One . of the new female faces was that of Sheryl Sandberg who is one of the . youngest self-made billionaires with a net worth of $1.05billion. Like Zuckerberg, she was helped dramatically by the fact that the Facebook share price is now up 130 per cent. This year's billionaire's list, which is the 28th such issue for the financial magazine, comes on the same day as reports that Sandberg may be turning her gaze from Silicon Valley to Washington, D.C. There is speculation that she may challenge Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer for one of California's two Senate seats. Her sizable fortune would make the $30-$40million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone. When MailOnline contacted Sandberg over the weekend, there was no comment. However, this morning a source close to her said that 'it is 100 per cent untrue.' Though the new wave of wealthy . technology leaders made their presence known on this year's list, . neither of the Facebook faces were in the top 20 with Zuckerberg just . narrowly missing the cut off. Gates clearly led the way with Ellison . not far behind, younger iterations like Google's Larry Page and Sergey . Brin came in 17th and 19th place respectively. They were interrupted along the way by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who came in 18th place with $32billion. Cover stars: Two different versions of the issue were released with Sheryl Sandberg on one (left) and WhatsApp founder Jan Koum on another (right) Aside . from Sandberg, another first time mention was given to designer Michael . Kors, whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he took his . eponymous company public in 2011. Hard times may have knocked off a few: . Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate from Brazil, was profiled as having $10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $300million this year. Ship-building magnate George Economou was listed with $1.7billion previously but took a hit due to the floundering Greek economy. Mystery money men who couldn't be valued: . Larry Gagosian, an American art dealer, is believed to be a billionaire but the value of his collection is unknown. Clinton confidante and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was not included. His assets- including a $50million Upper East Side apartment and 100-acre plot in St Thomas- that could help him reach the billionaire's club. Who didn't qualify, even though they're loaded: . Forbes explained that they do not consider 'royal family members or dictators who derive their fortunes entirely as a result of their position of power'. Rwandan president Paul Kagame and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are two such examples, with their murky financial dealings thought to put them above the billionaire mark. Though he is near the bottom of the list, retail giants were represented well in the top 20. Between Ortega, H&M's Stefan Persson, and LVMH's Bernard Arnault and the four Walton relatives, there were seven retail billionaires in the top 20. By comparison, there were only six tech billionaires in the same subset, including Gates, Ellison and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Forbes says a record 1,645 billionaires made the list this year, with an average net worth of $4.7 billion. That's up from 1,426 billionaires last year with a net worth of $4.2 billion. Total net worth of this year's list was $6.4 trillion, up from $5.4 trillion last year. The magazine said that 1,080 of the billionaires were self-made, 207 inherited their wealth and 352 inherited a portion but are still growing it. Forbes said 268 billionaires were new to the list, beating out a prior high of 226 newcomers in 2008. And a record number of women made the list this year, with 172 women joining, up 25 percent from last year. Altogether 100 people dropped out of the rankings, while 16 passed away. The biggest loser dropped so dramatically that he is no longer a billionaire. Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate from Brazil, was profiled as having $10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $300million this year so he wasn't included on the list. The U.S. was the country with the . greatest number of billionaires at 492, followed by China with 152 and . Russia with 111. Billionaires from four new countries joined, adding .

The Paterson, New Jersey boy mauled to death by a bull mastiff has been identified. Kenneth Clodo Santillan, 13, was killed, and another 13-year-old boy was injured Friday by the 115 pound canine as they made their way home from school. Paul Clarke, the hulking beast's owner, reportedly had to stab his beloved 'Trigger' in order to subdue the animal, according to the New York Daily News. Horror: Kenneth Clodo Santillan, pictured with father Kenny Santillan, was mauled to death Friday by a 115-pound bull mastiff . Just a young boy: Santillan had recently celebrated his 13th birthday, according to his Facebook page . Santillan was walking with the friend along a creek in back of Clarke's home, contrary to initial reports that said the teens were on a sidewalk in front of the house, when the attack occurred, according to neighbor Elizabeth Hatsko told MailOnline. The dog jumped out at the boys, initially attacking the unidentified friend, before they split up. Santillan was tragically run down by the killer canine and mauled to death before Clarke stepped in. Clarke ran at the dog, and was attacked himself, before stabbing it several times to keep it at bay until animal control arrived, according to the Bergen Record. Hatsko said she saw blood pooled in neighbor Clarke's driveway, the Record reported several blood stains in the snow lining the creek. 'Such a tragedy,' Santillan neighbor Rose Corbo told MailOnline. The incident occured in the afternoon, but the Santillan's body was not found until near 11.00pm, officials said. His injured friend took part in the search. Beloved: Santillan's Facebook page is filled with loving family members posing with him for pictures . Mourning: Father Kenny reportedly was in tears Friday as he viewed his son's lifeless body on the bloody snow . Authorities took the dog into custody and had it 'humanely euthanized,' authorities said. It was not exactly clear how the dog's life ended, and MailOnline was not immediately able to reach those responsible. Relatives mourned the loss of their beloved Ken on social media. 'RIP the best cousin I've had,' Cassie Nadia commented on a picture posted by Carlos Pastor. It is not clear if Clarke will face any criminal charges, but a lawyer retained by injured but alive boy's family intends to sue for damages. 'We intend on pursuing a claim for his injuries, certainly,' the attorney told the Record. Friday's incident was not the five-year-old dog's first dash for freedom, according to Hatsko. Trigger had escaped two times prior to Friday's incident - once he was recovered by Clarke, a second time he was found by Animal Control. The dog barked a lot and intimidated neighbors, but it had not attacked anyone prior to killing Santillan, Hatsko said. Killer: Paul Clarke's 115 pound mastiff is accused of mauling three teens, leaving one dead, as they walked home from school . Hatsko said the dog was big, and intimidating, but gentle with her grandchildren. She believes the dog was provoked into going after the young children. 'The boys got in the back there, and nobody’s supposed to be back there,' she said. 'He’s behind the fence, and you know how kids do…they would tease him, they would run. There appears to be no relationship between the victims and the dog's owner, who has been identified by prosecutors. 'If you were provoked, wouldn’t you fight back,' said Hatsko. 'An animal’s an animal.' A witness described the aftermath of the horrifying attack to the New York Post. 'The boy said, ‘I got bit by a dog and I can’t find my friend, we’re looking for him,' Maria Zachus said. 'Then I heard the guy say, ‘He’s here, he’s here! I found him! 'The father was screaming and crying, ‘My son, my son, my son — but why here, oh God why, why?’ Zachus continued. Criminal charges have yet to be filed. Paterson resident Orlando Cepeda told reporters he and his wife were walking through the area at approximately 4 p.m. Friday when they saw a teenage boy who was bleeding heavily from his left hand. 'He said, 'a dog bit me,' Cepeda said. 'He was running. He was scared.' A driveway on Sherwood Avenue was later discovered spattered with blood. Neighbor Jose Hernandez reported witnessing flood lights, ambulances, and police that afternoon. He also saw bloodstained snow on the embankment of the Passaic River. Paterson: Residents reported seeing a boy bleeding from his left hand and spotting blood on snowbanks and splattered across driveways . Paterson Detective Capt. Heriberto Rodriquez said further information about the attack would be released. This is the second time in a month a New Jersey child has been injured by dog attack. Earlier in February, a Newark boy, age 10, was found critically injured after being left alone with two pitbulls in his father's apartment. In that case, the boy was bitten several times and slashed before a neighbor broke down the door to rescue him. His father, Enrique Carillo, 41, was charged with child endangerment.","The 115-pound dog attacked both Kenneth Clodo Santillan, 13, and a friend as they walked home from school .

One man claims that the remains of approximately 1200 British soldiers and Mohawk allies may lie under a covered ravine in upstate New York. Randy Patten, a 61-year-old retired . state police investigator and former member of a New York commission that celebrated the 250th anniversary of the French and Indian War, says a local businessman 'is dumping on historical ground, or what’s left of it, anyway.' In the 1990s, businessman Anthony Tomasovic was granted permission by the town of Lake George to fill in his vacant, sloping property. The land borders the wooded ravine where about 1,000 British Colonial troops and 200 of their Mohawk Indian allies were ambushed by a larger force of French and Indians on the morning of Sept. 8, 1755. The ravine was also part of the route for a wilderness road traveled by such 18th-century figures as Paul Revere, Benedict Arnold, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Randy Patten stands on a path in a ravine in Lake George, N.Y. Patten is convinced many of the scores of casualties from a French and Indian War ambush lie buried underneath it . Patten says 1200 soldiers' remains may lie under the ravine. He points to after-battle reports and soldier journals that record the dead being buried 'where they fell' in the days following the battle . Patten says the land was damaged when Tomasovic dumped tons of soil, trees and road debris on his 2.8-acre property in the late 1990s, fronting a commercially zoned stretch of Route 9, the main drag in his tourist-friendly area. At some point, the fill began cascading into the ravine where the ambush known as the Bloody Morning Scout is believed to have happened along the Military Road, built by New England militiamen just days before the battle. Patten believes many casualties from the Battle of Lake George were buried afterward in the ravine, including provincial militiamen from Massachusetts and Connecticut and the Mohawks from New York.  For proof, he points to after-battle reports and soldier journals that record the dead being buried 'where they fell' in the days following the battle. The Bloody Morning Scout was a military engagement at the beginning of the Battle of Lake George. A perspective map of the battle can be seen here . The painting 'General Johnson Saving a Wounded French Officer from the Tomahawk of a North American Indian,' seen here, is usually linked to the Battle of Lake George . The French and Indian War (1756 to 1763) was fought between France and England, as both nations battled for increased imperial power . Served as colonial extension of the Seven Years' War fought in Europe between the two countries . Began after George Washington and his forces attempted to communicate with French captain in Ohio river valley, after a period of strained relations . British turned the tide with victories at Louisburg, Fort Fontenac and Quebec . The Bloody Morning Scout was part of the Battle of Lake George, with an ultimate Colonial victory . War effectively ended French political and cultural influence in North America . Also worsened the relationship between England and the Native Americans, as well as between England and the colonies . Patten, local historians and at least one town planning board member raised concerns about the ravine site after Tomasovic first applied in the mid-1990s for a permit to fill in his property. Nevertheless, the planning board approved his application in 1996, allowing Tomasovic to begin clearing trees and dumping soil on the property. No official archaeological digs have been conducted in the ravine, and none are planned. Patten feels something should be done to honor the common soldiers who died and are buried in the ravine. 'They were the first Americans to battle a professional foreign army,” he said. 'They deserve better.' The . town’s planning and zoning director sent Tomasovic a letter ordering . him to cease fill operations on his property in December. The . letter didn’t mention any issues regarding the dumping of soil on the . battle site, only focusing on concerns over stabilization of the high, . approximately 250-foot-long embankment that now looms over the ravine . along the property’s back side. Tomasovic said he had finished fill . work at the property last year, before receiving the letter. He has yet . to build anything on his property, but says he still has plans for the . parcel. He refused to divulge details. Randy Patten poses in front of the Ephraim Williams Jr. memorial on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2014, in Lake George, N.Y. Tomasovic defended his work at the property, pointing to a neighboring commercial property that was built decades ago, also by dumping fill into the ravine. Anyone building a business in an area as steeped in history as Lake George can’t help but run into preservation issues, he said. 'All of Lake George is a historic site,' Tomasovic said. 'Everywhere you build there, you’re going to find something historic.'","Randy Patten, 61, says businessman Anthony Tomasovic has been 'dumping on historical ground'

The widower of an Staten Island woman murdered while traveling alone in Turkey has remarried his slain wife's childhood friend one year after his tragic loss. Steven Sierra, 41, lost his wife and mother of his two children Sarai Sierra, 33, in January 2013 after a vagrant high from huffing paint thinner bashed her in the head with a rock and beat her to death. On January 23, two days after he visited Sarai's grave with their sons on the anniversary of her death, Sierra married Dulce Arroyo. Scroll down for video... Tragedy: Sarai Sierra, left, was brutally murdered while traveling alone in Instanbul and left her husband Steven, right, and their two young sons behind . Healing: Now Steven has found a new love in his murdered wife's childhood friend Dulce Arroyo. The two married almost a year to the day after Sarai's slaying . 'The Lord showed me that he wants us to move forward,' Sierra told the New York Daily News. 'You have to know in your heart when it’s right.' When Sarai's disappearance first made headlines after she failed to catch a flight home January 21, 2013, it appeared that the wife and mother, who married rather young, was simply sowing her oats late in life. But subsequent reports of tensions in the Sierra household painted a different picture, one in which Sarai was heading to the exotic foreign land to meet a man she'd met online, according to the Daily News. Steven and Sarai's brother David Jimenez traveled to Istanbul and began a frantic search for Sarai, not knowing she was likely already dead. Sarai's face was so badly beaten that Steven had to identify her by the unusually high arch of her foot. But this month, Steven, a bus driver for the New York City Transit Authority, took a huge step towards leaving that horror behind. 'I remember asking Dulce, ""Are you ready for this?"" And she said immediately with no hesitation, ""It would be an honor to raise the sons of my friend Sarai,""' Sierra told the Daily News. Arroyo knew Sarai as a young child and became her close friend shortly after she first married Sierra. She recalls the last time she saw her friend in the the days just before her fated trip. The pair ran into each other at a Staten Island shopping mall. Heading home: A casket carrying the remains of Sierra is prepared to be loaded onto a flight at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, Turkey in early 2013 after her body was found in a seedy area of Istanbul . Mourning: Steven Sierra, husband of Sarai Sierra, upper center, and Dennis Jimenez, right, wipe their eyes during her funeral, at the Christian Pentecostal Church in Staten Island . Tough times: Sarai Sierra's sons, Silas in blue shirt, and Sion in orange , are seen being comforted at their mother's wake. Dulce has her own son, Angel and the boys all now live together at the Staten Island home where Sarai once lived . 'Sarai was just great ... an absolute sweetheart,' says Dulce, who grew up on Staten Island with the slain woman . 'I didn’t say anything,' Dulce remembered. 'But I was thinking, ""An American woman in Turkey? What are you, crazy?""' Arroyo never saw her old friend again, but remembers her fondly. 'Sarai was just great ... an absolute sweetheart,' says Dulce, whose own son, Angel, is just a little older than Sierra's oldest boy Sion, 13. But is was Sierra's youngest boy, Silas, who clenched the deal for the grieving father. 'I want to know what it’s like to be at the wedding of my father,' Silas told his dad, despite having previously forbidden him from ever marrying again. 'I miss having a mom.' Arroyo had been one of many members of the Sierras' devout Christian community who came forward to help the grieving widower in his time of need. They would not move in together until after their wedding. And even then Arroyo says it was difficult for her to see the home as hers and not Sarai's. 'I see them as my family now,' says Dulce. 'I used to see them as Sarai’s family. Her kids and her husband and her furniture. It’s home now for me.'","Sarai Sierra, 33, was found beaten to death February 2, 2013 in a seedy strip of Istanbul following her solo vacation to the city .

The legalization of marijuana for recreational use in Colorado and Washington state has got local wedding planners gearing up for an influx of couples looking to spice up their nuptials with a weed-themed wedding. The idea might sound ludicrous, but organizers are predicting that marijuana and marriages may very soon become a winning combination. ‘It’s the new wine. I think Colorado will see a lot more destination weddings for this reason,’ Jane West who runs Edible Events Co., a Denver-based company specializing in private BYOC (bring your own cannabis) events. The wedding cake of the future? Event planners in Colorado and Washington state are gearing up for an influx of couples looking to spice up their nuptials with a weed-themed wedding . ‘We’re going to start thinking of cannabis like alcohol, and we’re moving towards regulating cannabis like alcohol and normalizing its consumption,’ she told The Knot. While she hasn’t had any bookings for marijuana marriages so far, she is working with some brides-to-be who want to incorporate weed into their bachelorette parties and bridal showers. After attending a traditional Las Vegas bachelorette party, Jennifer Gargotto said she decided she ‘didn’t want a traditional bridal shower’. A cannabis advocate, who runs Cannibase an online marketplace for cannabis along with her fiancé, she decided weed would be the prefect way for her guests to relax and get to know each other before her big day. Jennifer Gargotto, CEO of Cannabase,  'didn't want a traditional bridal shower' and decided to incorporate marijuana into her bachelorette party . ‘It’s a chance to demonstrate how classy it can be and hopefully calm some nerves and help people get to know each other before the wedding,’ she said. Another bride to-be with ties to Colorado’s burgeoning weed-related industry in Christianna Lewis, who works for The Hemp Connoissuer magazine. She told The Knot that she and her fiancé initially wanted cannabis to be a part of their wedding, but found it wasn’t currently that easy. ‘Initially my fiance wanted to have an area for vaporizing, but because of the venue we chose it won’t be at the actual wedding,’ said Christianna. Both brides-to-do also spoke about not wishing to make guests who aren't cannabis uses feel uncomfortable and so neither is currently planning to serve marijuana at their weddings. Some brides-to-be are starting to consider incorporating weed into their bachelorette parties and bridal showers . 'We’re trying to be mindful and respectful of their feelings, even though they’re supportive of what we both do,' said Christianna. Instead, she and her finance have decided to throw a joint (pardon the pun) bridal shower with a variety of weed sweets and edibles involved.

Meryl Streep played mean boss Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada (pictured) They may lack the competitive streak of their male colleagues but women are loath to work together. A study found two women are less likely to co-operate than two men when one is more powerful than the other. Similarly, two females of different rank are less likely to work together than a man and a woman. The finding contradicts the widely held belief that women’s nurturing nature makes it natural for them to help each other out, while men are too competitive to have time for each other. Researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances. Women, however, are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them. Richard Wrangham, of the University of Quebec at Montreal, said: ‘The question we wanted to examine was: Do men or women co-operate better with members of their own sex? ‘The conventional wisdom is that women co-operate more easily but when you look at how armies or sports teams function, there is evidence that men are better at co-operating in some ways.’ To look at whether there sexes differ in how they co-operate, the scientists looked at research collaborations in 50 university psychology departments. This showed that all female pairings of junior and senior researchers were much less common than collaborations between two men at different stages in their career. However, women of the same rank didn’t seem to have difficulty in working together and mixed-sex collaborations were also common. In other words, the problem arises in situations in which one female is more powerful than the other. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the researchers said the lack of trust may come from both directions. U.S. researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances. Women, however, are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them. Consequently they believe many women prefer to work with a male boss (pictured) Working for a difficult boss can come with stress, long hours and a poor office atmosphere. Recent research has found it can also be bad for your health. The stress of working for a bad boss over a long period of time can cause serious harm to employees, the study found. Scientists at Ohio State University found that chronic stress causes changes in the gene activity in immune cells. These changes cause the cells to be primed to fight an infection that doesn't exist. This leads to inflammation in the body which is associated with many health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. They said: ‘The study does not demonstrate whether the reduced level of co-operation among women if different status is due to higher-ranked or lower-ranked women. ‘However, our findings are consistent with results from early childhood onwards suggesting that females of lower status can be uncomfortable co-operating with their superiors. ‘Female superiors may also be less willing than male superiors to invest in lower-ranked same-sex individuals.’ Others say that while men make their feelings clear, women are more likely to let jealousies and resentments fester. Harvard University researcher Joyce Benenson, one of the study’s authors, said that women’s instinctive distrust of females in power may make it more difficult for them to scale the career ladder. She said: ‘Females are less likely than males to co-operate across ranks with same-sex individuals. ‘This means that a highly talented newcomer female in any organisation does not receive the support that her male counterpart does from higher-ranked individuals who can help them climb the hierarchy.’ Even having a male boss may not be a huge help. Professor Benenson said: ‘Because men often discriminate against women, it is unclear whether higher-ranked males could be more helpful.’","University of Quebec study found that two women are less likely to co-operate than two men, when one is more powerful than the other .

A belief in contagion raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as John F. Kennedy, (pictured) a study claims . Most people think they pay little attention to magic in modern times. But a new study has shown that when it comes to celebrities, plenty of people subscribe to the rich and famous instilling everyday objects with their magical ‘essence’. A belief in contagion – magical thinking in which a person’s qualities can be transferred to an object – raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as John F. Kennedy but lowers them for criminals and fraudsters, researchers claim. Two psychologists at Yale University set out to find how the belief in contagion influences the sale of celebrity memorabilia. Using data from three high-profile estate auctions, George Newman and Paul Bloom found that people’s expectations about the amount of physical contact between an object and a celebrity positively predicts the final bids for items that belonged to well-liked individuals such as President Kennedy. Essentially, people were willing to pay more for items owned by liked celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, if they had touched them a lot. The study in PNAS revealed that contagion negatively predicts final bids for items that belonged to disliked individuals, such as financial fraudster Bernard Madoff. The researchers wrote: ‘Contagion is a form of magical thinking in which people believe that a person's immaterial qualities or essence can be transferred to an object through physical contact’ and concluded the belief suggests ‘that magical thinking may still have effects in contemporary western societies.’ People were willing to pay more for items owned by liked celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, if they had touched them a lot . The study in PNAS revealed that contagion negatively predicts final bids for items that belonged to disliked individuals, such as financial fraudster Bernard Madoff (pictured) Volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it belonged to a celebrity they admired as well as one they disliked. People were prepared to pay almost 15 per cent less for a jumper worn by a celebrity if it had been sterilised - destroying the contagion effect. They would pay almost 9 per cent less for a jumper that they were not allowed to resell, indicating that most people value the celebrity ‘essence’ attached to an item, more than its cash value. However, sterilisation boosted the value of a jumper owned by a hated celebrity. Sterilised items that had belonged to an unpopular celebrity were valued around 17 per cent more valuable than those that had not. Drs Newman and Bloom looked at auction prices of 1,297 JFK-related items as well as 288 items said to have been owned by Marilyn Monroe and 489 related to Bernard Madoff. Descriptions of auction items rarely say whether the item was touched by its owner, so the participants of the study rated how much contact they thought each item might have had with its owner on a scale of one to eight, Smithsonian reported. The psychologists reasoned that people sitting in an auction house subconsciously do the same thing. They discovered a strong link between items thought to have been frequently used by a celebrity - such as a fork or a watch – and the price of items that exceeded auction houses’ estimates of how much an object would fetch. The only exception to their findings were prices paid for incredibly expensive items such as jewellery. Psychologists discovered a strong link between items thought to have been frequently used by a celebrity - such a watch - and the price of items that exceeded auction houses' estimates. However, contagion reduced the value of items worn by disliked celebrities. Watches belonging to Bernard Madoff are pictured . For items valued over $10,000, people did not pay any more or less based upon the amount of contact a celebrity might have had with them, indicating that the contagion effect does not influence serious investments. The duo also conducted an experiment where 435 volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it had belonged to a celebrity they like as well as one that they hate. ‘When asked to bid on a sweater owned by a well-liked celebrity, participants report that they would pay substantially less if it was sterilised before they received it,’ destroying the magical contagion effect and a celebrity’s ‘essence’, the psychologists wrote.

They would pay almost 9 per cent less for a jumper that they were not allowed to resell, indicating that most people value the celebrity ‘essence’ attached to an item, more than its cash value. ‘However, sterilisation increases the amount they would pay for a sweater owned by a disliked celebrity,’ the researchers said. Sterilised items that had belonged to an unpopular celebrity were valued around 17 per cent more valuable than those that had not, suggesting people do not want to be in contact with the ‘essence’.","Two psychologists at Yale University investigated how the belief in contagion influences the sale of celebrity memorabilia .

Aerodynamic: Ospreys have a wingspan of nearly two metres and can reach speeds of 80 mph when hunting . Crash: The osprey, which is also known as a sea hawk, crashes into the water and grabs the fish in its talons . Nicknamed the sea hawk, this ultimate aerodynamic killing machine folds its wings behind itself mid-dive in order to achieve the speed and precision of a dart. Photographer Viet La, 57, from Ontario in California, took the photographs last month. He said; 'The bird was going very fast - it had to move quickly to catch the fish...He managed to catch his lunch, then he emerged from the water and sat on a nearby branch to eat it. 'You can tell just how fast it was going by how blurry the background of my photo is,' he added. Paul Stancliffe of the British Trust for Ornithology said: 'Ospreys are fish specialists, feeding on virtually nothing else.' Underwater: Photographer Viet La said: 'The bird was going very fast - it had to move quickly to catch the fish' 'Osprey hunt fish by circling over water. Once a fish is spotted below the surface they dive and plunge feet-first into the water to grab the fish in their talons,' he added. Ospreys are unusual in that they appear almost all over the world as a single living species with, for example, hardly any genetic difference between one bird in Alaska and another that lives in Kenya. The Osprey is the second most widely distributed raptor species, after the Peregrine Falcon. In the British Isles the birds are scarce breeders and live primarily in Scotland, with smaller numbers in England and Wales. Ospreys became extinct in the British Isles in 1916 after aggressive egg and skin collection in the Victorian era, but were recolonised in Scotland in 1954 and reintroduced to the Lake District in 1996.","Osprey was photographed hunting in El Dorado Park Lake in California .

The search for a 23-year-old nursing student who went missing in Tennessee nearly three years ago was renewed over the weekend with authorities searching the home and property of an arrested 29 year old. Homeowner Zachary Adams was booked in Decatur County Jail on charges of aggravated assault Friday, following another arrest for drug charges earlier in the week. Tennesse Bureau of Investigation authorities wouldn't say whether Adams' arrest was in connection to the April 2011 disappearance of Holly Bobo, but they carried out a search warrant on his property while he was behind bars. Scroll down for video . Renewed search: Holly Bobo (left)  was last seen on April 13, 2011 walking into the woods behind her house with a man dressed in full camouflage. Investigators started searching the home of Zachary Adams (right) on Friday after he was arrested for aggravated assault. They haven't yet named him as a suspect in her disappearance . New tips: Authorities started searching Adams' property on Friday and continued throughout Sunday. Adams' house is located approximately 15 miles from Bobo's home where she went missing . Danielle Darnell, who grew up with Adams, says she was interviewed by police on Friday and told them Bobo encountered Adams and friends out on a racoon hunt a week before her disappearance. 'Holly was on stage and walking around the coon hunt and they basically followed, stalked her a bit,' Darnell told WBBJ. 'Karen [Bobo] even went up and introduced herself as Holly's mom.' Darnell says Adams made a few comments about Bobo in the past year to close friends, and that she and others reported the comments to the TBI. 'I do believe he is involved along with three others. I just know from things I've heard,' she said. Bobo was last seen by her brother on April 13, 2011 who saw her walking into the woods behind their Darden home with a man dressed in full camouflage. Where is Holly? The search on Saturday seemed to focus on an abandoned building and well across the street from Adams' house . TBI Director Mark Gwyn held a press conference Friday afternoon, and said he wouldn't be revealing details about the new search so as not to jeopardize the 'vital' new information they've collected. 'This is a very important time in this investigation. We're not going to say or do anything at this point to interfere with this investigation,' said Gwyn. 'Hopefully we'll be able to return Holly home safely to her parents. That's our goal.' They have not named Adams as a suspect in the disappearance yet, but neighbors weren't surprised to see authorities searching the reportedly unemployed man's property. 'Zach is always been in trouble. He's on drugs, really high. He has hurt his grandparents and a lot of people around here in different ways,' Ann LaMance said. High: Neighbors have described Adams as a drug user. Before his arrest on Friday for aggravated assault, he was booked earlier in the week for a drug charge . The search of Adams' property began Friday, but switched to the property across the street the following day. His house is located approximately 15 minutes from Bobo's home on Swan Johnson Road where she was last seen. Locals say Bible Hill Road closely connects both Swan Johnson Road and Adams lane. On Saturday the search seemed to focus on an abandoned building and what appeared to be a well on the property across the street. A dive team was brought in as well as cadaver dogs, while investigators took pictures and scoured the wooded areas. Gone: There is currently a $250,000 reward to return Holly Bobo .

Broken: Bobo's heartbroken parents Karen (left) and Dana (right) A small bobcat excavator was brought in on Sunday afternoon, and dirt was also being sifted on the property. TBI director Gwyn says the search will continue in the coming days, despite an impending ice storm. Terrie Bromley, a close friend of the Bobo family, is one of thousands who have aided in the search for Holly over the past three years. She told the Jackson Sun that the woods in front of the Adams home were searched before, but never the home itself. Close: Bobo went missing in Darden, and the search this weekend took place in nearby Holladay, Tennessee . Bromley says Bobo was not friends Adams or even friends with his friends. Meanwhile, about 400 friends and family gathered at Corinth baptist Church for a 12-hour vigil Saturday.

'At this point we still believe that she's alive.

Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russel Wilson is set to join the Texas Rangers for their spring training game against the Cleveland Indians today. Texas Rangers number 3 jerseys emblazoned with Russell Wilson's name have gone on sale ahead of the stunt appearance by Wilson, who played minor league baseball in 2011. But the star quarterback will not be risking injury by actually playing in the game, and instead will watch from the dugout. The multi-talented sportsman was acquired by the Rangers during the 2013 Rule 5 draft from the Colorado Rockies. Lone Ranger: The Seattle Seahawks quarterback is also a part of the Texas Rangers baseball team . The Rule 5 draft occurs each December. Teams can trade players not on their 40-man roster for $50,000 per player. Wilson was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in 2010 and acquired by the Texas Rangers in December. Seahawks fans need not worry; the Rangers are not about to put Wilson in Monday’s game and let him get buzzed by 90-mile-an-hour fastballs, even though he will be in uniform and in the dugout for the matchup with Cleveland.

His career with the team won't go beyond an appearance in the dugout at Monday's game in Surprise, Arizona where he's expected to inspire the Rangers before the match. Wilson may take part in some of the Rangers’ pregame workout, but that is it. 'Our intentions are to bring him in and see if there’s anything he can say that may help anyone around here that has on a baseball uniform,' Rangers Manager Ron Washington said.

Because of concerns about his height, the five-foot-11 Wilson jumped at his chance to play two seasons professionally in Colorado’s minor league system. He played in 93 games in 2010 and 2011, but never above the Class A level.

Lucky: Isidro Hernandez Tovar, 70, survivied the deadliest vehicle accident in U.S. history when he was 19-years-old and working as a laborer in California . A 70-year-old man who survived the deadliest vehicle accident in U.S. history spoke to the press for the first time since a train rammed into a bus full of Mexican laborers in 1963. After spending two months in the hospital, Isidro Hernandez Tovar, then 19, returned to his home in Jalisco, Mexico and put the scarring day behind him. Tovar only came forward after reading an article in the Monterey Herald last week about Salvador Flores Barragan - the man believed to be the sole-survivor of the crash. So he called up the Herald and said: 'I'm also a survivor'. Tovar was in the U.S. working in the Bracero program when the crash happened. The . Bracero program was establed in 1942 and ran until 1964, bringing some 5 . million foreign workers to the country to supplement labor shortages . caused by World War II - many of them Mexican nationals. Tovar . says he had to pay 700 pesos to sign up for the program, a fee  he was . only able to afford once starting work in California. 'Frankly, . they treated you like a little animal, they sent you from here to . there,' he said. '(The employers) were the ones who did everything. They . would tell you to either go to Coachella, the Imperial Valley or . Salinas. Three of us from my town came to Salinas.' He says he entered the program with three others from his hometown and they were all stationed at a celery farm near Chualar. It . was after a day of cutting and bagging celery that the workers were . boarded onto a bus to be shuttled back to their work camp. The . workers sat on four boards, two in the middle and two on the sides of . the bus. Once everyone was seated the bus began to move, but Tovar had . gotten up to go to the front of the bus. Deadly: Tovar and other foreign laborers were leaving a day of work on a celery farm in September 1963 when their bus was hit by a train. Twenty-eight people died on the scene and four later at the hospital. Above, the site of the accident . He . left a bag tied to the table near the front of the vehicle, and . therefore escaped the direct hit of a train that hit the back of the . bus. He says he didn't hear the train whistle, but rememebrs feeling the impact. When he came to, there were already bodies on the ground covered in orange blankets and then he passed out again. When he woke up again, he started looking for his friend Sixto Robles Urzua but couldn't find him. 'I . walked to the bodies, uncovered the tarps, saw two or three bodies, but . I didn't recognize any of them. They were completely disfigured. I kept . walking and when I couldn't walk anymore, I sat by the edge of the . field. Twenty-eight . people died at the scene and four later at the hospital in what the . National Safety Council has described as the biggest fatal vehicle . accident in U.S. history. Lives lost: Above, the road that bracero farm workers were traveling as they crossed the train tracks and were hit by a northbound train September 17, 1963, in Chualar, California . Tovar was taken to Carmel Hospital, where a woman volunteered to help write his family at home. 'She . told my mom that I was OK, not to be worried. I was all banged up, my . shoulder blade was broken, but I could walk,' Tovar recalls. After . spending two months in the hospital, Tovar returned home to Mexico and . spent the next several years traveling into Mexico City for interviews . with insurance companies about a settlement. In 1968 he was awarded 92,000 pesos. 'During . those visits, I used to see some of the remaining survivors, the widows . and the mothers,' he said. 'After we got the money, I lost track of . everybody. I've always thought about the event, but I lost touch.' Tovar . revisted that dark day two years ago though when he returned to site of . the crash and found nothing - no marker to remember the lost lives. Going back to the scene: Tovar stands next to a sign memorializes the deadly crash . This . September marked the 50th Anniversary of the crash, and there's been . renewed interest in the event especially among immigration rights . actvists who sucessfully lobbied to get a stretch of Highway 101 . dedicated as the Bracero Memorial HighWay. The dedication was held in September, and today there's a sign marking the crash where Tovar found nothing two years ago. The sign reads: 'RIP 32 braceros. Sept. 17, 1963. 4:25 PM.' On . Thursday, Tovar traveled back to the accident site with his wife and . son to talk with researchers about the accident and his part in the . Bracero program.

"By . Associated Press . and Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 19:14 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 00:01 EST, 3 March 2014 . The recent arrest of Sinaloa drug cartel kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman means the next man in line will be expected to stand up - and now he may have been identified. Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, 66, and from the same rural area of Mexico as El Chapo, is a close confidant of the jailed drug lord, and is considered to be the brains behind the operation. 'He is everything,' a US official told the Los Angeles Times. 'The brains. The logistics. Security. Everything.' Guzman was seen by officials as the muscle. The longer-term fate of a criminal ring . likened to an international corporation is anything but clear, as . authorities pursue other top leaders and weaker rivals dream of moving . in - but Zambada seems firmly in control, at least for now. Top dog: Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada is said to have taken over the Sinaloa drug cartel from Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman . Zambada is less flashy, according to a Times profile, but is still known to law enforcement - US officials have long offered a $5million reward for information leading to his capture. The rural farmer is well entrenched in the Sinaloa cartel, according to a 2010 profile in Proceso cited by the Times. He is respected by those both inside and outside of the organization - which is likely key to keeping it together. He and Guzman grew up together in rural Mexico and rose through the ranks of the cartel together, an official told the Times. Zambada told Proceso that he and El Chapo are 'compadres' who 'talk on the phone regularly,' the case for him being placed at the top even if he does  not want the title. 'Everything indicates that El Mayo Zambada will stay at the front of the organization. What's less clear is whether, with the detention of [El Chapo], his business model will come to an end,' an official told the Times. Zambada prefers to hold back on drug supplies instead of flooding the market, an easy way to drive up both demand and prices, as well as influence. El Mayo is also violent, but much less out in the open, according to the Times. He prefers to single out victims instead of leave the mass graves that have become a Sinaloa cartel hallmark in recent years. A DEA official who spoke on the condition . of anonymity to discuss specific details of Guzman's arrest in Mexico . said the agency doesn't anticipate that Guzman's absence will have an . immediate effect on cartel operations because it has evolved from a gang . into a worldwide organization. The operation did not touch the cartel's immense political power, nurtured through the bribery of corrupt officials, or its thriving money laundering operations. In this Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014 photo, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City, Mexico. Guzman, the head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, was captured overnight in the beach resort town of Mazatlan. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo) 'As long as these other structures remain in place, all things being equal, Sinaloa will be able to continue to operate if not as normal, at least as the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico,'  said David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Justice in Mexico Project. Guzman, who made Forbes magazine's lists of billionaires and most powerful people, was first among equals with Zambada and Juan Jose Esparragoza, known as ""El Azul,"" both of whom remain at large. Guzman worked closely with Zambada. Guillermo Valdes, former head of Mexico's top domestic intelligence agency, said the pair shared a clear vision, not only with respect to their adversaries but also with their business plan for trafficking cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countries. In other recent takedowns of major cartels, the Mexican government had to hit more than one leader before the organizations were dismantled or scattered into smaller gangs. One by one, the Arellano Felix brothers in Tijuana were arrested or killed over the last decade, as were the Beltran Leyva brothers from 2008 to 2011. Though the Mexican marines killed Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, the power of the group did not diminish until the other leader, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, was arrested last summer. Despite the continuity provided by having El Mayo at the top, some predict Sinaloa is about to suffer the same fate. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said to expect more arrests because authorities penetrated the cartel's communications system in catching Guzman. 'Our ability to crack their code will not bode well for their future,' he said, comparing Guzman's capture to the 1993 killing of Pablo Escobar of Colombia's Medellin cartel, once a powerful criminal organization. Its demise helped grow cartels such as Sinaloa. When Escobar fell, ""'he cartels started to unravel.' In fact, some fear Guzman's capture could spark more violence, though no Mexican cartels seem strong enough at the moment to make a major play. Long known to officials: El Mayo has operated out of the public spotlight, but has long been under scrutiny . Sinaloa's main rivals, the Zetas, have been substantially weakened, and other groups have become too local to rival Guzman's international reach. Since Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, he grew his cartel to be one of the largest in the world, with tentacles extending from Argentina to Australia. Nobody outside the cartel leadership knows the extent of its power or business, but estimates are that Sinaloa handles 25 to 45 percent of all drugs entering the United States, with revenues around $3 billion a year. Last year, Forbes named Guzman the world's 67th most powerful person, between U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner and New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson. Sinaloa is believed to operate with an extended network of officials and lookouts on the payroll, especially in the western Mexico state for which the cartel is named. Both a state and federal police chief have been arrested for alleged ties to Sinaloa or its allies, only to later be released. When the Mexican marines mounted their offensive on Saturday, it was without alerting any local law enforcement. 'Local and state authorities are in the service of the Sinaloa cartel,' Valdez said. Even though the long-term fate of Sinaloa is unclear, everyone agrees on the bottom line: The drugs will still continue to flow, even with the takedown of other Mexican cartels. 'In drug trafficking, as long as there is demand, there will be a supply,' Valdes said. 'It's like energy. You can't create or destroy it. It only transforms.'","Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, 66, grew up with former Sinaloa boss Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman .

A 12 year old New Zealand boy who is losing his sight wants to fill a 'visual bucket list' before he goes blind. Louis Corbett, who together with two of his older brothers suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary condition that robs sufferers of their sight, sometimes within months, is in a race against time to experience some of the world’s wonders before it’s too late. His parents, Catherine and Tim, asked him what he would like to see most – and the brave boy came up with a heart-warming hit list. Boy on a mission: Louis Corbett wants to complete his bucket list before he goes blind . Louis, from Auckland, chose the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and, in a sign of the times, Google headquarters in California. And unlike most Kiwis, who have a passion for either rugby or cricket, he also said he wanted to watch a live Boston Celtics basketball game in the US. 'Last year was a hard one for poor Louis,' Mrs Corbett told CNN. 'That's when he learned that his case was accelerated. '(But) this year we're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can. 'For some reason he really got hooked on American basketball. He cares about nothing else. He is really quite passionate about it.' In control: Louis's list has involved him travelling to the United States . Game on: Louis Corbett (left) with brother Jerome will watch the Boston Celtics live this week . With Louis' eyesight fading rapidly - by 50% in the past year alone - the trip was going to have to happen soon. A Boston-based businessman heard of the family’s plight and moved to make the little boy’s dream come true. Warren Casey, CEO of a US-based software firm, made a large donation and vowed to raise even more so Louis and his family could be in Boston for the Celtic’s game against the Golden State Warriors on March 5. 'I did it because the Corbetts are my next door neighbours,' said Mr Casey, who splits his time between Boston and his home in Auckland. He persuaded Air New Zealand to pay for the airfare and donated his own points. Thanks to the generosity of Mr Casey and his partners at Ceiba Solutions, who agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised, and the generosity of people around the world, more than $25,000 was raised in just four weeks. 'It is so touching,' Mrs Corbett said. 'People are just so supportive.' Enjoying life: Louis (second from top) has visited Disneyland as part of his bucket list . Sports fan: Louis (second left) has met some of his sporting idols, including New Zealand cricketers Kane Williamson (left) and Tim Southee . The fund-raising campaign also came to the attention of Corinne Grousbeck, wife of Celtics CEO Wycliffe 'Wyc' Grousbeck, whose 21-year-old son suffers from a similar condition to Louis’. 'Somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in New Zealand and told me I should read it,' said Mrs Grousbeck, incoming chairwoman of the Perkins School for the Blind. 'I completely understood where the Corbetts were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for (Louis). It's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through. 'Of course when I read about how he was a big Celtics fan, I knew that we had to have him come for a game.” While Mrs Grousbeck said she would ensure Louis and his family get some of the best seats in the house, she said the real show would be before tipoff, when the Perkins chorus sings the US national anthem.

Jesse Lee Perales allegedly smashed down the front door of Krystal Flores Perales's Laguna Shores Rd home in Corpus Christi, Texas, about 10pm Sunday. According to court documents, Perales threatened Krystal Flores Perales's sister with a gun, saying he would shoot her if she moved. He then allegedly told his son 'that he was going to kill his mother, Krystal . Perales, then himself'. Gripped by fear, Krystal Flores Perales, 28, grabbed her children, ran outside and jumped over the fence into an adjacent lot to escape. Perales allegedly followed her and shot her several times in the head at point blank range as her terrified children watched. He fled the scene. Police said the young mother died from gunshot wounds at Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital later that night, Kiiii News reported. Perales was reportedly the father of two of Krystal Flores Perales's four children and had filed for divorce in August last year. Following an anonymous tip, Perales was found the next day hiding out in an apartment complex at Staples and Saratoga. It is not clear what prompted the alleged attack, however Perales virtually admitted to a reporter he shot his wife over a custody issue, Kiii News reported. When asked by 3News why he did it, Perales answered, 'Why do you want to know?' The reporter then asked if the shooting was custody-related, to which Perales answered, 'So my kids grow up good, man...(expletive) their mom.'

The mother of the 'Ikea monkey' has ended her custody battle to get him back from an animal sanctuary. Yasmin Nakhuda will not appeal a judge's decision to place monkey Darwin with Story Brook Farm Primate Sanctuary (SBFPS). Nakhuda has said that steep legal fees, along with little chance of success left her with no choice but to give up her quest for ownership of the monkey, The Globe and Mail reports. The court ordered Nakhuda to pay a costs award of $83,000, in addition to her own legal costs. Darwin, a Japanese snow macaque, received worldwide attention after he escaped from Nakhuda's car in an IKEA parking lot in December 2012 and was photographed wearing a shearling jacket. Yasmin Nakhuda, 'mother' to monkey Darwin, seen here, engaged in a heated legal battle to gain ownership of the monkey . Darwin, seen here with Nakhuda, is now permanently living at Story Brook Farm Primate Sanctuary . Darwin gained worldwide attention after he was snapped wearing his shearling coat, like the one seen here, in the parking lot of an Ikea in 2012 . The monkey was then seized by animal services and sent to Stony Brook, prompting the dispute between Nakhuda and the sanctuary. The legal battle for custody of Darwin has been heated -- the June 2013 trial heard that Story Brook founder Sherri Delaney received death threats from Nakhuda's supporters, according to The Toronto Star. Nakhuda purchased Darwin from an exotic animal dealer after watching a video of a different Japanese snow macaque waiting on a table in a restaurant, the website says. On a Facebook support page for Darwin, Nakhuda said she had 'no regrets' regarding her battle for ownership of the monkey. 'We've faced ridicule, insults and our work and health suffered but we never relented out of pure selfless love,' she said. 'We have no regrets. None whatsoever.' She also said that his fan page will not be taken down from the social media website.

'DDM Facebook page WILL REMAIN and in fact shall thrive,' she said.  'It will be Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary's reminder that they have mere ""possession"" of Darwin but can never own him as Darwin is ours and will always remain ours in our heart, mind and soul. They will NEVER take this away from us.' In a statement on its website, the Story Brook sanctuary said it was 'pleased' with Nakhuda's decision. 'In September 2013, an Ontario Superior Court judge ruled that Darwin is a wild animal, and based on case law, Ms. Nakhuda lost ownership once he escaped from her car,' it says. 'Over the past 15 months, we have incurred numerous expenses as a result of Ms. Nakhuda’s lawsuit [...]  and the payment by Ms. Nakhuda of the costs award made in SBFPS’ favour has allowed us to pay off those expenses,' it adds. The remainder of the award was reportedly split with Kevin D. Toyne, who worked as a pro bono retainer on the case. The sanctuary also says that because Darwin was raised in a human home, he is only now 'slowly but surely learning to be more monkey than human.' The monkey, they say, now grooms one of his neighbors and and has learned to imitate other monkey's vocalizations.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:20 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:21 EST, 3 March 2014 . The case of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held by the Taliban since 2009, has arisen again as the U.S. and other countries engage in diplomatic efforts to free him. But if he is released, will America's only prisoner of the Afghan war be viewed as a hero or a deserter? While tattered yellow ribbons still adorn utility poles in his native Hailey, Idaho, others are expressing conflicting thoughts about Bergdahl's plight as the war winds down, with President Barack Obama threatening to withdraw all U.S. troops by year's end unless the Afghan government signs a crucial security agreement. They are convinced that on June 30, 2009, just a few months after he arrived in Afghanistan, Bergdahl willingly walked away from his unit, which was deployed in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan, adjacent to the border with Pakistan. As the Pentagon continues to try and free U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl - who has been held captive by the Taliban since 2009 - talk has turned to what will happen to him if and when he returns. Bergdahl is seen here in a grab from a Taliban video released in 2010 . While they do want Bergdahl home, they think he should have to answer allegations that he deserted his unit. Bergdahl was last seen in a video the Taliban released in December. At this year's Grammys, celebrities were photographed wearing Bowe bracelets. In the past two years, billboards with Bergdahl's face have popped up in major cities. One shows a smiling Bergdahl, in an Army uniform, with the message: 'He fought for us. ... Let's fight for him!' A transcript of radio intercepts, publicly released through Wikileaks, indicates that Bergdahl, then 23, was captured while sitting in a makeshift latrine. 'We were attacking the post he was sitting,' according to a radio intercept of a conversation among insurgents. 'He had no gun with him. ... They have all (the) Americans, ANA (Afghan National Army), helicopters, the planes are looking for him. Can you guys make a video of him and announce it all over Afghanistan that we have one of the Americans?' Rolling Stone magazine quoted emails Bergdahl is said to have sent to his parents that suggest he was disillusioned with America's mission in Afghanistan, had lost faith in the U.S. Army's mission there and was considering desertion. Bergdahl told his parents he was 'ashamed to even be American'. The case of Bergdahl, held by the Taliban since 2009, has arisen again as the U.S. and other countries engage in diplomatic efforts to end his capture . U.S. Army Private Bowe Bergdahl watches as one of his captors displays his identity tag to the camera at an unknown location in Afghanistan, on July 19, 2009 . Bergdahl, who mailed home boxes containing his uniform and books, also wrote: 'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong.' The Associated Press could not independently authenticate the emails published by the magazine in 2012. Bergdahl's family has not commented on the allegations of desertion, according to Col. Tim Marsano, a spokesman for the Idaho National Guard. Marsano is in regular contact with Bergdahl's mother, Jani, and father, Bob, who has grown a long, thick beard and has worked to learn Pashto, the language spoken by his son's captors. A senior Defense Department official said that if Bergdahl is released, it could be determined that he has more than paid for leaving his unit - if that's what really happened - 'and there's every indicator that he did'. Still, it's a conundrum for commanders under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the equal application of the law, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the Bergdahl case. Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, said if there is evidence that Bergdahl left his unit without permission, he could be charged with being absent without leave (AWOL) or desertion. Desertion during a time of war can carry the death penalty. Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of captured U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, address a rally held in their son's honor in Haley, Idaho June 22, 2013 . Signs of support for U.S.  Army Private Bowe Bergdahl are displayed in the storefront window of Zaney's Coffee House, in Hailey, Idaho . But Congress never passed a declaration of war with respect to Afghanistan, and neither President George W. Bush nor President Barack Obama has determined that U.S. military operations in Afghanistan make this a 'time of war' for the purposes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Fidell said. Were Bergdahl to be charged with desertion, the maximum penalty he would face is five years in prison and a dishonorable discharge, if it's proved that he deserted with the intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service. A case of AWOL, ended by the U.S. apprehending him, would not require proof that he intended to remain away permanently. The maximum punishment for that would be a dishonorable discharge and 18 months' confinement, he said. 'Someone is going to have to make a decision, based on a preliminary investigation, as to whether this is a desertion or AWOL rather than simply having the bad luck to have fallen into the wrong hands,' Fidell said. 'The command can say ''This fellow has been living in terrible conditions. We don't approve of what he did but we're not going to prosecute him,'"" he said. 'Or, the military could prosecute him as a way of signaling to others that 'Look, you can't simply go over the hill ... It's quite an interesting set of issues that will have to be addressed as a matter of both policy and law.' While the American government are attempt to free Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity, it remains unclear how we will treated once he returns to the United States . Desertion can be difficult to prove, said Ret. Maj. Gen. John Altenburg Jr., a Washington attorney who served 28 years as a lawyer in the Army. 'There has to be some evidence that he intended never to come back - that he intended to remain away from his unit permanently,' Altenburg said. 'I don't know if they'll charge him with anything. It will depend on the circumstances of his return and what he has to say.' Mary Schantag, chairman of the P.O.W. Network, an educational nonprofit group founded in 1989, said it's futile to speculate. 'He is an American soldier in enemy hands. Period. Bring him home,' she said. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and former Marine who served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, agreed. 'It's hard to imagine any circumstance where his captivity won't be viewed as time served,' said Hunter, R-Calif. Video footage taken from a Taliban-affiliated website  Private First Class Bowe R. Bergdahl, captured by the Taliban in southeastern Afghanistan in June 2009 . 'The first order of business is securing his release and I don't think it does an ounce of good to begin contemplating that far ahead when the focus is on getting him home.' Chrissy Marsaglia and her husband, ex-Marines from outside Seattle who launched a bring Bowe home project in 2012, don't speculate about the details of his capture or efforts to release him. They just want him home. Through donations, the small group has worked to raise awareness of Bergdahl's captivity on more than 90 billboards in U.S. cities. 'Every day, we meet people who don't know about him,' she said.","U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been held captive by the Taliban since June 2009 .

Having been built in Wichita, Kansas, the 100-foot fuselages are loaded onto freight trains to be transported over the Rocky mountains where they are assembled on a literal giant conveyor belt as part of the Boeing 737 Next Generation program. The constant flow of the jets across the nation are to fill the near-insatiable demand for air-travel globally, matched by Boeing who declared late last year that they will increase the rate of 737 production at Renton to 47 jets a month by 2017 - more than 560 per year. Mammoth: Boeing 737 fuselages are delivered by train to a Boeing manufacturing site in Renton, Washington over the weekend . Conveyor: Boeing officially cranked the production rate of its 737 Next Generation plane to 42 per month, an all-time high and hopes to be building 47 a month by 2017 . From Wichita: The fuselages have been built in Kansas and have been transported over the Rocky Mountain's to be delivered to Renton, Washington . By 2017, Boeing and Airbus will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month. Both plane makers also are vying for a piece of the spare parts market, demanding royalties on parts that are sold directly to airlines and never enter their factories . Riding with the plane: These two Beoing workers are accompanying the multi-million dollar freight cargo that has been transported from Kansas to Washington . Long journey: The Boeing 737 actually starts at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, KS and the fuselage is transported by train to Renton . Arrival: The fuselages arrive at the Boeing Renton factory in Washington in preparation for their transformation into the world's most popular aircraft . Destination: Boeing's 737 manufacturing site is pictured with the Seattle skyline in the background in Renton, Washington February 26, 2014 . Indeed, there is talk of the number of fuselages delivered by Spirit Aerosystems of Wichita, Kansas rising to as many as 60 a month by the end of the decade. Speaking to the Seattle Times in June, Spirit CEO Jeff Turner said that it was conceivable and that his firm would strive to do so. Freight trains carrying complete 737 fuselages from Spirit run from Wichita, through Stevens Pass, along the Seattle waterfront and straight into the Renton factory. There are approximately 5,600 747's in service including, early 737's - which represents a quarter of the total worldwide fleet of large commercial jets flying . Across the world there are 331 airlines in 111 countries that are flying 737s . At any given second there are 2,000 737 planes in the air and one takes off or lands every 2 seconds . Across the model there are approximately 54,500 scheduled flights of 737s every day . Boeing 737s have carried more than 16.4 billion passengers - equivalent to every man and woman on earth flying at least twice . All Boeing 737s have flown more than 176.5 million flights since their launch . The steady increase rate is planned to match the introduction of the newest 737 model, the 737 MAX or Boeing 737 Next Generation. It will be the third generation derivative of the 737 and will include 4 variations able to seat between 110 to 210 passengers. The move is designed to keep up the staggering competition between Boeing and the European multinational conglomerate, Airbus and their A320 neo model. Airbus last week said it will notch up production of its single-aisle A320 planes by nearly 10 percent, matching a similar move by Boeing. Both companies also are building many of their double-aisle plans at faster rates. By 2017, Boeing and Airbus will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month. Beverly . Wyse, Boeingâ€™s 737 program vice president and general manager, said the . move is aimed at meeting increased demand from airlines in an interview . with the Seattle Times. 'Our . employees and our suppliers have successfully increased the production . rate to unmatched levels over the last three years,' said Wyse. 'This increase will lay a solid foundation as we bridge into production on the 737 MAX.' However, Airbus has already declared that it is steadily overtaking Boeing. While Boeing has just over 1,600 firm orders for the MAX, Airbus has more than 2,400 for the neo. The . Boeing 737 is the best-selling and longest continuously produced . commercial airliner of all time with over 10,500 deliveries and orders. With approximately 5,600 737s in service, 25% of the worldâ€™s large jet fleet are Boeing 737s. And Renton is very much a part of that success with 40 percent of the world's entire jetliner fleet having been built at Renton. Construction: A Boeing 737 jetliner is pictured during a tour of the Boeing 737 assembly plant in Renton, Washington February 4, 2014.

End of line: The winglet of a Boeing 737 jetliner is pictured during a tour of the Boeing 737 assembly plant in Renton, Washington February 4, 2014 . Planes are technical marvels that operate with great precision and safety, but the flying public still demands fares that cost less than a good hotel room, and jet fuel costs are likely to remain high. So airlines are driving hard bargains to pay as little as possible for jets . Boeing is selling some jets more aggressively, since Airbus has gained 60 percent of the market for new single-aisle planes, a market that represents more than half of the new planes to be delivered over the next 20 years .","Boeing is to increase production of its staple Boeing 737 airliner to 47 jets a month by 2017 .

Ian Olver, 44, from Plymouth, Devon, was left needing hospital treatment after his neighbour's cat attacked him because of the aftershave he was wearing . The 44-year-old plasterer was left with a three inch gash to his head after the pet cat clawed at him because it hated his Hugo Boss aftershave . But the unsuspecting father-of-two had no idea that their pet cat Blue had a phobia of strong scents. The normally-placid cat leapt up at Ian and began clawing at his neck and ears as soon as it smelt his eau de toilette. He managed to fight off the animal but was left with a three inch gash to the back of his head which required hospital treatment and a tetanus injection. Mr Olver, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I’m normally a cheap and cheerful sort of bloke so its rare that I’ll be wearing a posh aftershave but this was a Christmas present. 'I put on two or three squirts before going out but it wasn’t as though it was overpowering. 'But as soon as I was inside the cat leapt up off table and landed on the back of my head. 'I managed to fling it off but it jumped up to have another go. This time I managed to knock it away with my shoulder. 'It was only then that I touched the back of my head and saw my hand was covered in blood. Blue the cat, pictured above, attacked Mr Olver after detecting his Hugo Boss Bottled Night aftershave . Ian Olver, pictured, had his head glued back together in hospital after the incident on Saturday . 'It was so bad my wife called a paramedic out and then took me to hospital to have my cut glued together. 'I don’t have any animosity towards the cat I just think it had a really bad reaction to the aftershave. I thought it was a nice smell - but obviously the cat didn’t agree.' Mark and Lorraine Bawden reared three-year-old black and white cat Blue by hand after he was rejected by his mother when he was a newborn kitten. The animal-loving couple, who have four cats, two dogs and several tarantulas, say Blue has never attacked anyone before but does react strangely to odours. Mr Bawden, 38, who is a carer, said: 'Blue wasn’t allowed to come into contact with anyone for the first six months of his life because his immune system didn’t work. Mark Bawden, Blue the cat's owner, said: 'He does have have a few issues and one of them is that he's very sensitive to smell' 'So he does have have a few issues and one of them is that he’s very sensitive to smell. 'He goes ballistic if he gets a whiff of tobacco for example. He’ll lick your fingers and roll onto his back as if it’s catnip. 'It’s the exact opposite with Vaseline, he absolutely hates it and will run off.' Lorraine, 38, added: 'We normally ask people what deodorant they’ve got on. 'If we buy any new perfumes or aftershaves I normally spray them on a card to see if he likes them. Father-of-two Ian, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I don't have any animosity towards the cat I just think it had a really bad reaction to the aftershave. I thought it was a nice smell - but obviously the cat didn't agree' 'This was totally out of character, he normally runs off when he doesn’t like something. 'He’s the cuddliest, most lovely cat we have and he’s never attacked anyone before - its just Ian and his expensive aftershave.' Launched in 2010, Hugo Boss Bottled Night is billed as an aromatic fragrance which 'abounds in intense and masculine woody accords' with hints of lavender, birch tree and African violet. Leading animal psychologist Dr Roger Mugford said Blue may have perceived the aftershave as a threat. The cat, which has a phobia of strong smells, attacked Mr Olver supposedly because he was wearing the Hugo Boss Bottled Night scent, pictured above . He said: 'It’s possible the cat may have attacked as a result of the perfume. 'Cats identify people by their smells and he may have seen the scent as a threat. 'This has happened in the past with both dogs and cats though dogs are more visual than cats, they don’t rely on their sense of smell as much. 'I would think that for this little cat the best thing for the man to do would be to go in with a treat as a peace offering.' Hugo Boss declined to comment.","Plasterer Ian Olver, 44, had his head, neck and ear clawed by the animal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:58 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:56 EST, 3 March 2014 . A new study has finally revealed a solid answer to a question that's plagued travelers for decades: when exactly should you book a flight to get it at its cheapest. And that answer is 54 days prior to departure, according to CheapAir.com. The tip comes from a study that analyzed over 4 million flights in 2013...and following its advice could save you hundreds on your next domestic flight. When to buy? A study from CheapAir.com looked at 4 million flights in 2013 and determined the best time to buy a plane ticket is 54 days prior to the flight . While the precise time to buy differs with destination, the compiled data--which looked at 10.5 months of booking time, the earliest most flights allow you to buy--revealed a window that applied to most domestic flights. CheapAir's study says that the best time to book a domestic flight falls between 104 and 29 days before a flight. Here are the best times to book, in days before the flight, by region. United States (domestically): 54 days . Mexico: 89 days . Caribbean: 101 days . Latin America: 80 days . Europe: 151 days . Middle East: 80 days . Africa: 166 days . Asia: 129 days . South Pacific: 70 days . Between 104 and 29 days prior to a flight, tickets tend to be at their cheapest. Buy any earlier than that and risks paying more than you need to. CheapAir says that many travelers make the mistake of buying in the first four months a ticket is available, when prices remain steadily high. Buy any later and the price is on a steep rise towards the day it hits its peak: the actual day of the flight. On average, though, it is better to buy too early rather than too late. According . to the study, those who booked before the 29-104 day window paid an . average of $33 more per ticket. Meanwhile, those who booked too late . paid an average of $73 more per ticket. Perhaps most importantly, the difference between buying on the cheapest day and the most expensive was an astonishing $312. It . must be noted that these findings showed the best time to buy domestic . flights on average in 2013 and can't predict the exact day to buy every . flight every single year. A . savvy traveler must also consider the popularity of his or her . destination, the time of year (is it Christmas? Thanksgiving) and the . availability of flights to the destination (is it a small or large . airport?). But following . the suggestions and sticking to the purchasing window suggested by . CheapAir is more likely than not to save you at least a little cash. WHEN TO BOOK EARLIER . When flying on or near a holiday. The study showed that the best time on average to buy a ticket for Christmas or Thanksgiving travel was June 4. When traveling abroad. While the best time to buy varied with the destination country, it was always earlier than with domestic flights. When flying someplace popular. Such as a warm, sunny place. You're flying into a small airport. You have very specific departure times. WHEN TO WAIT . When your travel itinerary is flexible. When you're flying domestically. Compared to international travel, cheaper tickets can be found closer to flight date. This excludes Hawaii. When you are flying to a large city. Larger cities have more options for airports, airlines, arrival times, etc. When you're flying at off-peak times.

A 'Good Samaritan' driver chased a woman for several blocks after she fled the scene of an accident that left a motorcyclist dead. Thomas Stanley, 47, was driving behind 30-year-old Benjamin Pirofsky's motorcycle on North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, Florida when he claims to have seen a Ford SUV travelling in the opposite direction turn directly in front of them, causing Mr Pirofksky to fatally plough into the car. Mr Stanley says he was shocked to see the SUV's alleged driver Nadia Verdon, 42, leave the scene of the accident last Friday, so followed her for several blocks, eventually taking a photograph of her licence plate which police later used to track her down. New York-born Mr Pirofksky, who had lived with his aunt nearby Coral Springs for three years, had taken his motorcycle for a ride to help him calm down ahead of a house move to Fort Lauderdale, according to the Sun-Sentinel. But at around 9.30pm last Friday, the Volkswagen dealership finance manager was fatally injured after an SUV pulled in front of his bike as he drove southbound on the busy North Federal Highway. Mr Stanley said he was certain the motorcyclist had been killed when he witnessed the high-speed crash as Mr Pirofksky's helmet flew off in a different direction while his body and motorcycle were still travelling through the air. Unable to get the crash image out of his head, Mr Stanley was shocked to see the Ford vehicle he believed to have been involved drive off along Northeast Fourth Street. He then drove his vehicle across three lanes of traffic to follow the car, which eventually stopped several blocks later. Good Samaritan: Nadia Verdon (left) was followed by Thomas Stanley (right). Mr Stanley claimed Ms Verdon caused the fatal accident. Ms Verdon is charged with DUI manslaughter, leaving the scene involving death and tampering with evidence . Scene: Benjamin Pirofsky was travelling southbound on the North Federal Highway when a car travelling in the other direction made a left turn in front of him onto Northeast Fourth Street, causing the 30-year-old to crash . Mr Stanley claims Verdon refused to return to the scene of the accident and denied having been involved, so the part-time handyman took a photograph of her licence plate and returned to the accident site, where ambulance workers had just declared Mr Pirofksky dead. He was initially unable to get through to officers who were trying to clear traffic, but eventually they listened and took Mr Stanley to a police station for two hours of questioning. After explaining what he had seen and showing the photograph, Mr Stanley went with officers to Verdon's address where the blue SUV was found covered by a tarpaulin. The investigators smelt alcohol on Verdon's breath and arrested her the following morning, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Speaking to the newspaper about why he had followed the vehicle without thinking of his safety, Mr Stanley said: 'I thought, 'You did wrong'. Pay for your crime' Verdon faces charges of DUI manslaughter, leaving the scene involving death and tampering with evidence, the local Sheriff's Office said, and has been bailed ahead of a trial.","Thomas Stanley, 47, chased a Ford SUV he saw leaving scene of fatal crash .

They come to leave bowls of fruit in the hopes of pleasing the gods, spend their days chanting mantras and dress in the colourful saffron robes favoured by the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Welcome to Maha Shivaratri, a two-day festival celebrated all over the world, although nowhere does it quite so exuberantly as India and Nepal, the two homelands of Hinduism. One of 12 holidays dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Shiva, the bringer of death and destruction, the Maha Shivarati marks the day of his wedding to the goddess Parvati as well as the day he first performed his cosmic dance, the Tavata. Scroll down for video . Passionate: A devotee holds a human skull during a procession for Maha Shivaratri, dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Shiva, in Allahabad . Risky business: A colourfully dressed devotee holds a python close during a procession dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction . Colourful: A woman elaborately made up to look like the Hindu goddess Kali joins the procession in the Indian city of Allahbad . Extreme: A Sadhu (holy man) shows his devotion to Lord Shiva by pushing the boundaries and breaking taboos - in this case by holding a human bone in his mouth . Beautiful: Hindus dressed as Lord Shiva (right) and his wife Mata Pavarti (left) wave to the crowds as they process through the streets of Jammu . And as these incredible photos reveal, it's a day that worshippers in both India and Nepal take seriously. From huge, colourful processions to a day-long fast, Hindus celebrate Lord Shiva in scores of different ways. All, however, partake in the key elements of Mata Shivaratri: making offerings of golden apple leaves to Lord Shiva, fasting for a full 24 hours and by taking part in the jagarana - a night-long vigil held on the eve of the festival. Many worshippers also choose to show their respect for Lord Shiva by chanting 'Om Namah Shivaya', a sacred Panchakshara mantra dedicated to the deity. Others show their respect for the god by wearing his favourite colour, saffron yellow, or by dressing up as the god himself, his wife Parvati or in some cases, both. Watch out! A worshipper dressed as a demon lies on a (pretend) funeral pyre during the Shivrati celebrations in the Indian city of Allahbad . Parade: Three colourfully dressed little girls sit on a huge cut out portrait of an elephant head as they process through the streets of Allahbad . Smoky!

'Lord Shiva' shows off his courage with the help of a python, watched by members of the huge crowds that line the streets for Shivaratri . Preparation: A man is helped into his costume which is 50 per cent Lord Shiva and 50 per cent his wife, the goddess Parvati . While many ordinary Indian and Nepalese men and women get involved in proceedings, celebrations are led by the Sadhu - holy men who have dedicated their lives to serving the Hindu pantheon. The most colourfully garbed of all the participants, some choose to paint sacred scenes and symbols on their faces, while others smoke cannabis to help them achieve a meditative frame of mind. Some, the Aghori, carry human bones and skulls; a sign of their life's work on overcoming taboos, whether by meditating over corpses or even, occasionally, eating human flesh. Regardless of what they wear - or the bones they carry - Mara Shivaratri is one day when Hindus of all types come together in the hopes that Lord Shiva keeps death and destruction at bay for at least another year. Respectful: This Sadhu (holy man) has chosen to wear a tunic and scarf in saffron yellow - the colour loved most by Lord Shiva . With . a history that stretches back almost 3000 years and links with Islam . and Buddhism as well as Sikhism, India's Varanasi is one of the holiest . cities in the world. Now . a modern metropolis with an estimated 1.2 million inhabitants, the . Uttar Pradesh city remains an important centre for pilgrims and is the . Eastern equivalent of Jerusalem, Mecca and Rome. Unlike . the other three however, Varanasi, thought by Hindus to have been . founded by the deity Shiva, is home to a set of hermits known as Sadhu . who live and pray on the ghats (steps) that line the banks of the . Ganges. They share . their space with pilgrims who flock to the city to cleanse themselves of . sin in the river's waters or even, in the case of the old or terminally . ill, to await their deaths. Like . the other six holy Hindu cities, expiring while in Varanasi is . considered an auspicious because it offers moksha - a lasting release . from the cycle of birth and death. Others . visit to see the stunning architectural legacy left by the Mughal . dynasty, who spent centuries beautifying the city in honour of its . founder, Shiva, and the imposing Ramnagar Fort; a British-built edifice . that overlooks the city from the other side of the Ganges. Singing: Celebrating Shivaratri also involves the chanting of mantras, most of which is done by Sadhu holy men like this pair . Drugs: Many Sadhu, such as this one photographed in the courtyard of Nepal's Pashupatinath Temple, use cannabis to help them get into the right frame of mind . Celebration: A pair of Sadhu holy men dressed in Lord Shiva's favourite saffron yellow celebrate in the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepalese capital, Katmandu . Beautiful: The colourful festival takes place in February or early March and along with processions, involves a day-long fast and a night-long vigil in honour of the god . Wisdom: The Sadhus or holy men are on hand throughout the celebrations to offer guidance to the crowd and will pray alongside them . Honour: Along with painting their faces with representations of sacred images or symbols, many Sadhu dye their beards with saffron in honour of the gods .","Maha Shivaratri is one of 12 Hindu festivals dedicated to the god, Lord Shiva .

When pictures of her weight loss made headlines last week, the Duchess of York put it down to regular mountain-running sessions with her personal trainer. But sources close to Prince Andrew’s ex-wife say there is another, rather more unusual, reason for her slimline figure – jam roly-poly flavoured tea. The diet drink was created for her after Sarah decided to embark on a health and fitness regime. Contrast: Sarah Ferguson (pictured, left, last week and, right, in 2010) has hit the headlines after losing weight . Unusual: The Duchess of York put her weight loss down to regular mountain-running sessions with her personal trainer. But sources say there is another reason for her slimline figure - jam roly-poly flavoured tea . She went to a bootcamp in the Swiss Alps and over 12 weeks lost more than two stone through daily mountain runs and hikes with her trainer, Josh Saltzmann, and eating a calorie-controlled diet. But, said a friend, 54-year-old Sarah still struggled with her sweet tooth. In desperation, she went to a master tea maker and asked them to create a range of flavoured hot diet drinks she could have instead of reaching for the biscuit tin. Together they came up with a range of 17 teas in three categories. The first is based on English puddings and includes jam roly-poly, rhubarb fool, strawberries and cream, bakewell tart, chocolate torte, and mint humbug. Hair scraped back: The Duchess of York looked tired and drawn as she left a restaurant in Manhattan last week . The second is a variety of ‘mocktail’ teas including pink champagne, gin and tonic, whisky and ginger, and pina colada. The third is a take on classics including English Breakfast and Earl Grey. The teas helped her lose another stone – making three stone in all – and Sarah is said to be delighted, even though critics have described her as looking tired and drawn. Now the once cash-strapped duchess is looking at bringing out her own personal range of pudding-flavoured diet teas. Different tactics: Sarah lost more than two stone  over 12 weeks during a bootcamp in the Swiss alps with her trainer, Josh Saltzmann (left). But, said a friend, the 54-year-old still struggled with her sweet tooth. So the Duchess went to a tea maker who created a range of diet drinks, including one tasting of mint humbugs (right) george . The friend said: ‘At the moment the teas are just for her but she has had so much interest in them that she is considering whether to market them. 'There are a number of commercial opportunities she is exploring but nothing has been signed yet.’ Sarah’s weight has yo-yoed over the years and the friend added: ‘Like most women she just wants to feel better about herself. ‘But she is also very keen to work on the global plan to combat obesity and wanted to put her money where her mouth was, so to speak.’","Sarah Ferguson put weight loss down to bootcamp sessions in Swiss Alps .

The most commonly killed species was the laughing gull, with 5,729 killed at JFK Airport, according to a report from The New York Post. Others included 3,023 European starlings, 2,445 herring gulls, 1,908 mourning doves and 1,070 brown-headed cowbirds, the paper says. 5,729 laughing gulls, like the ones seen here, were killed at JFK airport . A whopping 1,098 mourning doves, like the ones seen here, were also killed by the Port Authority . The agency, which oversees transportation between New York and New Jersey, also killed three endangered or threatened bird species, according to the paper. Both endangered and threatened species were also killed. The agency killed a northern harrier with a shotgun at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, despite its endangered status.  An American kestrel was also shot at Teterboro. The species is listed as 'threatened' in New Jersey, the Post reports. At JFK, 11 ospreys were killed. The osprey is labeled at-risk in New York. 11 ospreys were also killed at JFK -- despite the fact that the species is labeled 'at-risk' in New York . 62 woodchucks, like the one seen here, were also killed by the agency according to the report . Ron Marsico, Port Authority spokesman told the paper that the agency was able to shoot the osprey because 'nonlethal control efforts were not effective' and that both state and federal authorities had been contacted. The Port Authority also killed a parakeet, upsetting Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals. 'The idea that parakeets would bring down an aircraft is ridiculous,' she said. 'This gives you an idea of how trigger-happy they [the PA] are.' Even 4 red foxes, like the one seen here, were killed by the agency . Birds weren't the agency's only victims. According to the report, 82 Eastern cottontail rabbits, 44 black-tailed jackrabbits, 21 raccoons, 4 red foxes and 11 coyotes were also killed. Despite the news, there may be hope for one species. Though 5 snowy owls were killed according to the data, the Port Authority promised earlier this year to implement a program in which it would trap and relocate them, Gothamist reports.","Most commonly killed species was the laughing gull, with 5,729 killed at JFK Airport .

A damning report has revealed how staff at a Scottish nursery left distraught children to cry uncontrollably because they thought the youngsters were 'too spoilt'. Inspectors from a care watchdog saw children at All Stars Nursery in Aberdeen sob without any intervention from staff. In one visit, officials from the Care Inspectorate even 'observed one child cry themself to sleep at lunch'. Damning report: Inspectors from a care watchdog saw children at All Stars Nursery in Aberdeen sob without any intervention from staff . When asked why the children were left alone, staff claimed that some were 'bosied' and 'spoilt' and would 'eventually stop crying'. The report was published after the latest inspection which followed five years of unsuccessful attempts to shut the pre-school amid fears children were at risk. It stated: 'We saw occasions where staff did not respond in a sensitive and caring way towards the children. 'We observed a number of children who appeared unsettled and who cried for lengthy periods of time on both days of the Inspection.' The publication also revealed that staff undermined the children's safety by leaving the nursery untidy. A Supreme Court ruling last year ordered the nursery could stay open despite the Care Inspectorate upholding complaints of youngsters being force-fed and being given out-of-date food. Criticism: When asked why the children were left alone, staff claimed that some were 'bosied' and 'spoilt' and would 'eventually stop crying' Owners Sheila Davis and Maureen Mowat mounted appeals at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, the Court of Session and the Supreme Court after the commission was replaced by a new body during proceedings. The pair argued that the body could not continue the case of its predecessor and the sitting judges agreed. But since then a surprise inspection revealed concerns including a baby sleeping next to a plastic bag and youngsters having easy access to packed nappy bins. Another unscheduled inspection noted few qualified staff on hand and raised concerns about attitudes towards the children. The care authority did acknowledge attempts to improve conditions since the last inspection but added: 'there remains significant areas of concern'. Following this latest visit, the inspectorate graded the nursery as 'weak' - the second worst standard - and said it must continue to improve 'in all areas' and children need to receive 'consistent' and 'sensitive' care. Owner Sheila Davis declined to comment.

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 08:40 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:42 EST, 3 March 2014 . A 31-stone conman and his teenage son who conned a dying pensioner out of £17,500 for odd jobs and gardening that should have cost no more than £1,700 have been told to repay just £2.82 by a judge. Obese Edward Dolan, 48, and his son Michael, 19, from Stokesley, North Yorkshire, made thousands of pounds by tricking vulnerable pensioners into handing over vast amounts in exchange for work worth a fraction of what they charged. Together with accomplice William McElvaney, also 19, of Whitby, they were jailed last August after the Dolans admitted money laundering and all three admitted conspiracy to defraud. Michael Dolan, 19, left, and his father Edward, 48, must pay back just £2.82 after conning OAPs out of £32,853 . But last week the Dolans were ordered to pay the State just a fraction of the money they had swindled at a Proceeds of Crime hearing at Teesside Crown Court after it emerged that the men had little money left to pay. Despite lawyers agreeing that the older Dolan made £10,629 from crime, Judge Peter Armstrong ordered that he should pay just a nominal £1, while his son, who made £32,853, was told to pay just £1.82. The court heard that despite the many thousands the Dolans had made from crime, they had no money left to pay for their crimes. Meanwhile McElvaney, who the court heard had more than £4,000 available to him, was ordered to pay £93.76 back to the elderly woman he tricked, after it was decided that was how much he made from the crime. A court heard last summer how the threesome took cash and cheques for work which was either poor or not carried out. The Dolans picked on an 84-year-old man with terminal cancer in the nearby village of Marske, repeatedly targeting his home between June 2009 and September 2011. William McElvaney, 19, from Whitby, had more than £4,000 available to him but was only told to pay £93.76 back to his elderly victim because that was all he was judged to have made from his crime . They were caught out the day after the elderly man died in October 2011, when the older Dolan went to the man's home to see if he wanted more work done. He was met by the man’s grieving son, who became suspicious and called police. An expert estimated the work, for which the man had been charged £17,450 over two years, to be worth about £1,700. Another victim, targeted by the younger Dolan and his friend, McElvaney, was a 90-year-old woman with dementia in the village of Hutton Rudby, four miles from the Dolans' home. In June 2012 she told her son she had no money because she had paid it all to gardeners.  Her purse was emptied of pension money, and it emerged that she had paid them about £180 in three weeks for non-existent work. In the subsequent court case, Michael Dolan, who was just 15 at the start of the conspiracy and had no previous convictions, claimed to be the operator of the business. He was sentenced to two years in a young offenders’ institution last August and is still in custody. His father was jailed for 15 months, while McElvaney received nine months in a youth offenders’ institution. Judge Armstrong said as he passed sentence: 'The public need to know that those who involve themselves in offences like this will go to prison.'","Edward Dolan, 48, and his son Michael, 19, targeted vulnerable pensioners .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 3 March 2014 . Hundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews brought Jerusalem to a stand-still by taking to the streets in protest against a new bill that will force them into mandatory army conscription. More than 300,000 demonstrators held a mass prayer in the city centre as just 3,500 police were drafted in to control the outcry. It comes as Israel grapples with a cultural war over the place of the ultra-Orthodox in Israeli society, with the issue of army service is at the core of that struggle. Scroll down for video . Stand-still: Men, women and children blocked cars as they swarmed the streets of Jerusalem today for a mass prayer opposing compulsory military service . More than 300,000 took to the streets after the new centre-right government proposed to strip ultra-Orthodox Jews of their exemption from service . Beginning this year, the bill would require all ultra-Orthodox Jews aged 17 and a half to register at army recruitment offices . Since Israel's founding in 1948, the ultra-Orthodox, who make up eight per cent of Israel's 8 million citizens, have been allowed to avoid military service, compulsory for most Jewish men, to pursue their religious studies. The ultra-Orthodox insist their young men serve the nation through prayer and study to preserve Jewish learning, heritage, and a pious way of life. But the exemption has enraged secular Israelis who say the ultra-Orthodox are not doing their fair share. The issue featured prominently in last year's election, and voters elected a centre-right government that proposed ultra-Orthodox Jews should serve in the army. Parliament is expected to vote on the conscription bill this month. 'The change is beginning,' Ofer Shelah, whose Yesh Atid party supports the bill, told Israeli Channel 10 TV. 'This (law) will create a deep cultural change in the ultra-Orthodox public.' Shelah and his party believe integrating the ultra-Orthodox into the military will lead to their inclusion in the workforce and help sustain Israel's economic growth. Since 1948, when Israel was founded, seminary students have been permitted to dedicate themselves to their studies to keep the traditions alive . People sat on roofs and balconies as the crowds below, controlled by just 3,500 police, took over every stretch of road in the city during the open mass . Men clad in black clothing danced around the streets. Their outcry comes at the point of a culture clash in Israel, with army conscription a central issue . Israel's central bank chief warns that high unemployment in the ultra-Orthodox and Arab sectors threaten Israel's economic prospects. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox streamed toward the entrance of Jerusalem as a heavy haze settled on the gathering. Men clad in traditional black suits and hats bowed and swayed in prayer as others danced in circles. Spectators packed the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings as a loudspeaker blared prayers. Many held signs reading 'the Torah shall not be forgotten.' The city began grinding to a halt hours before the rally began. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 3,500 police officers deployed for the rally. He said authorities closed the central bus station and halted nearly all public buses into the city. In addition, public transportation inside the city was being limited from afternoon until night. Some schools and government ministries also closed early. Public transport had to be limited from midday until night, with some schools and government ministries also closed as the crowds refused to move . The ultra-Orthodox community makes up eight per cent of Jerusalem's eight million inhabitants. Secular Jews have protested for years against the 'unfair' rules . Usually only men attend such public demonstrations, but ultra-Orthodox community leaders encouraged women and young children to take part. A major thoroughfare in Jerusalem was closed for traffic and reserved for ultra-Orthodox women in accordance with the community's strict separation of the sexes. Many women, wearing long skirts and head coverings, held prayer books close to their faces as they prayed, while young children ran between them. 'They came out of fear of one thing: that they are going to be changed, that they will be put in a melting pot and changed,' ultra-Orthodox lawmaker Israel Eichler told Israeli Channel 2 TV. According to the draft bill up for a vote in Israel's parliament, only a fraction of eligible ultra-Orthodox Jews would be expected to serve, said Inna Dolzhansky, spokeswoman for lawmaker Shelah, who is also a member of the committee drafting the bill. Prayer sheets were handed out to the masses who sang and shouted their rights to sustain the tradition that has survived years of persecution . The bill is a bid to integrate ultra-Orthodox Jews into Israeli society and workforces as the government grapples to find ways to boost the economy . Orthodox experts claim it is the latest in a number of moves that give the sense of growing hostility from the secular movement . The army would be required to draft an increasing number of ultra-Orthodox Jews each year, with the goal of enlisting 5,200 ultra-Orthodox soldiers - roughly 60 percent of those of draft age - by mid-2017. Israel would grant financial incentives to religious seminaries that send their students to the army, she said. If the ultra-Orthodox community does not meet that quota by then, the bill calls for mandatory service for ultra-Orthodox Jews and criminal sanctions for draft-dodgers. Beginning this year, the bill would require all ultra-Orthodox Jews aged 17 and a half to register at army recruitment offices, although not all ultra-Orthodox would be obliged to serve, said Nisan Zeevi, spokesman for lawmaker Yaakov Peri, who has helped draft the bill. He said the law would permit 1,800 ultra-Orthodox Jews to forgo army service for religious studies. Orthodox Judaism expert Menachem Friedman said the law doesn't go far enough to properly integrate the ultra-Orthodox into Israeli society. But he said Orthodox leaders are sensing growing hostility from the secular majority, which has had to foot the bill for the community's welfare. 'Israeli society is saying enough is enough,' said Friedman. 'Everyone understands there is a very big problem and it cannot go on this way.'","300,000 took part in prayer against draft bill to abolish ultra-Orthodox exemption from compulsory military service .

A three-year-old heart patient died following a major delay in getting a key hospital appointment because of a glitch with a new NHS computer booking system, an inquest has heard. Samuel Starr was born with a congenital cardiac defect, but underwent surgery not long after his birth and made a good recovery. Medics treating the little boy said he would still need regular tests to check on his progress but Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court heard that Samuel did not have a crucial scan for 20 months after his first major operation. Samuel Starr, three, died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check-up for 20 months. He was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old . It also heard that the delay came after a new computer booking system called Cerner Millennium was rolled out. Once . an appointment had been made and a detailed check-up was carried out, . doctors found Samuel needed open heart surgery. During that procedure he . suffered a stroke. Further . complications then followed and and he died in the arms of his parents . Catherine Holley and Paul Starr at Bristol’s Children’s Hospital a few . weeks later. A tearful Ms . Holley told the inquest she expected her son to get a check-up in early . 2011 - but said she was left feeling 'dejected' and 'alarmed' when the . appointment did not go ahead until the summer of 2012. She told the inquest of the moment she kissed her son goodbye. She said: 'He was a kind and gentle boy with a great understanding of the world. 'As we read Samuel his favourite stories, he died in our arms.' Samuel was born with a restricted pulmonary artery - causing blood to easily flow away from his heart to his lungs. Samuel had an operation at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and he was recovering well initially. However, his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check-up . Ms . Holley said the condition was picked up during her 20 week scan. He was . born 39 weeks into her pregnancy, on June 15, 2009 weighing 8Ibs. But despite his heart problem Ms Holley said her child continued to flourish, and had required little medical intervention. His parents were also told to expect for their son to undergo around three operations by the time he was aged five. On March 3, 2010, Samuel had his first surgical procedure - open heart surgery at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. He . was discharged six days later, and referred to the Paediatric Cardiac . Clinic at the Royal United Hospital (RUH) in Bath for check-ups. The . inquest heard the first of these took place in Bristol in October 2010, . and an echocardiogram, also known as an 'echo', was carried out. Ms Holley said she was told the procedure would next be carried out early into the new year. She added: 'We left the hospital comfortable knowing this information.' However, . at the next appointment, which took place in Bath the following April, . Ms Holley said she was 'surprised that no echo' was undertaken. The . doctor told Samuel’s parents he hadn’t expected to see the youngster . and swiftly moved them on without performing an echo scan. But despite expecting to return six months later as instructed, they were not given an appointment until 14 months later. He underwent surgery at Bristol Children’s Hospital on August 7, 2012. Distraught . Ms Holley said she begged a district nurse to help but she still . struggled to get vital appointments at the Royal United Hospital in . Bath. Reading . a statement, she said: 'We were expecting an appointment in the New . Year (2011) - something we took to mean January - but we still hadn’t . received one by March. 'We . got Claire, our community nurse, to call the hospital. She called them . on the 12th March, 20th March, 8th May, 28th May and the 29th May. 'We were then given an appointment for 14th June but we already had commitments then so it was rescheduled for 21st June. Samuel was due to have his check ups at Royal United Hospital, Bath, but they became sporadic. A report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame . By the time Samuel's failing health was diagnosed he was very weak and he had to have more heart surgery. He died a month later following complications. An inquest into his death is due to open at Flax Burton Coroner's Court (pictured) on Monday . 'When we got there Dr Tometzki said that he had expected to see us a lot earlier than this. 'After doing an echo scan he told us he didn’t want to shock us but he wanted Samuel to have heart surgery that spring. 'We were shocked, we hadn’t been expecting this. It wasn’t meant to happen.' Samuel had a cardiac catheter inserted in July, before undergoing surgery in August. 'Just . hours before his operation Samuel was dancing around the ward and . telling the nurses all about Spiderman - we had to remind him to quieten . down,' Ms Holley said. 'Many . of the nurses on the ward could not believe how energetic he was . considering the surgery he was about to have - he was a happy and . healthy boy. 'After the operation, on August 9, as they began bringing Samuel out of sedation his left arm started flailing. 'We were (later) told Samuel had had a stroke and several cardiac arrests.' His . condition continued to deteriorate and on September 6, his parents were . recommended for treatment to be withdrawn following the onset of a . second cardiac arrest. Experienced medic Dr Tometzki broke down in tears as he recalled that moment during his evidence.'It is not ideal to take a child off (life support).....but it was the right decision'. Dr . Tometzki said the decision to operate had been prompted after the . discovery that Samuel's heart valves had thickened and become blocked.

Steven Hunter has been handed a restraining order banning him from all contact with Yvonne Donlan after pleading guilty to a stalking charge . A grandmother-of-nine has spoken of her stalking hell after her toyboy ex bombarded her with letters, voicemail messages and gifts after she ended their relationship. Steven Hunter, 45, even crept into Yvonne Donlan's garden to spy on her after ignoring a police warning to stay away from the 62-year-old. Hunter, of Salford, has now been handed a restraining order banning him from all contact after pleading guilty at Manchester Magistrates Court to a stalking charge. Ms Donlan, a mother-of-three who works for Salford Council, said: 'It was one of my children who eventually said to me that I should phone the police. 'She said that she thought he would kill me. 'I want to say to other women please do not think it is your fault. Go to the police.' She met Hunter in a pub in Prestwich in March 2012. She described him as ‘Mr Charming himself’, but said he later became ‘possessive and jealous’. She said: 'We went out one night with his friends and he thought that I fancied all of them and other people in the restaurant. It was horrible. It was more than jealously, it was weird.' Ms Donlan ended the relationship in January 2013 but then the harassment began. She said: 'The texts and answer phone messages started almost at once. He sent me shoes, gloves, champagne and DVDs, mostly love DVDs. 'There were 33 voicemail messages in a month. When the police listened to them, they were shocked. He would say some wild things and he would often say I shouldn’t be scared. 'There was one night when I was in the kitchen talking with a friend about a Rod Stewart CD. The next day the CD had been posted through the letterbox. He would run past my house and my neighbours would see him standing at the end of the street. 'There were around 40 letters. Some were about eight A4 pages long.' Hunter's actions were described as 'obsessional' by District Judge Paul Richardson at Manchester Magistrates Court (file picture) Peter Casson, defending, said Hunter was ‘very much in love’ with Yvonne. He said: 'There was no violence, there was no threat of violence. He has moved on with his life and he accepts the relationship is over.'

Bruce Forsyth, 86, will have a 'conversation' about his future at Strictly, which he presents with Tess Daly . Asked if the BBC's most popular programme could cope without him, Moore added: 'Strictly is a phenomenon of British television and very robust.  But it isn't about one presenter.' Before Christmas, the popular presenter admitted he was living 'on borrowed time' and said he struggled with the relentless schedules of filming Strictly.

Families have seen their energy bills soar by 55 per cent in a decade, despite them cutting the amount of gas and electricity they use by almost a fifth. Rising prices from the Big Six suppliers have seen inflation-busting rises every year since 2002, squeezing incomes particularly since the 2007 crash. Ministers have repeatedly urged households to reduce their consumption to cut bills, but the Office for National Statistics said the increase in spending is ‘explained solely by rises in energy prices’. How average monthly spend on energy rose by 55 per cent in a decade, but usage has fallen by 17 per cent . In 2012 families spent £106 each month on energy, up 55 per cent from £69 in 2002. At the same time energy usage has dropped by 17 per cent, the ONS said. An ONS report on Household Energy Spending said: ‘UK households spent an average of £106 a month on household energy in 2012. This was a 55 per cent rise on the 2002 monthly spend, after accounting for inflation. This is despite a decline in average energy usage. ‘Over this same time period, household energy use has fallen. The average amount of energy used per household was 17 per cent lower in 2012 than in 2002.

But all three nations are substantially lower than Northern Ireland, where the average household spend is £154 a month. ONS said: ‘The higher average spend in Northern Ireland may be partly explained by the different nature and size of the energy market there. ‘Across the rest of the UK, any differences in the average energy spend are very small. The average monthly spend in Scotland is slightly higher than in England and Wales, consistent with DECC figures on energy consumption per household.’ Spending on electricity is up 43 per cent in a decade and 56 per cent for gas .

Bullying was a factor in the death of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement who committed suicide in an Army barracks, an inquest recorded today . Bullying was a factor in the death of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement who committed suicide in an Army barracks, an inquest recorded today. Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg ruled that the 'lingering' mental effects of an alleged rape, 'work-related despair' and a romantic break-up all contributed to her decision to take her own life. Mr Rheinberg has now called on the MOD to review its care for vulnerable soldiers . Nicholas . Rheinberg concluded that Corporal Ellement hanged herself at . Bulford Barracks in Wiltshire, two years after she alleged that two . soldiers raped her while she was stationed in Germany. But . Mr Rheinberg said at the inquest in Salisbury that, although the care . given to Cpl Ellement in the aftermath of the allegation had been of . 'high quality', the transfer of information when she returned to the UK . had been 'unforgivably bad'. He . said he would be recommending to the MoD that it review its Suicide . Vulnerability Risk Assessment procedures and ensure that medical . personnel are regularly given refresher training. In a statement read outside court, Cpl Ellement's family said they welcomed the coroner's conclusions and recommendations. Her sister, Sharon Hardy, said: 'The family are delighted with this verdict we have today. 'The coroner has confirmed what we have always known - that Anne-Marie was treated appallingly and let down by the Army. 'She was never able to recover from the allegation of rape she made in Germany. 'She then suffered bullying by the Army and was subjected to unacceptable work practices. 'Victims . of sexual abuse in the Army need proper support, which the coroner has . recognised, and we are delighted with his recommendations.' The Salisbury inquest was dramatically adjourned last week as . new evidence emerged on what was to be the final day of the hearing. It was . revealed that three mobile phones and a pink 2010-11 diary belonging to . Corporal Ellement had mysteriously vanished from her barracks . after she died. The . previously unmentioned items were listed on an inventory made by a . fellow soldier. It was among 1,400 files newly discovered by the MoD legal team. She had scrawled 'I'm sorry' in lipstick on the mirror of her room, the inquest heard . The 30-year-old from Bournemouth was found in 2011 hanging from a fire escape at her camp in Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire. She had written 'I'm sorry' in lipstick on her mirror. The inquest - which lasted three weeks -  heard that Cpl Ellement alleged she had been raped . by two soldiers in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany. It heard that she . had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision taken by military . investigators not to prosecute them. Mr Rheinberg said: 'It is not the . function of this inquest to make a determination whether Anne-Marie was . raped, that may be for another court to determine, nevertheless I find . as fact that Anne-Marie believed she was raped and was deeply affected . by what for her was a deeply humiliating experience.' He . ruled that although the MoD had a policy in place for caring for . victims of alleged sexual assaults within the Army, a review was needed . to ensure that all steps were taken to support the victims, particularly . in cases where the allegation was made against a colleague. He . explained that although Cpl Ellement was placed on the Army's sexual . vulnerability risk assessment register, this information was not . transferred to her medical professionals when she was brought to the UK. He said: 'I find the welfare provided in Germany was good but the transfer of information unforgivably bad.' He added: 'I have concerns in relation . to the support and welfare support given to a soldier following an . allegation of sexual assault. 'There . is an existing code of practice on services to be provided by the armed . forces to victims of crime and sexual assault, I ask that that code of . practice be reviewed.' However, . Mr Rheinberg said that he felt this issue was not a significant factor . in Cpl Ellement's death because she had shown an improved state of mind . upon her arrival at Bulford. He . ruled that there were two periods when he believed that Cpl Ellement . had been subjected to bullying - one by the girlfriend of one of her . alleged rapists. Mr Rheinberg said she had directed her anger at the incident at Cpl Ellement. He . said: 'I find as a fact that deliberate action was taken to make . Anne-Marie's final days in Germany uncomfortable and the actions and . that deliberate action was harassment.' Cpl Ellement was being bullied and was 'scared to leave her room', her mother, Alexandra Barritt, right, said . He said it was 'unduly optimistic' of her superiors to keep Cpl Ellement and those who accused her of lying about the rape within the same accommodation block without trouble occurring. The other incident of bullying that Mr Rheinberg identified was in 2011 at Bulford when Cpl Ellement's superior officer. Staff Sergeant Julian Clark had made a posting on Facebook deriding the quality of work that he was inspecting. He said that Cpl Ellement believed this criticism identified her shortcomings to her colleagues and was something that troubled her 'again and again'. He said: 'I find it was inappropriate for a senior NCO (non-commissioned officer) to make a posting about a junior NCO on a social media website and further inappropriate to have friends who were junior NCOs able to read the posting. 'Although not imbued with evil intent, it resulted in bullying.' Hopes: Even as a child, Anne-Marie Ellement had dreamt of joining the Army, an ambition she fulfilled in 2006 . Mr Rheinberg said that the other factors involved in Cpl Ellement's suicide was her perception that she was over-worked. He said that although she reported that she had been working up to 90 hours in a nine-day period in the weeks prior to her death, she was liable to 'exaggeration'. He explained although he did not feel the MoD had over-worked her, Cpl Ellement was feeling stressed about her job and was suffering from 'work-related despair'. Another significant factor was a recent relationship breakdown. The inquest heard that she has sent messages speaking of her sense of betrayal to her former boyfriend on the day that she committed suicide. Mr Rheinberg also explained how Cpl Ellement had suffered sexual abuse and bullying as a child and had previously been raped at the age of 18. He said that she continued to complain of bullying both in civilian life and when she joined the Army, which had been a lifelong ambition. He said that she suffered 'poor body image and low self-esteem' and their was a 'correlation between her physical and mental health'. Mr Rheinberg explained that she was diagnosed as suffering from depression in 2009 and was prescribed anti-depressants. A previous inquest in March 2012 recorded a conclusion that Cpl Ellement, originally from Bournemouth in Dorset, took her own life. But last August, the High Court ordered a fresh hearing, which began in Salisbury on February 3.During the inquest, Cpl Ellement's family claimed she had felt bullied by colleagues and without support in the Army. Her sister, Sharon Hardy, 44, a married mother-of-four from Christchurch, Dorset, told the inquest: 'When she died, my immediate thoughts were the Army, the rape, the bullying and the overwork.' Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, originally from Bournemouth in Dorset, who was found hanged at Bulford Barracks after saying she had been raped, with her sisters, Khristina Swain (left) and Sharon Hardy. Ms Hardy said: 'The family are delighted with this verdict we have today' The hearing was adjourned last week after the court heard an inventory listing items including three mobile phones and a pink diary found in Cpl Ellement's room had been discovered by the MoD. But in a statement given to the court, Cpl Ellement's father confirmed that he had received the items including the diary and five mobile phones. He said that he had passed on the diary to Cpl Ellement's mother Alexandra Barritt and he had disposed of most of the mobile phones because of their age but had held on to her iPhone. Following the inquest, Brigadier John Donnelly, director of personnel services for the MoD, said: 'The Army deeply regrets the tragic death of Cpl Anne-Marie Ellement and although there were aspects of her care that were praised, I want to apologise to her family for the failures that the coroner has identified. 'This second inquest has been an extremely thorough investigation by Her Majesty's coroner and Anne-Marie's family has shown great dignity throughout. We now have a clear understanding of the complex circumstances surrounding her death and where the Army needs to learn lessons. 'Our priority is to study the coroner's conclusions and then identify what further steps can be taken, to help prevent a recurrence of this kind of tragedy in the future. At present, however, our thoughts and sympathy lie with Anne-Marie's family and her friends at this difficult time.' Emma Norton, legal officer for human rights charity Liberty and the lawyer representing Cpl Ellement's sisters, said: 'Soldier or civilian, your human rights require protection. 'Yet the Army failed this vulnerable, traumatised woman at every stage: an incompetent rape investigation coupled with a chain of command that repeatedly overlooked serious bullying and ignored her suffering. 'As long as the military investigates itself, this risks happening again. The coroner recognised the terrible failings in Anne-Marie's case. Now we need real reform.'

Speaking live on Radio 4's Today programme at 7am, Colin Paterson abandoned his measured commentary of the event to start screaming Bono's name. SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO . Ecstatic: The Radio 5 Live regular could not help screaming Bono's name as he walked past on the red carpet. The Irish singer attended the Oscars with his wife Alison Hewson (right) and the rest of U2, who performed . Mr Paterson, who was speaking live at 7am, shouted 'Bono!' numerous times as host Jim Naughtie tried to talk over . In a scene that many have likened to Alan Partridge famously shouting 'Dan! Dan!

Despite host Jim Naughtie's attempts to move past the hiccup, Mr Paterson ploughed on, until accepting Bono was not going to answer his cries. He even tried to entice the rock star by telling him 'You're live on Radio 4! Come over here and speak to John Humphrys!' - prompting the voice of Jim: 'You're not speaking to John.'

Finally recovering from the incident much later, he encountered the Alan Partridge star, who had some words of advice. He said: 'If you are in this profession that's a hazard you have to deal with. 'Live broadcasting means everyone is subject to Partridgeisms, and these traps everyone can fall into. So you have to watch your step.' Reminiscent: The scene echoed Alan Partridge, played by Steve Coogan, famously shouting 'Dan! Dan! Dan!'

Checking himself, Radio 5 Live regular Mr Paterson joked: 'This was not the finest moment of my career.' The scene followed U2's performance during the awards ceremony. According to A Single Man star Nicholas Hoult, the performance was electrifying. He tweeted: 'Did anyone see Bono serenade me?!?!'

Emmanuel Jack, 27, who police believe was behind dating profiles used to con women out of cash, has been jailed for laundering £186,000 of their money through his bank accounts . A student has been jailed for three years after six lonely women were scammed out of £186,000 through dating websites. Police believe Emmanuel Jack, 27, created dating profiles before asking women to hand over cash. That money then passed through bank accounts belonging to Jack. Jack, who was studying at the University of Salford, admitted 11 counts of money laundering totalling £186,000 and possession of articles for use in fraud and was jailed for three years at Manchester Crown Court today. Detective Constable Stuart Donohue, from Greater Manchester Police said: 'While we strongly suspect - but cannot prove - that Jack was the person who was communicating with these women, what we can prove is that money has been transferred through his bank accounts. 'Women from across the globe were targeted and exploited. Women, who in most cases were vulnerable and lonely. 'Some took out loans and others have lost life savings. 'From speaking with these women it is apparent that they believed they were speaking with a man who had genuine feelings for them, a man who loved them and wanted to be with them and who they genuinely believed to be a soul mate.' The first victim met a man who claimed to be John Creed - a self-employed architect and building contractor on a dating website in August 2011 when she was aged 61. The pair exchanged emails over several days before Creed said that he loved her. He then claimed to have a contract for building log homes in Shropshire and another to renovate six flats in Sweden and sent her paperwork which showed they were allegedly worth £950,000. He told her that his feelings were 'too strong to ignore' before asking for £1,500 to help pay for supplies for his project. Jack was today sentenced to three years behind bars after admitting 11 charges of money laundering . After the victim repeatedly questioned the request, a man phoned her and accused her of not trusting him. Feeling guilty, she agreed to transfer some funds to the account given - which was then sent to Jack’s account. Also in August 2011 another woman, aged 52 at the time, began chatting with a man over the same website. The man claimed to be living in Spain and working as an architect and building contractor. After a couple of weeks he again asked for £1,500 to repair damaged machinery and said that he would reimburse the woman as soon as he returned to the UK. He then asked for cash to pay tax bills before asking for more money to pay his workers. The woman took out a loan before paying the money, which was again transferred to Jack's accounts. An investigation was launched after the two women reported their suspicions to the police, and Jack was arrested in April 2012. Officers then investigated his bank accounts and discovered payments of £7,800.00 on March 6 2012 and £31,750 on March 15 2012 from a woman in Burkesville, Kentucky. Before her death in 2013, the woman had given a statement to Kentucky police in which she said  she met a man with the profile name John Windsor through another dating site around January 2012. Jack was a student at Salford University (file picture) studying business at the time of the offences . Windsor said he was an engineer who had been awarded a contract to redevelop Wick Airport runway in Scotland. The funds were sent to bank accounts by money transfers and in the form of Rolex watches through the post. Another victim, from Ohio, said she met a man who called himself John or Johnnie Carlo Rissi who was from America but had moved to England to set up as a gem broker. Whist apparently on business in Spain he requested money pay taxes and wages, along with various other excuses. Nine transfers totalling $31,640 (£18,924) were sent. Rissi took another $6,650 (£4,117), which was transferred straight into Jack's accounts. In total two UK and six foreign victims were identified. A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is scheduled to take place on May 16, for the authorities to try to recover the money.","Six women, two of whom were British, were targetted on dating websites .

Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council said most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area . Thousands of families face inflation-busting rises to parking, pest control and waste charges this year, a survey has found. Councils are planning to introduce fees in new areas, such as rat control - with one even charging parents whose children use care home facilities. Some authorities are putting up parking charges by 10 or 20 per cent, while others are setting up CCTV in bus lanes for the first time - to make it easier to fine motorists who use them. Others are charging households to move bulky or garden waste, while another has increased the cost of holding a funeral at its crematorium. Cash-strapped councils blame Coalition budget cuts for the huge rises, and some are making frontline staff such as home helps, cleaners and dustbin men redundant. But, shockingly, an analysis of job vacancies posted by councils shows that many are continuing to recruit advisers in areas such as diversity and carbon reduction - while claiming to be short of funds. Critics say local authorities should be doing more to eliminate waste and reducing exorbitant salaries for chief executives and senior directives. However, council finance experts warn that further increases to charges are inevitable as local authorities face budget cuts of £2billion this year. Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Liberal Democrat councillors in England and Wales, said that most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area. ‘This Government wants us to be entrepreneurs and much more businesslike, so we are starting to charge for services that used to be free,’ he said. ‘This comes after our grants have been cut by 40 per cent over the last three years.’ The survey by the Times newspaper says councils are also likely to shed up to another 100,000 jobs this year, bringing the total number of job losses to more than 500,000 since the beginning of the present Parliament in 2010. Several authorities, including Birmingham, Wakefield, Wolverhampton and Doncaster are planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs across areas including care, cleaning, and waste collection. Portsmouth City Council is planning to charge £43 to tackle rat problems . Most authorities are still finalising their council tax increases, but nearly two thirds of the 350 councils are to freeze their rates from next month, including almost all the London boroughs where elections are being held this year. However, one third of councils have proposed tax increases of less than two per cent, effectively defying a pledge by George Osborne, the Chancellor, to freeze them. About half of these have set a figure of 1.99 per cent, narrowly missing the rise that would force them to hold a referendum of residents on the issue. Brighton and Hove has suggested a 4.75per cent rise - triggering a referendum - but this may be overturned by the full council. Mr Vernon-Jackson, who is leader of Portsmouth council, told the Times that, for the first time, his authority would introduce charges for children in care. Portsmouth City Council is also planning to charge parents whose children are put in care . He said that many children spent only six to eight weeks in care homes when their families were having difficulties, but the cost of keeping them there was more than £2,000 a week. ‘We are asking families who can afford it to pay towards the cost of their children,’ he said. ‘It is only about £50 a week rather than £2,000, but it’s also to show them that they have to take responsibility.’ Portsmouth is also introducing a £43 charge for rat control, which is reduced for pensioners to £23. ‘We are also having to remove pensioner subsidies for allotments and bowling centres and we have put up parking charges in line with inflation,’ he said. Westminster Council in central London has increased the cost of residents’ parking permits by 16 per cent over two years, Dudley in the West Midlands is proposing a 10 per cent increase in parking fees, and the Isle of Wight plans to raise its charges by 20 per cent. Other councils, such as Wolverhampton, are introducing new parking fees. Authorities such as Luton are introducing £25 charges for the removal of bulky rubbish and for garden waste, and Copeland council in Cumbria has proposed increasing cremation fees by £30. Many authorities are closing youth services, Sure Start centres and family services. Andrew Webb, chairman of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, said: ‘Councils are now having to decide between investing in safer roads or safer children.’ Eric Pickles, the Comminities Secretary, has warned councils not to raise parking charges, which, he argues, hit local residents and retailers. Brandon Lewis, the local government minister, said yesterday: ‘We are reining in councils’ over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair fines, have scrapped Labour’s plans for bin charging and are giving extra funding to councils to help freeze council tax.’ The Taxpayers’ Alliance said that councils were still spending lavishly on entertaining and travelling while many were still recruiting staff for oddly-titled jobs. Among recent job advertisements were, for example, a ‘lead supplier relationship manager’, on £42,000, for Bristol Council, to improve supplier performance and be the ‘go-to’ person when market information is needed. A spokesman for the alliance said: ‘For too long town halls have picked people’s pockets with tax hikes. Now that the pressure is on to freeze tax is no excuse to use stealthy ways to raise revenue.’","Portsmouth City Council is planning to charge £43 to tackle rat problems .

High hopes: Mr Jackson (right) said he intended to 'breathe new life into this fantastic and historic location' The Grade II Listed inn was built as a coaching house in 1750 and inspired du Maurier when she found refuge there after getting lost while riding in thick fog. The local rector entertained her with ghost stories and tales of smuggling and he later became the inspiration for her fictional character, the Vicar of Altarnun. Du Maurier's subsequent novel is considered to be a Gothic classic, . telling the tale of a ruthless, bloody gang who lured ships onto the . rocks on the Cornish coastline before murdering the survivors and . robbing them. Historic: Jamaica Inn, situated on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, inspired du Maurier when she found refuge there after getting lost while riding in thick fog. The rector entertained her with ghost stories and smuggling tales . It has been enjoyed by several generations through the many screen adaptations of the tale. The Inn itself has a similarly eerie history. Built in 1750, it was used as a coaching inn by weary travellers using the turnpike between Launceston and Bodmin. Travellers would stay a night at the remote and isolated inn after having made the treacherous journey across the moor.

That's all I am going to say - it is totally unexplainable. 'We also get a lot of visitors who have had funny experiences. The old generator house [which has since been redeveloped] was definitely a very eerie spot and most people didn't want to go in there.' Rumours: The historic building is also reputed to be one of the most haunted places in Britain . However, despite its spooky past, the pub still attracts droves of du Maurier fans each year. Its smugglers' museum, featuring du Maurier's original writing desk, features a 15-strong team that increases to 30 staff in peak season.

They are believed to be operating out of Spain, and are suspected of duping people into buying worthless shares or investing their life savings in to fake companies. Officers from British and Spanish police forces have launched a Europe-wide search for the group who are said to have masterminded so-called boiler room scams, targeting elderly and vulnerable people in the UK, Serbia and Spain. Wanted: Graham Hawrysh (left) and Jeffrey Gordon are suspected of setting up and managing various boiler room scams which dupe members of the public into buying worthless shares . Graham Hawrysh, 37, is one of those suspected of helping to set up and manage a number of these schemes in Spain. He is alleged to have links to a global network of investment fraudsters targeting UK consumers. Another, Jeffrey Gordon, 54, has links to Romania, and possibly Colombia or Ireland, and has reportedly used a number of aliases to run similar scams around the world. Robert Douglas Lynch, 53, is accused of being involved in the set-up of accounts in Spain and the UK in order to facilitate the laundering of funds from investment fraud from the UK to Spain. Hunt: Robert Douglas Lynch (left) and Tunch Kashif have used aliases while operating the Europe-wide scams . Probe: Their names were released after a large-scale anti-fraud operation saw 110 people arrested in cities across Europe, including Barcelona . Raid: A number of luxury addresses, including this property in Marbella, were searched as part of the investigation . The fourth man is Tunch Kashif, 48. He is believed to have been engaged in various investment frauds spanning several years. He is said to have recently been involved in Fine Wine Investment Fraud with a company called Campus Investments which offered fraudulent shares to UK investors. The names of the targeted men were released a week after a worldwide anti-fraud operation saw 110 people arrested during raids in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella and London. Working alongside the National Crime Agency, City of London Police and Spanish National Police searched luxury properties and seized sports cars including Ferraris, all believed to have been bought by profits of the elaborate schemes. These investment scams are run by individuals based overseas and target innocent victims by luring them into investing in bogus companies. British and foreign nationals based in Spain pinpoint the most vulnerable members of the UK public through cold-calling. Confiscated: Officers from City of London Police, who were working with their Spanish counterparts, seized this white Ferrari from an address in Spain .

A mother tried to tickle her daughter's feet for signs of life after a 30ft fir tree toppled on to the caravan she was sleeping in and crushed her to death. Bethany Freeman, 17, went to bed at about 11.30pm at in Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, during the St Jude storms, on October 28. She was living in the caravan in the grounds of her mother’s house while it underwent major building works. But during freak weather the tree fell down at 7am, smashing her caravan to pieces. An inquest, in Tunbridge Wells, heard that Bethany died from brain injuries caused by the huge weight of the tree. Bethany’s . mother Tess Peirce and brother Guthrie Freeman, were staying in the . other static caravan on the property, the inquest was told. The night before she died Bethany had gone with her brother to watch an American football match at Wembley Stadium. Their . mother picked them up from the station and returned home. Bethany went . straight to bed in her caravan while Guthrie and Tess stayed in their . second static home. In the . morning they were woken by a huge crash, and rushed out to find her . caravan was covered by a huge tree, which crushed the sleeping portion . covering her bedroom, the inquest heard. Detective . Sergeant Sara Niblock told an inquest: 'The tree had crushed half of . the caravan completely where Bethany was sleeping. 'They . could see her foot sticking out from beneath the wreckage. Her mother . tickled her foot because she knew she was very ticklish, but Bethany did . not react.' A tractor owned by a nearby farmer was called on and, with its forks fitted, helped lift some of the tree to allow New Zealand-born Bethany to be released on to a stretcher by emergency crews, she added. Pc Andrew Baldry told the inquest in a statement that Bethany’s photographic identity card from her school was found amid the wreckage.

Ms Niblock said that other than a small laceration on the right of her torso, Bethany appeared from the outside to be otherwise 'unmarked'. CPR was attempted but Bethany, an upper sixth form student at Tunbridge Wells Girls’ Grammar School, was declared dead just after 8.30am. A post-mortem examination found she died from 'hypoxic brain injury as a consequence of a crush injury to her chest', said Mr Roger Hatch. Recording a verdict of misadventure, Mr Hatch said: 'It was well known that on October 28 of last year, this country was subject to extremely high winds which adversely affected the tree in a neighbouring garden which was brought down and unfortunately and tragically landed on the caravan occupied by Bethany.' Bethany was among four people killed around that time as the St Jude storm battered England and Wales, leaving a trail of destruction. Winds of up to 100mph swept through parts of Britain, uprooting trees, knocking out power supplies and crippling transport networks. CPR was attempted but Bethany, an upper sixth form student at Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School, was declared dead just after 8.30am . Ms Peirce left court without commenting. She said at the time of her daughter’s death: 'We are all absolutely devastated at the loss of my daughter. I would like to thank the emergency services for their tremendous efforts in attempting to save her.' Bethany was a 'universally respected' pupil at Tunbridge Wells Girls’ Grammar School who 'had everything to look forward to', the school’s website said.

But partially sighted Ashton, 54, found out about the complaint and subsequently enlisted the help of Sean Collier, 21, to beat up Mr Dawson and 'teach him a lesson.' Convicted: Sean Collier, 21, (left) was jailed for life after murdering Christopher Dawson. He was called upon by John Ashton (right) 'to teach him (the victim) a lesson' over a debt of just £100 . Collier, however, went too far with his fists and subjected Mr Dawson, who weighed just seven stone, to a frenzied beating before strangling him at his flat. In the aftermath of the assault, Ashton went to check on Mr Dawson, only to find his room had been ransacked, picture frames had been knocked off the walls and smashed, and other items of furniture had been upturned. He then discovered the battered victim lying on the floor at the side of his bed with blood covering his face. When he realised Mr Dawson was dead, Ashton told neighbours: 'I didn’t want to get him killed I just wanted him to give him a crack - I can’t believe he actually killed him.' Collier himself was arrested after boasting to pals of the 'buzz' he got from killing the vulnerable victim.

Cruel: Kerry Evans, 25, is shown posing with one of his pit bulls, which has had its ears ripped off . An illegal dog fighter who bred pit bull terriers for vicious bloodsports walked free from court - because he’s soon to become a father. Kerry Evans, 25, trained six pit bulls to fight in illegal underground leagues where people pay to watch dogs tear other apart, and bet on the outcomes. RSPCA officers found Evans's dogs covered in brutal scars, while many were missing ears because of the banned sport, which police have described as 'disgusting'. A court today heard the banned breed had been involved in the recent deaths of children in the UK. But even though he was convicted on 16 charges linked to raising the dogs and participating in illegal fights, Evans was only given a suspended prison sentence. Prosecutor Aled Watkins said: 'Evans was involved in organised dog fighting and kept six pit bull terriers to be used in this barbaric crime. 'The aggravating features in this case are the numbers of fighting dogs he kept. 'Quite frighteningly one dog had been bred from and her puppies were offered for sale over the internet. 'The day after Evans’ trial finished we heard the sad news involving the death of a child cause by a banned pit bull. It is a frightening feature of this case.' Evans was arrested after the RSPCA discovered five of the banned fighting dogs in a kennel near his home. RSPCA inspector Simon Evans left a note on the kennel asking for the owner to come forward, and was later phoned by an angry Evans. Another illegal pit bull, named Mason, was later discovered in his home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Evans turned up with a large bag ready to be jailed at Newport Magistrates Court. 'Unhealthy interest': The judge attacked Evans's interest in the illegal sport, but spared him from jail despite a his 16 convictions. The dog pictured above is not a banned breed . Scarred: RSPCA officers reported that Evans's dogs were covered in scars and many had lost their ears in brutal scraps . But Clive Rees, defending, pleaded for his liberty because he is due to become a father on Thursday. He said: 'He is anxious to stay out of jail to be there for the birth of his first and only child. 'His partner is due to give birth on Thursday and they hope to move into a flat together afterwards.' Evans was found guilty by Merthyr Tydfil magistrates last month on six charges of keeping or training pit bull terrier-type dogs, and six of having possession or custody of pit bull terrier-type dogs. He was also convicted of four charges of having equipment for use in connection with an animal fight. Evans was given a six-month suspended jail sentence for a year and banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years. Evans was also fined £1,000 and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work. All six dogs were ordered to be killed by the RSPCA along with dog fighting equipment and graphic books showing dogs tearing each other apart. Bloodsport: The dogs are trained to be fighting machines and steroids are sometimes used in the training process. The above dog was one of the six found by the RSCPA . Banned: As well as being ordered to pay a fine, Evans has been banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years . Police raided Evans’ home to seize first aid kits containing syringes and antibiotics - to secretly treat the dogs after fights. Officers also uncovered 'break sticks' used to prise open dogs' jaws. The court heard Evans boasted in online videos and Facebook messages about the power of his dogs’ jaws. District Judge John Charles told him: 'You have an extremely unhealthy interest in pit bull fighting. 'There is evidence of injury to the dogs and there is a potential of more serious harm as you bred from one of the dogs and offered the puppies for sale. 'You are about to become a father for the first time - let there be no doubt about the situation.'Dog fighting was made illegal in the UK in 1835 but the court heard there had been a resurgence in the 1980s with the influx of pit bull terriers. RSPCA chief inspector Michael Butcher told the court how the shadowy world of organised dog fighting was thriving in underground leagues across the country. Finds: Police investigators found books showing graphic images of dogs tearing each other apart as well as first aid supplies for treating the dogs in fights. The dog in the picture above is not a banned breed . Chief Inspector Butcher said: 'It’s quite a small fraternity with almost exclusively pit bull-type dogs used, being bred for the purpose. 'They will meet any dog in a pit face-to-face and go through the pain barrier. 'The dogs will be trained - it is very organised.' He said dog fighting was like boxing and governed by similar rules - with a corner man and first aid kits available during the fights in a pit measuring 12 square feet and 2ft 6ins deep. Chief Inspector Butcher said dogs could become champions or grand champions depending on how many fights they won. He told the court: 'The dog used would be the one you knew would do the business. 'All the injuries tend to be around the head, face, chest and front legs. Dog fighting is about courage not the physical side of things. 'The dog would have to be brought down from kennel weight by exercise, food and diet, and sometimes steroids and supplements would be used to have the dog at an optimum fighting weight. 'We’re receiving more reports about illegal dogs. It’s an obsession with these people - it’s barbaric. 'Two dogs fighting - sometimes to the death - is a disgusting way for people trying to enjoy themselves and earn money through betting illegally.'","Kerry Evans, 25, found guilty of breeding and fighting illegal breeds .

Poor children must learn how to behave in an ‘alien middle class world’ to help them get on in life, a government adviser has suggested. Working class families are urged to watch plays, visit museums and try middle class food, restaurants and shops to broaden their child’s life experience. Peter Brant, head of policy at the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, warned talented children from poorer backgrounds were not applying to university because they were worried about ‘fitting in’. Performance in exams is not the only thing holding working class children back, argues Peter Brant . The dominance of the middle classes in political life has been condemned by former Prime Minister Sir John Major. Education Secretary Michael Gove has vowed to narrow the attainment gap, insisting that some state schools are now better than private schools. But Mr Brant warned that it can be ‘incredibly difficult’ for working class children to ‘culturally fit into middle class lifestyle and jobs’. He said this was not just about academic achievement but the way children think and approach social situations. Writing in a post on the commission’s blog, he said: ‘It seems likely that worries about “not fitting in” will be one reason why highly able children from less well-off backgrounds are less likely to apply to the most selective universities. ‘It probably contributes to a lack of . confidence amongst those who are upwardly mobile as they struggle to . adapt to their new social environment with detrimental impact on their . ability to reach their potential. ‘And . the lack of effective networks and advice to help navigate this new . alien “middle class world” probably make it more difficult to translate . high attainment into success in the professional jobs market.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove insist he is reforming the school system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread . He highlighted barriers to children from less well-off backgrounds being able to achieve their potential, including a lack of shared cultural experiences  such as watching plays and taking up hobbies, and a lack of ‘cultural reference points’. The working classes also have different attitudes towards people and relationships’, including more ‘subtext, nuance and casualness’ in middle class relationships. The working and middle class also enjoy different food, restaurants, and clothes, he said. The middle classes are also able to draw on informal careers advice or role models, with working class children unable to tap into advice to break into the professional jobs market. Mr Brant warned that the problem can be unappreciated by policy makers - who mostly come from middle class professional backgrounds. ‘This often means that debate can all too easily assume that if educational inequalities can be reduced and aspirations of young people from working class backgrounds raised then that alone will be enough to tackle the problem.’ The governmant has come under pressure to adress the problem of wokring class children struggling to break into top jobs. Last year Sir John said he was appalled that 'every single sphere of British influence' was dominated by people who went to private school or who are from the 'affluent middle class'. In response Education Secretary Mr Gove said he was 'reforming the school system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread'. He once accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of being an intellectual socialist who collects ‘working class experiences as others might collect stamps’.","Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warns of fears of 'fitting in'

Pupils should be encouraged by state schools to join a cadet force to improve their character strengths, Michael Gove said last night. The Education Secretary wants head teachers to boost children’s so-called soft skills, such as showing respect, being self-motivated and coping under pressure. Mr Gove said employers demanded these traits, as well as resourcefulness and tenacity. Scroll down for video . Aiming for success: School cadets in training. Mr Gove said those in such programmes learn valuable skills . It was not enough for teachers to simply concentrate on academic progress – they must help create a workforce with ‘attractive personal qualities’, he added, which could be achieved by promoting more school cadet force units. In a speech today to highlight the need for schools to do more to build children’s character, he was expected to say: ‘Business – quite rightly – points out that it needs workers who possess not just impressive academic qualifications but attractive personal qualities. ‘Employees need to be self-disciplined, capable of subordinating their own instincts and interests to the needs of the team, responsive and respectful towards others, resourceful under pressure, tenacious and self-motivating. The Education Secretary wants children's soft skills to be developed to make them more employable . ‘Increasingly, they also need to be creative in the face of adversity, quick-thinking when presented with unexpected challenges. ‘A central element of our long-term plan for schools is the cultivation of those virtues – character strengths – through activities such as team sports, cadet forces, debating, dance, music and drama. It’s why we’re expanding the number of cadet forces in state schools.’ Of the 256 school combined cadet force units in England, 196 are based at independent schools, with just 60 in the state sector. The units can include cadets from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and Royal Marines. The Ministry of Defence provides uniforms, training expertise, equipment and access to military training areas, camps and courses. Prime Minister David Cameron, who was a cadet at Eton, has pledged to add 100 state school cadet units by the end of next year. Mr Gove’s comments come after the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and the CentreForum think-tank said last month that the development of children’s ‘character and resilience’ was so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after-school clubs. In a report, they called for teenagers to receive a school leaving certificate detailing their extra-curricular activities and employability skills. The ‘character and resilience manifesto’ report said the certificates could show that pupils had gained skills such as the ability to bounce back from setbacks. Meanwhile, the Education Secretary will today also call on all firms to offer apprenticeships for young people, saying concerns that it involved too much red tape had been addressed. Speaking at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey, he is expected to throw down the gauntlet to businesses and say: ‘There is no reason why every company in the country should not be offering apprenticeships. ‘We set ourselves the challenge of simplifying the apprenticeship programme and making it more responsive to employers’ needs, so no employer could have any excuse for standing aloof.’","Michael Gove suggested state pupils should join a cadet force .

Focusing on sporting success is a waste of time because 'very, very few children' are going to make it, an academic has said. Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, says there is little proof that the Olympic Games create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy. And he believes it is high time parents realised children are more likely to make the finals of shows like The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent than become sporting heroes of any sort. Winter Olympic Team GB's winners David Murdoch, Lizzy Yarnold, Jenny Jones and Eve Muirhead pose with their medals . 'We shouldn’t be trying to channel all of our energy into this pursuit of excellence in sports when very, very few children are going to succeed at any kind of level at all,' he said. 'My answer to parents who tell me their child might become a leading footballer or athlete is that they are putting them at risk of serious injury or closer to the world of performance-enhancing drugs. 'I ask them: ""Are you happy about that?"" and they say: ""It won’t happen to my child"". 'To which I reply: ""But it goes with the territory"". The cheats are very often those at the top. Ellis Cashmore says there is little proof that the Olympic Games create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy . 'Do we want to churn out one-dimensional characters who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of excellence?' Prof Cashmore is also concerned that the behaviour of elite sportsmen is filtering down to grass roots. 'Schools are now trying to apply an industrial model instead of encouraging children to enjoy sport without being competitive,' he said. 'At football matches, parents treat their children like interns in a concentration camp. 'I feel like saying to them: ""Your son is trying to enjoy himself, by the way!"".' Prof Cashmore, who has written books about David Beckham and Mike Tyson, reveals he once fancied himself as a middle distance runner with Birchfield Harriers – until he realised he 'wasn’t very good’. He played football until he was 40, has tried ice rinks but not skiing, and believes in sport as a useful means of recreation. But he added: 'Elite sportsmen are terrifyingly narrow, often unable to talk about anything else except their sport. 'I just used to try. I was an honest trier, a toiler.' Britain’s . Winter Olympics success, he argues, is such a flash in the pan that it . will have no effect on the nation’s youth whatsover. 'You . could stop 100 people in the street and ask them to name any of the . competitors. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who could,' he said. 'The . level of awareness of the Winter Olympics is zero and nobody was in the . slightest bit interested. 'Even if you asked 1,000 people, probably . only two or three of could name anyone. Because these were not games for ordinary people. Prof Cashmore also poured scorn on Lord Coe's 'Olympic legacies' 'So why do we spend all of this money training people to do something we are not very good at? “Is there anybody out there who wants so much taxpayer’s money spent on sports that will only be enjoyed by a tiny minority of a minority?' After studying the Winter Olympics medal table – Russia got 33 (13 of them gold), Norway 26 (11), Canada 25 (10), U.S. 28 (9), Netherlands 24 (8), Germany 19 (8), Switzerland 11 (6) and Great Britain 4 (1) – Prof Cashmore added: 'How did we get to the point that one gold, one silver and two bronzes is somehow a success when we are just not very good at winter games? 'The medals table proves the Winter Olympics is for affluent countries – and where are the black athletes? 'In six months time people will have forgotten all about curling. They won’t even know what it means.'Then there was the huge cost of covering something that I, and many others, didn’t watch a single minute of. Prof Cashmore also poured scorn on Lord Coe’s ‘Olympic legacies’. 'Over the years that word has mutated from meaning rejuvenating slums, new facilities and hospitals to creating more sportsmen,' he explained. 'The only increased take-up of a sport after London 2012 has been women’s boxing, so there’s a lot of people who find all of that a bit ambivalent. 'The newspapers and television were bigging up the Winter Olympics, but I didn’t hear anyone on the street talking about them.' The National Child Measurement Programme recently showed that 33 per cent of pupils aged 10 to11 in 2012-13 were obese or overweight, and 22 per cent of children in reception classes were overweight.","Ellis Cashmore is a professor at Staffordshire University .

"By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 03:52 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:58 EST, 3 March 2014 . Chancellor George Osborne today came under fresh pressure to slash duty on petrol and diesel by 3p a litre after damning new figures reveal UK drivers are suffering from the biggest fuel tax burden in Europe. Motorists in the UK pay the highest proportion of tax in the EU - despite a Government  freeze on fuel duty since March 2011, damning new  figures from the respected  RAC Foundation reveal. Britons face ‘the greatest fuel tax burden in Europe’, it says. Some 60 per cent of the cost of petrol is made up of tax imposed by the Treasury . Some 61p in every pound spent at the pumps on a litre of unleaded petrol - and 59p in every pound spent  on a litre of diesel – goes directly to  the Chancellor in fuel duty and VAT, says the RAC. It means that of the 28 countries in the EU, UK drivers pay the highest proportion of tax for diesel and the second highest for petrol after Sweden. Duty on fuel is currently a flat-rate 57.95p per litre. But the full tax of the fuel, including duty,  is then also subject to an additional tax burden of VAT levied at 20 per cent in total – making it a ‘tax on a tax’. Ironically, UK drivers pay some of the cheapest pre-tax fuel in Europe – but only before the full tax is levied, says the RAC. The figures were seized on by FairFuel campaigners demanding that the Chancellor cut duty by 3p a litre in the Spring Budget later this month. By the time VAT at 20 per cent is added, that would amount to a tax reduction of around 4p. Chancellor George Osborne has already acted to freeze fuel duty since taking power, but campaigners want him to go further . And the RAC Foundation itself said the Chancellor should go ‘ beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further.’ The RAC figures show that UK drivers who pay £1.37 at the pumps for a litre of diesel  see 59.09per cent of that going  directly to the Government as tax. That is the highest proportion of tax in Europe ahead of second place Sweden where diesel costs £1.24,  of which 56.04 per cent is tax. Drivers in third place Italy pays 54.72 per cent tax followed by Ireland (52.51 per cent), Slovenia (51.57 per cent), and Finland (50.15 per cent). Motorists in seventh place France are charged just £1.09 for litre of diesel, of which 49.90 per cent is tax, ahead of Holland (49.65per cent) and Germany (48.88 per cent) from a litre of diesel costing just £1.17. A 3p a litre duty cut – plus the near 1p reduction in VAT - would see the UK price drop to £1.33p and the proportion of tax to 49.58 per cent, just ahead of Germany. Lowest proportion of tax on diesel is in Luxembourg where  the fuel costs just 98p a litre of which 41.08per cent is tax. For petrol,  UK drivers pay the second highest proportion of tax  after Sweden. Petrol here is £1.30 a litre of which 61.42 per cent is tax, compared to 61.86per cent  in Sweden where the cost of fuel is actually cheaper at £1.24 per litre. Third place is the Netherlands (60.65per cent), followed by  Greece (59.86 per cent), Italy 959.02 per cent)and Ireland (58.71per cent). France is in eighth place at 57.64 per cent just ahead of Germany at 57.05per cent. If the Chancellor cut UK duty by 3p with a 1p fall in VAT the UK would drop to 18th place with unleaded costing £1.26 of which just over half (52.33per cent wold be VAT. Lowest tax for unleaded is  in Bulgaria  where drivers pay £1.05 a litre at the pumps of which 44.95per cent is tax, just ahead of Romania (£1.09 per litre of  which 47.70per cent is tax). Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘On 19th March the Chancellor will deliver his budget. He has made much of the fact that fuel duty has not risen for three years. However this has made little impact on the huge proportion of tax the UK’s 36 million drivers pay on their fuel.’ He noted: ’The irony is that if you take tax out of the equation we actually have the fifth cheapest diesel in the EU and the second cheapest petrol. The oil companies and retailers are often blamed for soaring pump prices but these figures reveal that’s not the whole picture.’ Fuel duty accounts for 61 per cent of the petrol price in the UK, the second highest proportion in Europe . Professor Glaister said:’With the poorest car owners now spending as much as a third of their income on buying and running a vehicle, and with a record number of people now commuting to work by car, there are plenty of reasons why the Chancellor should consider going beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further.’ RAC Foundation research shows that some 800,000 of the poorest car-owning households in the UK spend about a third of their disposable income on buying and running a vehicle. Its analysis also shows that a record 16.7million people in England and Wales are reliant on a car to get to work: 15.3 million as drivers and 1.4 million as passengers. Campaign group FairFuel UK seized on the figures to demand a 3p cut in duty, amounting to a near 4p (3.6p) cut after VAT. Quentin Willson, lead campaigner for FairFuelUK said: ‘Having the highest duty for diesel and second highest for petrol in the EU is a cruel and needless burden on the millions who have no option but to commute to work and shop for essentials by car. 'This is why so many complain they’re spending so much of their incomes on mobility. A fuel duty cut of 3 pence in the March Budget would hugely benefit everybody in the UK, but especially the poorest.’ Howard Cox, co-founder of FairFuelUK said: ‘This punitive tax on UK road users has to be slashed. The Chancellor currently takes considerably more at the pumps for diesel in tax than any other EU Finance Minister. 'Our call for a 3p duty cut would mean that the UK would drop to 18th in the EU 'tax take' for petrol and 9th for diesel.  Such a fuel duty cut would be self-financing and a vote winner.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Freezing fuel duty has been a major priority of the Government. As a result, petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it otherwise would have been. This represents an average saving for motorists of £680 over the course of the Parliament. ‘To help families with the cost of living, we have also increased the tax free personal allowance, taking 2.7 million people out of tax altogether.’","Motorists paying the highest proportion of tax in the European Union .

Boris Johnson today ruled out a return to the Commons before the 2015 general election, in a rebuff to senior Tories who want him to make an early comeback. The London Mayor insisted he had too much to do running the capital and would not abandon it to become an MP. He was also forced to play down claims of a rift with Chancellor George Osborne, insisting they have a ‘very, very good working relationship’. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson insisted he would not enter the Commons before 2015 . A major Conservative row erupted after it was reported on Saturday that David Cameron and Mr Osborne were trying to persuade him to stand in 2015 so that he is fully bound in to the general election result. Yesterday allies of the Mayor's insisted it was 'bull****' that the Chancellor had already personally delivered him a message saying that he should attempt to return to the Commons next year. But challenged on the issue today, Mr Johnson insisted he would not take a Commons seat next year because he was too excited by major infrastructure projects, including tunnelling under the Hammersmith fly-over. Taking questions on LBC 97.3, he was . asked: ‘You are not going into the Commons prior to 2015 because of the . excitement of the Hammersmith fly under?’ Mr Johnson replied: ‘Correct.’ LBC host Nick Ferrari asked again: ‘You are not going in, so despite George Osborne’s entreaties, the answer is no?’ Mr . Johnson insisted: ‘The answer is I am sticking to my job I was elected . to do in 2012, and in 2008, and I have a very great privilege to be . here.’ Chancellor George Osborne reportedly approached Mr Johnson about becoming an MP earlier, but Mr Johnson has rejected the plea . Senior Tories had opposed the idea of Mr Johnson making an early return to the Commons, because it would put him in prime position to challenge for leader if the Tories fail to win an overall majority under Mr Cameron. However, allies of the Prime Minister hatched a plan to urge Mr Johnson to stand in 2015 – if not before - so that he was bound into the result. If the Tories lost, he would not be able to claim he was not responsible. Yesterday, an ally of the Mayor told the Mail on Sunday that he believed Mr Osborne, who is also tipped as a future Tory leader, was responsible for trying to 'destabilise Boris'. 'This is nothing to do with party loyalty and everything to do with Osborne and Cameron trying to destabilise Boris. He saw it coming a mile off. 'They want to make sure that if the Tories lose, Boris gets as much flak as they do and can't stand as leader as a break with the failed Cameron-Osborne regime,' the source was quoted as saying. Mr Johnson gulped down his drink from a mug as he came under pressure over his leadership ambitions . Today Mr Johnson played down talk of a rift with Mr Osborne. ‘I said many things to my friend George,’ he said. He claimed he was ‘most surprised’ by the weekend’s headlines. ‘What I talk about with George is how to move the London economy. ‘George . and I have a good working relationship and indeed an old friendship and . what we both want to do is get David Cameron re-elected. That is the . project about which we are united.’ He insisted he wanted to remain as London Mayor to oversee projects like the replacement of the Hammersmith fly-over . Mr Johnson had been seen as a frontrunner to be the next Tory leader, but the dramatic improvement in the economy has seen Mr Osborne’s stock rise. The public jostling for position has been condemned by some Conservatives. Rebel MP Mark Pritchard wrote on Twitter: 'Inside and outside of Parliament people are fed up of Old Etonians thinking they can pass on Number Ten like some sort of plaything or baton.’ Tory party chairman Grant Shapps insisted Mr Johnson should play a major role in the general election campaign, whatever his intentions on a return to Parliament. 'Boris is a guy who is able to communicate incredibly well and it would be crazy for him not to be part of the 2015 message,' he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme. 'We all think Boris is a fantastic London Mayor and he's got a lot to offer. He's doing a brilliant job in London; his term runs till 2016, so he's got a little way to go, but no doubt he'll have many things to offer. What Boris does is up to Boris.'","London Mayor insists he will concentrate on running the capital .

A mother brutally murdered by her jealous ex-partner was 'let down' by police who failed to attend a call just hours before she was stabbed to death, a review has found. Jeanette Goodwin, 47, was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover Martin Bunch at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011. Bunch had stalked his ex-partner for months and was on bail for harassment when he broke into her back garden in a jealous rage with a kitchen knife. Jeanette Goodwin (left), 47, was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover Martin Bunch (right) at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011 . A domestic homicide review by the Southend Community Safety Partnership has said police failed to attend a call on the day of the murder. Mrs Goodwin called police at 2.30pm on July 24, 2011, to inform them she was being harassed by Bunch and arranged for officers to check up on her at 4.30pm. But police failed to attend the arranged meeting and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm. The report also criticised failings in the justice system after Bunch was handed conditional bail, ahead of a trial for harassment of Mrs Goodwin, just days before the deadly knife attack. Christine Doorley, who led the review, said lessons needed to be learnt from the tragedy. She said: 'This case shows the extremely manipulative and controlling power of a domestic violence perpetrator. Bunch had stalked his ex-partner for months and was on bail for harassment when he broke into her back garden in a jealous rage with a kitchen knife . 'He had an obsessional nature and past history as well as problems with drugs and alcohol. He was a really serious and dangerous perpetrator. 'The most important lesson to be learnt here is to make sure all information is recorded in real time with no backlog and shared with the right people. 'At any one time there were gaps in the transfer of information. 'The problems were in management of the perpetrator in terms of the criminal justice system. Mrs Goodwin's family today said they hoped the findings would help prevent another tragedy . 'Speaking to the family, they felt the justice process had not been right and I agree with them. 'There were mistakes with the technical knowledge and understandings of bail, bail conditions and options around sentencing. 'He did not fulfil any of his sentences and was never brought back to court for those issues. 'The family feel let down. There is evidence that process didn’t work as it should have.' Bunch was known to police and had 79 previous convictions. He was jailed for 27 years in August 2012 for the brutal murder of the mother-of-three. Mrs Goodwin’s family today said they hoped the findings would help prevent another tragedy. In a statement, they said: 'We are satisfied with the findings which were made. 'Even though it will not bring our loved one back, we hope the learning and improvements which have been identified will make a difference for other victims of domestic abuse and help to ensure they will now be treated as they should, as a priority. 'We hope these findings and recommendations will help to prevent such a tragedy occurring again.' Essex Police has said it would 'like to again extend its sincere condolences to the family and friends' of Mrs Goodwin. It said it welcomed the recommendations highlighted by the review, adding many had already been implemented and were expected to be completed by the end of this month. The force said it had also undertaken a range of further steps to improve its response to domestic abuse incidents in association with partner agencies in Southend and beyond. Police failed to attend the arranged meeting at 4.30pm and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm . Chief Superintendent Luke Collison said: 'Much has changed since the victim's tragic death and work continues to improve the consistency and co-ordination of our response to domestic abuse. 'There is a lot being done, both inside the force, and with partners. Domestic abuse is one of the biggest challenges we face – every day we deal with an average of 80 incidents, each one quite rightly demanding a professional and effective response. 'Essex Police rightly dedicate significant resources to tackling this issue and our commitment to meeting this demand and keeping vulnerable people safe is unequivocal. 'Together with our partners we remain committed to helping victims of domestic abuse and we would urge anyone suffering at the hands of a violent offender to contact us immediately. 'Our pledge is this: ""We will listen to you and we will help you"".' The force has said among the improvements made to the way it handles domestic abuse are: . Other changes include a joint initiative between police, Southend Borough Council and other partners to bring a specially trained domestic abuse . police officer and a social worker together to assess domestic abuse . incidents as they are reported, as well as a new Domestic Abuse Crime Unit at Southend police station to provide a . dedicated resource for all domestic abuse investigations and prisoners. The force said certain higher risk perpetrators are also specifically targeted by Neighbourhood Officers under Operation Shield, which it says provides a relentless attention and enforcement approach to those who pose the greatest risk to victims of domestic abuse. In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed sadistic killer David Oakes to murder his ex-partner and daughter . This is not the first time Essex Police has been accused of failing a victim of violent crime. In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed sadistic killer David Oakes to murder his ex-partner and daughter. The police watchdog said officers took 'inadequate action' to arrest the 50-year-old before he shot Christine Chambers, 38, and Shania, two, at their home in Braintree, Essex. Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June 2011. It emerged during his trial at Chelmsford Crown Court that police had visited either his address or Miss Chambers' home six times in the two years before the murders. The trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him. He then shot himself in the face, but survived. A damning report released by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded there was a number of failings by Essex Police, including missed chances to arrest Oakes before the killings. Responding to the report, Essex Police said it accepted the findings and apologised for the failings which had been identified. Meanwhile, in May last year, the IPCC published a second highly critical report on the failures by Essex police to protect Maria Stubbings who was strangled by her convicted murderer ex-boyfriend. Ms Stubbings was killed by Marc Chivers at her home in Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2008. Chivers had been freed from a German prison less than a year earlier, after serving 15 years for murdering his then girlfriend Sabine Rappold. He was jailed for life in 2009 for Ms Stubbings' murder. Maria Stubbings (left) was killed by Marc Chivers (right) at her home in Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2008 . Ms Stubbings was strangled with a dog lead and dumped under coats in the toilet of her house, but police were 'fobbed off' by her killer, who said she was away, even though her car was in the drive. It was only the next day when they came back they found her body. Ms Stubbings's 15-year-old son Benji had been left in the house with Chivers after his mother died, unaware that he was in grave danger. The IPCC report found there were implications for the whole force. The report said that the force missed 'a large number of opportunities' to protect her and her son. At the time, Essex Police said it accepted the findings of the report. Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said: 'A combination of factors including missed opportunities and organisational failures led to the brutal murder of Maria Stubbings. As a force we must never lose sight of the impact of her death at the hands of a violent offender and we must respond to the IPCC report in a positive way. 'We fully recognise that this is one of three tragic murders in Essex which has led to an IPCC investigation. We have taken on board the recommendations of those reports, many are already in place and work continues to improve the consistency of our response to domestic abuse.'","Jeanette Goodwin was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover .

Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio (pictured), whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child . A deaf couple desperate to have a baby were scammed out of £12,000 by a friend who told them he could arrange a surrogate birth, a court has heard. Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio, whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child. The 52-year-old, who is also deaf following a hit-and-run accident, conned the couple into handing over £6,000, believing that he had arranged a surrogate birth. Then when he told them the child had been born disabled, they parted with another £6,000 pounds for another baby. However, a judge heard that there never were any babies and 'devious liar' DiCaprio continued to fleece the childless couple with a bogus foreign property investment deal promising a return of up to £400,000. The conman is now starting a prison sentence for the scams which left Mr and Mrs Musselwhite devastated emotionally and financially. He told the couple he would use his contacts in Kenya to arrange for a mother to carry their child after they had failed to conceive. The couple handed over £6,000 before being told the baby was born disabled. A deal for a second baby was reached but DiCaprio extracted more money by saying the child was ill and there had been visa complications to delay its arrival. He even sent them fake pictures of the baby he called Amy, which he had actually taken from a photographer’s website. In a separate scam, DiCaprio persuaded Mr Musselwhite and his mother Doreen to invest £55,000 and £34,000 respectively in a fake property development in Kenya. Alexia Durran, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, said that DiCaprio met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend. He discovered they were trying for a baby through his ex-wife and embarked on 'a sophisticated fraud' to convince them he could arrange a surrogate mother to give them the child they wanted. 'In June 2011 he arranged for Sonia to meet with a man known only as Carl, who said he could arrange the surrogate for them,' said Miss Durran. 'She took out a loan and paid £6,000 to DiCaprio who said he would pass it on to Carl, who never appeared again.' The couple were told a mother, named Melissa, had been found to carry their child. Alexia Durran, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, said that DiCaprio met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend . 'Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya.' DiCaprio told the couple this child was suffering from Down’s syndrome. 'The Musselwhites were upset at this news as they thought the child’s disability, combined with their own deafness, would mean they would be unable to communicate together,' said Miss Durran. DiCaprio told the couple, from Reading, Berkshire, they would have to pay for a second mother to be found and a further £6,000 pounds was handed over after he said a woman named Jenny Maghanga had agreed. 'He told them the baby had been called Amy and sent them photographs,' said Miss Durran. Mrs Musselwhite gave up her job in February 2013 to prepare for Amy’s arrival but DiCaprio repeatedly said complications had come up which required more money before she could come to England. 'They were told Amy had spina bifida and had to have an operation, that she was suffering with malaria and that there were difficulties with her visa,' said Miss Durran. A woman claiming to be Jenny Maghanga called Mr Musselwhite and demanded more money, as did DiCaprio, who said if it was not paid the baby would be given to someone else. Investigations found no paperwork documenting the transfer of eggs and sperm to Kenya, which is strictly regulated by fertility clinics and the photographs purporting to be Amy were in fact taken by a London photographer of his daughter and uploaded online. DiCaprio had already convinced Mr Musselwhite he was involved in a building project in Kenya which, once completed, would earn investors a large return. 'Mr Musselwhite was persuaded on three . occasions to remortgage his home and take out high-interest loans, to . the amount of £55,000,' said Miss Durran. In . 2007, Mr Musselwhite’s mother Doreen became concerned after finding out . his mortgage, which had originally been for £35,000, was then . for £143,000. After the scheme was explained to her, Doreen . attempted to find out what was happening between 2007 and 2008. In . 2011, DiCaprio emailed Mr Musselwhite telling him he would be receiving . £90,000 after seven Kenyan apartments were sold, in exchange for . £1,500 in legal fees. He showed his mother the email and . DiCaprio visited her in early 2012 to show her false documents claiming . rights to build and land ownership in the African country. Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya . DiCaprio, from Rossendale, Lancashire, told Mr Musselwhite he would be paid a total of £400,000 and asked Doreen for £9,000 which would make her £105,000 in return. She paid the money and also agreed to a further £25,000 for an eventual return of £140,000. Neither Mr Musselwhite nor his mother has ever seen any return on their investments. DiCaprio was arrested on September 3, 2013, and admitted telling the Musselwhites he could arrange a surrogate mother and that the two children suffered the disabilities described, but said he had lost contact with ‘mother’ Jenny Maghanga. 'He described himself in relation to this operation as just being a mediator and denied he had kept any money given to him,' said Miss Durran. He told police he had several bank accounts in Kenya but could not provide details and claimed he had been sent the photographs by Jenny. The court heard he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982, including theft, forgery and making false statements. He was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception. Rebecca Randall, mitigating, asked for leniency from Judge Reddihough as prison would be 'more onerous,' for DiCaprio due to his deafness - who accepted what he did was wrong. 'He has now shown some sympathy, empathy and understanding of the consequences of his actions on the Musselwhites.' The court heard DiCaprio was keen to pay compensation to his victims, and a Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation hearing is due to take place on June 13 at Reading Crown Court. Miss Randall said DiCaprio was born partially deaf but lost hearing in both ears in a hit-and-run accident in the early 1990s, which contributed to his offending as he lost his job and independence as a result of it. She added that he had been abused as a child and was only recently coming to terms with the idea it may have impacted on him. The court heard DiCaprio has a wife and six-year-old child, who is also deaf, living in Kenya. Judge Reddihough, sentencing, said: 'The evidence in this case demonstrates you are a devious liar and a scheming fraudsman. In relation to Mr and Mrs Musselwhite, you preyed on their emotions and the long-standing wish to have a child.' He added: 'Putting it shortly, in a despicable way you conned them out of large sums of money. 'All three victims have suffered substantial financial loses which they could ill afford and their victim impact statements indicate the worry, upset and anguish you have caused to them by the very serious breaches of trust.' DiCaprio, who wore a blue short-sleeved shirt and jeans, was sentenced to 18 months for two charges relating to the baby scam and two years for two charges relating to the property scheme, to run consecutively for a total of three and a half years. The Musselwhites declined to comment after the hearing.","Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted friend of 20 years Gino DiCaprio .

One of Britain's worst boxers has lost his 51st fight in a row after being defeated on Saturday. 'Rockin' Robin Deakin, 27, who has not won since his first professional bout in 2006, lost on points to 'Polish pugilist' Damian Lawniczak after 13 rounds. Despite his appalling record Mr Deakin has vowed to keep fighting, saying 'struggle has become my identity.' Deakin, from Essex, is ranked 85th of 88 in the UK light welterweight division on website BoxRec . Deakin has continued his poor run of form with his 51st defeat in  row after losing on Saturday . After 13 rounds the judges ruled in favour of his opponent, Polish fighter Damian Lawniczak . Despite his poor form, Deakin took to Twitter after the bout to say he wouldn't give up on the sport . Mr Deakin, of East Tilbury, Essex, said on Twitter: 'I have had my confidence knocked so much. Dunno what to do. Got the talent just can’t get out of this rut. #gutted . 'The hardest part of ending is starting. Struggle has become my identity, I prepared for the fight. 'The occasion got to me. Thanks for all the loyaly. I will still fight. I won’t quit #boxing.' Robin, who reckons he had been training harder than ever before for Saturday’s bout, blamed nerves on his in-ring failures. Deakin said that 'struggle has become part of my identity' after the defeat adding that he loses focus in the ring . Deakin had success as an amateur and won his first professional fight in 2006, but has lost every one since . Last year the British Boxing Board of Control withdrew his licence over fears for his health meaning he had to travel to Germany in order to get a permit to carry on . He added: 'Loads going on in my head. Doing over time. Need a great trainer work on conditioning and my mental condition. I suffer with nerves real bad. 'The things that almost break you, are the things to make you strong. Strengths do not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths.' Mr Deakin is officially ranked 85th out of 88 UK fighters in the light welterweight category, according to website BoxRec, and has suffered more knockouts than any other fighter in the division with 12. Robin’s manager, Dave Murphy said: 'We’ve given Robin the training and the support he needs. 'Robin has been given the chance to prove his worth, and I think he shows that in everything he does.' With 12 knockouts, Deakin has been rendered unconscious more times than anyone else in his division . However Deakin's record is still better than Peter Buckley who quit the sport in 2008 after losing 256 out of 300 professional fights . Robin turned pro after a successful amateur career which saw him win 40 out of 75 bouts, including making it to the semi-finals of the British Youth Championships. The UK’s boxing regulatory authority, the British Boxing Board of Control, suspended Mr Deakin’s licence in 2012 when they began worrying for his health. Last month Mr Deakin was granted a permit in Germany which has allowed him to carry on fighting.

A new mother who had no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth on the toilet in her parents’ bathroom, has spoken of her shock at the arrival of her new son. Gaynor Rzepka, 25, gave birth to baby Olly-James on February 16 weighing a healthy 6lbs 5oz. But she said his arrival came as a complete surprise to her and her family, from Llantwit Major, Wales  - adding that she had worked ten hour shifts right up until the birth and had even ran a half marathon half way through her pregnancy. Gaynor Rzepka of Llantwit Major, South Wales, who gave birth to baby Olly without ever knowing she was pregnant . She said looking back the only inkling that she may have been pregnant was a sudden fondness for Mars bars, and 'putting on a stone around Christmas time.' Hours before the birth, Miss Rzepka had been at work at the Filco supermarket in Cowbridge and said she felt unwell. She said her manager asked her if she wanted to go home early but she insisted on carrying on until the end of her ten-hour shift. That night she woke at about 1am in pain. She said: 'I was having a really sharp pain in the side of my stomach all day and I didn’t know what it was. 'The only way I can describe it is that it was like someone stabbing me in the right hand side of my groin. 'I didn’t think much of it. At about 5am I felt like I needed the toilet but I couldn’t go. 'I had another really sharp pain at about 5.20am and went to the toilet again. I stood up because I didn’t feel right. 'I just pushed and he arrived. I caught him before he went into the toilet. 'I was really shocked.' She said his arrival came as a complete surprise to her and her family, from Llantwit Major, Wales - adding that she had worked ten hour shifts right up until the birth and had even ran a half marathon half way through her pregnancy . She said looking back the only inkling that she may have been pregnant was a sudden fondness for Mars bars, and 'putting on a stone around Christmas time' Miss Rzepka said: 'My first words were just repeating: ""Oh my God"". I didn’t know what else to say. I burst into tears and sat on the floor.' According to studies, the phenomenon of surprise birth is not as rare as one might  imagine. Previously, statistics show that one in 600 mothers-to-be will be unaware they are pregnant until they give birth, or just before. The situation tends to occur in busy women, those who may already be overweight, and those approaching the menopause. It tends to happen in menopausal women and younger busy women because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking for signs . Also, bleeding during pregnancy is  common, especially during the first few months when the baby is bedding in, so women can think they are still menstruating. 'My mum said: ""It’s a baby""and my dad was saying, ""Don’t worry, keep calm"".' Miss Rzepka, . who has been working at the deli counter at Filco for nine years, said . she had been lifting 25 kilo boxes all the way through the pregnancy, . right up until she had the baby. She added: 'A few days before I had the baby I was lifting up bags of potatoes for the customers.' Miss Rzepka’s . partner Paul, a 29-year-old bar manager who she met just over a year . ago at her sister’s hen party, was also none the wiser about her being . pregnant. 'I thought, oh no, he will kill me, so I said to my mum to ring him. He was over the moon about it. Gaynor said: 'I didn’t have any signs, no morning sickness, no pain, no heartburn, nothing at all. I had periods all the way through. 'I didn’t really put on very much weight until Christmas, and I just thought that was a Christmas belly.' She said she had been 12st until Christmas when she put on another 13Ibs.' Miss Rzepka had even ran the Cardiff Half Marathon five months into her pregnancy. New . grandmother Tania, 53, who also works at Filco, said: 'I had been up . with Gaynor all night. I thought she had grumbling appendix. 'I was sat on the settee watching the Winter Olympics and the next thing I knew she ran up to the toilet. 'When . I heard her scream I ran up the stairs, and half way up the stairs I . heard the baby scream. I just thought, ""Oh my God, that’s a baby"". 'I saw the baby and my maternal instinct kicked in. I put my arms out, took the baby and wrapped it in a towel. 'Then helped sit her down and wrap her up. She was quite white as she had gone into shock.' She said she had 'no inkling at all' that her daughter was pregnant. Miss Rzepka gave birth in the bathroom at her mother's home in LLantwit Major . She . said: 'It was like having two shocks - the first was when he was born . in the bathroom. But then when I brought him home from hospital wrapped . up in a blanket. I never thought that would happen to me. 'The . sense of responsibility and knowing my life would never be the same . again scares me much more than Olly-James coming in the night.' The new mother and her family have been running around buying all the things she needs for her first born child. But luckily her sister has two little boys - and everything they have grown out of has been passed on. Her partner Mr Rawcliffe, 29, took a job in Blackpool when she would have been about six months pregnant. But he is now making plans to move back to South Wales to be with his partner and son. She said: 'We are hoping to get a family home together as soon as he can move down to be with us. New grandmother Tania, 53, who also works at Filco, said: 'I had been up with Gaynor all night. I thought she had grumbling appendix' First responders came within ten minutes of her call and paramedics arrived soon after. Miss Rzepka was taken to The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where she stayed overnight. She said: 'The doctors reckon that because I was so active throughout the whole pregnancy, that is why I didn’t feel him move. 'When I was awake he was asleep and when I was asleep he was awake.' In October, Nadia Watson, 22, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, woke up suffering from what she thought were period pains but collapsed to the floor and went into labour. She screamed in agony for more than an hour as she delivered 7lbs 11oz baby Poppy by herself. She had a rare undiagnosed pregnancy and was unaware she was carrying a child - she gained very little weight and remained a size ten throughout. She had two retail jobs - at Frankie and Benny's restaurant and Blockbuster video - and would even help her pregnant neighbour carry her shopping. Asked whether there were any giveaway signs that she had been pregnant, Miss Rzepka said: 'Looking back on it now, I normally hate Mars bars but I’d been eating them the last few months. That was the only thing.' She said word quickly spread about the new arrival. 'I got text messages saying, ‘Have you had a baby, is it true?’ It saved me having to tell anyone.' Denise Blackmore, store manager at Cowbridge Filco, said: 'She was due to work a shift the following day. When her mum rang me that morning, I thought it’s not like Gaynor to be ill. 'She doesn’t take sick days, she is very reliable. When her mum told me I was a bit taken aback. 'Obviously we are really pleased for her. 'Because she is such a well-liked girl in Cowbridge, all the customers have been coming in and giving presents for the baby like balloons, blankets, teddy bears, and sending her flowers.' Ms Rzepka said Olly-James is happy and gaining weight and that she is now taking some well-earned time off work.","Gaynor Rzepka, 25, gave birth to baby Olly-James on February 16 .

Fall: Lalula Snook was allegedly knocked unconscious after slipping on the new floor of the swimming pool at Cleethorpes Leisure Centre . A multi-million pound swimming pool has been forced to close within days of opening after a three-year-old girl was allegedly knocked unconscious when she slipped on the new floor. The pool at Cleethorpes Leisure Centre in Lincolnshire was shut down after Lalula Snook fell over by the edge of the water. She reportedly smashed her head on the ground and was knocked unconscious - leaving her suffering from mild concussion. Bosses at the pool, which has recently undergone a £2.5million refurbishment, made the decision to close the facility on Sunday. They confirmed Lalula's fall was due to a 'number of incidents' involving the 'slippery floor'. Today, the child's father Jason Snook, 24, said he had been walking out of the changing rooms holding daughter's hand when she slipped on the ground. 'We were walking really slowly and she was holding my hand when she slipped,' he said. 'She fell hard and was unconscious for around 20 seconds before she came round- but it felt like forever. 'She was then crying for 45 minutes afterwards.' Mr Snook said a member of staff had given his daughter some ice and had filled in an accident form, before she was taken to hospital by ambulance. He added that he had witnessed several falls at the pool in the past - saying: ' I know that another girl had fallen and been hurt just before Lalula because her dad was filling an accident form in too.'

Tributes have been paid to two men murdered in a 'ferocious' ambush by a hooded gang as police scour CCTV to identify who killed them. Aaron Carriere, 21, and Josiah Manful, . 20, were both repeatedly stabbed after their black Ford Fiesta was . stopped in Montague Road, Leytonstone, in the early hours of Saturday morning. A gang of hooded attackers surrounded the car, leaving Mr Carriere with fatal knife wounds to his neck and Mr Manful with stab wounds to the chest. Tragedy: Aaron Carriere, left, and Josiah Manful, right, were murdered after they were ambushed in their car by a hooded gang . Looking for clues:  Forensics at the scene of the double murder as police try to piece together what happened . There are concerns the dead men were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time', with friends saying the pair went to church weekly and has no involvement in crime. Shantelle . Limbard, 23, told the Evening Standard: 'They were funny, kind, bubbly, outgoing and very . charismatic. They had hearts of gold and always had big smiles. If you . needed something because you didnâ€™t have any money or whatever they . would always help you out. Itâ€™s such a shock. We have no idea who would . want to do this.' Mr Manful's sister . Claudia said in an online tribute: 'I'll never wish death on anyone, but I hope the . people that took Aaron and Josiah's lives conscience eats away at them.' Police say they are not sure of any motive. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell said: 'At the moment it's not clear why these two men were targeted and murdered. 'My appeal is threefold. I'm appealing to witnesses to the attack, I'm appealing for information from those who may know those responsible, and we need to understand why these two men were murdered. 'It's too early to speculate on why they were murdered and we're keeping an open mind about the circumstances behind these murders, and I urge the community and members of the public to do the same.' Tributes: Flowers with notes from bereft family and loved-ones of the pair have been laid at the scene . One note said: 'To Aaron and Josiah, I can't believe what has happened to my good friends! You will forever be in our hears & will never be forgotten, may you both rest in peace. Love from Paris & Family' Bereft: Two young women public console each other at the murder scene as police try to work out a possible motive . Mr Attewell said that witnesses can have their identities protected. He added: 'There were several suspects and they were all hooded. They attacked both sides of the car simultaneously and attacked the two victims Josiah and Aaron while they were sitting in the car. 'They were stabbed several times, they suffered significant injuries. The attack can only be described as ferocious. 'It's likely that these suspects are speaking about what happened and people are hearing them speak about it. 'Information can be treated in confidence, my team are specialist homicide investigators and there are several methods we can use to protect people's identities.' He would not discuss whether either of the men were already known to the police or whether the murder may have been linked to a gang. Violence: Broken glass and what appears to be blood on the tarmac of Montague Road in Leytonstone, east London . Mr Attewell said: 'We need to understand why these two men were murdered and obviously we are looking into their backgrounds to see if there is anything in their backgrounds that will help us.' Police are scouring through CCTV footage to piece together the run-up to the murders and try to identify the killers. 'The events immediately before these two young lads were murdered are crucial for us to understand,' Mr Attewell said. 'We're looking for CCTV footage over a very wide area trying to see the movements of the victims and to identify the suspects on the footage and to piece together the events leading up to it.' Post-mortem examinations found the cause of death for Mr Carriere was given as stab wounds to the neck while the cause of death for Mr Manful was given as shock and haemorrhaging, and stab wounds to the chest.

A mother who was protecting her daughter from a drunken attacker was left with 'appalling' injuries after a woman bit into her thumb like 'a pitbull'. Helen Betts said the pain in her hand when Sandra Bell ripped it open was worse than when she battled breast cancer, Teesside Crown Court heard. Miss Betts, 57, needed 10 stitches to her thumb to repair the wound, while her nerves and tendons were also severed, leaving her with no feeling in her digit since the attack on October 2012. 'Six years ago I had breast cancer and I . can honestly say that this was more painful than anything I went though . with that. I thought she was going to rip my thumb off. What she did was . inhuman,' she told the court. Victims: Helen Betts was protecting her daughter Hayley, together left, when she was attacked by Sandra Bell, right, who bit at her hand like 'a pitbull' Violence: Helen Betts thumb was torn open in the brutal incident. The victim no longer has any feeling in it . But despite the severity of the attack, Bell was spared jail. Bell of Thornaby-on-Tees, had been at the Mitre Pub in Stockton with a male friend on October 20, 2012, when the pair became 'heavily intoxicated'. Prosecuting, Paul Lee said that the landlord had 'had enough' and ejected the man from the pub. He then became aggressive and Bell tried to calm him down. Hayley Shields, 18, who was working as a barmaid was asked to escort Bell out of the pub. But once outside Bell assaulted her. Mr Lee said: 'She grabbed her by the hair and pulled her down to the ground. She was then on top of her.' Miss . Shields' mother was inside the pub when the attack . happened and raced outside when she saw her daughter on the ground. Miss . Betts, a school meals caterer, said: 'I ran straight out and told her . to get off my daughter. She then grabbed my hair and was pulling it. 'I . went to try and get her hand off and she started biting my thumb. She . wouldn't stop. There were four people trying to get her off me. But she . wouldn't let go. I was just screaming in pain.' After the event: Miss Betts needed 10 stitches to her thumb to repair the wound, while her nerves and tendons were also severed . Today: The thumb, pictured outside court, has healed but the biting incident means she may not recover feeling in it . The . wound later became infected and led to Miss Betts having to spend more . than two weeks in hospital and a further two weeks of being visited by a . nurse at home. She now has no feeling in it and visible scars. She said: 'She was a bully and acted like an animal. 'It has had such a massive effect on my life. It has changed my character. 'I have lost a lot of confidence.' Sentencing . Bell, Judge John Walford said he had 'immense sympathy' for Miss Betts . and described the attack as 'absolutely appalling'. Freed: Despite the severity of the attack Bell was handed a two-year suspended sentence. Her defence told the judge she had suffered mental health problems . Mark Styles, mitigating for Bell, said her behaviour that night was 'out of character.' He . told the court that she was on medication at the time for depression . and she also suffers from a personality disorder for which she now . receives treatment. He said she is 'very unlikely' to trouble the court again. Judge Walford gave Bell a two-year sentence, suspended for two years with supervision. She was also ordered to pay Â£100 costs. No order for compensation was made.","Sandra Bell bit Helen Betts' thumb after she had attacked her victim's child .
