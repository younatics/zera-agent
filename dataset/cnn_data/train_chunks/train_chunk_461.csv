"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 8:26 AM on 6th December 2011 . Ski companies let out a collective sigh of relief as up to 30cm of snow finally fell across France, Switzerland and Austria today after what had been a worryingly mild start to the season. In France, Val Thorens, Tignes and Courchevel all received fresh dumps of snow with Val D’Isere reporting a fall of 20cm. And it is hoped that the snow will continue to fall with a number of French resorts expecting to receive anything between 10cm to 40cm of snowfall later this week. At last! A thick blanket of snow covers the slopes of French ski resort Val D'Isere today which reported a fall of as much as 20cm . Barren: The slopes of Val D'Isere, seen here just four days ago, had been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years . In Switzerland, it was snowing in both Andermatt and Arosa, which allowed riders on their slopes for the first time last weekend. Davos had 5cm of fresh snow and Zermatt received 10cm of fresh snow. Samnaun also had a good day on Monday, and received one of the highest amounts of fresh snow in Switzerland with around 30cm. In Austria, Obergurgl reported a fall of 10cm of fresh snow today and has 15 out of 24 ski lifts open. Lech fared less well with 5cm of snow and only four out of its 84 lifts open and St Anton had just 3cm of snow with only two out of its 84 lifts open. Resorts in Germany, Bulgaria and Scotland are yet to open for the season. Shining brightly: The slopes are now ready for ski season at Val D'Isere as this glorious picture shows . Dusted: The slopes at French resort Courchevel, which is due to host the World Cup alpine races later this month, look far healthier now . That's more like it: The town of Val D'Isere as it should look at this time of year . Vicky Norman of the Ski Club of Great Britain told MailOnline: ‘There’s great news in numerous European resorts who finally, after weeks of dry, warm conditions, have received anything between a light dusting and 30cm of the white stuff. Time to take off: A sign at Courchevel airport . ‘Resort villages have been transformed . from green to white overnight and the forecast implies more snow is on . the way. 'This has been a great confidence booster and could be the first . signs of what could turn out to be a fantastic winter season.’ Europe has been experiencing its warmest and driest autumn since 1864, meaning many European ski resorts had been forced to delay openings due to a shortage of snow, which was threatening to ruin . pre-Christmas skiing holidays for thousands of Britons. Resorts in France and Switzerland had been particularly badly hit. Nine out of 12 French ski resorts had to delay their openings, including the Grands-Montets at Chamonix, Meribel and Megeve. In the French Pyrenees, only two out of 36 resorts - Puigmal and Vallnord – had opened by the end of last week. Val d’Isère and Tignes in France, along with Zermatt in Switzerland and Ischgl in Austria, had managed to open on schedule with around 20 per cent of their pistes, but others had to postpone their opening days. World Cup races scheduled for Val d’Isère that normally mark the beginning of the European ski season had to be moved to Beaver Creek in Colorado. This time last year, pistes across France - where most UK Alpine sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open. Slope hope: A view from another part of Val D'Isere. World Cup races scheduled for the French resort that normally mark the beginning of the European ski season had to be moved to Beaver Creek in Colorado . Of the 36 resorts on the other side of France - in the Pyrenees - only two, Puigmal and Vallnord, is open. It . is the same in Switzerland, where canons are working overtime to . produce fake snow at Klosters, where only a handful of runs on two out . of five mountains have opened. Last . week the French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, . due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn . which has this year beleaguered the continent. Markus . Unterfinger, a spokesman for the resort, which is popular with both . Prince Charles and Chancellor George Osborne, said: 'It was the driest . November here for 150 years, since records began.' World Cup alpine races at Courchevel Alps ski resort are scheduled for later this month but may still be cancelled due to lack of snow . Although . snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week, a . spokesman for weather institute Meteo France said an 'exceptionally warm . and extremely dry' November included temperatures 2.5C above normal. This . has meant that December - traditionally a busy period on the slopes . when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could . be a wipe out. Snow joke: Just nine out of 12 resorts in France have currently yet to even start their season. With government austerity measures . biting in the UK, the French fear a lack of spare cash will combine with . the poor weather to stop people travelling for last-minute breaks too. In . the meantime, those who have already booked will be checking travel . insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because . of the lack of snow. Most policies pay out nominal fee if . there is no snow, but only if every ski lift is shut down. Resorts are . known to keep one lift open at all times, no matter how poor the snow . cover, to stop this happening. Some 400,000 British people travel to France to ski every season, with 250,000 heading for Austria, and 150,000 to Italy. Only around 75,000 go to Switzerland, but these tend to be richer holidaymakers, making the market an extremely lucrative one. If . conditions stay as they are, then many of them are expected to switch . to skiing holidays in the USA, where conditions are currently far better . than in Europe. Despite . the gloom, a spokeswoman for the Ski Club of Great Britain, said: 'There . is a lack of snow cover lower down in the Alps but snow is forecast . over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions. Slopes which are normally thick with snow at this time of year have been barren and brown due to the snow shortage .","Up to 30cm finally falls over France, Switzerland and Austria .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 2:46 PM on 6th December 2011 . Prison: Dental nurse Leonora Sinclair, 50, who was jailed for 10 years . A dental nurse was jailed for 10 years today for killing her husband in a row over what to watch on television. Leonora Sinclair, 50, wanted to see Harry Hill’s TV Burp while 73-year-old Lloyd insisted on viewing football. As the row escalated, Mr Sinclair, who had been married for only 10 months, lay bleeding to death in the hallway of their semi-detached home. Sinclair, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in October, but cleared of murder. Mr Sinclair, who was a driver for a church care centre, was frightened of his wife, who had attacked him on previous occasions. On the afternoon of Saturday, January 15, she texted a friend: 'I am watching Steel Magnolias and getting pissed on wine while Lloyd makes the dinner. LOL.' Later they argued about what to watch and Mr Sinclair was fatally stabbed with a large kitchen knife in the back of his left thigh. Pc Gillian Bills said drunken Sinclair told her on the way to hospital: 'We had an argument about what to watch on TV. 'He wanted to watch football and I wanted to watch Harry Hill.' Sinclair, who had been married twice before, denied stabbing her husband. She agreed she had claimed he was injured by falling on a broken wine glass, but said it was in panic. Judge Stephen Kramer told her: 'I am satisfied you are a domineering person - particularly when you have taken drink.' She had robbed Mr Sinclair’s family and friends of 'much loved and respected man'. Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, said Sinclair had set up a 'sham, bogus scene' while her husband was dying. Sinclair said Mr Sinclair must have stabbed himself by accident after he got her into a headlock and they struggled. Row: Leonora Sinclair, 50, wanted to see Harry Hill's TV Burp, pictured, while 73-year-old Lloyd insisted on viewing football . She said: 'He put on Sky Sports and I said I wanted to watch Harry Hill. 'He . got annoyed, he threw his glass down and he said ‘I pay for the TV, I . pay for Sky and you’re telling me what I can watch’? I put Harry Hill on . and he has gone berserk.' She sobbed: 'I didn’t stab Lloyd. I did everything possible to save my husband’s life. 'I treated my husband with respect and dignity. I loved my husband. 'I miss my husband - there are certain things on television at the moment which we used to watch together. I can’t watch these things now.' She added: 'Lloyd usually got home before me so he would cook dinner for us every day. 'Then he would watch TV while I did laundry or housekeeping. 'Lloyd bought me a computer for Christmas. He said I could watch EastEnders on the computer. 'I didn’t really watch telly that much. Lloyd loved telly. He liked Sky Sports. He liked football and cricket.' She said they were introduced in May 2008 and found an attraction despite being 'like chalk and cheese'. She added: 'We used to go out every evening. We’d go on holiday and trips. We had fun.' The court heard there were rows about money after they wed as her wages were paid into an account controlled by her husband. Mr Sinclair, who was a driver for a church care centre, was frightened of his wife, who had attacked him on previous occasions. Their Enfield home is pictured . However the prosecution said it was Sinclair who had been violent and friends and family had noticed injuries. Miss Cheema said: 'She found an element of enjoyment in humiliating him. 'Lloyd’s friends and family noticed that Leonora Sinclair was prone to bouts of melodrama and selfishness. 'Lloyd would come to work bearing signs of physical injury including bruising to his face. 'When asked about them he would frankly admit they had been caused by Leonora.' In September last year, Mr Sinclair called police because he said she had 'gone crazy'. Officers found her in a locked bedroom with a knife, said Miss Cheema. Mr Sinclair, who divorced his first wife some years earlier and had four grown-up children, had told his son Vincent that Leonora had broken his arm. Work colleague Ahmed Youseff told the court he saw Mr Sinclair limping and with facial bruising. He said: 'I lost count of the number of injuries. He always had an injury.' Monica Thompson, pastor of the Ministry of Praise in Tottenham, said she had been a friend of 'Brother Lloydy' for many years. He was a deacon and would drive others to help feed people on the street. She said he was a 'very charming, easy-going person' who had put four children through university. She used to ride with him to church on Sundays but stopped because of the violent rows she witnessed between the couple in the car. The final straw came when she saw Sinclair beating Lloyd up outside her home. She said: 'He was very calm as usual while she was raging at him. I got the impression he was afraid of her. 'His face was swollen up after that. She was hitting him in his face and everywhere. He was quite shocked.' Mr Sinclair’s son Vincent said his father told him: 'She keeps hitting me.' He was upset and his face was scratched. Family friend Sonia Grieves told police that two years before his death she had witnessed Sinclair ordering her husband out of the house to buy her wine and cigarettes. She said she saw Sinclair kick him out of the door.","Leonora Sinclair was found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of murder .

When Luke Armstrong got his first girlfriend it was understandable that he wanted to spend every possible moment talking to her. But sadly Luke soon learned that love comes at a price -  £912 to be exact. The 14-year-old left his mother Julie Muller stunned after running up the staggering amount in his phone bill for just one month. Ms Muller, who says she has forgiven . her son, has now called on mobile phone companies to prevent the problem . by creating spending limits. Luke, . who goes to Oasis Academy in Chadderton, Oldham, Greater Manchester, . went over his 300-minute allowance last month - increasing his bill from . the usual £28 a month to more than £900. His mother says phone company O2, who the contract is with, should have registered the usage as 'out of the ordinary'. Ms Muller, from Moston, also thinks mobile companies should send warnings when the bill gets close to the limit. She . said: 'Luke got a girlfriend and was using the phone in the middle of . the night and at lunch times at school to talk to her. It is quite sweet . but when I realised what the bill was I nearly had a heart attack. 'I think it’s shocking that companies like 02 don’t give you a warning when you get close to the allowance. Luke's mother Julie Muller (pictured) said O2 should have warned him when he was over his monthly limit . 'They do it with data usage - like the . internet - and I just don’t understand why they don’t let you know that . you are running up a bill.' Ms Muller said that, in the three years . that Luke has had his phone, he has only gone over his allowance once, . and then only by about £10. Phone giant O2 has asked Ms Muller to pay £168 a month to clear the debt . She added: 'He’s never done anything like this before and has been a really responsible kid. 'Both Luke and I thought there was a warning text or phone call to ensure he didn’t breach his allowances.' O2 have now asked Ms Muller to pay £168 a month to clear the debt. and have blocked the use of the phone until the bill is paid off. She said: 'I just can’t believe they have shown so little understanding in this matter.' A spokesman for O2 said: 'Many parents prefer to provide their children with Pay & Go phones which give them more control over the bills. 'We have a wide range of tariffs to suit different usage levels and customer’s can change these to suit their individual circumstances.'","Luke Armstrong is on £28-a-month O2 contract .

Guilty: Michael Barrymore, pictured arriving at court today, told the police officer: 'don't you think I've had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years' Entertainer Michael Barrymore tried to hide a stash of cocaine in his mouth after drunkenly telling police 'don't you think I've had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years, I know the law', a court heard today. The entertainer, 59, was found by police after his Citroen DS hit a kerb in Acton, west London, and he launched into a foul-mouthed verbal attack as they tried to question him about who was driving. Police discovered the damaged vehicle while on a routine patrol with Barrymore - real name Michael Parker - and another man standing by it. He was arrested after abusing the officers - and then tried to hide a stash of cocaine in his mouth at a police station, Ealing Magistrates Court heard. The entertainer was fined £680 for possessing the Class A drug, ordered to pay £100 costs  and a £15 victim surcharge. A second charge, of being drunk and disorderly, was withdrawn. He was held by the officers on November 22 at 4.30am. Prosecutor Sally Peters said: 'The Citroen was a hired vehicle registered to Mr Parker. 'Therefore they went to speak to him to see if he had any knowledge of the driver of the vehicle. He was asked and he said ""I am not answering you."" 'It was then noted that he smelt strongly of alcohol. He then proceeded to be very abusive towards officers and told them, ""don't you think I have had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years, I know the law"".' The television star was arrested and taken to a police custody suite where he was seen trying to hide a white substance in his mouth. Ms Peters added: 'He refused to spit it out. He was then stripped searched and a rock of white power was found in his pocket. Mr Parker tested positive for cocaine.' Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and maroon tie, the star appeared shaky as he sat in the dock at Ealing Magistrates Court, looking nervously towards the gathered press and fumbling with the front of his suit jacket. Earlier, the hearing was briefly adjourned after Barrymore's lawyer objected to his address being read out in court, citing 'intense attention' surrounding his client. Magistrates declined permission for the address to be withheld however, and Richard Gowthorpe gave it as Fleet Street in central London. Explaining their refusal to allow the address to be withheld, Chair of the Bench Moira Edmonds said: 'We won't be guided by any sort of sympathy for well-being.' Mr Gowthrope said only a 'very small amount' of cocaine was involved and added that the entertainer had apologised to police for his behaviour. Cocaine user: Barrymore, 59, who was on Class A drugs when he was arrested, was fined £780 by Ealing Magistrates today . While he now had a criminal conviction, his client had entered the court a man of good character, he noted. 'In many ways it's a sad day for Mr Parker to be before the courts and he's pleaded guilty to this offence,' he said. 'Certainly he will be punished to a degree by the conviction itself.' Barrymore had urged his lawyer to . point out that the evening in question had been 'exceptional' and that . 'there was an exceptional set of circumstances' at the time, Mr . Gowthorpe added. 'This behaviour is wholly out of character. This is not part of a general lifestyle that Mr Parker is living. 'He's addressing the problem, he's addressing the temptation and there's no present drug use.' Andrew de Cruze, from the Drugs Intervention Team, said that Barrymore had come to see them. 'Mr Parker did take the opportunity to come voluntarily,' he said. Accident: Barrymore, 59, is pictured getting into his Citroen car which had crashed into a kerb in Acton, west London. He refused to tell police who was driving . 'Since his arrest he has attended regularly. He has been very open with the team whilst being with them and has been honest about his circumstances. He has made good progress.' He added that Barrymore was undergoing a cognitive behaviour therapy programme which 'is something Mr Parker has fond very helpful and he feels willing to engage in that process. 'He is also addressing the use of alcohol by attending meetings.' Mr Gowthorpe added: 'Perhaps in a degree we are all flawed and Mr Parker is no exception. With the help of his family and friends he is progressing.' Once one of Britain's highest-paid small screen stars, Barrymore has had a controversial career. In the early 1980s, shows such as Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People attracted up to 13 million viewers and made him one of the best-known faces on TV, with a pay packet to match. But in 1995 he announced he was gay and split from Cheryl, his manager and wife of 19 years, and his career foundered. Less than a decade later, in 2004, the former Butlins Red Coat filed for bankruptcy. More recently, he appeared on TV as a housemate on Celebrity Big Brother. Public reaction to his appearance in 2006 was mixed but he was popular enough with viewers to take second place behind 'spoof' celebrity Chantelle Houghton.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:23 AM on 8th December 2011 . Unwell: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, 56, suffered a 'mild heart attack' Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari was being treated in a Dubai hospital last night amid rumours he was on the verge of being forced to step down by the country’s military. Zardari was said to have suffered a ‘minor heart attack’, according to a spokesman in Pakistan. Officials had earlier claimed that the 56-year-old had gone to the Arab state for treatment for an existing heart condition, angina. In London, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Britain, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said he spoke over the telephone to Zardari on Tuesday night in Dubai. Hasan said doctors in the UAE confirmed Zardari has angina, but it wasn’t clear yet whether he had suffered a heart attack. ‘Whatever the case, he has no immediate plans to step down,’ he added. News that he had travelled to Dubai provoked speculation in Pakistan that Zardari may use ill health as a pretext for stepping down under pressure from the country’s powerful military. The Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. was recently forced to resign after allegations he sent a memo to Washington asking for its help in reining in the generals in Islamabad. This has intensified pressure on Zardari, president for three years, who has many enemies in the media and political elite. Denial: Mr Zardari standing in front of a portrait of his late wife Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007 . The Washington-based Foreign Policy . magazine quoted an unnamed former U.S. government official as saying . Zardari was ‘incoherent’ when he spoke with President Barack Obama by . telephone over the weekend. The official said Zardari may resign on account of ‘ill health’ amid the uproar over the memo. His spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said: ‘All these reports are untrue, imaginary and speculative.’ The president’s condition was ‘not serious’ and he would return to Pakistan soon, he added . There are several reasons Mr Zardari could be feeling the strain, however. Tensions: Pakistan is under pressure from the West to contain militant insurgents in its borderland region and relations with the U.S. and India are strained . Tensions between the government and military have plagued the country for almost its entire existence, with the military ruling the country for more than half of its 64-year history. Relations with the U.S. have also hit rock bottom after a year of bust-ups, despite the $20billion in security and economic aid given to Pakistan since 2001 - much of it reimbursements for assistance in fighting militants. First there was the jailing of a CIA contractor for shooting dead two Pakistanis in Lahore. Then there was the secret U.S. Navy Seals raid inside Pakistan that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, as well as accusations from the U.S. that Pakistan was involved in attacked on American targets in Afghanistan. Ties were also further split by a Nato air strike on November 26 on two border posts that killed 24 soldiers, infuriating the Pakistan military. And concerns have been raised over the possibility of conflict between Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region, with neither side willing to back down.",Army is said to be on the verge of forcing Asif Ali Zardari to step down .

A father who killed his toddler son because he was crying was jailed for nine years today. Nathan Allen brought both fists down on 14-month-old Fletcher's abdomen as he lay in his cot. The youngster died in January from internal bleeding and damaged kidneys. Allen, 27, of Romford, Essex, was jailed for manslaughter at the Old Bailey after a jury cleared him of murder. Allen had been left with the boy for less than 30 minutes while his partner Danielle Hands, 19, went to see her family. The Common Sergeant of London Judge Brian Barker said Fletcher was suffering from nappy rash. He told Allen: 'Your reaction was aggressive and extreme. You will have to live with your actions for the rest of your life. 'This was a terrible act and you must take responsibility for your actions.' The judge said he did not fully accept Allen's explanation of events because the boy had extensive bruising on his face and abdomen. Allen denied hurting his son after the incident but admitted manslaughter at the start of his trial. In cross-examination, Allen demonstrated hitting the toddler with his two clenched fists in a downward motion. Allen said he hit Fletcher as he lay in his cot because he would not stop crying. Crime scene: Police outside the ground floor flat where Allen lived with his 14-month-old boy, shortly after his death . Sentence: Allen was jailed for manslaughter at the Old Bailey (pictured) after a jury cleared him of murder . He said: 'He was screaming and clinging to my arm. 'I hit him twice in the stomach.

'I'm sorry for what I've done, I'm so sorry for what I did to him.' He added: 'I just didn't know what to do, I was beside myself. I was frustrated with myself - my son was crying, I've never seen him cry like that. 'Fletcher was so happy and for me to see him like that, I felt like I was doing something wrong.'

The UK would not treat a dog as badly as it treated a woman who was forced to spend her final hours away from home after travelling to Switzerland to die, former BBC Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross said today. Former TV producer Geraldine McClelland, 61, who was diagnosed with lung and liver cancer, called for a change to the law after travelling to a Dignitas clinic in Zurich where she died yesterday. In a letter published hours after her death, Ms McClelland said she was not sad, but 'angry that because of the cowardice of our politicians I can't die in the country I was born in, in my own home'. Scroll down for video . Presenter Nick Ross, who was friends with Ms McClelland after working on Crimewatch with her, said: 'Like Gerry, I take it to be self-evident that people facing imminent death should be allowed to manage the means and time of their departure' Baroness Finlay (right) from pressure group . Living And Dying Well said 'this is a very sad story' but added: 'There . was no reason why this lady could not die at home with her family around . her, especially as Britain has internationally renowned palliative . care.' The professor of palliative medicine at Cardiff University said: The law we have has a stern face but an understanding heart. 'Parliament has examined this subject . in considerable depth, including the few jurisdictions where these . practices have been legalised, and has concluded that legalisation is . incompatible with protecting the public and especially its more . vulnerable members.' Peter Saunders of Care Not Killing said publicity surrounding Miss McClelland's death were a carefully orchestrated move in collaboration with the pro-euthanasia lobby. Care Not Killing, an alliance made up of human rights groups, disability rights organisations and palliative care groups, said coverage of her plight 'plays into the hands of pro euthanasia campaigners to whip up public support for a new assault on the Suicide Act ahead of the publication of the controversial Falconer Commission report in the New Year’. He added: ‘British parliamentarians have repeatedly considered and debated these issues and have three times in the last five years rejected the legalisation of assisted suicide on grounds of public safety. 'They have rightly recognized that any change in the law would simply place more pressure on vulnerable people – those who are disabled, elderly, sick or depressed - to end their lives so as not to be a burden on carers, relatives or the state. Such a move would also be a green light to would-be abusers who have a financial or emotional interest in their deaths. '‘Our priority at this time should instead be to resist any further weakening of the law and to make the very best palliative care, in which Britain is a world leader, more widely accessible and available so that patients can die as comfortably as possible at home or in hospital without fear.’ Ross, who was friends with Ms McClelland after working with her on Crimewatch, said: 'We wouldn't treat a dog so badly. He said: 'Like Gerry, I take it to be self-evident that people facing imminent death should be allowed to manage the means and time of their departure. 'Yet Britain is so primitive and dichotomist in its thinking that suicide is only acceptable when one has what is normally a transient motive like depression. 'It is legal when able-bodied but not when someone is so ill they need assistance.' In a defiant letter released hours after her death, Ms McClelland made a passionate plea for a change to British law to allow assisted suicide for the terminally ill. Miss McClelland wrote: ‘I am not sad . that I will die today. I am angry that because of the cowardice of our . politicians I can’t die in the country I was born in, in my own home.’ The . former producer of the BBC’s consumer affairs programme Watchdog . attacked the law which would have made it illegal for her family to help . her to die in this country. Assisted . suicide is a criminal offence in England and Wales, although new . guidelines allow prosecutors to waive criminal proceedings if they . believe families were acting out of genuine compassion. Baroness Finlay from pressure group Living And Dying Well said 'this is a very sad story' but added: 'There was no reason why this lady could not die at home with her family around her, especially as Britain has internationally renowned palliative care.' The professor of palliative medicine at Cardiff University said: The law we have has a stern face but an understanding heart. 'Parliament has examined this subject in considerable depth, including the few jurisdictions where these practices have been legalised, and has concluded that legalisation is incompatible with protecting the public and especially its more vulnerable members.' In Miss McClelland's open . letter, which was published in accordance with her wishes, she said: ‘I have chosen to travel abroad to die because I cannot . have the death I want here in the UK.’ She . said that she would have liked to have been able to choose to end her . life ‘at home, with my family and friends around me’, but the law . prevented her from doing so. Miss McClelland was understood to have died . in Zurich yesterday with her brother and sister at her bedside. She was diagnosed with terminal cancer . after the disease spread from her breast to her lungs and liver two . years ago. The lung cancer caused serious breathing problems and meant . she was rarely able to leave her flat in White City, West London. Writing for the Dignity in Dying blog, Nick Ross added: 'It sometimes seems that each concession to freedom in this country has had to be dragged out of a reluctant and controlling instinct that someone else knows best.' Ross acknowledged the need for strong protections, but said: 'The principle is clear: self-determination is at the core of any concept of human rights. Just as no doctor or nurse should be obliged to have a hand in something they find morally objectionable, so no brave soul like Gerry should be abandoned to die at the choosing and timing of uncontrollable cancer.' He went on: 'Never let organised religion be a trump card to imprison free spirits like Gerry in its own dogmas. 'No, bishops and legislators have no call to criticise Gerry. Rather they should heed her, set moral cowardice aside and make death for people like her more humane. 'I and others who knew Gerry won't rest until that day comes - and, of course, it will come. 'Meanwhile it is a dismal reflection on political slothfulness and lack of courage that thousands more Britons like Geraldine McClelland - unless they all slink off secretly to Dignitas as she did - will be deprived of a decent death.' Deathbed letter: Geraldine McClelland ended her life at the controversial Dignitas clinic near Zurich, Switzerland, as she entered the final stages of her cancer battle . Miss McClelland, who also worked on programmes including Crimewatch, Food and Drink and Health Check, decided to travel abroad to die in September. She said she was relatively lucky because she could afford the clinic’s fees and could travel. She urged readers of her letter not to feel sorry for her, but to ‘turn it into a fight to change the law’. Sheilagh Matheson, a life-long friend of Miss McClelland paid tribute to the ‘very independent, very determined’ woman. The 60-year-old, from Northumberland, said: ‘She didn’t want to endure the physical degradation that she knew she would suffer. ‘It was not a spur-of-the moment . decision. It was something she had thought about for many, many years.’ Miss McClelland’s letter was circulated by the Dignity in Dying campaign . group, which wants a change in the law. Assisting suicide carries a maximum . sentence of 14 years in prison, although there have been no prosecutions . since new guidelines were introduced last February, despite more than . 40 cases being considered by prosecutors. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC said the motives of those assisting suicide would be at the centre of decisions over whether they should be prosecuted. His intervention came after right-to-die campaigner Debbie Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis, took her case to the Supreme Court, after the High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled it was for Parliament, not the courts, to change the law. Campaigners for a change in the law say the guidelines do not go far enough but critics warn the guidelines risk creating ‘legislation by stealth’, which could put the elderly, sick and disabled at greater risk.","Crimewatch presenter worked with Geraldine McClelland who ended her life at Swiss clinic .

In laboratory tests, scientists showed that blocking the protein, periostin, prevented the formation of secondary cancers. Rather than focusing on cancer cells themselves, the researchers in Switzerland looked at the environment around tumours. Preventative: Scientists found that the protein, periostin stopped the formation of secondary cancers. Picture of a human cancer cell . They found several conditions necessary for 'metastatic' - or spreading - cancer to propagate. 'In particular, we were able to isolate a protein, periostin, in the niches where metastases develop,' said study leader Dr Joerg Huelsken, from the Swiss Centre for Experimental Cancer Research in Lausanne. 'Without this protein, the cancer stem cell cannot initiate metastasis; instead, it disappears or remains dormant.' The research is published today in an early online edition of the journal Nature. Periostin exists naturally in the . 'extracellular matrix', the connective tissue filling the gaps between . cells. It has been shown to play a role in foetal development. In adults, it is only active in specific parts of the body such as the mammary glands, bones, skin and intestine. Deadly: Most cancer deaths are caused by 'metastatic' spread to vital organs such as the liver or brain . The scientists showed that mice bred to lack periostin avoided metastatic cancer. They went on to develop an antibody that attaches to the protein, rendering it dysfunctional. 'We are hoping in this way to be able to block the process of metastasis formation,' said Dr Huelsken. Very few side effects were seen in the treated mice, but Dr Huelsken cautioned: 'This doesn't necessarily mean the same will hold true in humans. 'We're not even sure that we'll be able to find an equivalent antibody that will work in humans.' Most cancer deaths are caused by metastatic spread to vital organs such as the liver or brain.","Swiss scientists showed blocking the protein, periostin, prevented formation of secondary cancers ."

An international plot to smuggle one of Colonel Gaddafi’s sons into Mexico for a life of luxury with his family has been foiled, officials said yesterday. The plan, which involved Mexican and Danish conspirators and was led by a Canadian woman, was to spirit Saadi Gaddafi into the country after he fled Libya in September. The plotters flew to Mexico, opened bank accounts with forged ID papers, and bought safe houses around the country. The main home was a villa in an exclusive area of the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta, which is popular with both British and U.S. tourists. His neighbours would have included the likes of Lady Gaga and Charlie Sheen. Gary Peters, boss of a Canadian private security company, said he was involved in the operation and visited the villa twice. Playboy businessman Saadi, his wife . and children would have been flown over on private planes and protected . by security men hired by Mr Peters for £650 a day. The plot was foiled when ringleader, . Canadian Cynthia Vanier,  and other conspirators were arrested. Vanier . was said to be ‘the direct contact with the Gaddafi family’. Scheme: Al-Saadi fled Libya after the ousting of his father, pictured. The plotters allegedly jetted into Mexico, opened bank accounts and bought properties meant to be used as safe houses in several parts of the country . Saadi, 38, Gaddafi’s third son, is . living in the West African nation of Niger. The UN has frozen his assets . and banned him from crossing international borders. Interpol is seeking . his extradition while Libya’s new leaders accuse him of theft and . ‘armed intimidation’ while running the Libyan football federation. Niger has said he would remain in the West African nation until a United Nations travel ban is lifted. The plotters themselves used a . network of flights between Mexico, the United States, Canada, Kosovo and . the Middle East to plan the route and organize the logistics for Saadi . Gaddafi's arrival, Mr Poire said. 'The . large economic resources which this criminal organization has, or had, . allowed them to contract private flights,' Poire told a news conference. Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi . But the suspects were arrested after a tip-off. 'The (authorities) succeeded in avoiding this risk, they dismantled the international criminal network which was attempting this and they arrested those presumed responsible,' Poire said. Mr Poire said Ms Vanier ‘was the direct contact with the Gaddafi family and . the leader of the group, and presumably was the person in charge of the . finances of the operation.’ An employee of Canada's foreign ministry said the office would look into the report of the arrest but had no immediate comment. The plot also allegedly involved a Mexican woman, Gabriela Davila Huerta, also known as de Cueto. She lived in the United States and served as the liaison to obtain the falsified Mexican identity documents. She was arrested alongside fellow Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto. Pierre Christian Flensborg, from Denmark, was ‘the logistic liaison’ for the plan. Mr Poire said: ‘The activities of the . criminal organisation in our country included the falsification of . official documents, the opening of bank accounts with false documents, . the purchase of real estate that were intended, among other things, to . serve as a residence for the Gaddafi family.’ Puerto Vallarta: The plotters had bought Mr Gaddafi property near this popular tourist destination on Mexico's Pacific coast . Saadi Gaddafi's lawyer Nick Kaufman said his client was still in Niger, where he fled as his father's 42-year rule crumbled in August. ‘He is fully respecting the restraints placed on him presently by the international community,’ Kaufman told Reuters. Like many senior members of the Gaddafi regime, Saadi, a businessman and former professional soccer player, was banned from traveling and had his assets frozen by a U.N. Security Council resolution when violence erupted earlier this year. Interpol has issued a ‘red notice’ requesting member states to arrest Saadi with a view to extradition if they find him in their territory.","Mexican government claims to have broken plot to smuggle Gaddafi's son's family .

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 4:34 PM on 6th December 2011 . The nation’s benefits bill jumped by more than £4billion last year with some areas claiming seven times more in handouts than others. The total cost was £121billion, according to figures from the Department for Work and Pensions – up from £116.7billion in 2009/10. After pension costs are stripped out, Knowsley in Merseyside emerges as the ‘benefits capital’ of Britain. Biggest bill: Kowsley (pictured) in Merseyside is the 'benefits capital' of Britain after amassing £146million in claims last year . Lowest cost: Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Western Isles (pictured), off Scotland, received just £20.1million in hand-outs . Last year people in the constituency pocketed £146million in benefits, mostly relating to unemployment and disability. The handouts are equal to £1,842 for every adult in the borough, which is one of Labour’s safest seats. The figures do not include housing benefit, which would drive the total bill far higher. Half of the ten constituencies with the highest benefits bills were on Merseyside, with another two in Glasgow. The Knowsley total is more than seven times the amount claimed by residents of the Western isles, off Scotland. The lowest benefits bill on the mainland was in North East Hampshire, where residents claimed £25.6million. The figure is equal to £352.86 for every adult in the constituency, which is a safe Tory seat. Most of the areas with the lowest levels of benefits claims were leafy suburbs in the South of England. Employment . minister Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures show how important the . Government reforms are through initiatives like our new Work Programme, . the benefit cap and Universal Credit. We are building a system that is . much more fit for purpose.’ The figures underline the difficulty ministers have faced in trying to trim the welfare state at a time of austerity. Rising . unemployment has led to a surge in benefit claims, while efforts to get . millions of people on incapacity benefits back into work are still in . the foothills. More than five million people of working age are now on out-of-work benefits. The figures, which were released to Parliament last night, will also increase Coalition tensions over last week’s decision to raise benefits by 5.2 per cent next year. Many Tory MPs are furious at the move, which contrasts sharply with a freeze in working tax credits and a 1per cent pay cap on workers in the public sector. Critics say it undermines the Government’s pledge to ‘make work pay’ and undermines the incentive for the unemployed to take a job. The bumper increase in benefits was demanded by the Liberal Democrats as part of the price for supporting George Osborne’s  growth plan.","Residents in Knowsley, Merseyside, claimed the most...

A woman whose husband died after being locked in a store cupboard in a burning building has admitted his killing on the second day of her murder trial. Julie Dixon had originally denied killing popular businessman David Twigg, 46, during a fire at a workshop in Burgh Le Marsh, Lincolnshire in March last year. But yesterday afternoon, on the second . day of her trial at Lincoln Crown Court, she admitted killing him, a . spokeswoman for Lincolnshire Police said. Killer: Julie Dixon has admitted murdering David Twigg after he died in a fire at a workshop after she locked him in a cupboard . Dixon had previously told police that the couple were attacked by masked intruders at Mr Twigg's bespoke joinery business. She later changed her story and told police her partner had died following a failed joint suicide pact on March 13 at Mr Twigg's workshop. Following the plea change, Dixon will now appear at the court for a Newton hearing. A Newton hearing occurs when the defendant has pleaded guilty to the offence, but on the basis of a different version of facts from that of the prosecution. Mr Twigg died after inhaling smoke from the intense fire at the workshop, which was located next to his home. The court had previously heard that 43-year-old Ms Dixon had concealed huge debts and eventual bankruptcy from Mr Twigg. She was responsible for looking after the books and paperwork at the couple's joinery business which Mr Twigg had worked 'tirelessly' to make a success. When the business began to fail she kept the full extent of the problems from him, the court heard. After her arrest on suspicion of murder in June prosecutor Gordon Aspden said she gave a statement to police in which she said she and Mr Twigg had formulated a joint suicide pact but she had lost her nerve at the last moment when the fire started.",Julie Dixon admits killing David Twigg in fire at couple's joinery workshop .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 8:45 PM on 8th December 2011 . When her son told her he was gay, she describes it as a moment which 'shattered her dreams for a moment'. Little did Jane Clementi realise that less than a month later, her life would be shattered by the news her son threw himself off the George Washington Bridge after being subjected to homophobic bullying. Tyler Clementi, 18, committed suicide on 22 September, 2010. Three days earlier, his Rutgers roommate Dharun Ravi, 19, allegedly used a webcam to watch Tyler kissing another man in their dorm room and streamed it live in an incident that shocked the nation. Devastated: Joe Clementi and his wife, Jane, right, faced their late son's former roommate for the first time in May . Needless death: Tyler Clementi killed himself after he learned his tryst with another man was allegedly caught on a webcam . As Ravi awaits trial in February, Tyler's parents have broken their silence for the first time over the death of the son they adored and the hopes they have for his legacy. Speaking to People magazine, his mother Jane, 53, said: 'It wouldn't be fair to Tyler's memory to let this slide. Something good has to come out of this terrible situation.' She said neither she or her husband Joe had an inkling their son was gay until they told him, and actually had suspicions about their other son James. Accused: Dharun Ravi, centre right, is seen during his hearing in the webcam-spying case involving the suicide of Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi . Grieving: Tyler told his friend about coming out to his parents, Joe and Molly Clementi, saying his mum had rejected him . When Tyler - a skilled violist - told . his mother about his sexuality and that he was 'tired of living a lie' just a few days before leaving for his freshman year at New Jersey's . Rutger's University, she said she was stunned. 'We . talked for a while, hugged for a while, cried together. I told him how . much I loved him and he told me how much he loved me.' Internet chats and texts released in the criminal case paint a different picture, as Tyler had wrote to a friend about coming out: 'Mom has basically completely rejected me.' But Mrs Clementi said this was not true. 'I told him I needed time. You have dreams for your children, and when someone tells you this, your dreams are kind of shattered for that moment. 'I was processing it, but cutting him out of my life was never a possibility.' Sweeping changes: Rutgers University has announced it will allow men and women to share rooms to make the campus more inclusive for gay students . Ravi has pleaded not guilty to the 15 . charges against him, which include four counts of bias intimidation, a . hate crime. His lawyer insists he never bullied Tyler or was in any way . biased towards him. Mrs Clementi remembers the day Tyler moved into the dorm with Ravi, telling People: 'He wouldn't even look at Tyler'. His dad Joe said: 'I didn't think anything of it at the time. In retrospect i wonder.' According to court documents, Ravi had already discovered through the internet that his roommate was gay and posted on his Twitter account in August: 'Found out my roommate is gay,' and linked to a thread that Tyler is . believed to have posted on a gay community chat room. Then on September 19, according to Twitter archives stored by Google, . he tweeted again: 'Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went . into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a . dude. Yay.' This was the night that is believed to have led Tyler to kill himself. Accused: Dharun Ravi, left, and Molly Wei, have both left the university . Talented: Tyler Clementi was a gifted violinist. His death has served as a rallying point for anti-bullying and gay rights campaigners . Molly Wei, whose computer Ravi . allegedly used, will avoid prosecution if she completes 300 hours of . community service and testifies against Ravi in his trial. The Clementis say they are not sure . how they feel about her, telling People: 'I'm glad she agreed to help . the prosecution. I still haven't heard an apology though.' They are not seeking revenge for . their son's death, as Mr Clementi says he does not believe a just . outcome requires maximum penalties. Mrs Clementi said: 'Remorse would be nice. It's hard to forgive someone who doesn't think he did anything wrong.' Since his death, his parents have set . up a foundation in his name - thetylerclementifoundation.org - which . offers grants to programmes that deal  with gay teens, suicide . prevention and bullying.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:48 PM on 8th December 2011 . Six years ago this man met a woman in a bookshop - and the encounter ended up changing his life. As a result in that chance meeting, Phillip Miner, of Provo, Utah, went on to travel to Lusaka, Zambia, to model as Jesus Christ - and during his time out there he found the Saviour himself. While in Africa he also met Kathy Headlee, a single mother of five from Cedar Hills, Utah. They ended up marrying and merging their families - her five children and his two sons. Awakening: Phillip Miner, of Provo, Utah, travelled to Lusaka, Zambia, to model as Jesus Christ, and while he was out there he found the Saviour himself . Happy kids: Mr Miner flew out to Africa to an orphanage for children whose parents had died of AIDS . Jumping for joy: The children were overwhelmed and tearful at Mr Miner's appearance among them . Mr Miner’s story began in a Border’s store in 2005 when he was mistaken as another model used by artist Liz Lemon Swindle, reported the Deseret News. Before then he had left the Mormon church aged 14, got married, became a father aged 19, had another son and divorced his wife. Mr Miner had no interest in religion but a lady who worked with Ms Swindle noticed him in the bookshop and said he could be an understudy for a model of Jesus, named Christopher Crofts. ‘I knew this Jesus guy really didn’t mean anything to me, but I got that he was a big deal in a lot of people’s lives,’ he told the Deseret News, so he decided to help out. Lovely photos: Mr Miner had gone out to Zambia on a photography trip - but he got more than expected . Holding hands: Many of the children photographed had lost their parents to AIDS - or had AIDS themselves . Posing: The idea of the project was for artist Liz Lemon Swindle to capture Mr Miner as if he was Jesus . His big break came when aid organisation Mothers Without Borders asked Ms Swindle if she could create paintings of Jesus interacting with African children - and the charity would take the profits. 'I told one 12-year-old girl that I was there to remind her that Jesus knows and loves her. She started sobbing, weeping and wailing' Phillip Miner . So in 2007 they flew out to Africa to an orphanage for children whose parents had died of AIDS. The children were overwhelmed and tearful at Mr Miner’s appearance among them. ‘I told one 12-year-old girl that I was there to remind her that Jesus knows and loves her,’ he told the Deseret News. ‘She started sobbing, weeping and wailing.’ Then one day in Africa he could not get out of bed, feeling flu-like symptoms, dehydrated and emotionally broken. A young volunteer gave him a blessing in an attempt to make him feel better. Happy couple: During the trip he met Kathy, right, who founded Mothers Without Borders 11 years ago . The family: (left to right) Bottom row: Luke Drake, Mary and Moses Banford (in the giraffe suit); Middle row: Adam Barker, Heather and Wiley Barker (in leopard suit) Phillip Miner, Kathy Headlee Miner, Christopher and Matthew Banford (in the zebra suit); Top row: Carlin Miner, Jackson Miner, Elena Drake, Lizz and Steven Martin . ‘Until then, I was on a paid vacation having some interesting experiences,’ Mr Miner told the Deseret News. ‘Then a stranger laid his hands on my head - it became clear that these weren’t his words.’ 'This Jesus guy is really kind of a big deal to a lot of people. I just happen to be one of those people now' Phillip Miner . It was then that he decided it was time for the actor Jesus Christ to follow the real Jesus Christ. In addition, during the trip he met Kathy, who founded Mothers Without Borders 11 years ago. He went back home and broke up with his girlfriend. Two months later they married and merged their families. ‘I go back to where I started,’ Mr Miner told the Deseret News. ‘This Jesus guy is really kind of a big deal to a lot of people. I just happen to be one of those people now.’","Utah man Phillip Miner went to Africa so artist could paint pictures of Jesus .

Vesta is the second-largest object in the asteroid belt - 320 miles across - and is being probed by a hi-tech robot 'surveyor' that will then move on to its bigger 'sister' asteroid Ceres. New views sent back by the probe, Dawn, this week, reveal an object more like a planet than an asteroid - and scientists say they now consider it a 'transitional body' between the two. The Dawn spacecraft has been beaming back images since July - the latest show a rugged surface is unique compared to the solar system’s much smaller and lightweight asteroids. The latest pictures from Nasa's Dawn probe show that the moon is 'more like a planet' than an asteroid, scientists revealed on Monday . Impact craters dot Vesta’s surface along with grooves, troughs and a variety of minerals. 'Vesta is unlike any other asteroid,' said mission co-scientist . Vishnu Reddy of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in . Germany. The new findings were presented at a meeting of the American . Geophysical Union in San Francisco. This image using color data obtained by the framing camera aboard NASA's Dawn spacecraft shows Vesta's southern hemisphere in color, centered on the Rheasilvia formation - the different colours reflect different minerals in the surface. Rheasilvia is an impact basin measured at about 290 miles (467 kilometers) in diameter with a central mound reaching about 14 miles (23 kilometers) high. The black hole in the middle is data that have been omitted due to the angle between the sun, Vesta and the spacecraft. Most asteroids resemble potatoes, but Vesta is more like an avocado with its iron core, Reddy said. David Williams of Arizona State .

Asteroids are remnants from the birth of the solar system some 4.5 . billion years ago around the same time as the formation of the rocky . planets including Earth.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:14 PM on 7th December 2011 . It's a curious phenomenon that sends Americans abroad to look for work. The U.S. has traditionally skimmed the best minds from around the world in pursuit of the American Dream. According to polling firm Gallup, which surveyed people in 135 nations around the world, the U.S. was the top desired destination of those who wanted to relocate permanently to another country. But with unemployment hovering around nine per cent, the use of food stamps at record highs and the Great Recession continuing to punish the budgets of so many families, the American economy is much less of a magnet. Migration: More Americans than ever are choosing to work abroad because of better prospects and interesting endeavors . To some young entrepreneurs, economic possibilities seem brighter in places like Brazil, Russia, China or Latin America. The State Department now estimates that 6.3million Americans are studying or working abroad, the highest number on record. According to a survey by marketing consultants America Wave, the percentage of Americans aged 25 to 34 actively planning to relocate outside the U.S. has quintupled in just two years, from less than one per cent to 5.1per cent. 'Those numbers have shot through the ceiling,' says America Wave founder Bob Adams, who has run nine such surveys over the years. 'They're very surprising, and not something I anticipated. They're looking for work because of the sluggish economy, and they've lost confidence that the U.S. is going anywhere.' Freedom: Working abroad allows American entrepreneurs and those with technical skills to do their jobs in unconventional ways . Younger Americans seem even keener to look abroad, with 40 per cent of those 18-24 expressing interest in foreign relocation, which is up from 15 per cent two years ago. 'There's a feeling among more entrepreneurial Americans that if you really want to get anything done, you have to get out of country and away from the depressing atmosphere,' says Mr  Adams, who lives in Panama. ‘There’s a sense of lost direction, so more people are looking for locations that offer more hope about the future.' Derek Capo in his early 20s, working as an analyst at hedge fund Everest Capital monitoring international equities, and soaking up the weather and nightlife of his hometown of Miami.

There’s a sense of lost . direction, so more people are looking for locations that offer more hope . about the future.' -Bob Adams . But looking ahead, as he'd been trained to do, Mr Capo didn't like what he saw. The housing bust was starting to strangle the Florida economy, the stock market was looking increasingly erratic and he didn't want to pursue a pricey MBA in the middle of an economic crisis. He also wanted to test his entrepreneurial muscles, by starting his own business, ideally in a locale that felt economically vibrant, with seemingly limitless possibilities.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:40 AM on 7th December 2011 . A 19-year-old man has filed a complaint with state police alleging he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky after the former coach gave him liquor on the Penn State campus in 2004, the accuser's lawyer said Tuesday. Charles Schmidt said the client, whom he did not identify, went to his law firm about three weeks ago, after Sandusky was charged with sexually abusing eight boys over a 15-year period. 'He suffered one incident of abuse, to use the legal term - involuntary deviate sexual intercourse - allegedly at the hands of Mr Sandusky,' Mr Schmidt said. 'That occurred on the Penn State campus, we believe in the area of the football facilities.' Newest complaint: A 19-year-old man stepped forward to accuse Jerry Sandusky (centre) of sexual abuse. He is the ninth to do so . Sandusky's lawyer, Joseph Amendola, said he was unfamiliar with the allegations Mr Schmidt was making. The new claim came the day a lawyer for another young man who accused Sandusky of sexual abuse said he expects his client and at least five other accusers to testify at a preliminary hearing next week. The lawyer said he has information that the six young men whose testimony before a grand jury contributed to a report detailing allegations against Sandusky will be called to testify next Tuesday. Sandusky is charged with 40 counts of child sex abuse, and prosecutors allege he met his victims through a charity he founded in 1977 to help at-risk children, The Second Mile. Sandusky, 67, denies being a paedophile and has vowed to fight the charges. In interviews with NBC and The New York Times, he has said he showered and horsed around with boys but never sexually abused them. The existence of Mr Schmidt's client was first reported by WHP-TV in Harrisburg. Mr Schmidt told the AP that his client was 12 years old, dealing with the death of his mother and suffering emotional issues at the time of the campus incident. The lawyer said the two met through The Second Mile and his client claims Sandusky gave him liquor while in the office on campus. The grand jury report did not allege any instances of Sandusky giving boys alcohol. Schmidt said his law firm is conducting its own investigation into the client's claims. Accused: Sandusky faces 40 counts of sexually abusing minors . 'We hope to have it wrapped up within another week. We believe him to be credible,' Mr Schmidt said. 'Everything that we've been able to unearth since has corroborated what he told us, but we'll continue to do our due diligence.' The preliminary hearing, at which a judge would determine if prosecutors have enough evidence to take the case to trial, could last a day or more since the defence has the right to cross-examine the state's witnesses. The state attorney general's office would not comment on the evidence authorities plan to offer to show probable cause the crimes occurred. Mr Amendola said Tuesday that a police officer witness should not be able to testify in the place of the accusers, based on evidentiary rules that pertain to hearsay. No familiarity: Sandusky's lawyer Joseph Amendola (left) said he was unfamiliar with the newest allegations . 'Our position would be that these people have to testify,' Mr Amendola said. 'And one isn't sufficient, because you have eight separate incidents ... with eight separate alleged victims or accusers.' Prosecutors listed eight victims in the grand jury report but didn't know the identities of two of them when they issued the report in early November. The report said one of those two was a boy seen being sodomized by Sandusky in a Penn State football complex shower in 2002. Mr Amendola has said he believes he knows the identity of the boy in the shower and that the person dined with Sandusky this past summer.Mr Amendola said he's looking forward to questioning the prosecution witnesses - including any accusers. Horsing around: Sandusky denies being a paedophile. He has said he showered and horsed around with boys but never sexually abused them . 'We will, for the very first time, have the opportunity to face Jerry's accusers and question them under oath about their allegations,' he said in a statement Monday. 'We look forward to this opportunity.' Former sex crimes prosecutor Richard DeSipio said prosecutors may have to call the six known accusers for the judge to uphold the 40 counts. Defence lawyers sometimes waive preliminary hearings if they are worried about publicity for their clients, but Mr DeSipio said he is not surprised Mr Amendola is demanding the hearing. 'This is their first and only opportunity before trial to actually see the witnesses ... to hear their tone and demeanour and to question them and see how they respond to questions and also to flush out details,' said DeSipio, who is now a criminal defence lawyer in Philadelphia. Assistant football coach Mike McQueary, who has been identified as the witness to the 2002 shower encounter, could also be called to testify. Mr McQueary's account wasn't immediately brought to the attention of authorities even though high-level people at Penn State apparently were told about an incident in the showers. Full cooperation: Penn State president Rodney Erickson (far left) pledged that investigators will have unfettered access to the school . In the wake of the scandal, the university last month fired coach Joe Paterno and accepted President Graham Spanier's resignation. Paterno has said he wishes he had done more about allegations against Sandusky. Athletic Director Tim Curley has been placed on administrative leave, and Vice President Gary Schultz, who was in charge of the university's police department, has stepped down. Schultz and Curley are charged with lying to the grand jury and failure to report to police. They maintain their innocence. Also Tuesday, Penn State President Rodney Erickson told sceptical faculty members not to worry that school trustees would 'whitewash' their own investigation. Mr Erickson pledged to the University Faculty Senate that investigators will have unfettered access to and cooperation from the school. He said the leadership of a committee checking into the allegations should lend confidence 'that there will be no whitewash ... no sweeping under the rug.'","Accusor, now 19, said he was abused at 12 in 2004 by Sandusky on Penn's campus .

"By . Chris Wheeler and Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:34 PM on 8th December 2011 . Football fans in Manchester may have been downcast last night, but there were a number of TV executives who would have been jumping for joy. United and City's elimination from the Champions League means they have been exiled to the lesser-watched TV backwaters of Channel 5 and ITV4. They, along with ESPN, have the rights to the Europa League, the competition in which the Premier League's top two teams will now be competing. And executives at the channels will be now be looking froward to a boost in viewers of their Thursday night football coverage of Europe's second-tier competition. Fulham's defeat in the Europa League final in 2010 was watched by 4.715million viewers on Channel 5; the ITV audience for Manchester United's Champions League final appearance this May peaked at 11million. Out: Last year's runners-up Manchester United will play in the Europa League . Not this year: Manchester City's first year in the Champions League ended at the group stages . Manchester United fans were not amused as Channel 5 posted a message on Twitter welcoming their team to the Europe League within minutes of the final whistle last night. The Channel 5 press office tweeted: 'A warm welcome to Manchester United to the C5 team ... £europaleague' at 10pm as Reds fans were still coming to terms with the humiliation of being dumped out of the Champions League. But the tweet did not go down well with United fans. One fan wrote on Twitter: 'Are Channel 5 trying to take the p***?' while another supporter, . Darren Hoban, added : 'Sarcastic f******* t*****' and Sohail Khan wrote: 'Worst tweet ever'. Other United fans suggested that they would not be tuning in to see the coverage. One wrote: 'we're still not going to watch your crap channel!!' and Kris Knox added: 'as if we need another reason to avoid ch5'. Channel 5 has enjoyed some of its biggest-ever ratings for Europa League matches, with audiences of over 2 million viewers for some games. It will also be good news for football . fans who don't have Sky, which has near-exclusive rights to the elite . competition, as they will now be able to follow closely follow the two . clubs' European fortunes. However, the prospect is not one the players are as willing to embrace. United defender Patrice Evra said: 'It's embarrassing to be in the Europa League.' Evra added: 'I'm not ready for it and . the way I feel now it's Champions League or nothing. It feels like a . dream. I feel I'll wake up tomorrow and we will have qualified. 'But it's not a dream, it's the . reality and we should have woken up earlier. We haven't been . professional from the beginning of this competition.' Sir Alex Ferguson's team suffered a shock 2-1 defeat in Switzerland, meaning United, last year's beaten finalists, failed to progress to the knockout stages of the competition for the first time since 2005-06 season. And despite a convincing 2-0 win at home to Bayern Munich, City went out as they needed to better Napoli's result - but the Italians won by the same scoreline in Villarreal. United only needed to avoid defeat but Marco Streller and Alexander Frei gave Basle a two-goal advantage before Phil Jones got one back late on. 'It's a loss because it's the best . tournament in the world,' added Ferguson after seeing United finish . third in what was regarded as the easiest group. 'The Europa League is a competition I've . never been in with United. It means playing on Thursday and Sunday . right through and that has to be dealt with. That's our penalty for not . qualifying. You have to deal with disappointment. It's been used as a . motivation many times.' Dejection: Both Sir Alex Ferguson and Roberto . Mancini come to terms of being knocked out of the Champions League at . the group stages . Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini also struggled to contain his bitter disappointment after crashing out of the Champions League. He said: 'I think that maybe now the Europa League will feel like it's not a very important trophy, certainly not as much as the Champions League.' Be he added: 'For City, it can be important, because we need to win trophies. If we can reach the final, then you can be sure it will mean a lot to everyone. 'We must give it our best shot, but at the moment, I am very disappointed, because I really wanted us to go through tonight.' There was, however, some good news for Wayne Rooney - and England fans - today after he was cleared to play in England's final group game at Euro 2012. Rooney had been facing the prospect of three games out after receiving a straight red card for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic in England's final qualifier in October. But UEFA this morning reduced the striker's ban to two games, meaning the United forward will miss the tournament opener against France and the clash with Sweden but can return to Capello's side against Ukraine. The 26-year-old has also agreed to do some coaching in the community, said the spokesman.Rooney's hearing for his appeal against an international ban began.

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 6:33 PM on 1st December 2011 . Around one tenth of accidents that happen at crossroads are due to someone driving straight through a red light. But - rather distressingly for responsible drivers - half the people killed aren't the drivers who drove past the red signal. Now MIT researchers have developed an algorithm that can 'detect' drivers who're likely to drive straight across a red light - before they do so. The warning system will give drivers a two-second warning that an oncoming car is about to shoot a red light - it uses advanced 'V2V' vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems already in development by Ford . The monitor 'watches' deceleration and distance from a light - and 'guesses' which cars are likely to break the Highway Code. Crucially, the software can provide two seconds' warning if someone else is about to shoot across a crossroads - enough time for other drivers to hit the brakes. 'The challenge is, you don't want to . be overly pessimistic,' How says. 'If you're too pessimistic, you start . reporting there's a problem when there really isn't, and then very . rapidly, the human's going to push a button that turns this thing off.' Jonathan How, the Richard Cockburn Maclaurin Professor of Aeronautics . and Astronautics at MIT, says 'smart' cars of the future may use the system to help drivers anticipate and avoid potential accidents. The researchers tested the algorithm on data collected from an intersection in Virginia, finding that it accurately identified potential violators within a couple of seconds of reaching a red light — enough time, according to the researchers, for other drivers at an intersection to be able to react to the threat if alerted. The creators think the system will allow 'smart cars' to warn drivers of other dangerous drivers - before the cars even get close enough to cause a crash . Compared to other efforts to model driving behavior, the MIT algorithm generated fewer false alarms, an important advantage for systems providing guidance to human drivers. The researchers report their findings in a paper that will appear in the journal IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.'If you had some type of heads-up display for the driver, it might be able to warn you of other drivers who are a 'concern' says How, who is one of the paper's authors. ""Even though your light might be green, it may recommend you not go, because there are people behaving badly that you may not be aware of.""How says that in order to implement such warning systems, vehicles would need to be able to 'talk' with each other, wirelessly sending and receiving information such as a car's speed and position data. Such vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, he says, can potentially improve safety and avoid traffic congestion. Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is exploring V2V technology, along with several major car manufacturers — including Ford Motor Company, which this year has been road-testing prototypes with advanced Wi-Fi and collision-avoidance systems.The researchers are now investigating ways to design a closed-loop system — to give drivers a recommendation of what to do in response to a potential accident — and are also planning to adapt the existing algorithm to air traffic control, to predict the behavior of aircraft.","System monitors oncoming drivers and 'predicts' drivers who are going to go through red lights .

Samsung Galaxy S II has remained the most popular handset in Britain for an eighth consecutive month - beating iPhone 4S into second place . Demand for Apple's new hi-tech iPhone 4S has been huge - with many retailers reporting shortages. Some users have waited weeks to receive their new handets. But whether it's supply shortages or not, the new Apple handset has failed to unseat the reigning champion of the smartphone market.

Mellisa Sanders was hit by a taxi in San Antonio just two days before her break was due to end. The 18-year-old's injuries were so bad that doctors didn't expect her to last the night. But Mellisa started to improve after she was placed on a life-support machine and recovered to the point where she could be flown back to the UK from the Balearic island. Mellisa Sanders, 22, was left for dead following a hit and run four years ago. Her mother Christine said she was an inspiration . However, before she left, medics told distraught mum Christine her daughter would be in a 'vegetative state' for the rest of her life, unable to move or eat. But after four years, Mellisa, now 22, continues to defy the doctors and is described as an ""inspiration"" by her family. Not only can she communicate with loved ones, but she has also started taking her first steps after physio sessions in a hospital gym. She has also reached other recovery milestones such as dressing herself and cleaning her own teeth. Her mother Christine, 56, from Whitburn, South Tyneside, said: 'Mellisa is truly an inspiration. From where she was four years ago, she is defying the doctors every step of the way - she's amazing. 'Until now we didn't want to say anything, but Mellisa wants everyone to know how well she is doing in the hope it will inspire others, who have also suffered traumatic injuries, in their recovery.' Mellisa was holidaying with friends in Ibiza as they celebrated their A-Level results when tragedy struck. The group were on a night out and getting out of a taxi on a poorly lit road when she was hit by a cab. The driver sped off, leaving the teenager for dead on the roadside. The taxi driver has never been caught. Mellisa is now receiving specialist rehabilitation at Walkergate Hospital in Newcastle . Mellisa's older brother, Daryl, and his partner, Claire White, who were also holidaying on the island, were first to arrive at her hospital bedside. Christine said: 'They managed to get to the hospital quickly, as they were only 40 minutes away. 'It was really hard for me, being here at home, trying to find out what was happening because of the language barrier, but as soon as I could, I flew out there to be by her bedside. 'It was a shock when I saw her, I can only describe her as being smashed beyond recognition.  She was a mess. 'My son had said the doctors weren't going to put her on a life support machine as they classed her as brain dead, her eyes were fixed and she was classed as being in a coma. 'But then my son said he saw her arm move and they put her on the machine - they didn't know if she would last the night.' Mellisa spent almost three weeks on the machine before doctors finally felt it was right to take her off the equipment helping to keep her alive. She was taken for an MRI scan, which showed the left side of her brain had been severely damaged. Eventually, doctors allowed Mellisa to be flown by air ambulance to Newcastle General - where she spent a further 16 months being treated before finally being allowed home.  She is now receiving specialist rehabilitation at Walkergate Hospital. Christine added: 'Mellisa has spent nearly three years in hospital. To see her stand for the first time, I'm just choked every time she does something new. 'She can't remember the accident, yet she can remember the Leeds Festival before her holiday. 'I know she will never be the same and I have come to accept that but she is making positive progress, she is proving all the medics wrong.' Mellisa, who had achieved A-Levels in Law and Business Studies, had set her heart on becoming a lawyer.  And she remains determined to one day have a job. 'She wants to work,' added Christine, who gave up her own job as a beautician to care for her daughter. 'It has taken a long time in her recovery to get to this stage but she is a determined.'","Doctors weren't going to put Mellisa on life support as they classed her as brain dead, but then her brother saw her arm move ."
"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 9:24 PM on 5th December 2011 . Former Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo has become the first head of state to face judges at the permanent war crimes court. Gbagbo was calm and smiled at supporters in the public gallery as the 25-minute hearing opened in The Hague, Netherlands. The 66-year-old was extradited to the Netherlands last week to face charges including murder and rape committed by supporters as he attempted to cling on to power. Unrepentant: A smiling Laurent Gbagbo, former president of Ivory Coast, appears at the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity . Charges: Gbagbo, 66, is accused of being an 'indirect perpetrator' in a campaign of violence against supporters of rival Alessane Ouattara . Prosecutors say around 3,000 people died in violence by both sides after Gbagbo refused to concede electoral defeat, despite losing by a near eight-point margin. President Alassane Ouatarra took power in April with the help of French and UN forces. The former president, speaking in French, said he wanted to see the evidence against him. 'I will challenge that evidence and then you hand down your judgement,' he told the three-judge panel. Gbagbo also complained about his arrest by opposition forces backed by French troops in April, saying he saw his son beaten and his interior minister killed in the fighting. 'I was the president of the republic and the residence of the president of the republic was shelled,' he said. Killings: A child sits near a mass grave where the bodies of around 30 people were dumped by pro-Gbagbo militiamen in Yopougon, Abidjan, in April this year . Victims: members of the Dosso family, who lost parents, grand parents and five siblings in the violence after an election in April, watch Gbagbo's appearance on television . He also claimed he was not told he was being taken to The Hague from northern Ivory Coast, where he was under house arrest. The brief hearing was to confirm Gbagbo's identity and ensure he understood the charges. According to court papers, he is charged as an 'indirect perpetrator' in a carefully orchestrated campaign of violence against supporters of Mr Ouattara. Another hearing has been scheduled for June 18, when prosecutors will present a summary of evidence and the judges will decide whether it is strong enough to merit bringing Gbagbo's case to trial. Gbagbo's adviser Toussaint Alain said: 'It's a neocolonialist trial. The (ICC) has become an instrument of France... to empower friends and punish the ones who don't follow along.' Extradited: Gbagbo was flown by helicopter from northern Ivory Coast, then by plane to Rotterdam before being transferred to a detention centre in The Hague . Rival: President Alassane Ouattara won the election by nearly eight points, but nearly 3,000 people died in clashes between the rival groups . His lawyer, Habiba Toure, questioned the legitimacy of his detention. 'In principal, an arrest warrant is delivered to a free individual or a person on the run, which was not the case for Mr Gbagbo because he was already in the hands of Ivory Coast officials.' Human rights groups say grave abuses were committed by forces loyal to Mr Outtara, who enlisted the help of a former rebel group to oust Gbagbo. Gbagbo is the sixth suspect taken into custody by the court, all of them in Africa. A further 12 suspects remain at large. He claims he was told he was going to meet a magistrate in Ivory Coast and was surprised when the arrest warrant was produced. He was taken by helicopter from remote Korhogo on November 29 and put on a plane to Rotterdam where he arrived the next day. A convoy of police vans then drove him to the Scheveningen detention centre in The Hague, where former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic - the 'butcher of Bosnia' - was housed earlier this year alongside political partner Rodovan Karadzic. Inmates in the centre include Charles Taylor - the former Liberian president charged with committing murder, rape and sexual slavery as he sought control of Sierra Leone's 'blood diamonds' - and Thomas Lubanga, the Congo warlord charged with recruiting child soldiers.","Laurent Gbagbo faces charges of crimes against humanity, including murder and rape .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 4:12 PM on 7th December 2011 . Insulting: Andrew Robathan has angered the Second World War heroes . A minister yesterday likened the campaign for Arctic convoy medals to Colonel Gaddafi being ‘covered in’ honours. Andrew Robathan angered Second World War veterans by saying Britain did not ‘throw around’ honours like the Libyan tyrant and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The Tory defence minister said the UK only awarded medals for ‘risk and rigour’ – prompting accusations he was ‘belittling’ the sacrifice made by thousands. Mr Robathan made the ‘sickening’ remarks as those who risked their lives on what Winston Churchill described as ‘the worst journey in the world’, took their fight for a medal to Westminster. More than 3,000 UK sailors, who faced treacherous seas where temperatures plunged as low as -60c, died to keep the Soviet Union supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front. Of 1,400 ships on 78 convoys, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945. If the convoys of cargo and munitions had failed, Germany could have defeated the Red Army and turned the full might of its military machine against Britain. Despite the Tories promising to strike an Arctic Star medal when they won power, ministers have so far snubbed those who served on the convoys. Even Russia has awarded commemorative medals to survivors. Only around 200 veterans are still alive. Hell in the Arctic: Apart from the appalling cold, British seamen were under constant threat from U-boats, warplanes and battleships . Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . Caroline Dinenage, Tory MP for Gosport in Hampshire, used a Westminster Hall debate at Parliament to tell Mr Robathan it would be ‘utterly, utterly disgusting’ if the heroes went to their graves without being honoured. Insisting it was an ‘insult’ ministers had not kept their promise, she added: ‘It brings shame on our country. ‘At their age they should not have to fight for justice and it appals me that people who gave up so much to ensure the freedoms we take on a daily basis for granted should have to beg for the recognition that they deserve.’ But Mr Robathan suggested the campaign was similar to notorious regimes which handed out so many medals it diminished their worth. He said: ‘The intention post-war was not to cover everybody in medals. Medals in the UK mean something. ‘Authoritarian regimes and dictators often throw around a lot of medals. One can look, for instance, at North Korean generals who are covered in medal ribbon, or Gaddafi, or Saddam Hussein. ‘We have taken the view in this country, traditionally, that medals will only be awarded for campaigns that show risk and rigour. 'Some regimes give out very large numbers of medals whereas we, traditionally, do not.’ Mr Robathan’s comments infuriated veterans watching the debate. Commander Eddie Grenfell, 91, the leader of the Arctic Medal campaign, said: ‘The man is a disgrace. Veterans are outraged that their campaign has been likened to former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's ostentatious display . ‘It was absolutely disgusting to speak of us in the same breath as Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. 'They made a promise when they were looking for our votes and now they have betrayed us.’ Miss Dinenage said: ‘It sickens me that the veterans had to listen to those comments. 'They have demonstrated levels of heroism the minister could not begin to understand.’ Late last night Mr Robathan tried to calm the row, saying: ‘There was no intention to cause any offence. 'I was making the point that we honour people for their service in a very different way to that of authoritarian regimes.’ Successive governments have rejected pleas for an Arctic medal, claiming the sailors had already been recognised with the separate Atlantic Star medal. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Government would be holding ‘a fresh review of the rules governing the award of military medals’. Harrowing conditions: Sailors chipping away the ice and snow from the deck of H.M.S. Vansittart while on convoy duty in February 1943.

Betrayal: Commander Eddie Grenfel, left, called Mr Robathan a 'disgrace' for his remarks and right,  the commemorative medal for British Veterans of the Second World War Arctic Convoy . Hero: In perilous conditions a sailor frees chains, wires and bollards from the ice . Appalling cold: Snow and ice covered the upper works of all ships . Bravery: Eric Alley made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943 . By IAN DRURY . Battered by waves as high as houses, the ships sailed on through the darkness, fog and appalling cold of the Arctic winter. But the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by German warplanes, battleships and U-boats. A . total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and . munitions to the Soviet Union – allowing the Red Army to repel the Nazi . invasion. The cost in . lives was horrific. More than 3,000 UK seamen were killed in the . treacherous waters of the Arctic Ocean as they undertook the terrifying . trips to keep Russia supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front. In total, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945. But . the cost had the Arctic convoys not succeeded would have been worse: . Nazi Germany would very probably have won the Second World War. Churchill proposed the convoys following Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s invasion of Russia. Cabinet . documents reveal that Britain’s greatest prime minister promised to . supply Stalin ‘at all costs’. He knew that if Russia fell, the full . weight of the Nazi military machine would be targeted at the West. Over . four years, the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes, 5,000 tanks and . other battlefield vehicles, ammunition, fuel, food, medicine and further . emergency supplies. Because Norway and the Baltic states had been . captured by Germany, the only way to get the goods to Russia was through . the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel, both inside the Arctic . Circle. The first . convoys set off from Iceland and Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. Two . or three reached their destination unscathed. But then the Germans ‘got . wise’ to the missions, said Eric Alley, 88, who served as a radar . operator on HMS Inglefield. ‘After . they woke up, all hell broke loose. They shifted all their most able . Luftwaffe squadrons and U-boats to Norway and we’d be under constant . attack from the air and sea,’ said Mr Alley, from Weymouth, Dorset. ‘You’d . hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear. Once I was . moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion. I saw a column of . smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink. The poor blighters . on board didn’t stand a chance. We heard ships call for help but . couldn’t do anything about it.’ Mr Alley, who made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943, said conditions on board were ‘pretty terrible’. He . learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on . his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder. The . final convoy departed from the Clyde on May 12, 1945, and arrived at . Kola Inlet, near Murmansk, on May 20. It sailed back into Glasgow ten . days later. Victory in Europe had been declared on May 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the Arctic convoys.",Embattled Conservative MP said Britain only awarded medals for 'risk and rigour'
"The young men lived with the sportsman in his eight-bedroom house . By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 11:02 AM on 21st November 2011 . Accused: Peter Roebuck arriving at court for his trial in 2001. The former Somerset captain plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match . The ongoing investigation into the death of Cricketer turned commentator Peter Roebuck, 55, will see police quiz 16 male students who lived at his home in South Africa. Mr Roebuck had been accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old male Zimbabwean student before he killed himself last weekend. The alleged victim, Ital Gondo laid a charge of indecent assault against the former Somerset captain after claiming he had been 'groomed' through Facebook. Officers will now talk to 16 young men - aged 18 to 26 - whose education was being paid for by the sportsman and who lived at his eight-bedroom house in Pietermaritzburg, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The men are mostly Zimbabwean and many came from a home for abandoned boys in the country's capital of Harare. According to the Sunday Times, Tatenda Dennis Chadya, who was one of the first to be sponsored by Mr Roebuck said he thought of them as sons. He told the newspaper: 'These allegations have come as a complete shock to us all. 'Peter wanted us to be the best that we can and he was inspiration to us all.'

Minutes later, with the uniformed . officer still in the room, Mr Roebuck plunged 70ft to his death, hitting . an awning as he fell. Paramedics were called to the hotel, a short walk . from the Newlands cricket ground, and Mr Roebuck was pronounced dead at . the scene. Old enemies: Ian Botham, left, and Roebuck, right, in 1987. When Roebuck backed a Somerset club committee decision not to renew the contracts of West Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for Roebuck . Police seized items from his hotel room, including a laptop computer. Mr Roebuck had spent part of his last day alive with members of the Australian cricket team, who had lost their first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday. He regularly toured with the team as a distinguished writer and broadcaster for the Australian media, following a career in county cricket during which he played 335 first-class matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1988. After retiring from cricket in 1991, Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket .

The sprawling estate rented by Barack Obama and his family for the last three summers has been sold for an eye-watering $22million to the globally-renowned British architect Norman Foster. The impressive Blue Heron Farm on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard sprawls over an enormous 29 acres of waterfront, houses two full-size homes, a pool, hot tub and golf course. The architect of London’s Wembley Stadium and the Gherkin will also find a tennis and basketball court, an equestrian facility complete with eight-stall horse barn and an apple orchard. Huge purchase: The sprawling estate rented by Barack Obama and his family for the last three summers has been sold for an eye-watering $22million to the globally-renowned British architect Norman Foster . Interior: One of the many rooms which occupies just one of the two houses on the sprawling Blue Heron Farm estate on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard . Yale University graduate Lord Foster, . 76, is behind such U.S. masterpieces the Hearst Tower in New York, . Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the AT&T Performing Arts Center in . Dallas, Texas. Meanwhile, he also designed Two World Trade Center on the Ground Zero site. Foundation work began on the property in June last year and it will eventually reach a height of 1,349ft, or 88 stories. Lord Foster's tax residence is in Switzerland and he left the UK House of Lords as a crossbencher - without political party allegiance - in July last year in order to protect his 'non-dom' tax status. The architect's new home also boasts a . five-bedroom Victorian farm house, a vast space of gardens, a . reconstructed 150-year-old Pennsylvania hay barn and an oversized shed . from Vermont. Lord Foster’s purchase of the house - . in conjunction with his Spanish-born wife, publishing magnate Lady Elena . Foster - was completed in two separate deeds, reported the Martha’s . Vineyard Gazette. There is also beach access on . Squibnocket Pond and a vista of Tiah's Cove. The purchase price is among . the highest ever paid for a single-family home on Martha’s Vineyard. Luxury: The property looks out on to lush landscapes and generous waterfronts in Massachusetts . House two: The other building situated on the property, which was on the market for $23.7million . The sale was handled Tom Wallace of . Wallace & Co. Sotheby's International Realty, who also handled . rentals to President Obama’s family when they came to stay in the . summer. The Blue Heron Farm was named by former owner and philanthropist M. Anthony Fisher after the bird that is native to the area. The Manhattan real estate developer is responsible for making the property what it is today. After buying it in 1991, he and his . wife Anne added the individual touches to the property over the years, . making the lush landscape fit for a king - or even a U.S. President.

But they obviously did not let it get . in the way of their business ventures as they rented it out to the . Obamas for a reported $75,000-a-week for the last three summers.

"By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 12:55 AM on 10th December 2011 . The number of people admitted to hospital due to drinking has doubled in the past eight years, figures have revealed. They show the number of hospital admissions rose to almost 1.2 million last year. The shocking total – a nine per cent rise on the past 12 months alone – includes more than 7,000 teenagers. On the increase: More people are being admitted to A&E because of alcohol-related injuries and illness, with a 9% rise in the past year alone . It is also more than double the overall figure for 2002/03, when alcohol-related admissions stood at 510,780, according to data from Local Alcohol Profiles for England. London saw the biggest jump in the past year, at 14 per cent, followed by the East of England with a 10 per cent rise. Overall for England, there was an 11 per cent increase in admissions, from 1,056,962 in 2009/10 to 1,173,386 in 2010/11. Separately, provisional estimates show 7,074 hospital admissions for people under 18 due to alcohol since January, according to a written parliamentary answer to shadow public health minister Diane Abbott. Mrs Abbott said ministers needed to ‘get a grip’ on binge drinking adding: ‘The alarm bells should be ringing with the publication of these figures.’ ‘It is clear that for [Health Secretary] Andrew Lansley, the be-all and end-all is whether his friends in big business are happy, and, unfortunately, it is costing our NHS and British families an absolute fortune.’ Today's data also showed an increase in the total number of hospital admissions for alcohol in England, from 1,056,962 in 2009/10 to 1,173,386 in 2010/11, a rise of 11 per cent. In 2002/03, the figure stood at 510,780 admissions for alcohol. Mrs Abbott cited a recent report which predicted binge drinking will cost the NHS £3.8billion by 2015, with 1.5million A&E admissions a year. In England in 2002/03, there were 926 admissions per 100,000 people for conditions attributable to alcohol, rising to 1,898 in 2010/11. In 2009/10, the figure was 1,743 per 100,000. Mr Lansley blamed the previous Labour government for fostering easy availability of alcohol. He said: ‘These figures are disturbing evidence that, despite total consumption of alcohol not increasing recently, we have serious problems with both binge-drinking and long-term excessive alcohol abuse in a minority of people. ‘These consistent rises show Labour took their eye off the ball on tackling alcohol abuse during their 13 years in power. Their reckless policies included the decision to unleash a 24-hour drinking culture in our country. ‘We have taken real action by imposing high taxes on super-strength beers and ciders and banning below-cost alcohol sales.’ Under the ban on the sale of low-cost alcohol, which will come into force on April 6 next year, shops and bars will not be able to sell drinks for less than the tax paid on them. But health campaigners, led by the British Medical Association, said the below-cost price ban would make little difference to rising numbers of problem drinkers, claiming the price ‘floor’ was too low to have any impact. Mr Lansley said further measures will be set out in an alcohol strategy in the new year.",London sees a rise of 14% in just one year .

One of the country's most popular Christmas toys is selling online for more than twice its original price as parents scramble to get their hands on the must-have present. The LeapFrog LeapPad, a child's 'educational computer' which normally costs £79.99, is being sold on eBay and Amazon for over £170 as stocks run low nationwide. Numbers of the toy are running low after a sudden rush of sales saw it become September's best-selling toy in terms of value. In demand: The LeapFrog LeapPad toy is set to be one of the biggest sellers this year and has doubled in price online . Its rival - the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales. Adam Christopher, from toy price comparison website kidstoptoys.co.uk, said: 'Most retailers have been sticking to the recommended retail price for the LeapPad and InnoTab now, with the exception of Amazon and Tesco. 'Tesco has been selling the InnoTab for £63.99, which has been one of the cheapest prices. 'It's on sites like eBay, the Amazon sellers market and the Play.com sellers market where we have seen prices topping £150. I guess it happens every year with certain toys.'

The LeapPad's rival, the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales but costs upwards of its normal £63 asking price . The popularity of the LeapPad has increased since it was named in the Toy Retailers Association's 'Dream Dozen' gadgets for Christmas. It has been a sell-out success and has usurped Lego's Minifigures to become September's most valuable toy. Retailers have been altering prices of the LeapPad, as well as the InnoTab, to take advantage of the short supply. Others have been limiting customers to one purchase to combat the listings on eBay and Amazon. Robert . Dekker, senior marketing director at LeapFrog, said the company would . be replenishing supplies at various points to be divided equally between . retailers.

So she had every right to celebrate her first World Cup win on a U.S. slope by striking a pose. The recently-divorced Colorado skier decided to celebrate her landmark victory by dropping to a knee with her skis in her hand and taking up a prayer pose. It's otherwise known as ‘Tebowing’. Vonn, 27, has joined the craze that mimics quarterback Tim Tebow of NFL team Denver Broncos - and she had asked his brother beforehand if it would be OK to pull off the pose if she won. Scroll down for video . 'Tebowing': Lindsey Vonn kneels down in front of the podium after winning the women's World Cup super-G ski competition in Beaver Creek, Colorado, on Wednesday, to mimic the NFL quarterback Tim Tebow . The champion skier’s hometown fans were packed tightly into the stands and some of the local children had even been excused from school to take it all in. She didn’t disappoint them. Some fans had wondered how she would do without her husband, Thomas Vonn, who served as an adviser and personal coach. But her family, friends, coaches and teammates have stepped in. The Olympic gold medalist skier confirmed last month the couple started divorce proceedings after more than four years of marriage, and her husband would no longer have a role as her chief advisor. Vonn, of Vail, Colorado, finished in 1 minute, 10.68 seconds, holding off the Swiss Fabienne Suter by 0.37 seconds and Anna Fenninger of Austria, who came third on the tricky Birds of Prey course.

Go Broncos. I did it. Got to represent' Lindsey Vonn . While Vonn's 46th World Cup win moved her into a tie with Austria's Renate Goetschl for third on the career list, she will remember this victory more for finally breaking through in Colorado. Before stepping on the top step of the podium at the post-race ceremony, she dropped to a knee with her skis in her hand and joined the ‘Tebowing’ craze. But out of respect for Tebow she asked his brother, who was at the race, if it would be disrespectful. She was given the green light. The two have recently struck up a friendship but deny dating.

The former Two And A Half Men star says he does not believe Mueller would have been trying to sell the drug - because he gives her all the cash she needs in child support. Sheen - who pays her $55,000 per month - told TMZ: 'With the child support I give her... she's gonna deal drugs? Never gonna happen.'

Given the scenes witnessed at the world’s largest train station this morning, anyone would have thought these people were on an emotional pilgrimage somewhere. Well, some certainly were. Apple’s new 23,000 sq ft flagship store at Grand Central in Manhattan, New York, opened to great fanfare today as staff cheered enthusiasts who queued up for hours to be the first customers inside. Some fanatics had travelled almost 3,000 miles to make it and were rewarded as the first 4,000 people through the door received an exclusive t-shirt that reads: ‘Apple Store, Grand Central’. Scroll down for video . Crowds: Apple's new flagship store at Grand Central in Manhattan, New York, opened to great fanfare today as staff cheered enthusiasts who queued up for hours to be the first customers inside . Hurrah! Apple employees enthusiastically greet customers arriving to shop for Apple products on the opening day of the new Apple store at Grand Central Station in New York on Friday . People are already bidding for one on Ebay - but Jacob Davis is unlikely to give away his anytime soon. The 19-year-old travelled 150 miles from Albany, New York, to get to the front of the queue. ‘He’s my son and he’s an Apple fanatic,’ his father Robert, who had joined him waiting for more than 24 hours, told WCBS. ‘He loves the machines and he even gave me one for Father’s Day.’ But Mr Davis did not make the longest trip. Second in line was Gary Allen, who flew an astonishing 2,900 miles from Berkeley, California, and has visited Apple stores around the world, reported CNET. IT consultant Hector Nieves, who works near Grand Central, said he was moved by the cheering crowd as the store opened and thought of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in October. Through the doors: Some fanatics had travelled 3,000 miles to make it to the store opening in Manhattan . Fun: George Brown, 9, of New York, plays with an iPhone on the opening day of the new Apple store . ‘I could barely hold back my emotions coming up the stairs,’ Mr Nieves told CNET. The store has two ‘Genius Bars’ for technological help, 315 staff employed and a personal collection area for pick-ups. 'He’s my son and he’s an Apple fanatic. He loves the machines and he even gave me one for Father’s Day' Robert Davis . The store opened at 10am on Friday morning and by 11am there were 1,000 people who had made it inside, with another 500 queued up. Around 4,000 had got in by 12:30, reported CNN. The owner of the space, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city's bus and subway system, says Apple is paying $180 per square foot for its lease. This is slightly less than the $200-per-square-foot top rate at the century-old transport hub. Assistance: Customers shop for Apple products on the opening day of the new store on Friday in New York . Impressive: People walk through the new Apple store at Grand Central Station, which overlooks the main concourse of the historic terminal and will become Apple's new flagship store in New York . By leasing to Apple, the MTA says it is quadrupling the rent for Grand Central's east balcony and an adjacent one overlooking the cavernous main concourse with its famed night-sky ceiling. 'I could barely hold back my emotions coming up the stairs' Hector Nieves . The store includes a basement storage area that was never leased before. The transit agency says the draw of the Apple name promises to increase foot traffic to other businesses at the terminal. Apple is behind iconic products such as the iPod, the iPad and the iPhone - and has set up in a station that is visited by about 750,000 people daily and home to the Metro-North commuter line. The company signed a 10-year lease with the MTA for the space once occupied by Charlie Palmer's Metrazur restaurant, which got $5million from Apple to clear out early. All new: The store features two Genius Bars, 15-minute Express Workshop for commuters on a tighter schedule and will employ 315 people . Say cheese: A customer poses next to an Apple logo as he visits the newest Apple Store during its opening on the East Balcony in the main lobby of New York City's Grand Central station . MTA says the $180-per-square-foot cost reflects this $5million payment, plus Apple's $2.5million capital investment in the space and a $1.1million annual rate that will rise each year of the lease. Apple is making it easier than ever to spend money at the new store in Grand Central. Visitors to the station can buy personal electronics without the help of a human being. They slide an iPhone across a product's bar code and grab the item. The receipt is emailed. 'It's all about putting the customer in charge,' an Apple spokesman said confidently. The store also offers one feature not available at any other Apple store - 15-minute training sessions for rushed New Yorkers. Apple will not share any portion of its revenue with the MTA, as other retailers do at the terminal, and it is considered by the transport group as an ‘anchor tenant’ at Grand Central. This is equivalent to a prominent store in a shopping centre that serves as an attraction surrounded by smaller retailers. An anchor tenant typically does not share revenue. The spotlight on the latest Apple store accompanies the intense public profile of the company, based in Cupertino, California, following the death in October of its celebrity founder, Mr Jobs. This Apple store, the fifth to open in New York City, is about the size of two that are in London. Grand Central Terminal is the world's biggest train station by number of platforms. Company representatives offered a media preview of the new store on Wednesday, demonstrating its key features. Apple announced the opening of the store on its retail website.

Unlawfully killed: A coroner has returned a verdict over the death of vulnerable pensioner David Askew following years of torment by yobs . A vulnerable man of 64 who collapsed and died after three decades of harassment by yobs was unlawfully killed, a coroner ruled yesterday. David Askew, who had learning difficulties, had a fatal heart attack after confronting some of the local youths who had subjected him to years of mockery and vandalism. No one has ever been prosecuted over his death, but yesterday coroner John Pollard said he had no doubt Mr Askew had been unlawfully killed. He said the case showed how 'feral youths can bring misery to a decent and vulnerable family'. Mr Pollard also criticised 'staggering inertia and complacency' at the local council. Mr Askew had been bullied by three generations of youths on an estate in the Hattersley area of Greater Manchester. He was pestered for money and cigarettes and on one occasion the yobs kicked in the family's front door. Mocked as Dopey Dave, he had eggs and stones thrown at him when he went out. Windows of the family home were smashed. During one two-month period he went to the offices of Tameside Council every day to complain while his mother called police 88 times. Confrontation: Mr Askew argues with a thug outside his home. He was subjected to years of bullying by local youths who mocked him, threw eggs and bricks, and smashed his windows . The inquest heard the council's . neighbourhood manager Mark Tunstall, who was in charge of community . safety, was 'out of his depth' and never visited the family, even though . his office was just 400 yards away. Neighbourhood police visited . regularly, the inquest heard, but senior officers felt Mr Askew was . 'part of the problem' for giving the youths cigarettes in the hope they . would leave. Convicted: Kial Cottingham, 18, was sent to a young offenders institution for his role in the harassment . Mr Askew died in March last year after confronting youths . outside the house over an overturned wheelie bin and over tampering with . his mother Rose's mobility scooter . In September last year Kial . Cottingham, 19, who lived just doors away, pleaded guilty to harassing . Mr Askew and was locked up for 16 months. Prosecutors said there was no . evidence to charge him with manslaughter. He apologised to the family . when he gave evidence to the inquest. At Trafford Coroners Court yesterday Mr Pollard recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. He cited the evidence of a pathologist . who told the inquest that while it could not be scientifically proven . that the stress of harassment on the night Mr Askew died led directly to . his death, the circumstances of the case 'strongly suggest' it had. After the hearing David's mother Rose, now 90, said: 'I am still angry about what happened but there is no use hating people.' Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan . of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We have learned our lessons and . made significant improvements to the way we deal with these crimes.' David's mother, now aged 90, said that she is still angry about the attack, but added that the family have now been made to feel very welcome in the community . Earlier this year an Independent . Police Complaints Commission report highlighted 'systemic failures' by . the force to link the calls made by the family and treat the abuse as a . hate crime. It also found CCTV cameras installed to catch the culprits . were next-to-useless because the picture quality was too poor to . recognise their faces. Tameside Council admitted that 'all agencies' needed to work more closely to ensure that the vulnerable were better protected.","Also criticised 'staggering inertia and complacency' at local council .

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 8:39 AM on 2nd December 2011 . Homes built before 1919 have risen in value more than any other type of property over the past 25 years, a report reveals today. The study, by the Halifax, said the oldest homes in the country were clearly the best. The report says pre-1919 homes are popular because there are fewer of them, and they tend to be in the best locations. A solid investment: A row of Edwardian houses, which are often larger than other types of property . Over the past quarter of a century, the report reveals, homes falling into this category have risen in price by more than 450 per cent. This is equivalent to an average increase of more than £500 every month for 25 years, a price rise which has not been matched by any other type of property. In 1986, pre-1919 homes had an average value of £33,619, making the category the cheapest of the four ‘ages’ of property. By 2001, the average had increased to £117,990 and today it is £188,473, an increase of 461 per cent, or £516 every month. The other three ‘ages’ of property are 1919 to 1945, 1946 to 1960 and 1960 onwards. Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, said it was easy to see why pre-1919 properties were now more expensive than any other. He said: ‘The age of a property often determines its size, its style and location. Properties from the Victorian or Edwardian era tend to be in higher demand. ‘This is because there are fewer of them. They are often larger, situated in desirable locations, and have a popular style.’ In demand: Victorian properties also fared well. The age of a property often determines its size, style and location, the survey revealed . The cheapest properties are homes built between the end of the Second World War, which triggered a building boom, and 1960. They cost an average of £144,988, and have risen in value by only 249 per cent over the past 25 years. As the study highlights the popularity of older properties, it raises concerns about the Government’s moves to encourage people to buy new-build homes. The Prime Minister has said he wanted ‘everyone in this country’ to experience the ‘magic moment’ of getting the keys to their first flat. But the Government scheme, which allows people to buy with only a five per cent deposit, is available only to those who want a newly-built home. And it is this type of property which has plunged in value over recent years amid fears of further falls. Since the credit crunch began, the Halifax figures show, homes built after 1960 have dropped by nearly £40,000 in value. Henry Pryor, a leading independent housing expert, said: ‘If a man in a hard hat offers you a subsidised mortgage on a nice new house or flat that he has built, just say no. Ask for 15 per cent off instead.’","Edwardian and Victorian properties are more 'in demand'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:15 AM on 9th December 2011 . Women are to be allowed to serve on submarines for the first time in the Royal Navy’s history. Female officers can serve beneath the waves on Vanguard-class subs, which carry the Trident nuclear deterrent, from 2013, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced yesterday. Women of lower rank will follow two years later, when they will be able to serve on the new state-of-the-art £1.2billion Astute-class ‘hunter-killer’ submarines. Female officers will begin serving on British submarines from 2013 . The announcement breaks more than 100 . years of tradition. Women had been barred from subs because of concerns . that carbon dioxide in the recycled air could damage their fertility. There were also concerns among top . brass that the presence of women could create disruptive relationships . on underwater missions that often last months. But Mr Hammond said he was scrapping . the long-standing ban on females on the recommendation of Admiral Sir . Mark Stanhope, the head of the Navy, after experts at the Institute of . Naval Medicine concluded that health fears were ‘unfounded’. Philip Hammond has announced that women can serve on submarines . Pregnant sailors, however, will still be banned from going to sea amid concerns that fumes could damage an unborn child. Addressing the Royal United Services . Institute think-tank, Mr Hammond said Britain’s Armed Forces would . ‘value our history and tradition – but we will not be slaves to them’. The lifting of the ban ends one of the . last all-male bastions of the Armed Forces following pressure to . introduce equal opportunities throughout the military. Wrens have served on Royal Navy . surface ships since a ban was lifted two decades ago, and about 9 per . cent of personnel are now female. The Australian, Canadian, Danish, . Swedish and Norwegian navies already allow women to serve on their . submarines. And last year the U.S. axed the ban on female submariners. The new Astute attack submarines could easily be adapted so females have their own areas with showers and beds. New Astute class submarines will have women serving on them from 2015 . Philip Hammond has confirmed that the final estimate of the cost of military operations in Libya was £212million. The figure is less than the last estimate issued by the Ministry of Defence in October of £300million. The fall is primarily due to a drop in the estimated cost of replacing spent munitions from £140million to £67million. Mr Hammond stressed there was no going back on the cuts in the Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). 'The situation we face now - after the years of political failure to grip the problem - is that eliminating the black hole in the defence budget is the only way to sustain military capability over the long-term,' he said. 'Of course there are many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of individual capabilities. But let's be under no illusions - unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option.'","Philip Hammond making his first speech in office since taking over from Liam Fox .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 12:11 AM on 8th December 2011 . [headerlinks] . Private care: NHS Wirral have struck a deal for maternity care with One to One (file picture) An NHS trust has become the first in the country to sign a contract with a private company to provide maternity care. NHS Wirral has made a deal with One to One following a pilot scheme to provide services to women in the local area. Those women opting to go with One to One will be provided with a midwife who sees them through all their antenatal care, birth of the baby and postnatal care. This will be an alternative to the usual NHS services on offer, although One to One midwives will be able to go into NHS hospitals to deliver the baby if the woman has a hospital birth. The company is now in talks with other NHS trusts around England and Wales about providing some of their maternity services. At present, the firm employs 28 people, including 20 midwives, but is looking to expand. In the two weeks since the contract was signed with NHS Wirral, around 10 babies have been born using One to One midwives, most of them at home. It is the first time the NHS has signed a contract of this nature. The decision has the backing of the Department of Health. The One to One website said: 'Set to be the gold standard of midwifery care, the One to One personalised maternity service is delivered by a team of passionate, highly motivated midwives who have experience across all aspects of pregnancy, birth and postnatal care. 'By having just one midwife throughout your pregnancy we ensure continuity of care.' Women have access to their named midwife from 8am to 8pm every day, and round-the-clock access to another midwife if they need it. In the pilot scheme with NHS Wirral, One to One cared for women every step of the way apart from the actual delivery. But it has now secured the insurance it needs to provide deliveries as well. A statement from NHS Wirral said: 'NHS Wirral is pleased to be able to offer women in Wirral a choice in how and where they would like their maternity care to be delivered. 'One to One Northwest provides an opportunity for midwives to offer a different style of care from hospital based maternity units, free at the point of delivery. Claim: One to One's website says the firm offers 'a different style of care to hospital based maternity units' 'NHS Wirral continues to contract with local hospital-based maternity services providers (Wirral Hospital's Trust, Liverpool Women's Hospital, Countess of Chester Hospital). 'Therefore, women are free to choose the type of service and location of birth which they feel best meets their needs.' Jacque Gerrard, the Royal College of Midwives' director for England, said: 'The RCM is aware of the progress made by One to One as a maternity service provider, and we welcome it as an add-on service for choice for women. 'However, we have reservations regarding the impact upon jobs for midwives in the NHS. 'We have formed a professional relationship with One to One to gain recognition for our members, as they will be an alternative employer for midwives.' The contract will initially run for three years and follows the pilot scheme involving more than 200 mothers. One to One will provide all the scans and tests that an expectant mother needs in pregnancy, such as blood tests and the 12- and 20-week development scans. Joanne Parkington, founder and clinical director of One to One, said: 'We are thrilled that Wirral PCT has chosen to award One to One the contract to deliver our maternity care service to mothers-to-be in Wirral. 'The pilot and now the full contract are quite simply the first of their kind in England and Wales. Not convinced: Jacque Gerrard, the Royal College of Midwives director in England, said the deal could 'have an impact on jobs for midwives in the NHS' 'We believe they are the biggest thing to happen in midwifery since The Midwives Act more than 100 years ago. 'One to One aims to reinvent free midwifery services by delivering a personalised service that places women and their families at the heart of their care. 'Continuity of care has been shown to increase the normal birth rate, reduce hospital admissions and associated interventions, improve breastfeeding rates and boost women's satisfaction with the whole maternity service.' She said the service would 'relieve the pressure on the existing NHS system and introduce a specialised service for teenagers and the most vulnerable'. And the firm said that 'among the most exciting aspects of One to One's care is the encouragement women are given to consider a home birth if this is something they would prefer to a hospital birth subject to their circumstances and needs'.","Ten babies have already been born through private firm One to One .

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 10:28 AM on 6th December 2011 . Tory MP Zac Goldsmith was  last night attacked for using a reference to Auschwitz to criticise popular newspapers. The environmentalist made the provocative remark – described by one fellow MP as ‘pathetically stupid’ – at  a star-studded session of a Parliamentary committee investigating privacy  and injunctions. Sitting alongside actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, the MP rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of famous people simply so that they sell more copies and remain financially viable. Zac Goldsmith made the provocative remark - described by one fellow MP as 'pathetically stupid' - at a star-studded session of a Parliamentary committee investigating privacy and injunctions. He later conceded his words could have been chosen differently . 'Silly': Mr Goldsmith later said that no-one could genuinely believe he equated tabloids to concentration camps . (From the left) Steve Coogan, Hugh Grant and Max Mosley giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions at Portcullis House, London . He said: ‘No one said that Auschwitz should have been kept open because it created jobs.’ Some 1.1million people – most of them Jewish – died in the concentration camp in southern Poland during Hitler’s reign of terror in the early 1940s. Mr Goldsmith later insisted on Twitter that his point about newspaper sales was ‘valid’ but conceded he ‘could/should have made it citing something different’. Journalists hired private inquiry agents to amass ‘a veritable treasure trove of information’ about celebrities including Hugh Grant and his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley, the Leveson inquiry into Press standards heard yesterday. In 2003, investigators raided the office of a private agent used by national newspapers and found files detailing illegal searches for criminal records and car number plates, and other searches for addresses and ex-directory and mobile phone numbers. Other ‘targets’ were not publicly named, but the inquiry was told one newspaper had paid £800 for the June 2001 phone bill of an unnamed sportsman from a national team. Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘In relation to some of [the cases] it’s absolutely right that there may well be a public interest justification for the inquiry. In relation to others, however, it’s difficult if not impossible to see what public interest justification there could be.’ He was appearing before the joint . Commons and Lords committee – separate to the ongoing Leveson inquiry . into Press standards – because he had previously obtained a so-called . super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had . been leaked to the Press. He said newspapers that engage in immoral behaviour to boost sales should be allowed to go to the wall. But Labour MP Margaret Hodge, a member of the Parliamentary Committee Against Anti-Semitism Foundation, expressed outrage at his use of Auschwitz in his argument. ‘I just think it is a pathetically stupid comparison,’ she said. ‘He should think before he opens his mouth and hurls insults like that. It will cause a lot of distress to people.’ Last night a spokesman from the Holocaust Educational Trust said: ‘Zac Goldsmith has said that he could or should have cited a different example and we agree.’ Mr Goldsmith added on Twitter last night: ‘No one can genuinely believe I equated tabloids to concentration camps.’ He had earlier told the committee that . MPs found guilty of certain types of hypocrisy should be ‘barred from . office’, saying: ‘If you are in a position of authority such as an MP... it does mean you have to expect to be scrutinised very, very closely . and very regularly to ensure you are not engaging in hypocrisy, you are . not engaging in fraud, you are not abusing your position of power. Revelations: Mr Grant (left) told MPs of his battles with photographers while Mr Coogan said he had spent thousands trying to protect his privacy . Former motor-sports boss Mr Mosley also gave evidence to the committee . ‘If an MP for example were to campaign . on a ticket where he was incredibly homophobic and then it emerged . later that that person was in fact gay then I think newspapers would . have absolute right to rip that person to pieces – that wouldn’t be . enough. I think they should be barred from office.’ The committee also heard from Mr Grant who told how on one occasion photographers slashed every surface of his car with a knife. And Mr Coogan said that he had spent thousands of pounds in legal fees trying to defend his privacy. He said: ‘I at one point threatened an injunction against a newspaper that was going to publish a story about a member of my family, not about me, that was no way in the public interest. 'The correspondence that led to them not publishing cost me between £15,000 and £20,000. ‘In my pursuit of having had my phone hacked, that has cost me over £200,000 so far. I hope I will get it back one day – I don’t know – so it keeps me awake.’ Max Mosley, former boss of the FIA motor sports governing body, was also on the panel. He won damages for breach of privacy in 2008 after the News Of The World exposed his participation in a sado-masochistic orgy with prostitutes. QUENTIN LETTS sees four crusaders take on the Press . Four rich swordsmen yesterday visited Parliament to complain about the naked nerve of the media. All were cross that their sexual/marital misadventures had been paddled in and peddled by the jaunty British Press. Such was their displeasure that they demanded a privacy law. Their testimony was heard at times with giggling rapture by the new Privacy and Injunctions Joint Committee. The Prayer Book’s line ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’ may soon have to be Tippexed out and replaced by ‘Thou shalt not publish any article about adultery, unless first having checked with the participants that they are happy to have their horizontal activities discussed by the Daily Phwoarr’. Our stern quartet of trouser-droppers was: Steve Coogan, comedian; Hugh Grant, film actor; Max Mosley, sometime motor-racing johnny; Zac Goldsmith, MP for Richmond Park in the Conservative interest. Steve Coogan described stories about celebrities' sex lives as 'tawdry dirt' at the hearing . Mr Mosley is the one who had a run-in with the late News of the World after that newspaper disclosed his taste for sex parties, at one of which the laydees spoke German and wore prison uniforms. Mr Mosley, who wears a hearing aid and sounds ducal posh, is of the view that those who disapprove of his carry-on are dated moralisers. ‘This was actually a private orgy,’ he said, most indignant. How reassuring, in this day and age, to find a chap so insistent on manners. If Mr Mosley is of the view that gate-crashing has run amok in 21st-century Britain, I’m with the fella all the way, if that is the phrase. I wonder: did the invitations (not stiffies, please) to his private orgy say ‘RSVP’ and advise a time for carriages? Dress: optional. That sort of thing? Good for him! Hyacinth Bucket herself would admire such insistence on etiquette. But a curse on my frivolity. Does it not prove what our four crusaders, our four doughty warriors for the common folk, were saying? They envisaged an Olympian ideal of journalism in which seemingly every page is an in-depth expose of malpractice in hospitals and the social services. One of them (I forget which) complained that the very word ‘celebrity’ was ‘a pejorative term employed by the Press’. Plainly they have never received emails from showbusiness publicists imploring them to attend an event because it will have ‘a big celebrity turnout’. The MPs on the committee addressed the witnesses by their Christian names. The peers were more circumspect. Lord Dobbs (Con) gushed that the room’s public seats were packed (not true, as it happens). Crossbencher Lord Harries, former Bishop of Oxford, covered his face and closed his eyes during long passages of evidence. Disgust or an attack of the  post-prandial zeds? Both forgivable. Lord Gold (Con), having heard Mr Goldsmith suggest that MPs deserved less privacy than other people, was puzzled as to how this could be made to work in law. Mr Goldsmith agreed it was complicated. Mr Grant said freelance photographers had tried to run over the grandmother of a child he fathered. Mr Mosley, who at one point used the Mitfordesque term ‘people like us’, was asked about Press regulation. He wanted ‘a body’. The man is incorrigible! Actor Hugh Grant claims the press harassed the mother of his new born son after the birth . Mr Coogan had been to the word factory. He described stories about celebrities’ sex lives as ‘tawdry dirt’. He has the makings of a red-top sub-editor. Mr Goldsmith was perhaps the least dogmatic of the quartet but then went and stepped in a cowpat. He compared nosy newspapers to Auschwitz concentration camp. That he was sitting next to Oswald Mosley’s son when he said this somehow accentuated the looseness of the remark. Lord Thomas (Lib Dem) wondered why Mr Grant, having been bullied by out-of-control paparazzi, did not seek legal redress for harassment. Mr Grant, so far as I could follow, agreed that he had eventually done something like that. So why the need for a law on privacy which would probably help chiefly lawyers, sado-masochist freaks, libidinous actors and passing totalitarians?","MP later conceded he could have phrased his words differently .

"By . Rupert Steiner . Last updated at 7:41 AM on 9th December 2011 . One of Britain’s best-known shoe chains,  Barratts, has collapsed into administration for  the second time in two years. Some 3,840 jobs are at risk if a buyer cannot be found to rescue the 191 Barratts and Priceless Shoes stores and the 371 concessions within  department stores. The firm is the second casualty in two days on the High Street. On Wednesday outdoor clothing chain Black’s hoisted the ‘For Sale’ sign. Tough times: Nearly 4,000 jobs were under threat after the owner of shoe shops Barratts and Priceless Shoes collapsed into administration . Yesterday Deloitte was appointed . administrator of  Barratts. Spokesman Daniel  Butters said: ‘We will . continue  to trade the stores whilst we seek a buyer for all or part of . the  business as a going concern. ‘Barratts and Priceless Shoes have faced a downturn in trading as a result of the difficult  economic conditions. ‘This has been exacerbated by the unseasonably mild weather  in recent . weeks which resulted  in fewer sales across new winter lines.’ Under owner Stylo, Barratts and Priceless survived being put into administration in 2009 when 220 of its 380 stores closed . The business first went into administration in 2009 and Deloitte was . called in. Parent company Stylo threw in the towel and 220 of 380 stores . were shut. Christine Elliott, chief executive of the think-tank Institute for . Turnaround, said that while  Barratts is just one of many retailers . facing difficulties, the blame falls squarely at the door of management. Amid the many shoe factories of  Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company. W Barratt & Co invited customers to ‘Walk the Barratt Way’ in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal. The company’s Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold ‘the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt’s Factory Price’. In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory. The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand. In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts. But in 2009, Stylo put Barratts and its other brand Priceless shoes into administration, with 220 of its 380 stores closed down. The remaining 160 stores were bought by current Barratts owner Michael Ziff, former chairman of Stylo and a descendant of its founder. ‘This isn’t just an impact of the recession as some might think,’ she . said. ‘The failures have been down to retailers not putting  into place appropriate systems and making changes when the warning bells first . started ringing. ‘But this isn’t a sole example of a retailer going into administration for the first time,’ she added. ‘The reason they have failed again is that adequate changes to the operational business haven’t been made. ‘Shareholders and managers should be monitoring businesses and acting early to restructure before it is too late.’ Britain’s battered High Street chains have been struggling in recent months as austerity cuts bite into household budgets. The challenging consumer  environment is having a mixed effect on Britain’s retailers. The wealthy continue to splash out in upmarket stores such as Mulberry . and Burberry, while hard-up consumers dodge mainstream chains. Yesterday fashion chain Peacocks also looked like it was  adding to the . gloom, but refused to confirm rumours it is in talks to shut 200 stores. The discounter, which has 611 Peacocks stores and 394 Bon Marche shops, . said: ‘We continue to progress our re-restructuring discussions and . plans, with no decisions taken at this point.’ A raft of other household names – including HMV, JJB Sports and Game Group – are also thought to be struggling.","Administrator Deloitte says stores will continue to trade while it seeks a buyer for all or part of the business .

"Coldplay turned down option to duet with one of the final acts . Tulisa has said she will 'become a member of Little Mix' as she takes to the X Factor stage for the first time . Odds on Marcus Collins slashed following news of duet with superstar mentor Gary . Text voting has been suspended due to the shorter cut-off . period for votes . By . Holly Thomas and Andrea Magrath . Last updated at 6:31 PM on 8th December 2011 . In an unexpected twist, it has been reported that the JUDGES will duet with their own acts on Saturday night's show. The news comes after the beleaguered show's production team failed to secure the big-name artists previously featured in the highly-anticipated finals. So now it has been left to judges Kelly Rowland, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos, who will all take the stage this weekend at Wembley Arena to perform with the finalists. The pressure is on: Tulisa and her fellow judges will perform alongside their acts in this weekend's live X Factor final . A show source said: 'Once Louis Walsh's . acts were eliminated it became clear the three judges with acts left . were all current singers.' 'It's going to be more pressured than . ever. The acts will be singing in front of 10,000 people - and with . their mentors,' a source told the Sun. 'The judges will be nervous as well because the song could be the difference between winning and losing. Breaking new ground: Kelly Rowland and Amelia . Lily will perform the rousing number River Deep, while Marcus Collins . and Gary Barlow sing More Than A Woman . 'And . on top of that, Simon Cowell will be watching from LA. So the judges . are almost auditioning for their places on next year's show as well,' the source added. According to the Sun, Coldplay agreed to perform on the final, but declined a duet with one of the acts. And due to continued problems with her throat singer Adele who is at present recovering from surgery has now been forced to pull out of the show. Kelly and Amelia will perform the rousing number . River Deep, Mountain High, while N-Dubz star Tulisa will duet on a . mash-up of Alicia Keys' If I Ain't Got You and Empire State Of Mind with . Little Mix. Mentors under scrutiny: Because Simon Cowell will be watching from LA, the final may prove something of an audition for the judges for next year's show . Fashion statement: Lily wore a custom ring for her photo call today . At an X Factor press conference today, . Gary and Marcus confirmed that they will be performing the Billy Joel . classic, More Than A Woman. Louis Walsh will sit it out, amidst rumours . that the X Factor bosses cooked up the plan only after the music . manager's last act was voted out. But judge Gary also suggested a song for fellow judge Louis, saying he could sing I Will Survive. Tulisa has promised to become a 'member of Little Mix' on the night. 'A group has never won this competition, especially not a girl group even getting this far in the competition,' she said. 'I'm the youngest judge, it's my first year and I want to change X Factor history with these little muffins behind me.' Gary Barlow meanwhile has promised an . 'emotional evening' when he joins Marcus Collins to perform the Billy . Joel song Always a Woman. The Take That star declared that the final acts were the ones who 'had grown the most' throughout the competition. X Factor fans have been told via a message on the show's website they will not be able to vote by text for this weekend's final. Text votes returned to the show only two months ago after an absence of several years. The . 35p-a-time text option has been suspended due to the shorter cut-off . period for votes, meaning any delays on mobile networks could entail . thousands of wasted messages. Text voting was suspended in 2007 after a number of problems, but it returned in October and has been in place since then. X . Factor bosses explained: 'Because The X Factor final includes a vote . 'freeze' and therefore a shorter vote period, it is not possible for . text voting to be offered, as delays can be experienced within the . mobile networks at busy times which could result in text votes not being . received within the period the vote is open.' During . the 2005 X Factor final, 13.9% of votes cast by red button and text . arrived too late to be included, although it did not affect the outcome . of the show. A 2007 report by auditors Deloitte found 'serious technical issues' with red button and text voting in a number of ITV shows. 'I think they have all moved on incredibly well through the competition and that's why they are here now,' he said. Dermot O'Leary, the host of the hit ITV1 show, said it was impossible to pick a winner. 'It's my first year when we're going into the final and we don't really know who the favourite is,' the host admitted. News of the duets has improved the chances of one act at least, with odds on Marcus Collins to win trimmed from 11/4 to 5/2. Hills odds suggest this is the closest final in the history of the programme. Little Mix remain favourites with a slender lead at 6/5, while odds on Amelia Lily are 9/4. 'No disrespect to the other judges . but Gary Barlow is the superstar and Marcus is back in the game big . time,' said Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams. Hills expect to take over 100 bets a . minute for the last hour of the Finals show on Sunday, and  turnover a . seven figure sum on X factor 2011. Meanwhile research announced today by blinkx, the world’s largest and most advanced video search engine, shows that Marcus Collins and Amelia Lily are trailing behind Little Mix in the run-up to the final this Saturday night, with 27 per cent and 28 per cent respectively to the girl group's 45 per cent. Old hand: Gary is a regular on the X Factor stage having performed there many times . The research also revealed that that axed diva Misha B has risen in popularity, since her shock exit last Sunday exit, becoming the second most-searched contestant after Little Mix. Kitty Brucknell and Frankie Cocozza on the other hand have faded into obscurity, accounting for less than 1 per cent of video searches on the top X Factor contestants. Louis Walsh has backed Amelia to win, saying this week: 'There's something about Amelia, she's a ready-made pop star. I love the fact she can sing anything. This girl is a star.' The judge admitted he has mixed feelings coming into the final however, confessing that he wants to see his close friend Tulisa triumph. Show them how it's done: Kelly stormed the stage last week to perform her new single . Ever cheerful, Little Mix tweeted today: 'We owe everything to @officialtulisa . we've become so close and cannot think of a better person to perform . with in the final #XFactorDuet xxx' Clearly excited for the final, they . added: 'Rehearsing in Wembley Arena! Can't believe were here :) so who . would be your perfect #XFactorDuet ?xxx' Not to be outdone, Amelia Lily . posted: 'OMG!! words cannot describe how excited I am about dueting with . @KELLYROWLAND !! Dream come true #XFactorDuet xxxx' Old hand: Gary performed on the X Factor final last year with Take That . And always upbeat Marcus Collins . wrote; 'I feel so privileged to be doing a duet with @GBarlowOfficial on . the weekend. He has been such an inspiring mentor. So excited! #XFactorDuet' Having been a favourite to win until days ago, it appears comeback girl Amelia has run into a fresh spot of bad luck. The 17-year-old is reportedly suffering . from laryngitis and exhaustion- which certainly won't help her voice to . stand up against vocal powerhouse  Kelly during their duet. X Factor favourites: Take That also performed with 2006 winner Leona Lewis . The . duets in the final will be the first time that Tulisa has taken to the X . Factor stage, while Kelly performed on last weekend's results show. Gary is an old hand, having performed on the show during last year's final and alongside 2006 winner Leona Lewis.

"Stylist, who worked on hit show Gossip Girl, had turned to thank pilot and was caught in propeller's blade . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:26 AM on 8th December 2011 . A model and fashion blogger who was horrifically injured after walking into a spinning plane propeller has taken her first steps after the accident. A post on Lauren Scruggs' Caring Bridge website reveals she had managed 30 steps five days after she inadvertently walked into the propeller at a private airport in Dallas, Texas. The 23-year-old suffered a skull fracture, brain injury, severed left hand and could still lose her left eye in the horrific incident. Scroll down for video . On the scene: Lauren Scruggs, with her father Jeff and mother Cheryl who held her daughter while they waited for an air ambulance after she caught in the propeller of a plane . Family: Lauren (left) with her father Jeff and twin sister Brittany is surrounded by loved ones at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas . On Monday, she made a further step in her recovery after speaking for the first time. Under the headline 'Lauren walks!', a post from yesterday reads: 'This morning... the physical therapist assisted Lauren walking for the first time. 'Once she got halfway there, she said ""30"". Not sure what she meant, [her family] asked her what that means, she replied ""steps!"" 'What a praise, she was counting every step she took!' But the model faces a long period of recovery as she has already undergone several emergency surgeries on her face and shoulder. Trauma: The parents of Lauren Scruggs, Jeff and Cheryl, speak outside Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, about the extent of their daughter's horrific injuries . The update added: 'The left eye is still non-responsive, the doctors will continue monitoring it for the next few days. 'Please pray [for] Lauren as she begins to learn the extent of her injuries.' She is believed to have been returning to the two-seater plane to thank the pilot when she accidentally walked into the propeller. Her father Jeff told Good Morning America: 'They're telling us it's going to be a long recovery. Obviously she's had a lot of trauma to her head, and she lost her left hand and her left eye is questionable. 'We're praying she'll regain her sight.' Tragic: Miss Scruggs suffered serious facial injuries when she climbed out of a 2011 Aviat Husky at the private airport in Texas (library picture) In the city: Lauren Scruggs has been working to build up her own fashion website and held interviews at New York Fashion Week . Mother Cheryl was overcome with emotion as she recounted the ordeal. She said: 'I was inside, and someone came in and told me she had gotten hit. I was there until the care flight got there. 'I was just able to hold her and… that's the toughest part of it all, just seeing her waiting there and waiting for the help. All I could do was tell her that I love her.' Family friend Janee Harrell said: 'They landed and Lauren was getting off the plane so they could pick up another passenger. It was dark... we are thinking that Lauren came back to thank the pilot, and didn't see that the propeller was winding down.'

According to RadarOnline, Lynn Lunsford, Mid-States Public Affairs Manager with the Federal Aviation Administration,said that an integral part of the investigation into exactly what happened is why the propeller was still moving when Miss Scruggs got off the plane. 'It appears that the pilot left the engine running at idle while she exited the plane to switch places with another passenger. That's one of the aspects of the investigation,' he told RadarOnline. The pilot has not yet been identified but he is thought to have been a friend of Lauren's and recently purchased the plane. Ms Scruggs, from the suburban area of Plano in Dallas, was taken to the Parkland Memorial Hospital where her devout Christian family, including her mother Cheryl, father Jeff and twin sister Brittany, gathered at her bedside.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:19 PM on 1st December 2011 . Country singer Mindy McCready is in Nashville and says she will probably not be able to bring her five-year-old son back to Florida to fulfil a judge's order - because she is nearly seven months pregnant with twins. McCready said today that she and her mother have had a long custody battle over Zander. Her mother was awarded guardianship of the boy in 2007. Florida Department of Children and Families said a missing person report was filed with Cape Coral police on Tuesday night after McCready took Zander from her father's home. Missing: Former country music star Mindy McCready, seen here in a 2007 mugshot, has gone missing with her five year old son Zander . A statement released today from the troubled star's publicist revealed the pair are 'safe, healthy and comfortable'. 'The 5-year-old boy has been with his . mother for more than 30 days,' the statement continued. 'Law enforcement . officials spoke with the child and saw Zander via Skype yesterday.' On Tuesday, DCF discovered that . McCready and the boy were not at her father's home and a judge ruled she . must return the boy voluntarily by 5pm. Thursday or risk an arrest . warrant. McCready earlier denied 'stealing' her . child and issued a statement saying: 'I am working with lawyers to try . to get all this straightened out.' Mindy lost custody of Zander, seen here in 2009, left, and in the arms of Rosie . O'Donnell in 2006 at three months old, after several run-ins with the law . She told Access Hollywood: 'I did not . steal my child, as it would be impossible for me to kidnap what already . belongs to me! There never was any missing persons report and never an . Amber Alert.' The 36-year-old, who has been jailed twice and reportedly attempted suicide four times, does not have custody of the toddler. A Florida judge has now given McCready until Thursday to return the boy. The singer, who appeared on Celebrity . Rehab with Dr Drew in season three, went missing after an allowed visit . with her son at her father's home. McCready's mother was granted custody of Zander after McCready's long line of run-ins with the law. Ex-boyfriend Billy McKnight is the father of MCready's son . DCF . spokesman Terry Field said the agency requested an emergency pickup order, and a judge said McCready must . return the boy by 5pm Thursday. A former country music chart topper, . McCready's life spiralled out of control in 2004, and has since suffered . domestic abuse, been arrested on drug and DUI charges and made several . reported attempts at suicide. MCready's . first run-in with the law came in early 2004, when she attempted to buy . powerful pain killer Oxycotin using a fake prescription in Nashville, . Tennessee. McNight was arrested after he tried to choke her in 2005 . After pleading . guilty, she was later fined $4,000, ordered to perform 200 hours of . community service, and slapped with a three year suspended sentence. In May 2005, McCready's ex-boyfriend . and the father of her child Zander, Billy McKnight, was arrested and . charged with attempted murder after hitting and trying to strangle the singer. Shortly after splitting with McKnight, she later attempted suicide the following July. Adding to her woes, a warrant was issued for McCready, after she had violated her probation. It . stemmed from two separate incidents in both May and July 2005, where she was charged . with driving on a suspended license, identity theft, unlawful use of . transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution. She was later arrested in Florida and . returned to Tennessee, where she went in front of a jury who once again . charged her for violating her probation. The former star, who was pregnant with . McKnight's baby, later allegedly tried to commit suicide again in September 2005. Troubles: Mindy has been arrested five times, here is another one of her mugshots in 2005 . Following Zander's arrival in March 2006, it appeared that McCready was on the road to recovery. However . after a reported physical argument with her mother in July 2007, she was . arrested and charged with assault and resisting arrest. McCready was later sentence to one year in jail, but was released just three months later in December. After nearly half a year trouble free, McCready once again violated her probation. Reality show: In 2009, McCready took part in reality TV . show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which was aired the following year . in January and February . Sentenced to jail for the second time, she served 30 days of a 60 day sentence, and was released on good behaviour in October 2008. Just under two months later in December, she reportedly attempted suicide for the third time. In 2009, McCready took part in reality TV show  Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which was aired the following year in January and February. The 53-year-old addiction specialist treated the singer for substance abuse and she later appeared on The View to discuss her road to recovery and her attempt to salvage her music career. Speaking out: McCready appeared on The Dr. Oz show on U.S television last year, to discuss her troubles . McCready later released her fifth studio album, I'm Still Here, in March 2010. However, shortly after, she allegedly had another overdose. McCready's fall from grace came after her success in the country music industry. In 1996, McCready's LP Ten Thousand Angels sold over two million records, going platinum twice.","McCready's mother has guardianship of five-year-old Zander .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 11:24 PM on 9th December 2011 . Murdered: Highlander Scott McLaren, 20, was shot dead when he went to look for his night vision goggles, the inquest heard . A soldier was executed by the Taliban after leaving his base in the middle of the night to look for missing kit, an inquest heard yesterday. Highlander Scott McLaren walked away from the safety of his checkpoint to try to find a pair of night vision goggles. But as the 20-year-old hunted for the valuable equipment he was captured by insurgents, tortured and killed. He was shot five times in the head with an automatic rifle before his semi-naked body was dumped in a river three miles from Checkpoint Salaang in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand. Highlander McLaren’s body was found by British troops after a  17-hour manhunt involving hundreds of servicemen, including U.S. special forces. The soldier, from the 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, had been ‘concerned’ about the missing night vision goggles, the coroner was told. Highlander McLaren went to retrieve the goggles, which had been left by another soldier at a nearby vehicle checkpoint. His unit had been warned about the importance of looking after their kit and why it was vital it did not fall into enemy hands. The soldier, from Edinburgh and on his first tour of duty, later mentioned going to bring back the goggles but a comrade told him there was ‘no point’ because they were due to go on patrol a few hours later. But shortly after completing his sentry duty at 2am on July 4, Highlander McLaren was caught on CCTV walking out of the base wearing full body armour and carrying his SA-80 assault rifle. However instead of crossing a canal bridge to get to the vehicle checkpoint, he wandered off in the opposite direction. He was discovered missing an hour later as his unit prepared to go on patrol. At 5pm, his body was found face down in the river. Afghanistan tragedy: The 20-year-old's father James McLaren looks on as his body is repatriated following the death on July 4 . David Ridley, the Wiltshire and . Swindon Coroner, recorded that Highlander McLaren had been ‘assaulted, . tortured and ultimately executed’ by insurgents. He said: ‘Quite clearly Scott was . concerned as regards the missing goggles and talked of going back to the . checkpoint where they were last seen. ‘But the evidence, and in particular . the CCTV imagery, points quite clearly to Scott heading off in an . entirely different direction. It is unclear what Scott was doing that . night and sadly the only person who could help us is no longer with us.’ The inquest heard that two weeks . before his death Highlander McLaren had become emotional and told a . sergeant that he kept ‘messing up’. Sergeant Finn Beary said: ‘I said . “You’re only a young lad and this is your first tour”. He didn’t give . any indication what he was messing up. It seemed like he had been . putting a lot of pressure on himself.’ Grief: Kirsty McLaren, the soldier's sister, is seen during his funeral in Edinburgh. Yesterday a coroner ruled he was unlawfully killed . Captain Calum MacLeod, commanding the . soldiers at the base, said that after the goggles were mislaid the unit . had received a ‘b******ing’ from second-in-command Corporal Douglas . Young. Captain McLeod said: ‘I explained to . them why it was important we looked after our kit and what would happen . if it got into enemy hands. ‘The last thing you think of is that . someone is going to walk into the middle of enemy-held territories. Everybody was clear about the threat of the enemy in the area of the . base.’ After the execution, one insurgent boasted how he was rewarded with cash and a motorbike for the attack. Captain MacLeod stressed that no . individual was to blame for the loss of the kit. ‘When you are part of a . team, you must take responsibility as a team,’ he said.","Highlander Scott McLaren, 20, was shot five times .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:08 PM on 3rd December 2011 . Country singer Mindy McCready was found hiding in a closet with her five-year-old son last night after defying a court order to return him to legal guardian. Police raided the Arkansas home of Ms McCready's boyfriend at around 8pm after tracking the pair down. The multi-platinum-selling recording artist has been accused of stealing the boy from her mother, who has had custody of him since 2007, during a recent visit to her Florida home. Found: Authorities have taken Mindy McCready's son Zander from her and into custody. The singer is seen here in a 2007 mugshot . Mindy lost custody of Zander, seen here in 2009, left, and in the arms of Rosie . O'Donnell in 2006 at three months old, after several run-ins with the law . A judge had signed an order for the singer's son, Zander, to be taken into custody if he was not returned to his legal guardian by 5pm on Thursday. Florida Department of Children and Families spokeswoman Terri Durdaller said that her agency was working with Arkansas state officials to bring the youngster back to his maternal grandmother in Florida. Officials say he's safe and in good health. Baby daddy: Ex-boyfriend Billy McKnight is the father of MCready's son . Gayle Inge, Zander's grandmother and McCready's mother, was tearful when she spoke about the news last night. 'I'm real excited that he's safe,' she said. 'But I can't explain what this is like. We feel for Mindy and we feel for Zander.' Mrs Inge said that her son - McCready's half-brother - texted McCready, who responded with a text which said her mother would never see her again. McNight was arrested after he tried to choke her in 2005 . 'I want to wrap my arms around her and tell her that I love her,' Mrs Inge said, adding that her daughter and grandson were found by authorities 'hiding in a closet.' The evening's developments capped a days-long struggle between McCready - who is seven months pregnant with twins - and  child welfare authorities and her own mother. Authorities say McCready - who turned 36 on Wednesday - took the boy during a visit late last month to her father's Florida home, where she was allowed to visit the boy. McCready's parents are divorced. A Florida judge signed an order on Thursday telling authorities to take the boy into custody and return him. It's not yet clear whether the singer could face criminal charges. McCready said earlier in the week that she would not bring her son back from Tennessee, where she has a home, despite violating the custody arrangement. Troubles: Mindy has been arrested five times, here is another one of her mugshots in 2005 . She said that her son had suffered abuse at her mother's house, a claim that Mrs Inge vehemently denies. 'I'm doing all this to protect Zander, not stay out of trouble,' McCready wrote in an email to The Associated Press (AP) on Thursday. 'I don't think I should be in trouble for protecting my son in the first place.' Reality show: In 2009, McCready took part in reality TV . show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which was aired the following year . in January and February . McCready told the AP on Wednesday night she was in Tennessee and could not travel because she is pregnant. The boy's father, Billy McKnight, told NBC's Today show on Friday that he spoke on the phone with McCready and their son after the judge's 5 p.m. Thursday deadline expired. 'He did sound healthy and ok. He wasn't crying or scared,' Mr McKnight said about their son. 'I think she believes she has a case and doesn't realise she's pushing her luck on this one,' he said. Speaking out: McCready appeared on The Dr. Oz show on U.S television last year, to discuss her troubles . McCready and her mother have had a long custody battle over the boy. McCready had provided a series of emails to the AP with Lee County Judge James Seals' ruling to return the boy. 'Mom has violated the court's custody order and we are simply restoring the child back into our custody,' the judge wrote. 'Nothing more. Nothing less. The court makes no judgment about whether Mom will or will not competently care for the child while in her custody. It only wants the child back where the court placed him.' McCready found fame in the mid-1990s when she moved to Nashville at the age of 18, armed with only her karaoke tapes. Her first album, 'Ten Thousand Angels,' sold two million copies. Her next four albums weren't as successful. Her personal troubles began encroaching on her professional success. According to her website, she suffers from severe depression. In August, she filed a libel suit against her mother and the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc.,over a story published in the tabloid newspaper that quoted Inge. And in 2008, McCready was admitted to a hospital after police said she cut her wrists and took several pills in a suicide attempt.",Authorities working to take the youngster back to his maternal grandmother in Florida .
"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 5:47 PM on 9th December 2011 . A girl who had a violent fit and collapsed during a cross-country race died because of a ""significant"" delay getting her to hospital, a coroner ruled today. Shannon Powell, 14, was competing in Trent Park, in north London in January this year, and the coroner said that neglect by race organisers contributed to her death. First-aiders rushed to help the teenager and an ambulance was dispatched to the scene at noon, North London Coroner's Court heard. Paramedics refused to carry 14-year-old schoolgirl Shannon Powell, who . fatally collapsed during a cross country run, due to 'health and . safety', an inquest heard . A post-mortem examination found she had a rare heart disorder called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. North London coroner Andrew Walker . said: 'There was a significant delay for Shannon getting to hospital, . which caused her death in the sense that there was an opportunity for . rendering care which, if taken, would have prevented the death. 'The ambulance arrived at 12.06 and then spent 30 minutes trying to find the address, arriving at 12.36. 'The crew could not drive to where she lay as the gate and height restriction barrier were in place and locked.' The ambulance was able to reach Shannon when a passer-by unlocked the gate. Mr Walker said: 'The ambulance could not have arrived at the scene any earlier, given the information they had. 'Although the provision of first aid . for the event had been considered and the team of first-aiders had been . employed, little or no thought had been given to what should happen if . an ambulance needed to attend a person at the event. 'All but one of the gates to the park . were locked and there was a mistaken belief that all London Ambulance . Service vehicles had keys they could use to unlock the gates.' He added that no risk assessment had . taken place for the site for the provision of medical care and there . were no clear details available to guide an ambulance to the correct . gate. He said: 'The instructions given to the marshals concerning what to do should a person need an ambulance were inadequate.' Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Walker said Shannon's . death was contributed to by neglect. Shannon's parents Wayne and Simone Powell, pictured leaving North London . Coroners Court yesterday, were distraught at hearing of their daughter's . final moments . Shannon Powell collapsed during an event at Trent Park, in Enfield . Wayne Powell, Shannon's father, tried to read a statement to the court on behalf of her family. He was overcome with emotion and struggled to get the words out as his eyes welled up and a court clerk had to take over. The statement said: 'We find it hard to understand why there was such a delay in getting Shannon to hospital and we have been yearning for the truth about what happened in those long hours in Trent Park before Shannon finally reached hospital. 'We would like to thank everyone for attending Shannon's inquest to allow us the chance to learn what happened to our beautiful girl on that fateful day. 'Her love for life was great and she grabbed all opportunities that came her way - she is a much-loved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin, loyal friend, and losing her has devastated the family and the community.' Talented runner and swimmer Shannon Powell was a member of Ealing, Southall and Middlesex Athletics Club . Earlier, the inquest heard Shannon was a talented athlete and had seemed 'fine' before the race. She . was running well but when she failed to cross the finish line members . of Ealing, Southall and Middlesex Athletics Club, including her coach, . went to look for her. Team manager Tracey Gould found her first after spotting a group of people on top of the hill wearing high visibility jackets. Shannon's last words to her were ""sorry"" for not finishing the race, the inquest heard. She told the inquest: 'I thought there was a problem with her stomach or she had twisted her ankle but as I made my way closer I could see there was somebody on the ground. When I got there I could see it was Shannon. 'Her breathing was very fast as if she had just stopped running. When I first got to her she opened her eyes. She said sorry for not finishing the race.' Miss Gould said she stayed with Shannon, who by this point was slipping in and out of consciousness. 'Obviously something had happened which was very serious,' Miss Gould told the coroner. 'When she opened her eyes they were fixed. Something had happened which worried me at that time because she couldn't focus. She was wide eyed.' Shannon, a Year 10 pupil at Northwood College in Middlesex, died before she could be taken to hospital. She was three weeks away from her 15th birthday.","Ambulance arrived six minutes after 999 call but struggled for 30 minutes to find address .

Britain's high streets and shopping malls finally saw a Christmas retail boom today as shoppers turned out in force to take advantage of early sales. Queues formed outside stores as retailers slashed their prices in the hope of kick-starting the big festive spend. Traders in Oxford Street and Regent Street in central London said they believed they would make £180million in sales just from today after both streets were pedestrianised to attract an estimated one million shoppers. En masse: Crowds fill Oxford Street this evening after the famous shopping road and Regent Street were closed to traffic in a bid to attract an estimated one million people . Flooded: Customers spent the day hunting out bargains along Oxford Street. Traders there and in Regent Street are hopeful of turning over £180million from today alone . Bagging a bargain: These gleeful girls trot down Oxford Street arm-in-arm with a sackful of gifts today as retailers offered mega discounts to drive revenue . Car parks filled up, and cafes and restaurants were packed at shopping centres in cities all over the country on what is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Store chains including Marks & Spencer, fashion retailer French Connection and shoe chain Barratts were offering discounts of up to 50per cent aimed at getting bargain hunters to part with their cash. Queues had formed outside shops such as John Lewis and Selfridges when they opened for business. Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), which operates 14 malls including the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Lakeside in Thurrock, and St David's in Cardiff, reported that record numbers of shoppers had taken advantage of offers such as a three-for-two on everything at accessories shop Accessorize and discounts of up to 50% at Past Times gift stores. Festive feel: After a poor November, retailers hope to generate better cash flow in the run-up to Christmas by offering big discounts . All four one: A family gets into the spirit of Christmas this afternoon. Retailers say retro games, electronics and products for the cold are doing well . Trevor Pereira, commercial director at CSC, said: 'It has been really busy across all the centres today and we have seen record numbers of shoppers out in force with cars parks and restaurants being full. 'Our retailers are telling us that retro games such as mini-pinball and Jenga are selling well and that shoppers are being discerning in their purchases.' Richard Dickinson, chief executive of New West End Company, which represents 600 traders in Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street, said it has been a 'good sunny shopping day' in the West End. 'November was not great for retailers but today a lot of people have driven in to get good winter products for the cold. Electronics are doing well too,' he said. A spokesman for Meadowhall, in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, said sales at the centre had started earlier than they would traditionally. Sea of shoppers: Queues had formed outside shops such as John Lewis and Selfridges before they had even opened for business . Two-gether: These girls show off their spoils after a day on the high street taking advantage of early sales . He said: 'I think that's a UK-wide phenomenon. But certainly that's what we're seeing in the centre.' Christmas shoppers at Braehead, one of Scotland's biggest shopping centres, also queued up before the shops opened. Peter Beagley, the general manager of Braehead, said the car park was full and buses were 'choc-a-bloc'. He said: 'I reckon it's a case of the early bird gets the gifts they really want. People were out waiting for the shops to open to make sure they can buy the presents they've chosen to give to friends and family.' In Edinburgh hundreds of people queued from 6am in the cold to be the first through the doors of a new branch of Primark in Princes Street. The first person in line was Laura Hamilton, 25, from Newtongrange, Midlothian, who said it was snowing heavily when she turned up at 6am. She said: 'We've been waiting for Primark for so long and the store will bring so much to Edinburgh. I can't wait to snap up a few bargains.' The most popular present on children's lists to Father Christmas this year is Apple's iPad tablet followed by the Xbox and Nintendo Wii video game consoles, according to department store Selfridges.","Record numbers seek out cut-price deals at UK's biggest shopping centres .

The Deputy Prime Minister backed the Prime Minister’s negotiating position after being telephoned by him in the early hours of yesterday to discuss the unfolding events. But Mr Clegg apparently believed the veto would not be necessary, as France and Germany would roll over and make concessions to Britain to maintain treaty change at the level of all 27 EU countries. Showing the strain: Nick Clegg (right) has come under fire from his own party after backing David Cameron's decision to veto the eurozone rescue package (file picture) In Europe's periphery? Mr Cameron looks anxiously at German Chancellor Angela Merkel at yesterday's eurozone summit in Brussels after wielding the veto . The failure of the deal and use of the veto has left the overwhelmingly pro-EU Lib Dems close to a state of crisis – with senior ministers said to be ‘deeply concerned’. They fear the Coalition will be put under unprecedented strain and sources warned that any Tory moves to loosen ties with the EU further would lead to open revolt among the Lib Dem membership. Former party leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘There will be a huge price to pay and, as a consequence, the foreign policy priorities of this country for the past 40 years has gone down the plughole in a single night. 'That foreign policy has now been hijacked by the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party aided by a Prime Minister who was not prepared to stand up for the national interest.’ Damning criticism: Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott (left) said it was a 'black day for Britain and Europe’, while former party leader Lord Ashdown (right) said there will be a 'huge price to pay' further down the line . He told the Guardian: ‘As a consequence . we have lost control of the European agenda and the Prime Minister has . lost control of the demands for a referendum. This has been Gallic . payback time for the way in which Cameron went around Europe lecturing . Sarkozy on what to do.’ Prominent Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close political ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, described the summit outcome as ‘a black day for Britain and Europe’. He said: ‘We are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken. With the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff, we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the City of London above our vital national interest of working closely together with Germany and France to keep our economy and jobs all over Britain safe.’ Lorely Burt, chairman of the Lib Dem parliamentary party, said it was unclear why Mr Clegg had agreed to the decision. She said: ‘I gather Cameron phoned our illustrious leader before he decided to do this. There must have been reasons. I don’t see them at the moment.’ Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said the UK . was facing a ‘worst-case scenario’ of isolation in Europe. Mr Horwood . said the result was not the ‘ideal outcome from a Lib Dem point of . view’. Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of leaving Britain 'on the sidelines of Europe' Furious: Mr Miliband, a staunch pro-European, said Mr Cameron caved into the demands of Tory Eurosceptics . But he blamed Tory Eurosceptics for pushing the Prime Minister into a corner. He added: ‘It will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the European single market and the future of the European economy.’ Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies accused the Government of adopting a ‘xenophobic’ approach to Europe. ‘Far from keeping Britain strong, Cameron has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table,’ he said. ‘By seeking to protect bankers from regulation, he has betrayed Britain’s real interests and done nothing in practice to help the City of London. ‘The fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us.’ Fellow MEP Sharon Bowles warned the UK face ‘revenge attacks’ from the rest of Europe. She said: ‘There is already mood music within the parliament that if the UK wants it some people will take a great deal of satisfaction in making sure we don’t have it.’ By contrast, Mr Cameron’s position in his own party has been greatly strengthened – though he will now face renewed demands for a referendum as the other members of the EU forge a fiscal union. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was tempting to say well done to Mr Cameron, but insisted he had 'gained nothing' London Mayor Boris Johnson – who piled . pressure on Mr Cameron in the run-up to the summit, and has been . increasingly touted as a leadership rival – said: ‘David Cameron has . played a blinder and he has done the only thing that was really open to . him to do.’ Eurosceptic MPs cheered the result – but made it clear that they would step up the pressure on Mr Cameron at Westminster to go further in distancing Britain from the heart of the new European project. Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who quit the Government over Europe in October, hailed Mr Cameron’s stance as a ‘paradigm shift in our relationship with the EU’, which made a referendum more likely. Temporary truce: Boris Johnson, increasingly touted as a leadership rival, said Mr Cameron had 'played a blinder' He added: ‘There is going to be inevitable pressure for further repatriation of substantial powers, and people may well be asked before the end of this parliament for their view on an in-or-out referendum.’ The leading Eurosceptic Bill Cash said the decision to wield the veto was a ‘historic moment for Europe. He added: ‘We are now embarked on a very serious, responsible path towards renegotiating the whole of our treaty relationship.’","Deputy PM had backed David Cameron's decision to use veto on rescue plan .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 6:58 PM on 9th December 2011 . Niall Hall former aide to the Queen Mother, had his car stolen and was kidnapped in South London . A former aide to the Queen Mother today told how he feared he would die when he was kidnapped by a hooded gang who battered him, tied him up and held a knife to his face. Niall Hall, 49, told a court of the terrifying ordeal that saw his head and face slammed against the pavement during a violent struggle before he was bundled into the back of his own car and taken to a lock up near his home in Battersea, south west London. Kingston Crown Court heard how Mr Hall was 'targeted' by the gang of thugs who thought he looked like a 'rich man' and stole his £1,000 Tag Heuer watch and forced him to hand over his bank card PIN numbers on February 1. During the hour long assault, Mr Hall had two knives held to to his stomach and face, had his hands tied up with an iPod cable from his Land Rover and was made to strip naked and change clothes as the kidnappers tried to cover their tracks. Martin Dias, 29, Aaron Miller, 21, Derwin Ellis, 30, and Brian Gilbert, 19, are accused of carrying out the vicious assault, which saw them steal the watch, cufflinks and withdraw £470 from Mr Hall's bank account. Giving evidence today, smartly dressed Mr Hall, said he was 'very, very afraid' as he was ambushed by three of the men outside his Battersea home in south west London as he parked his Land Rover Freelander. The former Army captain tried to flee his captors as they ordered him in to his car and put his coat over his heard, only to be tackled to the ground by the largest of the three, smashing his head. He said: 'I suddenly became aware of three people around me. They were all men and were large, Afro Caribbean men. 'They were right upon me and they were moving at speed towards me. 'I really didn't have time to do anything. I started to move because I was fairly certain I was about to be assaulted. 'I was grabbed, I was seized and I was pushed to the ground. I was laying on my back with my arms and legs in the air, I suppose not unlike a dead insect. I was asked to hand over my watch and wallet.' Terrified Mr Hall told how he immediately obeyed, but tried to flee once again when he was ordered to get in the car. The Queen Mother with Niall Hall on the right who was an aide in the 1980s. He was 'carjacked' and stripped naked at knifepoint by three robbers . He said: 'I got a couple of feet at most, I felt as if the soles of my shoes had turned into iceskates. I was knocked to the ground in a violent manner.  'My head and face hit the road and my left eye went black. 'It was bruised and filled with blood. I couldn't see out if it. 'I saw a knife being held to my face by the person who had tackled me to the ground.  'It was a short blade, about five to six inches long, and probably about an inch and a half in width. It was an old steel mottled sort of blade. 'It was made pretty clear I was to comply with what I was told. Two people dragged me to to the car. I was dragged along by my knees. It was quite painful by this stage. 'I had a bleeding eye, cut legs - I was then bundled in to the back of the car. I was put in the rear passenger side. 'I was being held down on the back seat, across two of the people. I had a knife held to my throat and a knife held towards my stomach. 'It was along the lines of 'keep quiet, do what we say unless you want to be stabbed'. 'I could feel the cold steel upon my neck. I felt very very afraid.' The violent robbers then drove him to the nearby lockup on the Surry Lane estate, Battersea, south west London.  'I had time to reflect on what was happening. I really though that I was going to die,' he said. Mr Hall was then ordered out his car and 'frogmarched' to the lock up, where he was tied up and forced to reveal his bank details. He said: 'They removed everything, card by card. They said 'you must be a very rich man'.' After handing over his PIN numbers, two of the men left to get the cash and clean up the car, while one stayed to guard Mr Hall. Mr Hall added he heard someone saying 'I want to f**king kill you, I want to f**king kill you' and believed it to be his captor, until realising it was actually a ring tone. When the men returned, having withdrawn £470 from Mr Hall's bank account at a Tesco's ATM, he was stripped naked and forced to change as the gang tried to hide the evidence. He was then driven to Chelsea, just across the river, and dumped on Cheyne Walk, where he was told to stare at a wall for ten minutes.  But he managed to flag down cyclists for help and was taken to hospital. Mr Hall told Kingston Crown Court (pictured) he feared for his life during the hour-long ordeal in February this year . He suffered a fractured left eye socket, damage to his eye, acute bleeding to the left side of his brain, a chipped tooth, cuts, swelling and bruising. Police recovered CCTV images showing another member of the gang, Kizzy Miller, 32, driving to cash points to take money out of Mr Hall's account, jurors heard. Detectives also found the lock-up splattered in blood where the victim's clothes had been dumped. Dias, Ellis and Gilbert deny kidnap and robbery. Kizzy Miller denies a charge of encouraging or assisting the offences. Aaron Miller has pleaded guilty to kidnap and robbery. Mr Hall acted as an aide to the Queen Mother in the 1980s when his duties included collecting the armfuls of bouquets and cards delivered to her London home, Clarence House, on her birthday and organising her annual St Patrick's Day photocall with the Irish Guards. The case continues.","Niall Hall 'battered, stripped, and tied up during hour-long assault'

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:32 PM on 10th December 2011 . Guilty: Berta Manzanero, 71, pictured arriving at court yesterday, was fined £300 after she admitted stealing the flowers from the grave in Barking . A woman who stole flowers from a child’s grave wept as she was brought to justice yesterday. A hidden camera caught Berta Manzanero, 71, taking four potted plants worth £15. After the images were published, Manzanero’s disgusted daughter phoned police and identified her. Yesterday she was fined £300 after admitting theft. She was supported by her son-in-law, but her daughter was not at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court in East London. The family of 11-year-old road crash victim Robert Stringer, who was killed more than 30 years ago, installed the camera after thieves targeted his grave at Rippleside Cemetery in Barkingside almost every fortnight for 18 months. They put up a sign pleading for the thefts to stop but it did not work, and others complained that they too had fallen victim. Last month, the camera recorded clear images of Manzanero as she knelt down to help herself to the floral tributes. The footage showed her taking the terracotta pots and their  contents and stuffing them into   large shopping bags before casually walking away. Yesterday Manzanero, who moved to Britain from Spain in 1962, admitted taking the flowers as she visited the graves of her husband and mother, but insisted she was not responsible for the other thefts. Prosecutor Ellen Warner said  Manzanero confessed what she had done to her daughter, who telephoned police. After being arrested at her home  in Dagenham, Essex, she told  officers she took the flowers because they were ‘nice’ and intended to return them. Manzanero’s solicitor Kaushik Ramdhary told the court that she suffered depression after her son, a City banker, committed suicide, leaving a wife and baby. This was soon followed by the deaths of her husband and mother. Mr Ramdhary said she visited the cemetery once a month and did not need the flowers because she has a ‘lovely garden at home’. Thief: Four pots of flowers, worth £15, were taken from Robert Stringer's grave Rippleside Cemetery. He died when he was 11 in the 1980s . Stolen: Berta Manzanero, who is a former NHS worker, is caught on camera bending down and taking the four flower pots . Getaway: She wanders off with the haul of flowers. The family of Robert Stringer set up the CCTV camera after a string of thefts from the grave . He said: ‘There was no need for her . to steal flowers to put on her own family’s grave. She is very, very . fond of flowers. On that particular day those four pots caught her eye. 'She turned back to look at them, she . picked them up and put them in her bag. It was impulsive. She knows . what she has done is wrong and she knows that the family of the boy has . been very, very upset. She asks that her apologies be passed to them.’ Last night, Robert’s cousin, taxi . driver Stephen Rose, 37, said: ‘What she did was terrible and we’re glad . that she’s been brought to justice.’","Widow Berta Manzanero, 71, made an 'impulsive' decision to steal the £15 flowers from the grave .

Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi today told a court that photographs taken of him surrounded by women were an  attempt to make his home look 'like a harem'. The pictures published in the glossy Italian magazine Oggi showed the 75-year-old walking hand in hand with the women who . were described as 'Berlusconi's Angels'. They showed some sitting on his lap and in one snapshot he is pictured with his . eyes closed and his hand inside a woman's T-shirt. The images were printed over eleven pages which ran them under the headline: 'Berlusconi's Harem.' Unusually for Berlusconi - who is . currently involved in four trials - he appeared in court as a victim as . he brought the civil case against the former editor. It was later revealed all the women . were aspiring TV starlets with one being identified . as Angela Sozio, 39, a former Big Brother contestant. The media tycoon turned politician . told the court in Milan: 'Holding hands with my guests is something I do . all the time. It's normal for me to do that, to make my guests feel at . ease.' He added of the photographs, which were published in 2007 by Oggi's then editor Pino Belleri:  'The way they were presented as 'Berlusconi's harem' was totally different to reality.' The pictures were taken by Antonello Zappadu at Villa Certosa, Berlusconi's luxury home near Porto Rotondo on the island of Sardinia, a well known millionaire's playground where he has entertained several high profile international political guests over the years. Villa Certosa: Berluscon's luxury holiday home in Sardinia where he entertained women and was pictured by a magazine . Among them were Tony Blair and his wife Cherie who famously spent the weekend with Berlusconi in the summer of 2004, just hours after he had undergone a hair transplant and he was snapped alongside the couple wearing a bandanna. They were treated to a spectacular fireworks display which ended with the words 'Viva Tony' lighting up the night sky - and neighbours complaining about the noise from the eruption that was produced from a specially built fake volcano. Berlusconi added: 'The way the pictures were taken, they deliberately excluded images of male guests because the photographer was looking for a sale. Accusations: Prostitute Patrizia D'addario, left, claims she taped herself having sex with Berlusconi, who has been linked with Moroccan Karima El Mahroug . 'To take the pictures that he did he would have to have come onto the property - it would not have been possible any other way. 'My staff found that branches and flowers in the area where the photographer was had been broken and trampled of. 'The grounds and garden of villa Certosa are wonderful - I have the largest hibiscus in the world and there is also a working pizzeria, ice cream parlour and fairground. People who are my guests leave very reluctantly.' Prosecutor Alberto Nobili told the court the 15 photographs which had been published were 'taken illegally' and as such Mr Belleri was also guilty of wrongly receiving them. VIP guests: Cherie and then prime Minister Tony Blair stayed at Berlusconi's villa in Sardinia in 2004 . Berlusconi then told the lawyer defending Mr Belleri that he had no problem returning to give evidence as he was so regularly in the Milan court building 'I have an office' - a reference to his four ongoing trials including one for sex with an underage prostitute. Judge Maria Teresa Guadagnino adjourned the trial until next year and afterwards Berlusconi was clapped and cheered as he went shopping in a nearby street.","One snapshot showed former Italian PM with eyes closed and his hand inside woman's T-shirt .

Dana and Elizabeth Davis had spent nearly five gruelling days stranded in their car in the rugged Arizona mountains during a snowstorm when they finally realised they needed to venture out for help. The car had run out of petrol, and their rations of sandwiches, chocolate bars and juice were depleted. Dana, 86, bundled in multiple layers of clothing, put socks on his hands for warmth as he and 82-year-old Elizabeth started walking. What happened next became a story of incredible tragedy and survival. Elizabeth collapsed just 15 to 20 feet into the walk, her body in a weakened state after five days in the cold. Found: Dana Davis, 86 (right) was found walking along a remote road. His 82-year-old wife Elizabeth (left) had died when trying to hike to safety . Dana forged ahead, walking eight miles, . spending a night under a tree and leaving behind pieces of his wife's . knitting yarn to create a trail to her body. The former Boy Scout and World War II Navy vet was found by an officer . with the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation along a desolate, dirt . road and taken to a hospital, where he spoke with reporters Friday about . the ordeal. He had lost about weight and was covered with a white blanket, but . otherwise was in good condition, at the hospital in the mining community . of Globe. Found: Authorities found the couple's 2001 Buick on a remote road after an Arizona officer found Mr Davis walking alone on a trail . He hopes to be discharged from Cobre Valley Regional Medical Center on Saturday. The Albuquerque couple had been visiting with nephew Jim Mills in the . Phoenix suburb of Chandler and began their drive home December 1 along . U.S. 60 - a route that would take them through the Bosque del Apache . National Wildlife Refuge near Socorro, where Elizabeth had once been . president of a friend's group. The side trip was one of countless journeys they had made in their 60 . years together, visiting Asia, South America and the jungles of Borneo . to watch orangutans. But they accidentally ended up on a different highway. Realising their . mistake, the couple consulted a map and decided to take a forest road . that connects back to the main road. Snowed in: The couple was trapped in their stalled car for two separate snowstorms . ‘I should have turned around right then and gone about five miles back . to where I had turned in,"" Mr Davis said. The couple drove their Buick . for miles up the forest road, passing a sign that said ‘pavement ends’ but continuing on. Mr Davis said he wasn't worried, because he had driven the Alaska-Canadian Highway before it was paved. ‘So that's the second time I goofed,’ Davis said. The road became more and more impassable the farther they travelled. The car bottomed out several times, punching a hole in the transmission oil pan and making it impossible to drive anymore. They were stuck, miles from anywhere, with no mobile phone and no one knowing of their whereabouts. They knew they could be there for some time given the desolate nature of . the area. They had two sandwiches, four cookies, two chocolate bars and . two cans of juice. ‘We knew it would probably be a while before somebody found us, so we . started rationing ourselves right away,’ Mr Davis said at the news . conference next to his son and daughter, who live in the San Francisco . and Philadelphia areas. He was upbeat, but his wife was worried. She wrote letters to her children and grandchildren. They ran the engine at night to stay warm but eventually ran out of gas and decided to seek help. Off course: The couple veered off course because they wanted to visit Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge on their way back to Albuquerque . ‘She was pretty convinced she was not going to get out of there,’ said . Davis, who worked 40 years in aerospace engineering for General Electric . Co. and also served in the Navy during World War II. ‘Me, I'm pretty . stubborn. I was going to walk until I found someone.’ The walk was too much for his wife. After she collapsed and died, Mr Davis moved her body away from the road and resumed his walk. He hiked from 10am until sunset Tuesday and found a spot under a tree to spend the night. The next day, he started walking again in attempt to find any sense of . civilization. He encountered snow that was piled several feet high along . the road. Finally, an officer with the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation appeared in an SUV, and he was saved. His yarn and other markers led them back to his wife of more than 60 years. Authorities returned the fabric, and Davis displayed it Friday at the . news conference - a handful of red and blue pieces of yarn that he had . left on trees to mark the route. Remote: The couple did not have mobile phones with them, but they likely wouldn't have worked in such a remote location . When asked at the news conference how he is coping, Mr Davis said: ""It . really hasn't hit me that hard yet. ... I don't feel as though I really . realize she's gone."" The couple's son, Bob Davis, and daughter, Lani Sexton, said the letters their mother wrote are her legacy. ‘The letters to my kids, myself, my sister, her kids. It's almost like . she knew. She knew that that was it. The letters were very poignant,’ son Bob said. Both children, although devastated by the loss of their mother, beamed at their father. ‘It's amazing, don't you think,’ daughter Lani said. ‘He's 86, and I . think it bodes well for my brother and I, for our lives. Our family's . always had humour, and that's what gotten us through the last 36 hours . since we got to town here, and we're hugely proud.’","Elizabeth and Dana Davis spent five days stranded in rugged Arizona mountains before trying to walk to safety .

These are some of Britain’s most inspirational people who will help to carry the Olympic torch around the country next summer. Yesterday, 6,800 people were told they had been selected as ‘citizen torchbearers’ at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, after they were nominated by friends, family and colleagues. Inspirational: Lord Coe stands with just a handful of 6,800 'citizen torchbearers' who have been chosen to carry the Olympic flame for next year's Olympics . Chosen ones: Sarah Thomas, from Shrewsbury, left, has been picked to carry the torch, while 18-year-old Jess Colborn has been chosen after her amazing recovery from a stroke two years ago . Each bearer will carry the torch through their hometowns and villages during the 70-day relay across Britain. Among them is 18-year-old Jess Colborn, who had to learn to walk and talk again when she suffered a stroke two years ago. The A-Level student from Allenheads, Northumberland, feared she would never walk again when she was paralysed down the left side of her body and right side of her face. But after months of physiotherapy, she has almost fully recovered and now hopes to study medicine at university. She said: ‘Carrying the Olympic torch will be amazing. It will show just how far I have come. ‘The relay will be two years on from the stroke and will be a great way to celebrate.’ Fundraiser: Moira Starkey, 84, from Herefordshire, who has raised thousands for charity will carry the torch even though she uses two sticks to walk . She will be joined by 84-year-old Moira Starkey, who has raised thousands of pounds for a breast cancer support centre, Hereford Haven, through sales of her homemade jams and pickles. Miss Starkey, who walks with two sticks, completed her first marathon at the age of 83 last year, by walking 2,000 times around her town hall. Moria Starkey, 84, who will carry the torch . She said: ‘It took me three months, but my friends kept me going by bringing in tapes of my favourite classical music. ‘It’s a great honour to be asked to be a torchbearer – I just hope I don’t drop it.’ Miss Starkey, who has undergone two knee replacements, added: ‘After five laps of the town hall I would have a rest and a cup of tea and then carry on.’ Miss Starkey, of Storridge, Herefordshire, made so many jams for charity that she was invited to meet Prince Charles during a visit to the town. She said: ‘This week alone I have made 23 Damson jams, 21 strawberry jams, 15 marmalades and 10 lemon curds. Prince Charles approved of the lemon curd, he likes that best.’ Matt Short, 20, of Tonbridge, Kent, was a keen rugby and tennis player until he was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer at the age of 16 and had to have his leg amputated. Overcoming adversity: Holly Hamill from Northern Ireland battled cystic fibrosis before winning four golds at a national gymnastics championship, while Matt Short, a keen rugby player, had to have a leg amputated following a diagnosis with a rare bone cancer . The teenager, who has set up the Ewing’s Sarcoma Research Trust, says completing the torch relay will be a particularly poignant moment. He said: ‘Hopefully it will mark an end to my period of recovery and be a new beginning.’ Holly Hamill, 17, of Glengormly, Northern Ireland, was nominated by her gymnastics coach for overcoming cystic fibrosis to win four gold medal apparatus medals at the Rhythmic British Championships. Stunned: Rachel Nafzger said she couldn't believe she had been chosen for the relay. She will walk the course alongside her guide dog Nikita . She said: ‘It is amazing to be part of this. I just hope I don’t fall over. ‘My condition makes things harder because my chest is tight. It can be a downer but I just focus on my ability not my disability. ‘I hope I can show people that by doing the relay.’ Rachel Nafzger, 21, will walk the torch relay with her guide dog Nikita. She was born four months premature with limited sight, but that has not stopped her living independently. She left her home in Northamptonshire . to study English literature at Plymouth, where she is a member of . several voluntary groups. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I was told I had been chosen. ‘Nikita will love the crowds because she’s an attention-seeker.’ The remaining 1,200 torchbearers will be announced in January. Eight thousands people were chosen from a shortlist of 28,000 hopefuls to take part in the relay after being selected by sponsors Lloyds TSB, Samsung and Coca-Cola. It was announced yesterday that Dublin will also be included in the relay, in a bid to include Ireland in the celebrations. Holly Hamill, who overcame cystic fibrosis to win four golds at the British rhymthic gymnastic championship . The naming of the torchbearers was somewhat overshadowed by events earlier this week, when it was revealed that more taxpayers money would be pumped into the Olympic Games. Yesterday, Lord Sebastian Coe admitted that the Olympics organising committee would be ‘living ‘hand to mouth’ in coming months. The admission will only fuel fears that the Government will be forced to invest in excess of the £9.3bn already pledged for the competition. Ministers recently agreed to put £41million towards the opening and closing ceremonies, doubling its budget. Simeon Wakely, from Bath, a wheelchair tennis and basketball player, described his nomination as 'a shinning example of what can be achieved when you set your mind to it', while Lord Coe also displayed the torch . The event was supposed to be paid for by the privately-funded organising committee Locog, but the Prime Minister himself stepped in, apparently to give the four ceremonies the ‘wow factor’. It was also revealed this week that a further £271million will need to be invested in security after organisers wildly underestimated the number of security guards required at the Games. The total security bill is now in excess of £1bn. Yesterday, Locog chairman Lord Coe said that keeping the Games on budget over the next six months ‘will be a challenge’, but that Locog was ‘driving down on costs’ where they could. ‘We will be living hand to mouth now until the Olympic Games. As you get towards the games, there’s a build up of pressure’, he said. ‘It will be tough. These are the hard months everyone was predicting six months ago.’","Each bearer will carry torch through hometown or village .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:53 PM on 9th December 2011 . The husband of missing Utah mother Susan Cox Powell has accused her parents of turning the couple's children against him. Josh Powell has asked that the courts place his two sons, aged four and six, with a guardian as his in-laws have an ‘irrational vendetta’ against him. ‘The Coxes are coaching my sons in ways that are clearly intended to destroy our loving relationships as a natural family unit,’ Josh Powell wrote in a court declaration that he filed in Pierce County, Washington. Family: Susan Powell, with her two sons and husband Josh, has been missing for two years. Josh wants the boys, now four and six, to live with a guardian . ‘By living in the Cox house, the boys are exposed to the Coxes' overwhelming attitude of hatred toward me and it is seriously traumatizing my children,’ he wrote. ‘There is considerable evidence that the Coxes make explicit comments to and around my sons reflecting their attitude.’ He said that by being with his in-laws, his sons ‘are caught in the middle of a very hostile war of words and emotions’. Susan Powell was reported from her West Valley City home on December 7, 2009, when she failed to show up for work as a stockbroker at Wells Fargo Financial. A body has never been found. Custody: The two boys moved in with Judy and Chuck Cox, pictured, after their grandfather was charged with voyeurism and possession of child pornography . Her husband is the only named person of interest in the case but has never been charged or arrested. He said he took his young sons, then . four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. He . believes his wife ran off with another man. Susan Powell's parents have had custody of the children since September. They had previously been living with their father and grandfather, but were removed from the house after their grandfather, Steve Powell, was charged with voyeurism and possession of child pornography. Steve Powell has pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of voyeurism and one of possession of child pornography. He remains jailed on $200,000 bail. The arrest prompted a Cox family lawyer . to directly accuse Josh - for the first time publicly - of involvement . in his wife's disappearance. Husband: Josh Powell, Susan's husband, is still the only person of interest in the case. He has denied killing her or having anything to do with her disappearance . 'The time has come where we have to stop playing cat and mouse games: Josh Powell had something to do with the disappearance of the mother of these children,' attorney Steve Downing said. Powell responded: 'Everything they said is patently false. I am a good father to my sons.' No one has been charged in Susan Powell's disappearance, and police say the case remains an active investigation. Since his wife's disappearance, Powell, . who still wears his wedding ring, has claimed his wife suffered from . mental illness and plotted her own disappearance. In court: The children previously lived with Steve Powell, pictured, and his son Josh. Steve Powell has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him . He has denied killing her or having anything to do with her disappearance. 'I would never even hurt her,' a tearful, red-eyed Josh Powell told CBS' Early Show in August. Josh and his father have said they believe Susan Powell ran off with another man. 'I'm still thinking she left,' Steven . Powell told The Associated Press in August. 'Hopefully they'll be able . to find her at some point... We don't believe she's dead.' In July, Steve Powell, who claims his . daughter-in-law was in love with him, announced that he planned to . publish her private journal online. ‘People don't know that there are two . distinct sides of Susan. She was very ... kind of an open person in a . sexual way ... with the opposite sex,’ he said. Missing: Josh Powell believes his wife Susan, then 28, ran off with another man . No trace: She was reported missing from her Utah home exactly two years ago . Susan's parents have always defended their daughter in the press and have made it clear they suspect foul play in her disappearance. ‘My clients are under a court order in the family law case not to discuss the matter,’ the Coxes attorney, Anne Bremner told the Huffington Post in response to Josh Powell's latest allegations. ‘I can say that the boys are in a loving and safe home.’","Two years this week since Susan Powell disappeared .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 8:43 PM on 9th December 2011 . A retired FBI agent who vanished in Iran in 2007 reappeared in a video and a series of photographs which were sent to his family over the past year, it has emerged. It had been suspected by the U.S government that Robert Levinson was dead. However U.S officials revealed earlier this year that they had received proof he was alive. Scroll down for video . Held: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson vanished in Iran in 2007. It has now emerged that his family were sent a video and a series of photographs of him last year . It has now emerged that a video was emailed to his family in November last year in which he pleaded with the U.S. government to meet the demands of his unidentified captors. It transformed a mysterious disappearance into a hostage standoff with an unknown kidnapper. 'I have been treated well. But I need the help of the United States government to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three and a half years,' Mr Levinson says. 'And please help me get home.' The 54-second video showed Mr Levinson looking haggard but unharmed, sitting in front of what appeared to be a concrete wall. Robert Levinson went missing in Iran in 2007 . He had lost considerable weight, particularly in his face, and his white shirt hung off him. There were no signs of recent mistreatment. But Mr Levinson, who has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure, implored the U.S. to help him quickly. 'I am not in very good health,' he says. 'I am running very quickly out of diabetes medicine.' The Associated Press (AP) saw the video and obtained a government transcript of Mr Levinson's statement soon after it arrived last year but did not immediately report it because the U.S. government said doing so would complicate diplomatic efforts to bring him home. Now, those efforts appear to have stalled, U.S. relations with Iran have worsened and Mr Levinson's wife, Christine, of Coral Springs, Florida, is expected to release the video herself in a desperate attempt to make contact with whoever is holding her 63-year-old husband. That represents a sharp change in strategy in a case that for years the United States treated as a diplomatic issue rather than a hostage situation. Mrs Levinson has issued many public statements over the years, but she typically directed them to her missing husband or to the government of Iran. In the nearly five years that Mr Levinson has been missing, the U.S. government has never had solid intelligence about what happened to him. He had been retired from the FBI for years and was working as a private investigator when he traveled to Iran in March 2007. His family has said an investigation . into cigarette smuggling took him to Kish, a resort island where . Americans need no visa to visit. The . prevailing U.S. government theory had been that Levinson was arrested . by Iranian intelligence officials to be interrogated and used as a . bargaining chip in negotiations with Washington. Desperate: Diplomatic efforts to bring missing former FBI agent Robert Levinson home have stalled. His wife Christine, pictured, is expected to release the video of her husband in an attempt to make contact with whoever is holding him . But as every lead fizzled and Iran repeatedly denied any involvement in his disappearance, many in the U.S. government believed Levinson was probably dead. The surprise arrival of the video and photographs quickly changed that view but did little to settle the question of his whereabouts. The video contained tantalizing clues suggesting Levinson was not being held in Iran at all, but rather in Pakistan, hundreds of miles from where he disappeared. The photographs, which arrived a few months after the video, contained hints that Levinson might be in Afghanistan. Despite the lengthy investigation, several U.S. officials said, Washington still has no idea who is holding Levinson, where he is or who holds the key to bringing him home. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions. Disappeared: The retired FBI agent went missing following a visit to Kish in Iran, a resort island where Americans need no visa to visit . A father of seven, Levinson addressed . his remarks to 'my beautiful, my loving, my loyal wife, Christine,' as . well as his children and his grandson. He apparently did not know he also has a granddaughter, who was born in 2008. Family and friends confirmed that it was Levinson in the video, and authorities also compared his face with computer-generated images that estimate aging. The video prompted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to announce publicly in March that Levinson was alive and urged the Iranians to help find him. Though the legacy of the 1979 hostage standoff with Iran looms over all relations between the two countries, Clinton did not refer to Levinson as a hostage in March and she softened the U.S. rhetoric toward Tehran. The video also helped initiate a series of discreet discussions between U.S. and Iranian officials, conversations that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in September were producing good results. Demands: The video of Robert Levinson prompted U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to announce publicly in March that he was alive and urged the Iranians to help find him . Not long after Clinton's remarks, the Levinson family received a series of photos of Levinson dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit like the ones worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In these photos, Levinson's hair and beard were much longer and he looked thinner. In each photo, he wore a different sign hung around his neck. One read, 'Why you can not help me.' Investigators determined that the video was routed through an internet address in Pakistan, suggesting that Levinson might be held there. Also, Pashtun wedding music played faintly in the background, officials said. The Pashtun people live primarily in Pakistan and Afghanistan, just over Iran's eastern border. The photos, however, traced back to a different internet address, this one in Afghanistan. Authorities don't know whether those . clues mean Levinson was being held in Balochistan - a rugged, arid . region that spans parts of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan - or perhaps . in the lawless tribal region . along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. These areas are home to . terrorists, militant groups and criminal organizations. None . of these groups has a clear motive for picking up Levinson. But an . American hostage, particularly one who used to work for the U.S. government, would be considered a valuable commodity to any of them. Some . U.S. officials believe the Iranian government routed the video through . Pakistan as a way to blame Levinson's disappearance on someone else - . most likely the anti-Iran terrorist group Jundallah. But as with every other possibility, the U.S. has no proof. The video was accompanied by a demand that the U.S. release prisoners, but officials said the United States is not holding anyone matching the names on the list. It's possible some of them may have been held by the Pakistani government at one point, but officials say the demand doesn't offer any indication of who might be holding Levinson and there's been no more communication about it. U.S. authorities have repeatedly analyzed the video and the apparently scripted remarks Levinson made, looking for clues. Optimistic: The video of Robert Levinson helped initiate a series of discreet discussions between U.S. and Iranian officials, conversations that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, pictured, said were producing results . For instance, Levinson said a 'group' had held him for three and a half years, a word choice that could suggest a criminal organization or terrorist group, rather than a government. And he said he had been held 'here' for that time, suggesting he had not been moved. Over the past year, the hopefulness that initially followed the arrival of the video has faded. The meetings with the Iranians have not provided a breakthrough, and U.S. officials said the government was no longer as optimistic about the future of those talks. Relations with Iran, meanwhile, have worsened. The Justice Department recently accused Iranian intelligence agents of plotting to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador in Washington. Then a United Nations watchdog released a report warning of Iran's nuclear ambitions, prompting the United States and its Western allies to issue new sanctions against Iran's financial system. Most recently, a high-tech, stealth CIA drone was captured by Iranian officials while on a surveillance mission over Iran. The embarrassing mishap put sophisticated technology in Iranian hands and provided public evidence of the kind of spying that's been long suspected. The one bright spot in Washington's relationship with Tehran was the release of two American hikers from an Iranian prison in September. The U.S. worked behind the scenes to secure that release but officials said Levinson was not part of those discussions. The Levinson family has not updated its website since June, when Christine Levinson wrote an open letter to her husband. 'I am willing to do whatever is necessary to bring you home,' she wrote. 'At the same time I'm at a loss as to how I can do that.' Watch the video .","Robert Levinson tells family 'I am not in very good health'

The USS New York, which holds more than seven tons of steel from the World Trade Center in its hull, has returned to the site ahead of this weekend’s 10th anniversary of the terror attacks. The ship sailed down the Hudson River on Thursday and her passengers included 170 members of the 9/11 Families Association, which includes first responders and families of victims. Sailing: The USS New York passes the World Trade Center and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as it arrives in Manhattan on Thursday . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced on Tuesday that she would sail from her home port in Norfolk, Virginia, to New York Harbor. The ship was only commissioned into service under two years ago in November 2009 and it was built in part with iron salvaged from the wreckage of the twin towers, reported the New York Times. ‘She helps protect the freedoms that make this the world’s most diverse and tolerant city,’ Mayor Bloomberg said. ‘We are honoured to welcome the men and women of the USS New York back to our city.’ He added that the ship’s return was a poignant moment and a symbol of the personal connection between the state and its armed forces. Pride: The USS New York is seen in the Hudson River upon its arrival in New York, with an NYPD helicopter overhead and the Statue of Liberty in the background . Escorted in: Portions of the hull of the USS New York were made out of iron salvaged from the wreckage of Ground Zero. Its passengers included 170 members of the 9/11 Families Association, which includes families of victims and first responders . ‘Every member of the crew has a tremendous sense of mission and appreciation of the unique role their ship plays for the citizens of New York,’ Secretary Mabus said. ‘She is an emblem of the strength and renewed spirit of a city that was damaged but never defeated.’ One of the crew members has previously described rushing from a construction site to help out rescue efforts on September 11 in 2001. Another said he actually decided to enlist while looking at the rubble from the disaster, reported the New York Times. ‘While on the pile, I looked and said: “Never again in my backyard”.’ Coming back: The USS New York is seen docked on a pier adjacent to West 47th Street in the Hudson River on Thursday . The ship has a display case with a helmet donated by the city’s fire department and there are also photos of 9/11 lining her, a Navy spokesman said. The vessel’s crest has a picture of a rising phoenix in front of the World Trade Centre - and says: ‘Strength forged through sacrifice. Never forget.’ ‘I don’t think there’s a family in New York that hasn’t been touched,’ Bonnie Beran, who was watching the ship from the shore on Thursday, told WCBS 880. ‘To some degree we’re all survivors.’","USS New York sailed down Hudson River with 170 members of 9/11 Families Association to New York Harbor .

Patients and staff were forced to flee from a hospital, including an operating theatre, this evening as a fire tore through one of its buildings. A major blaze broke out in the ground floor of a building housing an £800,000 MRI scanner and two CT scanners at around 4pm as medical teams rushed to get patients to safety. Around 55 patients were evacuated from the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester with some forced to move mid-operation. Drama: Smoke billows across the skyline as firefighters tackle the blaze at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital this evening which forced patients and staff to evacuate the building . Big response: More than sixty firefighters and three vehicles with aerial platforms were used at the height of the blaze . Most were transported to other wards although some patients being treated for less serious illnesses were told they could go home 'at their own risk'. Both police and hospital officials have said that no-one was injured by the fire. Ten fire engines and three vehicles with aerial ladder platforms rushed to the scene as the hospital was reported to be well alight. Patients were being moved to other parts of the hospital while the accident and emergency department was closed to ambulances. Discussing tactics: Firefighters gather next to an ambulance . Hospital staff said that the MRI and CT unit was some way away from the main wards. A hospital spokesman said: 'The fire took hold in the MRI department at about 4pm. 'We're not sure how it started yet and it will be something for the fire service to investigate. 'Fifty-five patients were moved from A&E, medical imaging and the operating theatre to other parts of the hospital. 'I'm not sure what operations were taking place when the fire started. 'There were no casualties and the fire service remain on the site, but it (the fire) is under control.' She expected the A&E department to remain closed until tomorrow morning.

Great escape: Around 55 patients were evacuated from the X-ray and A&E departments, five operating theatres and the intensive care units at the Winchester hospital . 'We . are assisting the fire service with road closures around Romsey Road . following the hospital fire,' said a spokesman from Hampshire Police. 'Motorists in Winchester are advised to find alternative routes around Romsey Road and St James Road and expect delays. 'Traffic at the moment there is gridlocked.' Dr . Chris Gordon, acting chief executive of the trust that runs the . hospital, said: 'My understanding is that we've had a fire in the MRI . and CT scanner room and maybe in the roof of the building. Dr Chris Gordon . 'We have evacuated the X-ray department, accident and emergency and five operating theatres and the intensive care units. 'There was surgery going on at the time and those patients have also had to be evacuated. 'As far as I know no one has been injured and no one has come to harm as a consequence of that evacuation.' One of expensive scanners thought to have been destroyed by flames had only been used at the hospital since February 2009. The hospital's MRI scanner was officially unveiled in March of that year by Vendee Globe yachtswoman Dee Caffari. The installation of the scanner at a cost of £800,000 followed a major investment programme which also saw a £700,000 CT scanner purchased in 2007. The Royal Hampshire County Hospital serves most of central Hampshire and was founded in 1736. It opened at its current site in 1868 after Queen Victoria contributed to the appeal to finance the hospital and allowed it to carry the name 'Royal'.","Around 55 patients rushed out of Royal Hampshire County Hospital, with some moved mid-operation .

They were the first family of five siblings to be accepted at the same time into New York’s Juilliard School. The Utah siblings released three albums that got to number one in the U.S. classical chart. The New York Post described them as ‘the biggest classical music sensation in years’. Entertainment Weekly said they are ‘button-down cute and somewhat otherworldly’. They have performances coming up in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in November - before going to Ohio in December. When asked what made them want to . speak out after they initially tried to hide the story from the media, . Desirae said: 'I think we want to reach out to people and want to change . the laws and Statute of Limitations so there are none for victims of . childhood sex abuse. 'Sex abuse within families is so . rampant and we want to speak out so people are not ashamed any more. The . more people who are aware, the less it will happen. 'I think abusers make you feel like you shouldn't tell anyone, they make you embarrassed.' Deondra said: 'We've been really . blessed to have had the support to get through all this and to be able . to speak about these horrible things.' Their brother Gregory revealed that as well as the actual victims, the abuse affects the whole family. He said: 'People don't realise how . many other people it affects. But it was important for me to be there . for them. It was really a cut and dry situation - you support the . victims not the perpetrator.' The 5 Browns are a Utah piano-playing group consisting of three sisters and two brothers. They have set up The Foundation for Survivors of Abuse to help those victims come forward and offer support. Sexually assaulted: The Brown daughters only wanted to see their father jailed for a certain amount of time . They are also hoping to get the . backing of some senators to change the Statute of Limitations so that a . child does not have to come out about the abuse when they are still . living under the same roof as their attacker. Deondra said: 'There will be life long . scars from abuse suffered and hopefully a child of that age will be . able to find that support they need, whether it's within the home or a . foundation or something they can reach towards and find what they need.' The Brown daughters kept the abuse a . secret for years, even from each other, until 2007 when they were . discussing separate issues and it came up. Desirae explains how they broached the . issue with their parents to try to deal with it discretely: 'We . approached my father and mother and thought we could deal with it in the . family and for him to take full accountability and show extreme . remorse. But unfortunately that was lacking in our situation. 'When he heard he wanted to manage . other children, it boiled down to, ""If he doesn't go to prison he could . do this to someone else"". The situation has made the five of us closer . than ever.' Unity: Sisters Desirae, left, and Deondra kept the abuse a secret for years, even from each other . Brother: Gregory said it is not just the actual victims who are affected but the whole family . Keith Brown was sentenced to spend . ten years to life in prison for the abuse of his daughters after he . pleaded guilty in February to one felony count of sodomy and two felony . counts of sexual abuse. Judge David Mortensen sentenced the . 55-year-old to ten years to life on the first count, and 15 years to . life for each of the others. He said Brown was a 'danger to society' but was given a lighter sentence by the consent of his victims. His crimes were close to being kept a . secret from the public and were only uncovered by the media following a car accident near Salt Lake City that he was involved in just days . after he was charged. Brown drove his Porsche off a road and . it fell 300ft into the Little Cottonwood Canyon as he returned from . a ski resort on Valentine’s Day with his wife - with police saying he was travelling too fast. He was driving, and his wife Lisa, the mother of the children, was in the passenger seat. They were both knocked unconscious, but Brown woke up and managed to dial 911. A family torn: Mormon piano group The 5 Browns - left to right: Melody, Ryan, Desirae, Gregory, and Deondra . A spokesman for the 5 Browns told the . Salt Lake Tribune they are now focusing on ‘managing their lives, . careers and the ongoing healing process’. The girls were abused on separate occasions between November 1990 and October 1992, November 1990 and November 1992, and March 1997 and March 1998 in Utah County. Brown’s attorney, Steve Shapiro said: 'I think he’s remorseful and I think every step he’s taken in the process ... has been geared toward taking responsibility.'

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 7:47 AM on 9th December 2011 . A Syrian oil pipeline was blown up today in what has been described by the government as an act of sabotage by an armed terrorist group. The pipeline, carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in Homs, spilled flames and clouds of thick black smoke into the air over the city, which has been the epicentre of the protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 'This is the main pipeline that feeds the Homs refinery,' said Rami Abdulrahman of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Black sky: Smoke pours across the Syrian city of Homs after an oil pipeline was blown up, with both sides blaming each other in the anti-government protests . Blackout: The pipeline was a major one, carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in Homs, which is the home of the anti-Assad protests . Randon shootings: Human rights observers have also reported seven people killed in Homs today by snipers . The Observatory also reported seven people killed in Homs today by snipers and in 'random' shootings. The ferocity of Assad's crackdown on protests triggered desertions from the armed forces, and now thousands of army defectors have joined a guerrilla army staging hit-and-run attacks on security forces. The state news agency, SANA, said the pipeline was attacked in the Tal Asour area to the northwest of the refinery on the outskirts of Homs, a city of 800,000 where - activists say - about 1,500 people have been killed in the crackdown. Video footage of the pipeline ablaze shows a Syrian army tank close by the billowing smoke. The Homs refinery serves part of Syria's domestic requirement for refined oil products. It is the second attack on an oil pipeline after SANA said saboteurs blew up an oil export pipeline near Homs in June, which carried oil from Syria's eastern oilfields to the Mediterranean coast. Gathering forces: Demonstrators protesting against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad march through the streets in Homs as a campaign of civil disobedience looms . Widespread: There were also anti-Assad protests in Kafranbel, near Adlb, as people openly show their dissent . New view: With media outlets banned from Syria by Assad's regime these protest photos are some of the clearest yet showing the level of opposition to the government . Anti-Assad activists are looking to step up their activity by calling for a nationwide strike on Sunday - a working day - as the first stage in a campaign of civil disobedience against Assad's government. The Local Coordination Committees, the grassroots organisers of the peaceful protest movement said the campaign would include sit-ins, shop closures and strikes by public service workers and students. A similar call for a walkout two months ago had mixed results. Shops and businesses in the southern province of Deraa, cradle of Syria's eight-month-old popular revolt, shut for eight days at the end of October. Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 41 years, has denied ordering his troops to kill peaceful protesters, saying only a ""crazy"" leader kills his own people. In a television interview with ABC news of the United States he distanced himself from the actions of the security forces, saying it was not his personal army - a disclaimer that Washington said was simply not credible. Assad is under growing international pressure, including a threat of sanctions from the Arab League, to cease violent repression of protests. Rejecting criticism of his government's action, he told ABC News that 'most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government, not the vice versa'. Syrian activists say around a quarter of the more than 4,500 deaths they have recorded in nine months of protest have been among the security forces. Most foreign media have been excluded from Syria, making it hard to verify events independently. In the city of Homs and nearby areas in northwestern Syria people staged a general strike on October 26, partly enforced by armed insurgents.   But the two biggest cities of Damascus and Aleppo were largely unaffected, and residents of the capital said on Thursday that authorities appeared to be taking steps to thwart Sunday's planned action. Some shopkeepers who sought to pay their bills to the government this week said they were told to wait until Sunday when officials would visit their premises to collect the money - a veiled warning not to be closed. One resident also reported increased numbers of police and plainclothes security forces in Damascus. 'Every 10 metres you find a group of them, wearing normal clothes,' she said. Meanwhile, Russia has called on Nato to stay out of Syria's business or risk inflaming sectarian tensions that could 'blow this whole geopolitical space up'. Russia, along with China, vetoed a European-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution in October that would have condemned Syria for a violent crackdown on the mass anti-government protests and threatened it with potential sanctions. Speaking at Nato headquarters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated Moscow's unhappiness at the way a Security Council resolution this year had been cited as the basis for a Nato operation that helped to topple Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. 'When a crisis emerges, all political, religious and other forces should be... encouraged to participate in dialogue,' he said after meeting his Nato counterparts. Lavrov said outsiders should not 'pick and choose the sweethearts', and groups within a country that called for outside help were taking 'the wrong path'. Death toll: President Bashar Assad (centre left), pictured here meeting with a Lebanese delegation, has led a brutal crackdown against dissent . 'Not seeing threats that emanate from the current trends would be wrong, in my view, because those processes that are deeply rooted might come to the surface and blow this whole geopolitical space up,' said Lavrov. 'We are, to be very frank with you, extremely concerned with the fact that we are seeing (a) growing divide within the Islamic world, between the Sunni and the Shi'ite. 'Unless we help reverse this negative trend, we might witness very dire events.' Speaking at a news conference after Lavrov, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reiterated that the alliance had 'no intention whatsoever to intervene in Syria'. The United Nations says more than 4,000 people have been killed in the crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's government.","Public strike threat as campaign of civil disobedience is mooted .

"By . Chris Hastings . Last updated at 11:51 PM on 10th December 2011 . Her usual passengers are tourists who pay to cruise along the Thames past London’s most historic sites. But next year Spirit of Chartwell will take up her own berth in the . history books – at the head of a  magnificent 1,000-strong flotilla celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Award-winning film production designer Joseph Bennett and former . model-turned television garden expert Rachel De Thame have been brought . in to transform the already luxurious 210ft cruiser into a Royal Barge . which will recall the splendour of the 17th Century. Majestic makeover: An artist's impression of how the Spirit of Chartwell will look when she is transformed into a Royal Barge in time to lead a flotilla to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year . Luxurious: The 210ft Spirit of Chartwell as she is today. The cruiser was originally built in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2000, but was given an overhaul after it was acquired by the Magna Carta Steamship Company . And an official artist’s impression released yesterday reveals the extent of the makeover. Elaborate gold gilt sculptures will be added, along with lavish red . carpets, velvet drapes and two thrones beneath a canopy. Several . Royal-themed floral displays will be made up of flowers from the Queen’s . own gardens. Pageant Master Adrian Evans, who is organising the Thames Diamond . Jubilee Pageant, said: ‘The Royal Barge must be a jewel – the most . magnificent vessel in the flotilla. Joseph and Rachel have come up with a . truly inspiring design.’ Bennett, who won an Emmy for his work on the television blockbuster . Rome, was keen to produce a vessel which recalled the glory days of the . great State barges of the 17th and 18th Centuries. But his final design will also incorporate features celebrating each of the past six decades of the Queen’s reign. He said: ‘We’re trying to make every decorative element tell a story that’s relevant to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. ‘Aspects such as her coronation, the Commonwealth countries, the 60 years of her reign, we want to reference all of these. Honoured: Former model-turned-TV garden expert Rachel De Thame has been given the task of revamping the Spirit of Chartwell. She has chosen to bedeck the vessel with red, gold and purple flowers . ‘And as far as possible, we’ll also make every effort to use specialist craftsmen based in Britain.’ De Thame, 50, who now presents the BBC’s Gardeners’ World and . Countrywise on ITV, has chosen red, gold and purple flowers and her . designs will also reference the Commonwealth, the coronation and the . Gold State Coach. She said: ‘I feel extremely honoured to be involved in . the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. My aim is to help make the day a . truly special one for the Queen.’ During the Thames trip, the Queen and Prince Philip will be centre stage . on the two thrones, which have been specially positioned under a . gold-gilted canopy to ensure crowds are given the best possible view of . the pair. Palace officials are currently deciding which other senior Royals will be on the barge. What is certain is that Her Majesty will be accompanied by members of . the Royal Watermen, whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the Monarch on . all her official journeys by river. The watermen, chosen from those whose regular business is manning tugs . and launches on the Thames, are paid a token sum of £3.50 a year for . their Royal role. They will be instantly recognisable in their black caps and scarlet . tunics, with the silver Royal cypher on both front and back. They will be led by the Queen’s official bargemaster, a post dating back to 1215 and which is currently held by Paul Ludwig. The Spirit of Chartwell was originally constructed in Rotterdam in the . Netherlands in 2000, but was rebuilt last year following its acquisition . by the Magna Carta Steamship Company. Although her day job is running Thames trips for paying guests, the Chartwell is far from being a bog-standard cruiser. In fact, according to one commentator, to describe the vessel as a pleasure cruiser is ‘like calling the Queen Mary a ferry’. According to the craft’s website, her interiors are modelled on the . ‘timeless grandeur’ of the 1929 Pullman railway carriage and features . include 33 upholstered seats and original fixtures and fittings from . ocean liners. Right Royal occasion: The barge will be designed so that The Queen and Prince Philip can be easily seen as they take centre stage on two thrones for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations . Decadent: The Queen and Prince Philip will sit under a gold-gilted canopy (centre). The design of the barge will also incorporate features celebrating each of the past six decades of the Queen's reign . The walls are adorned with original glass panels by celebrated French . designer Rene Lalique and the vessel boasts panoramic windows and . hardwood finishes throughout. Her nine-hour Memories of London voyage, which includes a champagne . reception, three-course lunch and a gala dinner, costs from £195 and . £265 per person. Last night, her owner Philip Morrell said: ‘As the Spirit of Chartwell . evolved, I knew we had built something special – ideal, I thought, for . the carriage of royalty. ‘But little did I even vaguely suspect that in the course of one short year we should be graced with such an honour.’ Celebration: Her Majesty and Prince Philip will be accompanied on the journey by members of the Royal Watermen, whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the Monarch on all her official journeys by river, when she marks 60 years on the throne in June next year . Up until the mid-19th Century the Monarch would regularly travel on the . Thames either on ceremonial occasions or between the different palaces. As other means of transport began to prove more efficient, however, it was deemed no longer necessary to keep a Royal Barge. The Queen does occasionally make use of the Royal Nore, a vessel made available to her by the Port of London authority. It has been involved in State visits since 1971 and carries the Royal Standard and Regalia when the Queen is aboard. The Diamond Jubilee celebrations will take place over a four-day Bank Holiday weekend from June 2 to 5 next year.",Spirit of Chartwell to be transformed into a Royal Barge to lead flotilla celebrating Diamond Jubilee next year .
"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 11:06 AM on 8th December 2011 . Apple's iPhone is already a 'games console' for many of its users - the average iPhone owner plays games for 14.7 hours a month, according to a Nielsen study. But a new app will ensure they have more to play than Angry Birds. The key? The 3D, hi-def games - including hits such as Assassin's Creed: Revelations - aren't actually playing ON your phone or tablet's slow processor - they're playing elsewhere, and the video streams to iPad, iPhone or Android devices courtesy of the new Onlive app. The new Onlive app allows users to play games that iPad's processor simply wouldn't be capable of such as Lego: Batman - streaming the video from high-powered servers, and adding touch controls to the 'console quality' games . The app adds an 'overlay' of touch controls to console games, making them easier to use on iPad . The app itself is free - but a subscription of £6.99 buys you access to a library of 150 games. Renting a game for three days costs £3.99. 'Buying' a game outright costs similar prices to what it would cost in the shops - for instance Assassin's Creed: Revelation is £39.99. The app comes with two free games - the crime thriller L.A. Noire, and Lego Batman. So far, 25 games have been adapted for touchscreen controls. Current PC and console hits such as Assassin's Creed Revelations are available either for a one-off payment or via a subcription of £6.99 a month . Even when 'renting' games via the app, the app counts up your rentals and once you've 'paid' for the game, you keep it . There are 500 million mobile devices in the U.S. and UK capable of using the app. In the UK, the service only works over wi-fi. In the U.S., 4G mobiles will also be able to use the service. L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games and family titles like LEGO: Batman will be given free to anyone who downloads the OnLive app. There is also an upcoming wireless controller (£39.99/$49.99) which works with many tablets and phones - overcoming one of gaming's major hurdles on the platforms, the fact that touchscreen controls rarely work on action games. Only 25 games have been optimised for touchscreen control so far - but you can buy a £39.99 controller which works with most phones and tablets . 'Today marks a major milestone: OnLive is now delivering the latest, console-class, top-tier games—literally to your fingertips—on mobile tablets and phones for instant on-demand play anywhere, anytime,' said Steve Perlman, OnLive Founder and CEO. 'Through the free OnLive app, tablet and smartphone gamers can play top console and PC titles like Assassins Creed: Revelations and L.A. Noire—one of the most highly acclaimed, graphically sophisticated games to date—with exclusive OnLive Cloud Touch controls or with the new mobile-compatible OnLive Wireless Controller. 'Tablets and smartphones, the fastest-growing consumer product categories in history, are now capable of running the hottest, highest-end games. Gaming and mobile devices will never be the same.' There are 500 million devices in the U.S. and the UK capable of running the free app . Most of the nearly 200 games in OnLive's growing library, including recent top-tier releases like Batman: Arkham City, Assassin’s Creed: Revelations and Lord of the Rings: War in the North, are immediately playable on virtually any device with the OnLive Wireless Controller, which automatically find wireless connection for any tablet, smartphone, PC, Mac, TV or Blu-ray player.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:36 AM on 10th December 2011 . Almost 100 years after they were sent, telegrams declaring the sinking of the Titanic have been put up for sale. The eight messages were sent by Bruce Ismay, head of the ship’s  owners White Star Line, after he was rescued in the 1912 disaster. The first telegram to the shipping company’s New York office was set at 1pm on April 15 – 11 hours after the Titanic sunk with the loss of 1,517 lives. First word: Bruce Ismay's telegram, the first following the disaster, will go on sale in New York . In it, Mr Ismay wrote: ‘Deeply regret [to] advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision [with] iceberg resulting serious loss [of] life. Further particulars later.’ The world's largest passenger liner of the age sank 400 miles south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland after it struck an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Ismay wrote: 'Deeply regret [to] advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision (with) iceberg resulting serious loss (of) life. Further particulars later.' Bruce Ismay was dubbed 'Brute Ismay' by the press after claims that he deserted the Titanic while women and children were still on board . Soon after he wrote the telegrams Ismay - who was later dubbed the Coward of the Titanic - had to be treated with opiates to help him cope with the shock of the sinking. Ismay was the managing director of White Star Line and he was depicted in the 1997 Kate Winslett movie Titanic encouraging the liner's captain to go faster. He later told the official enquiry into the disaster that he had to turn and look away in the lifeboat at the moment the Titanic sunk at 2.20am on April 15. The Carpathia arrived at the scene of the sinking in the north Atlantic at 4.10am and began picking up the 711 survivors. Following the disaster Ismay was . savaged by both the American and the British press for deserting the . ship while women and children were still on board. Some papers called him the 'Coward of the Titanic'. In the hours that followed a radio operator in Philadelphia picked up signals broadcast by Carpathia that listed the nams of the survivors and this news of the disaster was then dispatched to the world's press. It is thought Ismay's was the first official telegram that broke the news of the disaster. The first message has Ismay's full name at the top and the rest bear the name 'Yamsi' - Ismay spelled backwards. His second message stated: 'Most desirable Titanic crew aboard Carpathia should be returned home earliest moment possible / propose returning her myself please send outfit of clothes including shoes for me to Cedric [a ship]/ have nothing of my own.' Doomed ship: The Titanic sank off Newfoundland on 15 April 1912, resulting in the deaths of 1,517 people . The telegrams are printed on paper headed 'The Marconi International Marine Communication Company Ltd' and were retained by the staff at the White Star Line's New York office. Also included in the sale are replies sent by White Star Line officials in New York. One reads: 'So thankful you are saved but grieving with you over terrible calamity... '...accept my deepest sympathy horrible catastrophe.' And: 'Concise marconigram account of actual accident greatly needed for enlightenment public and ourselves / this is most important.' 6 ... The number of iceberg warnings received before the collision . 269.1m ..

Marsha Malinowski, from auctioneers Sotheby's who are selling the telegrams, said: 'The owner thought with the 100th anniversary of the sinking coming up it was a good time to sell. 'They have been kept in an album and are in beautiful condition. They are actually quite chilling because they are very matter-of-fact. 'They had to be written as such because they were telegrams and they are pretty much a statement of facts. 'Ismay sent the first shortly after he was rescued by the Carpathia on April 15 and the others followed until the 18th. 'They discuss getting Titanic staff back home and also mention George Widener, a Philadelphia streetcar magnate who was lost in the sinking."" After he was rescued Ismay was led to the cabin belonging to the ship's doctor, which he reportedly did not leave for the entire journey to New York. Miss Malinowski added: 'The disaster had a profound affect on Bruce Ismay who resigned from White Star Line and lived as a recluse in Ireland.' Ismay died in 1937 aged 75. The auction takes place in New York on December 13.","Marconi messages from rescue ship expected to fetch £100,000 .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 5:52 PM on 8th December 2011 . A woman car passenger hit by a concrete block hurled from a bridge had four titanium plates inserted in her face as surgeons reconstructed her shattered cheekbones. Grandmother Carol Manley, 57, was inches from being killed as the bucket-shaped 20kg block was thrown through the windscreen of her husband's Nissan on the A12 in Essex. Today her husband Steve, 56, who was driving, said if the concrete had been six inches further over he would be planning his wife's funeral. Inches from death: Carol Manley, 57, in her hospital bed after undergoing reconstructive surgery following the attack on the A12 . Horror: Carol Manley has suffered cuts and bruises, a fractured eye socket, a broken nose and her ribs are broken. She also has internal injuries . Mr Manley, a lorry driver, escaped with just a scratch to his face when the two-foot-high block came through the window. He revealed his wife of 37 years, who has four grown up children and 11 grandchildren, is epileptic and has had three fits in two days following the attack at West Hanningfield Bridge, Galleywood. She is covered in cuts and bruises, has a fractured eye socket, a broken nose and her ribs are broken. She also has internal injuries. Just 40 minutes before the attack, on the evening of December 1, and only three miles away on the same stretch of road, thugs had lobbed another missile at a Vauxhall Astra. Mother-of-two Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother Stella, 48, both escaped serious injury as the   block hit their car after it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder. Today Mr Manley told of his fury as he spoke out a week after the attack. Press conference: Michelle Manley addresses a press conference at Essex Police Headquarters to appeal for information with her father, Carol Manley's husband, Steve (right) Happier times: Carol with her husband Steve on holiday before the accident . Missile: This is the two foot 20kg concrete block inside the Manley's Nissan car. Firefighters had to cut the roof off the vehicle to get Mrs Manley out . Shattered: This picture shows the full extent of the damage to the windscreen of the Nissan. The roof was cut off as Mrs Manley was rescued and rushed to hospital . Huge weapon: The block was two foot tall and weighed around 20kg. Police think it may have been a bollard outside a property . He said: 'I could not tell you just how angry I am or what I would do to the culprits should we ever cross paths.' The couple were returning to their home in Harold Hill, Essex, after visiting friends near Chelmsford last Thursday. He said any bystanders at the scene with the culprits probably didn't have the 'backbone' to contact police. 'Even if someone who was maybe with the culprits but didn't play a major part, who might see this story and realise how much damage their friends' actions have done, maybe they can call the police and come up with some sort of deal, a lighter sentence or no charges,' he said. 'But then I imagine the people involved haven't got the backbone to call the police and do the right thing. These are the kinds of people who stood in the dark, threw a block off the bridge and then ran away. 'It's almost like a pyromaniac who starts a fire but then stays to watch the flames. 'I don't know what makes these people tick.' He said his wife is still drifting in and out of consciousness. 'She is recovering but it is not so much the physical scars as they mental ones. 'Carol is epileptic and she has now had three fits in the space of two days yet she had not had a fit for nearly a year. 'The stress of everything that has happened has made her much worse.' Emotional: Mrs Manley's daughter Michelle wipes away a tear at today's press conference, while her husband Steve describes the injuries his wife sustained . Accident scene: This is the West Hanningfield Road bridge that the concrete block was thrown from into the Manley's car . Mr Manley said that he could not at first understand what was happening when the concrete hit the car. He said: 'We heard a thud and I thought that I had hit a fox. When I went to look at Carol to say ""what the hell was that"" I realised there was a hole in the roof and windscreen and this great lump of concrete was on her lap. 'I just did not give a thought as to where it had come from - I just wanted to check that Carol was okay. 'I did not get to speak to her properly until we got to the hospital - that is when we realised that had the lump of concrete been six inches further over, I would be planning my wife’s funeral right now.' Probe: Police cordon off West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12 at Galleywood, Essex, from where the missile was thrown . He pulled over onto the hard shoulder before his wife was cut from the car by firefighters and taken to Chelmsford’s Broomfield Hospital. Police have been comparing the two attacks with 30 similar incidents on the A12 over the past three years. The block which hit the Manleys is thought to have been a bollard from a nearby house, police have said. So far there have not been any arrests but detectives revealed earlier this week that they are planning on speaking to three teenagers who were arrested previously but released without charge. Officers have been carrying out door-to-door inquiries in recent days and doing stop-checks on motorists in the areas close to where the two bridge attacks took place. Block victims: Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother Stella, 48, escaped uninjured when another block was thrown into their Vauxhall Astra 40 minutes before the Manley's car was struck .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:42 AM on 9th December 2011 . In northern Bucharest, in a busy residential neighborhood minutes from the centre of Romania's capital city, is a secret that the Romanian government has tried for years to protect. For years, the CIA used a government building - codenamed Bright Light - as a makeshift prison for its most valuable detainees. There, it held al-Qaida operatives Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, and others in a basement prison before they were ultimately transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006, according to former U.S. intelligence officials. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The National Registry Office for Classified Information, also known as ORNISS, sits in a busy residential neighborhood minutes from the center of Bucharest . The existence of a CIA prison in Romania has been widely reported but its location has never been made public until now. The former prison was located and details learned of the facility where harsh interrogation tactics were used. A programme on the CIA prison will air on December 8. The Romanian prison was part of a network of so-called black sites that the CIA operated and controlled overseas in Thailand, Lithuania and Poland. All the prisons were closed by May 2006, and the CIA's detention and interrogation program ended in 2009. Unlike the CIA's facility in Lithuania's countryside or the one hidden in a Polish military installation, the CIA's prison in Romania was not in a remote location. It was hidden in plain sight, a couple blocks off a major boulevard on a street lined with trees and homes, along busy train tracks. The building is used as the National Registry Office for Classified Information, which is also known as ORNISS. Classified information from NATO and the European Union is stored there. Former intelligence officials both described the location of the prison and identified pictures of the building. In an interview at the building in November, senior ORNISS official Adrian Camarasan said the basement is one of the most secure rooms in all of Romania. But he said Americans never ran a prison there. Terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured shortly after his capture during a raid in Pakistan in 2009, was held at the site in Bucharest . 'No, no. Impossible, impossible,' he said in an ARD interview for its 'Panorama' news broadcast, as a security official monitored the interview. The CIA prison opened for business in the fall of 2003, after the CIA decided to empty the black site in Poland, according to former U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the detention program with reporters. Shuttling detainees into the facility without being seen was relatively easy. After flying into Bucharest, the detainees were brought to the site in vans. CIA operatives then drove down a side road and entered the compound through a rear gate that led to the actual prison. The detainees could then be unloaded and whisked into the ground floor of the prison and into the basement. The basement consisted of six prefabricated cells, each with a clock and arrow pointing to Mecca, the officials said. The cells were on springs, keeping them slightly off balance and causing disorientation among some detainees. The CIA declined to comment on the prison. During the first month of their detention, the detainees endured sleep deprivation and were doused with water, slapped or forced to stand in painful positions, several former officials said. Waterboarding was not performed in Romania, they said. Overlooked: A view of the CIA 'prison' in Bucharest showing how near it is to a busy railway line . A satellite image showing the residential area and transport links surrounding the secret black site . After the initial interrogations, the detainees were treated with care, the officials said. The prisoners received regular dental and medical check-ups. The CIA shipped in Halal food to the site from Frankfurt, Germany, the agency's European center for operations. Halal meat is prepared under religious rules similar to kosher food. Former U.S. officials said that because the building was a government installation, it provided excellent cover. The prison didn't need heavy security because area residents knew it was owned by the government. People wouldn't be inclined to snoop in post-communist Romania, with its extensive security apparatus known for spying on the country's own citizens. Human rights activists have urged the eastern European countries to investigate the roles their governments played in hosting the prisons in which interrogation techniques such as waterboarding were used. Officials from these countries continue to deny these prisons ever existed. 'We know of the criticism, but we have no knowledge of this subject,' Romanian President Traian Basescu said in a September interview with AP. A floor plan setting out the rooms where alleged torture took place right in the heart of Romania's capital city . The CIA has tried to close the book on the detention program, which Obama ended shortly after taking office. 'That controversy has largely subsided,' the CIA's top lawyer, Stephen Preston, said at a conference earlier this month. But details of the prison network continue to trickle out through investigations by international bodies, journalists and human rights groups. 'There have been years of official denials,' said Dick Marty, a Swiss lawmaker who led an investigation into the CIA secret prisons for the Council of Europe. 'We are at last beginning to learn what really happened in Bucharest.' During the Council of Europe's investigation, Romania's foreign affairs minister assured investigators in a written report that, 'No public official or other person acting in an official capacity has been involved in the unacknowledged deprivation of any individual, or transport of any individual while so deprived of their liberty.' That report also described several other government investigations into reports of a secret CIA prison in Romania and said: 'No such activities took place on Romanian territory.' 'We know of the criticism, but we have no knowledge of this subject' Journalists and human rights investigators have previously used flight records to tie Romania to the secret prison program. Flight records for a Boeing 737 known to be used by the CIA showed a flight from Poland to Bucharest in September 2003. Among the prisoners on board, according to former CIA officials, were Mohammad and Walid bin Attash, who has been implicated in the bombing of the USS Cole. Later, other detainees - Ramzi Binalshibh, Abd al-Nashiri and Abu Faraj al-Libi - were also moved to Romania. A deceptive Al-Libi, who was taken to the prison in June 2005, provided information that would later help the CIA identify Osama bin Laden's trusted courier, a man who unwittingly led the CIA to bin Laden himself. Court documents recently discovered in a lawsuit have also added to the body of evidence pointing to a CIA prison in Romania. The files show CIA contractor Richmor Aviation Inc, a New York-based charter company, operated flights to and from Romania along with other locations including Guantanamo Bay and Morocco. For the CIA officers working at the secret prison, the assignment wasn't glamorous. The officers served 90-day tours, slept on the compound and ate their meals there, too. Officers were prevented from the leaving the base after their presence in the neighborhood stoked suspicion. One former officer complained that the CIA spent most of its time baby-sitting detainees like Binalshibh and Mohammad whose intelligence value diminished as the years passed. The Romanian and Lithuanian sites were eventually closed in the first half of 2006 before CIA Director Porter Goss left the job. Some of the detainees were taken to Kabul, where the CIA could legally hold them before they were sent to Guantanamo. Others were sent back to their native countries.","Location has never been made public .

"By . Chris Johnson . Last updated at 4:03 AM on 10th December 2011 . The entire photo spread of Lindsay Lohan posing nude for Playboy has leaked online today - prompting the magazine's founder Hugh Hefner into releasing the magazine early. Earlier in the week the cover, featuring the 25-year-old actress posing nude on a bunny shaped chair hit the net. But now a further 10 snaps started doing the rounds. Revealed: Lindsay Lohan's highly classified Playboy magazine photo spread has leaked on the web, just days after a snap of the cover got out. Founder Hugh Hefner says the magazine will now be released early . Playboy has confirmed to MailOnline . that 'someone took photos of Lindsay’s pictorial in an advanced copy of . the January/February issue'. It was not due to hit newstands for . another week (December 15) and it was earlier reported how bosses feared the sales of what they . hoped would be the biggest selling issue of the year could be severely . hit, according to TMZ.com. Now Hefner has come up with a solution, tweeting: 'Because of the interest & the Internet leak, we're releasing the Lindsay Lohan issue early.' He has not confirmed the new date of release yet. Crest of a wave: Lohan was pictured in Hawaii watching the Pipe Masters Surf Contest from the balcony of a private residence today . Payday: The actress was paid a reputed $1m to take part in the nude Playboy shoot, seen here with a friend . What a drag: The Mean Girls star was spotted puffing on a cigarette . Lohan - who was today pictured in Hawaii watching the Pipe Masters Surf Contest from the balcony of a private residence - was paid a reputed $1m to bare all in the Marilyn Monroe-inspired shoot. The newly-leaked photos capture her in a series of provocative poses as the Mean Girls star channels the tragic screen siren. Lindsay appears entirely naked, save for a pair of terracotta platform heels, in most of the inside shots. The most clothing she wears is a black . fur shrug in one frame as she kneels with a red cushion covering her . lower half while raising her hands above her head. The shoot is set against a sexy red . backdrop; in some of the photos she lies on ruffled material - while in . another she perches on what appears to be a lip-shaped couch. Looking lasciviously into - and away . from - the lens in the spread, Lohan is wearing lashings of red lipstick . and has Marilyn's trademark beauty spot above her lip. She wears and assortment of long and . short blonde wigs, and completes her look with long fake lashes and . heavy black make-up on her eyelids. Props such as cushions are used to . cover her lower half in many of the photographs, although in one she . stands entirely naked - only slightly crossing her leg over. Another frame shows her lying back seductively while holding her breasts with her hands. One blog has published pages of the magazine and the accompanying interview. Lohan tells the mag: 'Sex and . sexuality are part of nature and I go along with nature. I think Marilyn . Monroe said that, and I agree with her. Marilyn Monroe style: Lindsay's shoot was . inspired by celebrity photographer Tom Kelley's nude . pictorial of Marilyn Monroe, shot in 1949 for a calendar before . featuring in the first edition of Playboy in 1953. One of Lohan's poses . is in very similar style to this one of Monroe . 'Knowing your body and being in touch . with your body is important because it gives you confidence, and in . life, women need confidence.' The actress had to pose for the magazine photographers twice, as the original attempt did not satisfy Playboy boss Hefner. Speaking . about the snaps, Hefner revealed the inspiration behind them. He . said: 'It's a classic tribute, inspired by the original Tom Kelley nude . pictorial of Marilyn Monroe. [It's] classy, very classy,' the New York . Post reported. 'It turned out very well. I would say . that I had some reservations early on, but after a couple of false . steps, everybody came on board and it's going to be very exciting,' Hefner added. At the time Lindsay posed for the photos, Dina Lohan, Lindsay's mother said the shoot was 'tastefully done'. Speaking . to The Insider's Christina McLarty she said: 'It was an opportunity for . her and she's done thousands and thousands of covers, so this was just . something...she's 25 now. 'It was just something that was her . decision...we have a contractual say in how far it goes and her and Mr . Hefner will decide.' Blonde ambition: Lindsay sported casual jean shorts, black vest top  and flip flops as she stepped out in the sunshine . Getting away from it all: The actress looked happy and relaxed as she chatted to a male friend . This . is not the first time that Lindsay has bared all for a magazine, in . 2008 she covered herself in just a sheer pink scarf posing on the front . of New York magazine. Lindsay . has been keeping a fairly low profile of late and last month she spent . just four and a half hours in jail, after being released early from her . 30-day sentence, due to overcrowding. The . sentence also requires Lohan to undergo 18 psychotherapy sessions and . appear monthly at court hearings between December 2011 and March 2012, . she also has to complete more community service. Taking action: In the wake of the second leak, Hefner says the mag will be released early . Offering their opinion: Playboy boss Hugh Hefner said the shoot was 'classy' and Dina said they were 'tastefully done' Oh la la: The Playboy cover isn't the first time that Lindsay has stripped off for a magazine and the actress bared all for New York magazine in 2008 .","It was due to hit newsstands next Thursday - but will now be released early, tweets founder Hugh Hefner ."

Liam, originally from the nearby island of South Uist, was the first to be killed on Lewis for more than 40 years. Detectives were hunting for three people wearing ‘hooded-type tops’ who were spotted near where Liam’s body was found. Detective Chief Inspector Kenny Anderson, of Northern Constabulary, said they were seen walking in the area shortly after midnight on November 22. Police have carried out raids on at least four properties on Lewis. Liam was last seen in a Co-op store on November 22, the day he was due to be sentenced at the sheriff court for assaulting or hindering two ambulance technicians trying to treat him after an incident in the town centre. He was believed to have been living at the home of his half-sister, Natasha, 20, and was working as a fisherman. The teenager had been involved in several serious incidents around the islands recently.

He said that she took a mirror and held it up to her face, shrugging it off, saying: ‘It’s not that bad’. ‘She’s excelling in the physical and occupational therapies and they're not as concerned about.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 8:10 PM on 9th December 2011 . A pensioner who strangled his wife of 50 years because he could not cope with her deterioration due to Alzheimer's has walked free from court today. Former pub landlord Keith Rumbold snapped while caring for Shirley Rumbold at their North Wales bungalow and then tried to take his own life with a cocktail of whisky, ant powder and tablets. Rumbold, 74, could not bear the thought of his wife being put in a psychiatric ward where he feared she would be cruelly treated. Remorseful: Keith Rumbold (left) covers his head as he leaves Mold Crown Court today after being released with a suspended prison sentence for the mercy killing of his wife, Shirley (right), who suffered with Alzheimer's disease . One morning when she became agitated and refused to dress, he flipped and grabbed her around the neck for what he thought was a few seconds. As she passed away, she slipped off the bed on to the floor and he placed a pillow under her head and kissed her repeatedly, telling her that he was sorry. Mrs Rumbold's death was the second tragedy to hit the family this summer after the couple's grandson died after falling into a pond in the back garden of his home. Rumbold's suicide attempt failed and he was charged with murdering 73-year-old Shirley. A trial was due to be held next year, but today at Mold Crown Court in Wales his guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the prosecution. Rumbold, who had never been in any trouble before, received a 51-week prison sentence suspended for two years. Snapped: Police outside the bungalow in Prestatyn, North Wales, where Rumbold strangled his wife while caring for her because he didn't want her going to a psychiatric hospital . He was placed on supervision and a . mental health treatment order was made so that he would receive . treatment from a psychiatrist as an out-patient. Mr . Justice Lloyd-Jones told him that he had already served the equivalent . of a 12-month sentence since the killing on June 9 and it was not . necessary for him to return to prison. Rumbold had previously spoken of suicide, saying it had been a cry for help as he tried to cope with 'her cruel illness', effectively as her sole carer. He did not want her placed in an unit where she would have to wear a nappy and felt that she would only last a couple of weeks. Mr Justice Lloyd-Jones . The judge said that he decided to kill himself 'because you could not bear to be without her' and tried to stab himself. But he did not penetrate the skin. The judge said: 'There is a great deal of mitigation. Your relationship was a very loving one. During her illness, you gave her four years of selfless devotion and love. You snapped and lost self control under the immense pressure.' The defendant, the judge said, was trapped between the pressure of being unable to look after her at home and his dread of her going into a home. The couple were married 50 years and were said to be devoted to each other. The couple had three grown up children, and lived in a one-bedroom bungalow at The Meadows in Prestatyn where their daughter found her dead and him lying on the dining room floor in June. Prosecutor John Philpotts said Mrs Rumbold suffered from vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. She was on medication, but he refused to administer it, saying that he did not want her to be 'like a zombie'. Second tragedy: The couple's 11-year-old grandson, Nathan Rumbold, was found dead after falling into a pond at his home in Polesworth, Warwickshire, last summer . At times, he appeared 'at the end of his tether'. In the days and weeks leading up to her death, her condition continued to worsen, the court heard. She was verbally and sometimes physically aggressive to him and his own health began to suffer. He was reluctant to accept help from outside agencies and appeared to be embarrassed by the situation. Rumbold seemed very concerned that social services were intervening and hostile to the idea of her moving into residential care. 'He had seen a television programme a few days earlier on June 1 which suggested that standards within some care homes were poor and he appeared convinced that his wife would be treated badly if she were admitted into care,' said Mr Philpotts. On the day of the killing, their daughter Susan Davies attended their home, the curtains were drawn and she found a number of notes from her father, warning her to take care on entering the bedroom. One asked if he and his wife could be cremated together. He was lying in the doorway of the dining room and on entering the bedroom she found her mother dead on the floor with pillows placed either side of her. Mrs Davies realised from her mother's facial expression that she was dead. She shouted: 'What have you done?' and her father appeared to try to respond. Distraught: Floral tributes left to Nathan who apparently died after tripping and banging his head before landing in the pond in August . Mr Philpotts said: 'Paramedics attended. He told them that he wanted to die, that they were not to resuscitate him and that he had taken tablets and anything he could get his hands on.' He said she had 'taken a funny turn' and 'was now at peace'. He said he wanted to die and to be with his wife. The defendant had four or five very superficial scratches to the abdomen which he said he had caused with a knife and he said he had taken whisky and ant powder. He told police: 'She had dementia. The last three years have been hell. What is going to happen to me now? I did it. I strangled her. ' Arrested on suspicion of murder he said: 'What happened today was I just put Shirley to sleep'. I've always been a law-abiding citizen.' He added: 'All I wanted was social services to come round and give us a hand with the cleaning.' When interviewed by the police, he said: 'I was getting her clothes out of the wardrobe, then I just snapped. I just didn't know what day it was or what time it was and I just snapped and I grabbed her by the neck. Keith Rumbold . 'Everything just seemed to come up in a like a surge you know and I just cracked. I turned around and just grabbed her by the throat I think...I don't remember after that.' Mrs Rumbold died from asphyxiation caused by external compression of the neck, probably by manual strangulation. Gordon Cole QC, mitigating, said the case was 'tragic'. The defendant was a law-abiding, hard working man who was devoted to his wife and she was devoted to him, he said. Earlier this year, the couple's grandson Nathan Rumbold died after apparently tripping and banging his head before falling into a pond in back garden in Polesworth, Warwickshire. He was taken to hospital by air ambulance, but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The boy's family were said to be 'absolutely distraught and deep in grief'. The tragedy happened at a cul-de-sac at Polesworth, Warwickshire. After Rumbold's sentencing, Detective Sergeant Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said the sentence concluded a very difficult and sensitive case. She said: 'Our condolences go to Shirley Rumbold's family who have conducted themselves with dignity throughout this deeply distressing time. 'The family wish to say that Shirley Rumbold was a very loving and caring mother who was adored by all her grandchildren. 'They wish to thank all who have supported them throughout these difficult months and would appreciate from privacy following today's hearing.'","Keith Rumbold snapped while caring for wife of 50 years at their home .

The turnout of black voters in Barack Obama's victorious 2008 presidential campaign was phenomenal. Some . 65 per cent of eligible African-Americans voted that year. But, three years on and there is discontentment in the black community as their unemployment rate hits a 27-year high. Currently, more than 16.8 per cent of blacks are out of work compared with just 8 per cent of whites. The numbers are even more bleak for black men, with 19.1 per cent being jobless. What's more the black unemployment rate has now remained above 10 per cent for four years. And it's showing at the polls. Just five months ago, 83 per cent of African-Americans held 'strongly favorable' views of Mr Obama. That number has now dropped to 58 per cent, according to a Washington Post-ABC news poll. When Mr Obama asked out-of-work black Americans for help at the Caucus awards dinner last night observers may have felt he was also pleading for a lifeline in his second term bid. Topping the to-do list, he said, is getting Congress to pass the jobs bill he sent to Capitol Hill two weeks ago. The package of payroll tax cuts, business tax breaks and . infrastructure spending will benefit 100,000 black-owned businesses and . 20million African-American workers,' he said. Republicans have indicated they're . open to some of the tax measures - but oppose his means of paying for . it: hiking taxes on top income-earners and big business. Caucus leaders remain fiercely protective of the . nation's first African-American president, but in recent weeks they've . been increasingly vocal in their discontent - especially over black . joblessness. 'If Bill Clinton had been in the White House . and had failed to address this problem, we probably would be marching . on the White House,' caucus chairman, Rep Emanuel Cleaver of . Missouri, recently told McClatchy Newspapers. Like many . Democratic lawmakers, caucus members were dismayed by Mr Obama's . concessions to the GOP during the summer's talks on raising the . government's borrowing limit. Mr Cleaver famously called the compromise deal a 'sugar-coated Satan sandwich.' But . he also said his members are keeping their gripes in check because 'nobody wants to do anything that would empower the people who hate the . president.' At the caucus dinner last year, Mr Obama . implored African-Americans to get out the vote in the midterm elections because . Republicans were preparing to 'turn back the clock.' What followed was a Democratic rout that Mr Obama acknowledged as a 'shellacking.' Where the black community turned out in droves to help elect him in 2008, there was a sharp drop-off two years later.

"By . Mark Solomons . Last updated at 10:02 AM on 12th December 2011 . It is the dilemma faced by thousands of shoppers when searching for a new gadget for the home. Whether buying a camcorder or coffee maker, a DVD player or dishwasher, is it a good idea to plump for the most expensive brand, stick with the names you trust, or take a chance on the cheapest model and hope for the best? The average price of a festive basket of food and drink is a hefty 19.5per cent higher than last Christmas. Asda came out best value for a trolley of 33 festive essentials, which totted up to £127.40 - £4.32 less than second-placed Morrisons, £9.85 less than biggest chain Tesco, £21.60 less than Sainsbury's and a whopping £40.04 less than upmarket Waitrose. Asda also had the cheapest offers on festive drinks though, Morrisons has the cheapest small turkey at £8.33, compared with Asda at £10, Sainsbury's for £13.24 and Tesco £15.00 while at Waitrose they were £17.01. But the basket compiled annually by trade magazine The Grocer, while not strictly comparing like with like, cost on average £142.36 this year, a staggering 19.5per cent hike on last year's average across the five major chains of £119.18. However the cost of alcohol was down, along with the Alka Seltzer for the cost festive hangover. Asda was selling champagne for £12 a bottle, merlot for £4 and sauvignon blanc for £6, Bailey's Irish Cream for £10 and Ruby Port for £6.32. Own-label Christmas puddings were just £5 at Asda, matched only by Tesco, and along with Sainsbury's the cheapest mince pies at £1. But now there’s no excuse to be baffled as the country’s consumer experts have produced a list of the 50 best buys of the year. The top household products have been compiled by Which? magazine after researchers tested 2,700 makes and models under strict laboratory conditions. Which? says everything from headphones, laser printers, vacuum cleaners and baby monitors were put through their paces before they could be deemed a best buy. The list is based on the goods being the most efficient, the best value for money, the least likely to go wrong, and the most likely to do the job properly. For customers looking to replace a broken-down washing machine or buy a present for a loved one, it could take the guesswork out of the dazzling array of items on the shelves. The winners range from a 55in Samsung television priced at £2,500 to a pack of Energizer rechargeable batteries worth £8. The best toaster costs just £28, compared with some models on sale for twice as much. In contrast, the top tumble dryer, from German manufacturer Miele, costs £1,269, which is considerably more expensive than rival machines. Most brand names on the list, including Apple, Bosch and Bose, are well known to British consumers, while those such as Rancilio, the Italian-based coffee machine maker, are less so. The list may prompt householders to check which makes and models they own themselves, or perhaps act as a reminder about what they should get next time. But be warned: buying the best doesn’t come cheap.Purchasing every item on the list contained in the panel would cost almost £19,500. Some categories, such as fridge-freezers, were omitted from the list because no particular model was deemed a best buy. ‘They either didn’t make the grade, or lacked sufficient reliability data,’ said a Which? spokesman. Meanwhile, Cyber Monday last week saw Amazon.co.uk receive orders for over three million items, which is the most amount of items ever to be ordered in a single day.

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 7:19 PM on 8th December 2011 . A pensioner claiming to be Heather Mills' forrmer chauffeur has been fined after being caught using a photocopy of her disabled parking badge. Stewart Simonson was caught out after traffic wardens recognised the picture on his permit 'was someone on the television'. Simonson, 65, said he photocopied the blue badge with Ms Mills' 'full knowledge and consent' as he was confronted about his Smart car parked on a yellow line in north London. He was ordered to pay a total of £660 - including a £175 fine - by Enfield magistrates after admitting using the permit six months after finishing working for the former model. Stewart Simonson, 65, from Enfield, told police he was a former driver for Heather Mills . Mr Simonson claimed he had permission from Ms Mills to have a copy of her blue badge . He said he copied the badge because Ms Mills, whose marriage to Sir Paul McCartney ended in an acrimonious court battle in 2008, often forgot the original when she travelled to London. Simonson, who did not appear in court, admitted the offence under the road traffic act, Robert Redmond, a lawyer representing Enfield Council, told Jenny Brown, chairman of the bench. Simonson, from John Gooch Drive, Enfield, had said he had only used the permit 'on a spur of the moment' after stopping to pick up painkillers and a watch battery, Mr Redmond added. Mr Redmond said: 'Because she would forget to bring her parking card he had made a photocopy with her knowledge and consent. 'He said he had intended to return it to her “if he saw her”. He didn’t return it to Brighton because he didn’t want to get her into trouble. 'It would appear he was unlucky as he said it was the first and only time he used the card.' Simonson, of Enfield, wrote a letter to the court in which he said: 'I was employed as a chauffeur by a lady who was awarded a disabled badge. 'On occasion she would forget to bring the badge, therefore I made a copy. 'I suffer from arthritis which forced me to retire nine months ago. Six weeks before this I had been discharged from hospital and am in constant pain and unable to walk any distance and applied for a badge myself.' On the day of the offence he had been home alone and had been in a lot of pain so drove to the supermarket to get some tablets then stopped to get his watch battery changed and had used the badge to park on the single yellow line which is restricted between 8am and 6pm, he claimed. He said: 'I would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.' Simonson, who said he was in the process of applying for his own blue badge, had parked his car illegally on Lodge Avenue, near a supermarket, the court heard. Suspicions were raised about the permit when traffic officers looked at the hologram. Mr Redmond told the court: 'They recognised that the person in the permit to be someone they had seen on television.' Heather Mills separated from Paul McCartney in 2006 in an acrimonious split that was settled in the courts . Enfield Council is taking a 65-year-old man to court for allegedly using a photocopy of Heather Mills' blue badge to park illegally. In interview he claimed to be her former chauffeur. Chris Bond, of Enfield Council, said Simonson's use of the permit was a 'despicable crime'. 'This prosecution shows we will not hesitate to take action against people who defraud and rob from the disabled,' he added. 'Enfield Council is absolutely committed to bring blue badge cheats to book and anyone who attempts this type of crime in our borough can expect us to act swiftly and firmly against them.' Ms Mills was granted the badge by Brighton authorities because she has a prosthetic leg. She was hit by a police motorbike and suffered serious injuries, losing part of her left leg, six inches below her knee in London in 1993. She met Sir Paul McCartney at a Pride of Britain charity event, and they were married in June 2002 and gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney in October 2003. She separated from the former Beatle in 2006, which led to a highly publicised divorce in which she was awarded £24.3million in a court settlement in March 2008.",Stewart Simonson caught when wardens recognised picture on the permit 'was someone on the television'

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Last updated at 9:13 AM on 9th December 2011 . Belgian police have threatened to arrest British border staff stopping illegal migrants taking Eurostar trains to London. Dozens of migrants are thought to exploit the so-called ‘Lille Loophole’ every day. They buy a Eurostar ticket from Brussels to Lille, allowing them to avoid the UK border checks in the Belgian capital. Loophole: Passengers can miss key border checks by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille but then stay on until London . And when the train stops in Lille they . simply stay on board and carry on through the Channel Tunnel to London, . where passports are rarely checked. Internal border agency figures suggest use of the loophole has shot up . in recent months. The Belgian authorities insist Britain cannot . interrogate Eurostar passengers with tickets to France because both . countries are inside the European Union’s Schengen area of free . movement. St Pancras station in London. The Government alone is powerless to close the so-called 'Lille loophole' and is in negotiation with other European countries . UK officials were pulled up when they tried to stop two Iranian men said . to ‘bear all the hallmarks of Lille loopholers’. Hiding under a Eurostar train is one way of getting into Britain – as is trying to sneak into the back of a lorry. But both are dangerous and far from certain to succeed – unlike the ‘Lille loophole’. Illegal migrants must first buy a ticket – often for as little as £23 –from Brussels in Belgium to Lille in France. Crucially, this ticket allows them to bypass the British border controls at the Eurostar terminal in Brussels, which are designed for those with tickets to London. Instead the migrants walk down the passport-free lane for Lille passengers – where only their ticket is checked. When the train gets to Lille, they stay on board and complete the journey to London. Some buy a second ticket covering the final leg of their trip so they do not fall foul of ticket inspectors. Brussels police say stopping passengers with tickets to Lille, even those thought to be headed for London, breaches the Schengen agreement on free movement. One of the UK . officials told BBC Radio 4’s The Report that a Belgian officer shouted . at him: ‘This has got to stop. You are not in Britain now, you are in . Schengen. If they make a complaint you will be arrested.’ The threats mean British officials may now have to turn a blind eye to suspected illegal migrants. In the first six months of this year, officers caught 80 migrants using . the loophole to get into the  country. But in the following five months . that number increased to 240. Last year just 14 migrants were caught on . the route. As the figures show only those who are detected by the Border Agency, the true figure is likely to be much higher. Border Agency sources said there were fears the loophole could be . exploited by terrorists and people traffickers. One said it was not . unusual to see up to 20 suspect passengers on a Eurostar train. Another officer even claimed Belgian police had been known to use the loophole to clear migrants from the streets of Brussels. Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘We are working closely with our . Belgian counterparts and Eurostar to resolve this as quickly as . possible.’ A spokesman for the Belgian government did not respond to requests for a comment.","Passengers buy a train ticket from Brussels to Lille but can stay on until London without passport checks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:42 PM on 9th December 2011 . Plastic manhole covers are being trialled in a drastic move by a local authority after scrap metal thieves stripped an area of the traditional road coverings. Councillors in North Somerset have ordered the trial after scores of the covers were stolen earlier this year. The move comes as scrap metal theft reaches almost epidemic proportions across the UK. Plastic replacement: The cheaper covers are being tested in North Somerset following a spate of thefts . Nineteen manhole and drain covers, which are made out of wrought iron and cost an average £4000, were stolen in just 48 hours across North Somerset in March. The new plastic replacements cost only £400 and are built to last for 15 years where their metal counterparts require replacement after five years. North Somerset Council is now working with motorcyclists in the Nailsea area to determine whether the plastic anti-skid cover are a safe alternative. North Somerset Council spokesman, Nick Yates, said: 'We are trialling a new type of cover in one location in Nailsea. It is made of plastic and is anti-skid. 'We are now working with a local motorcycle group to monitor and get feedback from the group into the performance of the cover over the coming months. Metal target: Manhole and drain covers are being stolen countrywide as the cost of scrap metal rises . 'The new covers are also less likely to be stolen as they have no scrap value. We are trialling one of the plastic covers and if this proves successful, we would hope to use them in other areas across the district.' Local residents have also complained that the covers at Church Lane in Backwell have yet to be replaced despite them being stolen  nine months ago. The council has cordoned off the area around the missing covers to warn drivers and pedestrians, but residents say work needs to be done urgently to replace them. Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment. Rail . companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily . basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number . of thefts 'is huge'. As . police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the . country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing . pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act. The . coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them . from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders . down. Ministers are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy. It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year. One resident said: 'There is no street lighting to speak of along Church Lane and to have these open manholes surrounded by barriers in the middle of the road is a safety hazard. One of the cordons is just around a blind bend and when you come around the corner you are on top of it before you have noticed. 'I wouldn’t have thought it would have taken more than six to eight weeks to order replacements and get them fitted. 'I believe there are some concerns about the fitting of these manholes because of the utilities which may be under the road. 'But other companies seem to manage to carry out work without these problems, so why can’t North Somerset Council. I am concerned that nine months on, these covers have not been replaced.' Mr Yates said the covers were being replaced but there had been delays because surveys needed to be carried out first. The metal covers need to be drilled into the road surface and sometimes cables and pipes lie underneath. The council is also appealing to anyone who sees anything suspicious to report it immediately to the police.","Thieves stripped area in Somerset in under 48 hours .

"Last updated at 12:07 PM on 9th December 2011 . Samsung Electronics Co. is free to sell its Galaxy tablet computers in Australia after the country's highest court dismissed rival Apple's appeal in its global patent battle . The copyright and patent battle . between the two companies rages on, but Samsung Electronics has won . another important round - Australia's highest court dismissed rival Apple’s appeal, leaving Samsung free to sell its Android tablets this Christmas. It follows similar rulings in cases in Germany, the Netherlands and America. Following the ruling, Samsung said in a statement that its Galaxy Tab 10.1 'will be available in stores this holiday period.' Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a tablet running Google's Android system which is lighter and thinner than iPad 2. Apple took Samsung to court in Australia after accusing the South Korean company of copying its iPad and iPhone. The battle began in April, when . Cupertino, California-based Apple sued Samsung in the United States, . alleging the product design, user interface and packaging of Samsung’s . Galaxy devices 'slavishly copy' the iPhone and iPad. But a U.S. court recently ruled . Samsung was free to sell Galaxy devices in the U.S, a decision analysts . said could 'turn the tide' in favour of Samsung. The companies are embroiled in bitter . patent disputes in 10 countries - but none is more important than the . U.S., Samsung's biggest market. The three leading rivals in the tablet market: Samsung and Apple are locked in a bitter patent dispute in several countries . Samsung . surpassed Apple as the world’s top smartphone maker in the third . quarter and a ruling to temporarily halt U.S. sales of Galaxy . smartphones could have negatively affected its growth momentum just as . Apple released the iPhone 4S in early October. 'We . believe the legal uncertainties between Samsung and Apple are waning, . or put in another way, the situation is turning positive for Samsung,' said Nomura analyst CW Chung. The battle has only intensified as sales of Samsung's cult Galaxy handsets have bitten into Apple's market share. Samsung is now the biggest smartphone company on Earth, by revenue and by volume, beating both Nokia and Apple. Android  phones now account for 52.5 per cent of the smartphone market - and Apple's just 16.6. But . its Galaxy Tab isn't going to have an easy ride, even if it DOES go on . sale - both Galaxy and iPad 2 are now being aggressively undercut by . Amazon's new Kindle Fire tablet, which is roughly half the price of . either. The Apple store in Sydney, Australia: A dispute between Apple and Samsung has erupted over Samsung's Galaxy S 10.1 tablet . A Samsung store in Sydney: Customers will be free to buy Galaxy tablets from Friday afternoon - unless Apple appeals the court's decisions . Fire has remained Amazon's best-selling item for eight weeks running. At . least one major American retailer said it outsold iPad 2 on Black . Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza seen as 'kicking off' the . shopping season in America. 'It’s . hard to expect the ruling to have a major positive impact on Samsung’s . tablet business or legal cases in other countries as Apple could appeal - . and sales won’t be restored anytime soon,' said Song Myung-sub, an . analyst at HI Investment & Securities in Seoul. A Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 on display in Seoul: Despite the Australian ruling, legal battle still rages between the two companies and Apple is to sue for a European ban on December 22 . Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle in 10 . countries involving smartphones and tablets since April. At one point, Apple forced Samsung to withdraw its Galaxy tablet from a technology trade show where it was not even on sale. Samsung has attempted to ban iPhone 4S in several territories. The . Australian dispute centres on touchscreen technology used in Samsung’s . new tablet. The quarrel had triggered expectations that some of the pair’s $5 . billion-plus relationship may be up for grabs. Samsung openly describes Apple as its 'biggest customer'. Ironically, the A5 chip in both iPad 2 and iPhone 4S still seems to be made by Samsung. 'Apple will continue to dominate the tablet market as Amazonappears to be the only viable threat at the moment and other vendors, including Samsung, continue to struggle.'    The . ruling is, however, a timely boost for Samsung ahead of the busy . pre-Christmas shopping season. While the Australian market is not large, . it is a key launch market for Apple products outside the United . States.

The samples showed two-year-old Omnee posing happily and naturally,  and Mrs Allan was quick to order £10 prints for the family home. But she was horrified when the prints arrived to find that the photographer had airbrushed away the purple birthmark that runs from Omnee’s top lip to her cheek. Anger: Nikki and Stuart Allan are furious after a professional photographer altered pictures of their daughter Omnee, pictured left and right, to remove her birthmark from the image . ‘I think it’s absolutely disgusting,’ said Mrs Allan. ‘Who is this man to decide my daughter isn’t perfect?’ Luke Joyce, who runs Little Stars Photography, has apologised and said . the picture had been altered by accident – it was the photo of another . child which should have been changed. But Mrs Allan, a 30-year-old retail merchandiser, said: ‘We live in a . world which has all manner of pressures to conform and look perfect and . for someone to decide that a two-year-old isn’t pretty enough because . she has a birthmark on her face is scandalous. Birthmarks are a benign skin irregularity which appear on the skin at or shortly after birth. As many as one in ten babies have a birthmark and they can appear anywhere on the skin. They are not painful and are caused by an overgrowth of blood vessels or excess skin pigmentation. One of the most common types of birthmark is a hemangioma. These occur when many new blood vessels grow in a specific area on the skin. No one knows what causes a birthmark but they are not painful or a sign of illness. A strawberry hemangioma, where the skin is red and sticks out of the skin go away untreated by the time a child is about nine years old. Another kind of birthmark is the port wine stain, which is level with the outer layer of skin. Children with these normally have them on the face and neck. Doctors can sometimes use laser surgery to treat birthmarks to reduce their appearance. ‘Where does it stop? If one of the kids . had wonky teeth, would he have altered them to make them “perfect”? It’s . not up to him to play God. 'There are enough worries about the . prejudices she may endure later in life without having to worry about . adult male photographers, especially when she’s just two years old.’ The photographer visited the Pebbles Day Nursery in Exmouth, Devon, . around six weeks ago and took pictures of the majority of youngsters . there. Parents were then able to view the photos and choose which ones . to order. On these pictures, Omnee’s birthmark was still present. Mrs . Allan, who lives in Exmouth with her husband Stuart and other children . Kelvin, five, and Brooke, three, said she did not accept Mr Joyce’s . comment that the birthmark had been removed because of a mix-up with the . photo of another child. ‘What are the chances of another child requiring a birthmark to be . removed?’ she asked. ‘I’m fuming. He’s offered us a free print but I . don’t want anything to do with him.’ Sophie Edwards, manager of Pebbles Day Nursery, said several parents . were unhappy with the photos. ‘Some children’s eyes appeared to have . changed from blue to brown while others just didn’t look very good,’ she . said. ‘We feel very let down. Whether or not Omnee’s birthmark was . deliberately altered I don’t know, but either way it’s a very . unfortunate incident.’ Mr Joyce said he would not dream of altering a child’s photo for . cosmetic reasons and Omnee’s picture had been altered because of a . mix-up with reference numbers. ‘I was mortified when I realised the mistake,’ he said. ‘I have spoken with Omnee’s parents and offered a free print. ‘I hold my hands up and admit I made a mistake but that’s what it was, a genuine mistake. ‘I would never alter a photograph in that way. How dare I? Who am I to . decide what features should and shouldn’t appear in pictures? ‘We are a small business with limited resources and this was a genuine . oversight for which I am eternally apologetic. I thought the family were . OK with the situation but obviously not.’","Parents viewed original images and chose their favourites to cherish .

The days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to get a day off are over, a survey has found, as workers fear 'pulling a sickie' could get them the sack. People are now so concerned about job security they will trudge into work even when genuinely ill to underline their commitment to the job. The survey by Fisherman’s Friend found that half of workers had not taken a single day off sick so far in 2011 because of cold or flu, despite actually being ill at least three times. The average number of days taken off sick due to such illnesses is now just two days a year, half the number compared to three years ago. This fall in cold and flu absenteeism means that such illnesses are estimated to have cost the UK a mere £4.6 billion in 2011, compared with more than £9 billion three years ago. Workers’ top two reasons for battling on even when ill were ‘concerns over job security’ and ‘not wanting to let colleagues down’, which together polled more than 90 per cent of the vote. 'Our survey makes interesting reading because the figures show the difference in workers’ attitudes to sickness and job security in just three short years,'said Rob Metcalfe, spokesman for Fisherman’s Friend. Pressures: Out of the 1,000 people surveyed 90 per cent said they would go into work despite being ill as they were concerned about job security . 'When we carried out our last study, fears over job security were not a strong factor, but we are now several years into the economic downturn, and with warnings of even tougher times ahead no one wants to be singled out as a weak link at work' Workers aged between 25 and 34 were found to have had the greatest number of colds and days off in 2011, three apiece, possibly due to hectic lifestyles that revolve around work and play, leaving them more exposed to illnesses such as the common cold. People in the North East were found to . have had the most colds, an average of three, while those living and . working in Northern Ireland have had the fewest, just two. Pulling a sickie: The days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to have a day at home are over . Workers in Scotland, Wales and the South West took the least time off when ill in 2011, with more than two thirds from each region declining to take a single day off for a cold or flu. Meanwhile, the only major difference between men and women still appears to be their perception of how ill they really are when suffering with a cold or flu. Out of 1,000 people surveyed three quarters of men claimed they genuinely thought they suffered when they were ill more than women.","Average number of sick days per year halved to just two .

Known as auroras, they are caused by radiation particles . from the sun bouncing off Earth's atmosphere and are normally only seen in countries in the far north, such as Norway. However, they've been photographed  as far south as Oxfordshire and in Northumberland, where the skies became a dramatic green and purple hue. Purple haze: The incredible light show on Monday made Northumberland look more like Norway . It's not grim up north: The solar flares transformed Britain's northern skies . Way to glow: The aurora over Ludgershall in Buckinghamshire last night . A huge green and red aurora was also captured by the International Space Station. However, the recent solar flares, caused by a . sunspot known as 'Active Region 1302', could wreak havoc with electrical . communications ranging from handheld . electronics such as iPhones to sections of the power grid. But experts . believe the most powerful eruptions have been and gone. Joe Kunches, a scientist at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, said: 'The solar wind that was really energised seems to have passed us by.' However, solar activity is notoriously unpredictable and the Earth isn't out of the firing line just yet. Astronomer . Dr Ian Griffin, CEO of Science Oxford, told MailOnline: ‘Active Region . 1302 is the source of all of the auroras, and may well be the source of . some more auroras over the next few nights. ‘Space-weather . forecasters estimate a 40 per cent chance of more flares during the . next 24 hours. Any such eruptions would be Earth-directed as the sunspot . crosses the centre of the solar disk. ‘In short, with no moon in the sky, and . an active region on the sun, the next few nights might be very . interesting for sky-watchers in Britain.’ Aurora-chaser Reed Ingram-Weir described the lights seen over Britain as the most impressive he'd ever seen. On . Monday he took incredible pictures near the causeway that links the . North East coast with the island of Lindisfarne, in Northumberland. He . said: 'What made this display really amazing was the colour, it was a . fantastic deep purple colour when usually Northern Lights are a pale . green colour. 'The reason . it was purple is all to do with the composition of the particles from . the sun hitting the atmosphere, obviously these were some different . kinds of particles. Red alert: This stunning image from the International Space Station shows a bright green and red aurora over the Earth, with the latter colour caused by radiation colliding with nitrogen in the atmosphere . Hot stuff: The behemoth sunspot 1302 has been unleashing huge solar flares . Well spotted: Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin took this picture of Active Region 1302 in Oxford . 'We set off from Newcastle at around 9pm and then drove an hour north, all the time trying to get a clear view directly north. 'We needed to find an area without . light pollution as well and by the time we reached Lindisfarne it was . about 10.30pm but it was well worth the journey. 'I have been to Norway four times and Iceland once to see the lights, but this was the best one I have ever seen anywhere.' Spectacular auroras could be a fairly regular occurrence over the next new years as the sun is currently going through a strong period of activity. Dr Tim O'Brien from the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory, told MailOnline: 'Solar activity rises and falls, with peaks every 11 years. We are now on a rise towards the next maximum, which is good news for Northern Light watchers. 'The next peak is in 2014, so there should be other chances to see auroras. The rate of occurence (of solar flares) will certainly increase over the next few years. However, you can't predict them.' A sunspot occurs when strong magnetic fields on the sun reach the surface and cool down, according to Nasa. Large ones can be seen clearly using telescopes and powerful cameras.","'Northern Lights' seen over southern England .

Philippines was today safe after escaping from his captors, the Philippine military said. After walking for two days without shoes, Kevin Lunsmann was found by a village official in Lamitan town on southern Basilan Island yesterday. He had spent five months in captivity. The area is a . stronghold of the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are believed to . be behind the kidnapping, said military spokesman Lt. Col. Randolph . Cabangbang. Kevin Lunsmann, 14, a kidnapped American teenage boy, talks to Filipino soldiers. He wandered without shoes for two days in a southern Philippine jungle before villagers found him, ending his five-month captivity . The boy is now safe in military custody, Cabangbang said. Police Senior Superintendent Edwin de . Ocampo said Kevin, of Campbell County, Virginia, . told his kidnappers that he would take a bath in a stream, then ran away. The . boy, who was barefoot, followed a river and ran away when he saw . villagers, who eventually assured him that they were friends. Mr De Ocampo said the boy was fine except for bruises on his legs and arms. His Filipino-American mother, . Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, was freed two months ago after she was dropped . off by boat at a wharf on Basilan. Their Filipino cousin, Romnick . Jakaria, dashed to freedom last month when special Philippine army . forces managed to get near an Abu Sayyaf camp in the mountains of . Basilan. U.S. teenager Kevin Eric Lunsmann, 14, smiles at the military headquarters shortly after he escaped from kidnappers in southern Philippines . They were believed to be held for ransom, but Cabangbang did not say Saturday whether any was paid. U.S. ambassador Harry Thomas said the boy would be reunited with his family soon. 'In . this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an . innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday . celebrations,' Mr Thomas said. 'I also want to acknowledge the courage of Kevin himself, and his family, throughout this long ordeal.' He said there would be a 'speedy investigation and prosecution of all those involved in the kidnapping of American citizens.' The three were vacationing with . relatives on an island near Zamboanga city when they were snatched July . 12 and taken by boat to nearby Basilan. The captors then called the . family in Campbell County, Virginia, to demand a ransom. The U.S. and Philippine governments . did not pay any ransom for the mother's release, Interior Secretary .

Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative, the largest so far in America. Officials have become outraged after watching wealthy celebrities like Lindsay Lohan sent to jail at taxpayers’ expense. If you do the crime, prepare to do the time... and the dime: Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative . They say the fee - which is not far off the $188 for a luxury hotel in the area - is needed to plug an $80million black hole in the county finances. Riverside prison supervisor Jeff Stone said: ‘You do the crime, you will serve the time, and now you will also pay the dime’. He estimates that some 25 per cent of the county’s prisoners could be able to to pay something and that it could earn around £4million each year. Critics have however said it is unlikely to bring in even that much as most prisoners have no cash at all. Mr Stone said that he put forward the law, which was unanimously passed by the County Board of Supervisors, due to concerns about overcrowding. Riverside, which is east of Los Angeles, has five jails and stands at 93 per cent capacity, up from 85 per cent in October. The price of crime: In the UK to house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night . The fee will reimburse the county for of clothing, health care and food. One issue of concern is that those who stay in county jails do so for an average of two years, meaning for a wealthy prisoner they could end up paying $51,885 per year, or $103,795 for their entire stay. Mr Stone said: ‘We need to be looking for revenue wherever we can for ourselves. ‘There are people who have the means and who get into trouble with the law. Why should the citizens of this county with other struggles be forced to pay for that? The Lindsay Lohans of the world can certainly pay for it themselves.’ In Britain, the cost of holding an inmate in jail can be even higher than in Riverside County. Keeping somebody in a police cell - which is done when there is no room at nearby prisons - is a staggering £459 per night. To house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night.","Means-tested initiative is the largest so far in America .

Bernie Madoff's daughter-in-law has revealed how her husband gushed about their future in a romantic wedding anniversary card - just two months before he killed himself. Stephanie Madoff Mack’s disclosure comes one year after Mark Madoff, 46, was found hanged in his New York loft apartment - as their two-year-old son Nicholas slept in the next room. The suicide fell on the second anniversary on the arrest of his father, disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence for masterminding a $60billion financial scam. Happier times: Stephanie Madoff Mack, left, said how her husband Mark, right, left her a note gushing about their future just months before he hanged himself. She is still unable to make sense of his death, she added . In a blog post, Mack said her late husband had given her a card for their sixth anniversary bearing an optimistic message. She revealed that, a year on, she is still confused about why her husband killed himself when he was so excited about their future. ‘Dear Stephanie,’ the card read. ‘Another year. Another great year. I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my eyes at night. So much to look forward to. I love you. Mark.’ Writing for the Huffington Post, she also recalled their conversation during their celebratory dinner. Together: Writing a year after her husband's death, Stephanie Madoff Mack said their two young children, Nicholas and Audrey, still say they miss their father every day. She no longer speaks to the Madoff family . Shamed family: Fraudster Bernie Madoff, left, with his wife Ruth and son Mark . at a dinner in Long Island in 2001. Mark Madoff was found dead at his . apartment in Manhattan two years after his father's arrest for fraud . It ‘weighed the pros and cons of moving out of New York City to raise our two children in the suburbs’, she said. ‘We talked about possibly having a third child.’ She added: ‘What I remember about that . dinner is that we were like any other normal couple, in love, . celebrating their wedding anniversary. For their sixth wedding anniversary, which they celebrated two months before his death, Mark Madoff wrote Stephanie a card, which read: . Dear Stephanie. Another . year. Another great year. I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so . happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my . eyes at night. So much to look forward to. I love you. Mark . ‘We were not the son and daughter-in-law of Bernard Madoff, the man who turned our life upside down.’ She also described how she was still haunted by questions surrounding his death, which friends have said was borne out of Mark’s fear he would be locked up like his father. ‘His inner turmoil is something I still struggle with every day,’ she wrote. ‘I re-read his last email to me: ""I love you"" and his last email to his lawyer: ""Please take care of my family"" and still can make no sense of what he did. None.’ She also expressed her regret that he was not witnessing their two children, Nicholas and Audrey, growing up – and that the children spoke of him every day. ‘He should be here to see how big Nicholas has gotten,’ she wrote. ‘Their heads are the same shape, and Nick is always pushing his sleeves up the way Mark did. It makes me laugh, and then I immediately think: Mark should be here. ‘A day does not go by without either one telling me sadly that they miss Daddy.’ Tragedy: Officials carry Mark's body out of his New York apartment after he was found hanged by a dog leash . Death: The couple's 22-month-old son Nicholas was sleeping in the next room when Mark committed suicide . Ms Madoff Mack, who wrote a book entitled The End of Normal about her part in the family, has publicly fought with the rest of the Madoffs following the death of her husband. After she continued to contact Bernie, his wife Ruth was banned from Mark’s funeral. Mr Madoff was overwhelmed with grief and looked 'like someone had shot him in the stomach' when he heard that Mark had committed suicide, a fellow inmate said. After her husband's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, Ruth was warned by her sons Mark and Andrew to leave him or lose contact with them . Divided: The Madoff family, (L-R) Ruth, Bernie, Andrew and Mark, were torn apart by the arrest. Ruth, who was banned from Mark's funeral, angered her sons when she continued to support her disgraced husband . At the time she chose her sons. But after Mr Madoff was attacked in prison in 2009 she returned to his side, and her furious sons then severed all ties with her. Mr Madoff revealed earlier this year that his family no longer speak to him following his multi-billion-dollar fraud. Ruth has stopped visiting in a bid to salvage a relationship with her second son, Andrew.","Mark Madoff killed himself one year ago, two years after his father's arrest .

"By . Chris Slack . Last updated at 12:45 PM on 12th December 2011 . A team of historians believe they have unearthed evidence of a 4,000-year-old Stone Age camp - thanks to a dog walker. Roger Hall was walking his pet at Cannock Wood in Staffordshire, when he discovered a handful of strange-shaped rocks. Experts later identified the rocks as flint 'flakes', which are the off-cuts from tools crafted by Stone Age Man 4,000 years ago. Discovery: The Stone Age flints were found in Cannock Wood, which is also the location of the Iron Age hill fort Castle Ring, pictured, dating from around 2,500 year ago . If the discovery is confirmed, it could mark the spot of the only Neolithic camp known in the Midlands. Roger Knowles, a member of the Council for British Archaeology, is convinced the camp could identify a link from the time when mankind changed from nomadic hunter-gatherer to village dweller. Mr Knowles is now calling for a full excavation of the site after contacting the Staffordshire County Council archaeologist. Excited: Archaeologist Roger Knowles said the discovery could be one of the most important for decades and now wants the site to be fully excavated . He said: 'This could be the most significant historical find for decades. There have been previous individual finds from the Stone Age - tools, weapons and burial sites - but never a settlement. It's very exciting. 'I really haven't a clue what they would find if they began a full excavation. 'I've studied the area time and again. There's a sandstone cliff and I wonder if the people of that time built their settlement against it for shelter. 'From there they would have had an amazing view, all the way to the Derbyshire Hills.' He added: 'It would not have been a big community, a couple of families at most living in thatched dwellings surrounded by a wooden blockade. The slivers of stone handed by Mr Hall to Mr Knowles provide an insight into the Neolithic period, known as the New Stone Age - a part of our history of which little is known. The Cannock Wood tribe had access to flint - in an area where the stone is not native. Roger Knowles . Mr Knowles explained: 'They either discovered flat pebbles of it in the River Trent, or it was imported from down south.' The discovery is just the latest archaeological treasure unearthed in Cannock Wood, where pagans still flock to celebrate the summer solstice at Castle Ring, an Iron Age fort, dating from around 2,500 years ago, thought to possess mystical powers. In 1907, two London archaeologists discovered a New Stone Age 'flint' factory on nearby farming land. The haul included 600 flint blades and 40 complete 'implements'. Mr Knowles is convinced there are more treasures to be found in the Cannock Wood area. He added: 'The area really is a magical spot and each discovery shows New Stone Age man was a lot cleverer than we first thought.'","Finds flint 'flakes' which could be from Stone Age tools .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 5:57 AM on 12th December 2011 . The bloody drug war in Mexico shows no sign of relenting. Neither do calls for tighter border security amid rising fears of spillover violence. This hardly seems a time the U.S. would be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from Mexico without a customs officer in sight. But in this rugged, remote West Texas terrain where wading across the shallow Rio Grande undetected is all too easy, federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a security upgrade. Easy crossing: Guillermo Gonzalez Diaz, wades into the shallow Rio Grande across from Big Bend National Park, Texas on October 31 . By the spring, kiosks could open up in . Big Bend National Park allowing people from the tiny Mexican town of . Boquillas del Carmen to scan their identity documents and talk to a . customs officer in another location, at least 100 miles (160 kilometres) away. The crossing, which would be the . nation's first such port of entry with Mexico, has sparked opposition . from some who see it as counter-intuitive in these days of heightened . border security. Supporters say the crossing would give the isolated . Mexican town long-awaited access to U.S. commerce, improve conservation . efforts and be an unlikely target for criminal operations. William Wellman, Big . Bend National Park's superintendent, explained: 'People that want to be engaged in . illegal activities along the border, ones that are engaged in those . activities now, they're still going to do it. But you'd have to be a real idiot . to pick the only place with security in 300 miles (480 kilometres) of . the border to try to sneak across.' Security upgrade: Federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry in this West Texas terrain where it is easy to wade across the Rio Grande . The proposed crossing from Boquillas . del Carmen leads to a vast expanse of rolling scrub, cut by . sandy-floored canyons and violent volcanic rock outcroppings. The . Chihuahuan desert wilderness is home to mountain lions, black bears and . roadrunners, sparsely populated by an occasional camper and others . visiting the 800,000-acre (320,000-hectare) national park. Customs and Border Protection, which . would run the port of entry, says the proposal is a safe way to allow . access to the town's residents, who currently must travel 240 road miles . (390 road kilometres) to the nearest legal entry point. It also would . allow park visitors to visit the town. If the crossing is approved, the . Border Patrol would have eight agents living in the park in addition to . the park's 23 law enforcement rangers. 'I think it's actually going to end up making security better,' CBP spokesman William Brooks said. 'Once you've crossed you're still not . anywhere. You've got a long ways to go and we've got agents who are in . the area. We have agents who patrol. We have checkpoints on the paved . roads leading away from the park.' A public comment period runs through . December 27 on the estimated $2.3million project, which has support at . the highest levels of government from both countries. Rugged: Handicrafts made in Boquillas del Carmen, Mexico across the Rio Grande await tourists at an overlook in Big Bend National Park, Texas . But U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas . Republican member of the House Homeland Security committee, questioned . the wisdom of using resources to make it easier to cross the border. 'We need to use our resources to . secure the border rather than making it easier to enter in locations . where we already have problems with illegal crossings,' Mr McCaul said in . an email. 'There is more to the oversight of legal entry than checking . documents. (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) needs to be physically . present at every point of entry in order to inspect for contraband, . detect suspicious behaviour and, if necessary, act on what they . encounter.' While CBP will run the port of entry, . the National Park Service is the driver behind the project, which it . hopes will help conservation efforts on both sides of the border. Even . as the National Park Service has increased cooperation with its Mexican . counterpart, joint conservation has been limited by the inability of . personnel to cross the border without making a circuitous 16-hour drive, . Wellman said. So the National Park Service is . building the contact station just above the Rio Grande. It will house . CBP kiosks where crossers will scan in their documents and talk to a . customs officer in Presidio, the nearest port of entry, or another . remote location. Park service employees will staff the station, offering . information about the park and guiding people through the process. Work underway: Machinery operators in Big Bend National Park, Texas work on a planned remotely-operated port of entry at the Rio Grande . Similar ports of entry are already in operation on remote parts of the border with Canada. 'We think we can do this without doing . any damage to national security and possibly enhance security along the . border by having better intelligence, better communication with people . in Mexico,' Mr Wellman said. The crossing would also restore a . long-running relationship between the park, its visitors and the . residents of Boquillas del Carmen, the town of adobe dwellings set a . short distance from the river in Mexico. For years, U.S. tourists added an . international dimension to their park visit by wading or ferrying in a . rowboat across the shallow Rio Grande to the town. There they bought . handicrafts and tacos, providing much-needed cash in the isolated . community. But U.S. officials discouraged such . informal crossings in 2002 after the September 11 terrorist attacks . prompted calls for tighter border security. Without access to tourists . or supplies on the U.S. side, the town of just more than 100 people has . seen a 42 percent drop in population from 2000 to 2010. Gary Martin, who manages the Rio . Grande Village store at a nearby park campground, recalls many Mexican . residents crossing the river to pick up groceries and other necessities. 'We're their supply,' Mr Martin said. 'They don't have any electricity over there. So they would come here and . buy frozen chicken, cake mixes and things that they couldn't get over . there.' Mr Martin tried to stock food items Boquillas del Carmen residents wanted, such as eggs and big sacks of beans. 'After the border closed, well, I got . rid of most of my food and went back to gifts because I wasn't making . any money,' Mr Martin said. He estimated about 40 per cent of the store's . revenue came from Boquillas residents. Few have risked crossing to the store . since. 'If they get caught over here they get shipped off,' he said. 'They get deported all the way to Ojinaga and then they've got to find . their way home. It's not really worth it.' Still, most days some Boquillas del . Carmen residents wade across the river a short distance downstream of . the old crossing and scramble up to a paved overlook perched high above . the river. On boulders near the parking spots . they lay out painted walking sticks, scorpions and roadrunners crafted . from copper wire and colourful beads. Each craftsman's work occupies a . different rock and operates on the honour system with the hope tourists . will drop four or five dollars in their jar. 'Sometimes we don't sell anything,' said Boquillas del Carmen resident Guillermo Gonzalez Diaz. ""Sometimes . we sell one."" And other times authorities confiscate everything. Mr Gonzalez, a 34-year-old father of . three, described his town as 'very sad, very hard' and said there was no . work. Without access to the Rio Grande Village store, residents depend . on a bus that runs once a week to Melchor Muzquiz, a larger town about . 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, for supplies. A small military presence protects the . town from the drug-related violence that has engulfed other Mexican . border towns. Now with news of the port of entry, residents are already . making plans for restaurants and shops, he said. 'When it closed nobody crossed and everything went downhill. People began to leave,' he said. 'Now people are going to return.'","Kiosks could open up between Big Bend National Park and Boquillas del Carmen .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 5:36 PM on 12th December 2011 . An incredibly rare 200-year-old golden 'doubloon' has sold for $7.4million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a gold coin. The 'Brasher' 1787 doubloon contains 26.66g of gold and is considered the first American-made gold coin denominated in dollars. Its name comes from Ephraim Brasher, the goldsmith and neighbour of George Washington who minted the coin and whose trademark stamp was taken as proof of a coin's weight and fineness. Rarity: Left, The 1787 doubloon is stamped with Ephraim Brasher's unique 'EB' hallmark and is one of only seven ever made and right, a painting by artist Gilbert Stuart of the first American President George Washington . As the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia did not begin striking coins until the 1790s, the doubloon's huge historical significance saw it sell for the record sum. The coin is marked with Brasher's 'EB' hallmark, which the highly-regarded goldsmith only stamped on his own coins. He mainly struck copper coins from 1787 onwards, but also put his unique stamp on a small number of gold coins. It is thought the already-extremely rare coin has even greater significance as records show that only seven golden doubloons were made by Brasher. The coins fetched $2,415,000 for the . New York Style EB Punch on Wing NGC AU55, $2,990,000 for the unique New . York Style EB Punch on Breast NGC XF45 and $690,000 for the rare but . less iconic Lima Style Doubloon. Trademark: The 'EB' stamp was Brasher's hallmark when he began minting coins in 1787 . Blanchard . and Co, the New Orleans-based coin and precious metals company that . brokered the deal, said the doubloon was purchased by a Wall Street . investment firm.

"By . David Richards . Last updated at 6:19 PM on 12th December 2011 . A former chef accidentally killed his girlfriend by falling asleep on top of her, an inquest heard. 13st Robert Trigg and 8st Susan . Nicholson had been snuggled together on the sofa when he . rolled over and suffocated his partner of four months. The heavy sleeper, 47, awoke next morning . to find the ex-insurance worker, 52, dead and was initially questioned by . police on suspicion of accidental manslaughter but was released without . charge. Tragedy: Robert Trigg accidentally suffocated his girlfriend Susan Nicholson after rolling over on her as they slept on the sofa at their Worthing home (file picture) Robert attended the inquest and heard that it was possible Susan had been smothered in as little as 15 seconds. Home Office pathologist Dr Simon Paul told the coroner: 'Susan died as a result of somebody sleeping on top of her.' The inquest heard that Susan and Robert snuggled up together on the sofa of the flat they shared and fell asleep in each other's arms. However, during the course of the night Mr Trigg rolled on top of Ms Nicholson's head, suffocating her. He awoke the next morning with his torso lying diagonally across her face. Her face had turned purple and she was unresponsive and in the same position she had been throughout the night. The . post-mortem examination found pinpoint haemorrhages in one of her eyes, . her face, neck and upper chest - consistent with external pressure. Mr Trigg had been lying next to Ms Nicholson, on his side, with his head on her chest, the inquest heard. However, at some point during the night he had moved positions and woke up with his head on the arm of the sofa and his torso smothering Ms Nicholson . Dr Paul told the inquest in Worthing, West Sussex that it was possible the pressure lasted as little as 15 seconds. The couple had been living together for just four months in Ms Nicholson's flat in Worthing. Mr Trigg told the inquest that they would often sleep together on the sofa instead of their bed and had done so dozens of times before. On April 17 the pair had fallen asleep at about midnight with slender Ms Nicholson on her back with her head about halfway on the sofa and her leg over-hanging the arm. Mr Trigg had been lying next to her, on his side, with his head on her chest. However, at some point during the night he had moved positions and woke up with his head on the arm of the sofa and his torso smothering Ms Nicholson. Detectives had investigated the death and considered bringing charges of manslaughter or accidental manslaughter against Mr Trigg but did not find any case to answer. Mr Trigg told West Sussex Coroner Michael Kendall: 'I went to bed at about midnight. She was on the sofa and I asked her if she was coming (to bed). 'But she said ""Let's snuggle in, let's crash here together"". So I slept on the sofa with her. 'It was relatively narrow but we had slept in it 40 times before. We didn't have a bed for five weeks when we first moved in and it became common practice. 'I would often sleep on my side or find myself on the floor.' Mr Trigg said that he woke up at 2am to go to the toilet and returned to the sofa. He told the inquest Susan had been in the exact same position she had fallen asleep in. He awoke again at 8.15am the next morning, on top of her. He said: 'At this point I realised I couldn't hear breathing. I had my midriff over her chest area. 'When I looked down she was in the same position but she had changed colour. I just thought the worst, I had suffocated her. 'Her hand was still warm and I held it and said ""Time to wake up, stop mucking about"" but there was no response.' Dr Paul told the inquest that as well as the pin-point haemorrhages, the inside of Susan's lips had indentations consistent with being compressed against the teeth. 'She died as a result of somebody sleeping on top of her.' In recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Kendall said: 'There is no doubt that Susan's death was caused by Mr Trigg overlaying on her face. 'There is no evidence whatsoever that that was part of an altercation, violence or an incident of aggression of any kind. 'We cannot be sure precisely how Mr Trigg came to lie across Susan's face but the evidence is that he did and that immediately caused the death.'","Susan Nicholson, 52, suffocated when Robert Trigg, 47, rolled on top of her .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 5:14 PM on 12th December 2011 . Concerns are being raised about youth sports providing predators easy access to children in an environment where abuse can go undetected. It comes as the Amateur Athletic Union said this weekend it is probing allegations of child sex abuse against former president Bobby Dodd. This follows child sexual abuse allegations against assistants to coaches at Penn State and Syracuse universities that have rocked college sport. Investigation: The Amateur Athletic Union said this weekend it is probing allegations of child sex abuse against former president Bobby Dodd . Young athletes often spend significant time with coaches or team volunteers on the playing field, travelling to tournaments or at camps. Millions of children lace up shoes, don swimsuits and grab rackets - but rarely does any of this happen with close parental supervision. ‘You don't necessarily know a lot about these people except they know how to coach basketball,’ Northeastern University's Jarrod Chin said. Mr Chin, the director of training and curriculum at the university's ‘Sport in Society’ programme, cited basketball as an example. The Amateur Athletic Union is probing Bobby Dodd and contacted police in Memphis, Tennessee, who have begun investigating the matter. Two players alleged to ESPN he engaged in touching and sex acts in hotels during tournaments and that he gave alcohol to underage players. Two more cases: Child sexual abuse allegations against assistants at Penn State (Jerry Sandusky, left) and Syracuse (Bernie Fine, right) have rocked college sport . Dodd, who has not been charged with a crime, was not available for comment and an attorney for him has not yet been identified. There has been a wide variety of past instances of alleged sexual abuse in youth sports, the National Council of Youth Sports said. 'You don't necessarily know a lot about these people except they know how to coach basketball. It's a larger social issue, and sport is one avenue where sexual predators find ways to assault young people' Jarrod Chin . These range from a figure skating coach accused of molesting students to youth baseball and basketball coaches accused of abusing boys. In addition coaches of girls' track and volleyball teams have also been accused of interacting inappropriately with young women, the council said. ‘It's a larger social issue, and sport is one avenue where sexual predators find ways to assault young people,’ Mr Chin said. The National Council of Youth Sports has been trying to find the best way to screen coaches for at least a decade. Some sporting organisations have made background screening mandatory, the council’s executive director Sally Johnson said. The National Council recommends guidelines for such screening as well as use of a third-party company to process comprehensive checks. 'I think children get a feeling if something's not right, and they need to be comfortable coming forward to report that' Sally Johnson . Ms Johnson also wants to see better training and reference checks about past behaviour by coaches. The AAU, one of the nation's largest youth sports groups, said it planned to review the safeguards it has in place to protect youngsters. ‘I think children get a feeling if something's not right, and they need to be comfortable coming forward to report that,’ Ms Johnson said. Mr Chin added: ‘I think a lot of people are feeling like they can say something, tell their story, that they are not alone.'","Amateur Athletic Union probing former president Dodd .

"By . John Stevens and David Gardner . Last updated at 6:55 AM on 1st October 2011 . Michael Jackson looked like he’d been dead for 20 minutes when an ambulance arrived at his mansion, jurors heard yesterday. Paramedics Richard Senneff and Martin Blount dashed to the star’s aid after Jackson’s bodyguard called 911. The crew said they found Jackson lifeless and the star’s personal doctor Conrad Murray evasive about what had happened. Scroll down for video . Paramedic Richard Senneff took the stand in the Conrad Murray involuntary manslaughter trial . They claimed Murray made no mention . of the fact Jackson had been injected with propofol, the hospital . anaesthetic blamed for causing his death. According to evidence lodged in pre-trial papers, Murray said Jackson wasn’t taking any medication. When pressed, he said he gave the star lorazepam to help him sleep. ‘It didn’t add up,’ said Mr Senneff. He recalled that Jackson’s pupils were dilated, his skin was cold and his eyes dry. He said the 50-year-old looked like ‘a hospice patient’. However, the paramedic said Murray . insisted Jackson had only just lost consciousness and had no medical . problems other than dehydration. Mr Senneff testified that the singer might have lived if his personal physician Dr Murray had called 911 immediately. Mr Senneff said there was a good chance that they could have restarted Jackson's heart if they had been called when Murray found the singer unconscious. Murray appeared frantic when the paramedic arrived in the bedroom on the day of Jackson's death in June 2009, Mr Senneff said. He was the first paramedic to . reach Jackson's bedroom and said within moments, he and three other . paramedics were working to revive Jackson. He said that Jackson, who was wearing pyjamas and looked underweight, was being moved as he walked in. He said the singer was so thin his ribs were sticking out. Conrad Murray watches the prosecution make their case today . A photo of Michael Jackson's bedroom where he was found unconscious was shown in court . A Los Angeles judge has ordered attorneys in the trial to not speak publicly about the case. Judge Michael Pastor said this afternoon that prosecutors and lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray were ordered not to comment outside of their respective legal teams. Pastor didn't specify the reason for his decision. However, he called Matt Alford, a Houston lawyer who is a partner with Murray's attorney, Ed Chernoff, to return this afternoon. Mr Alford appeared on NBC's 'The Today Show' this morning, in which he said the jury was smart enough to know prosecutors haven't proven their case. The lawyer cast doubt on the testimony of Jackson's bodyguard Alberto Alvarez who testified yesterday. He said: 'It's kind of like the old Mark Twain adage, ""I remember things that didn't even happen"".' The paramedic said that he noticed an IV . stand with an IV bag hanging on it, but that Murray did not answer when . asked if Jackson had an underlying condition. He had to ask Murray three times about what condition Jackson had before the doctor answered. 'He said, ""Nothing. He has nothing"",' Mr Senneff said. 'Simply, that did not add up to me.' Murray eventually told medics that he was treating the singer for exhaustion and dehydration. When asked what medications he had . given Jackson, Mr Senneff said Murray told him that he had only given . Jackson the sedative lorazepam. The doctor did not mention that he . had been giving Jackson the surgical anesthetic propofol to help the . singer sleep. The veteran paramedic said Jackson . was cool to the touch, his eyes were open and dry and had an IV in his . leg. He said that when they connected the singer to an EKG it showed a flatline. As paramedics were about to give up . they felt a pulse in Jackson's groin. They stopped CPR to check him . again on a monitor, but again it showed a flatline. Sugar levels in Jackson's blood also showed no change. After trying multiple heart-starting medications and other efforts, Jackson was still lifeless. In a call played to the court, emergency room personnel at a nearby . hospital advised Mr Senneff to declare Jackson dead in his bedroom. The court was shown a picture of the space next to Jackson's bed where Murray tried to revive the star . Jackson went into cardiac arrest at this rented house in LA . The court heard about the scenes in hospital after Michael Jackson was pronounced dead . Mr Senneff said Jackson was transported because Murray wanted the life-saving efforts to . continue. The paramedic added that after he . took Jackson down to the ambulance he returned to the bedroom to pick up . equipment, where he saw Murray picking up items from the floor. Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to . involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, Murray could face up to four . years in prison and lose his medical license. Prosecutors contend the Houston-based . cardiologist repeatedly lied to medics and emergency room doctors about . medications he had been giving Jackson in the singer's bedroom. Authorities contend Murray . administered a fatal dose of propofol and other sedatives. Murray's . attorneys claim Jackson gave himself the fatal dose after his doctor . left the room. Prosecutors are expected to call another paramedic who treated Jackson. Murray's trial is expected to last five weeks and is in its fourth day. The dispatcher calls time of death in . the phone call, but Mr Senneff tells him that Murray wants to continue . efforts to revive the singer. An executive for the maker of a medical device used by Michael Jackson's doctor to monitor the singer told jurors today that the equipment was not adequate for the continuous monitoring of patients. The $275 fingertip device that monitors the pulse and blood oxygen levels was recovered after Jackson's death and was being used by Dr Conrad Murray while he was giving the singer doses of the surgical anesthetic propofol. Prosecutors called Nonin Medical executive Bob Johnson to try to show that Murray lacked enough equipment to care for the singer during the treatments. Propofol is normally administered in hospital settings. Mr Johnson said the model that Murray used had no audible alarm and was not intended to be used for the continuous monitoring of patients. Robert Russell, a former patient of Conrad Murray, on the stand . Jurors also heard from a former . Murray patient who lauded the doctor's treatment of him, but said his . cardiologist became increasingly distant and hard to reach while working . with Jackson. 'I felt like I was getting the best . care in the world,' said Robert Russell of Las Vegas, before Murray . became the singer's personal physician. After Murray began treating Jackson, . Russell said he couldn't get answers about his own treatment. He called . Murray's office on June 25, 2009 - the day Jackson died - and demanded . to speak to the doctor. The doctor left him a voicemail at . 11:49am. Prosecutors are using records to show that Murray was on the . phone in the moments before he realised Jackson was unconscious. Russell told jurors Murray's message . seemed odd because the doctor said he was going on sabbatical, despite . telling the salesman and his wife months earlier that he was going to . work for Jackson.

Top scientists are designing a self-controlled navigation system that will pilot the next Mars Rover - an artificially intelligent 'sat nav' that will drive the hi-tech vehicle. Except, of course, on Mars, there are no GPS satellites to guide it - so it will be smart enough to do the whole thing itself. It should speed up the vehicle immensely - sending a radio signal to Mars to control a vehicle takes more than half an hour. Independent: The new navigation system will allow a Mars Rover to find its way around the Red Planet all by itself . Since the 'Seeker' navigation system will save so much time, it will allow a rover to find its way around the Red Planet - covering at least one kilometre a day. The system will perform a range of key actions completely unaided by Mission Control or GPS-type technology including: working out the precise location of the rover on Mars, identifying particular sites to visit on the planet and detecting and avoiding hazards. It will also be able to navigate its way back to previously visited sites. It will take the team of experts from Britain, France, and Canada seven months to complete the project, which is part of  the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) StarTiger initiative, which tackles space-related challenges. Early developments of the system were unveiled by the team based at the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in Swindon at STFC's 7th Appleton Space conference today. The event organised by RAL Space sees . leading experts from across the globe sharing the very latest . developments in current and future space . exploration. Self-controlled: The system will be able to identify specific sites to visit and detect hazards . Project director, Kim Ward of RAL Space said: 'The keys to Seeker’s success will be imagination, application and team work. 'With radio signals to conventional rovers taking at least 30 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars, Seeker’s ability to work autonomously in hostile terrain will be crucial to extending our understanding of our planetary neighbour.' David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science, said: 'Space captures the imagination of so many people, and it’s excellent to see UK experts playing such a significant role in the groundbreaking StarTiger initiative. 'The Seeker project has the potential to transform our exploration of Mars and make an important contribution to the international body of knowledge on the universe around us.' The Seeker team includes experts from STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space, IT developer SciSys, global defence and security company BAe Systems, and electronics engineering company Roke Manor Research - all in Britain.

As the debt ceiling deadline draws . dangerously close, Barack Obama was spotted heading to church with his . family in Washington this morning. Perhaps . he was praying for a solution - or better a resolution - to the small . task of securing a multi-trillion-dollar deal that House Democrats and . Republicans can agree on before the Government defaults on August 2. If the President was feeling the strain of last week's gruelling debt meetings, he didn't show it. Looking resplendent in their Sunday Best the Obamas laughed and joked with each other as they made their way back to the White House after the service at St John's Church. Mr Obama also told reporters he would 'absolutely' be watching the women's soccer world cup final between USA and Japan today. While the First family gathered around the television White House and congressional aides were continuing discussions to find a solution for increasing the nation's borrowing authority while reducing long-term deficits, behind the scenes. This . comes after the failure to get a deal after five straight days of . meetings last week between Mr Obama and congressional leaders at the . White House. But there was hope today that congressional leaders still had time 'to get something big done' with Mr Obama. 'I . think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in Congress seem to . have all agreed that we can't push to a default,' White House budget . director Jack Lew said. Sunday best: The Obamas head home after attending a service at St John's Church in Washington, while Congress leaders worked behind the scenes to try and seal a debt deal . 'So I think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that doesn't happen.' The . government will exceed the current $14.3trillion debt ceiling in 16 . days, after which it will be in default of its obligations. The . consequences could be far-reaching, with potentially higher interest . rates on mortgages and car loans, a halt in Social Security checks and . unsettled world financial markets. Talks have continued over the weekend and White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer . said on Twitter that Mr Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other White . House officials were discussing 'various options' with lawmakers . throughout the day yesterday. Meanwhile Republican House Speaker John Boehner is 'keeping the lines of . communication open,' his spokesman, Mike Steel told Bloomberg. 'Meetings have been . occurring.' Republicans have rejected any plan that contains tax increases. Lew said on NBC's Meet The Press that the president 'made clear he wants the largest deal possible.'

Not much to smile about: Mr Obama shares a joke with his wife who looks less than impressed, as the family walk out of the church gates . Stroll: Mrs Obama is seen with daughter Malia, left, while the President walks with the couple's other daughter Sasha after the service . 'He wants to do the most we can to . reduce the deficit,' Lew said. 'But he also said that if we can't get . the most done, then in addition to extending the debt we should do as . much as we can.' House Republicans are preparing to . vote this week on allowing an increase in the government's borrowing . limit through 2012 as long as Congress approves a balanced-budget . constitutional amendment. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called that . proof Republicans are willing to compromise and 'hardly a radical idea' but the Senate's No 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that bill . doesn't have the needed support in the Senate. 'This notion that we have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong,' Durbin said. Lew also did not like the idea. In the background: The Obamas head back to the White House where talks between congressional leaders were thought to be ongoing throughout the weekend . 'What these ideas do is say let's . kick the can down the road so that others will deal with it,' he said. 'The challenge is for Washington now to do the job the American people . sent us here to do.' DeMint said the U.S. is on course for . a financial disaster and that lawmakers have 'to draw a line in the . sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come.' 'And the longer we put it off the bigger the problems are going to be for our country,' DeMint said. Holding the fort: Meanwhile White House Budget Director Jack Lew revealed there were 'many conversations' going on as the battle to secure a deal before August 2 carried on . However, if it comes down to it, . White House officials who say Congress won't let the U.S. default are . 'probably right on that,' DeMint said. Senators are working on a bipartisan . plan that would allow Mr Obama to raise the debt limit without a prior . vote by lawmakers. The talks focused on how to address long-term deficit . reduction in the proposal in hopes of satisfying House Republicans. 'Lines of communication remain open with all parties,' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. Mr Obama admitted that . compromise was needed in talks with Republicans to solve the . crisis, during his weekly radio and internet address yesterday. He said it would take 'shared sacrifice' for . Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement. 'Let's be honest. Neither party in this town is blameless,' he said in . his broadcast to the nation. 'Both have talked this problem to death without . doing enough about it. That's what drives people nuts about Washington.' He attempted to reach out to the middle class in the address, repeating his . call for higher taxes on the wealthy and reforms to politically popular . entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 'We are all . part of the same country. We are all in this together,' he said. But Republicans renewed their call for an amendment to require a balanced budget. 'The only reason this administration doesn't want a constitutional . amendment is because they want to keep spending the American people's . money,' Senator Orrin Hatch said in the Republican response. 'And the only . reason congressional Democrats would refuse to pass it, is because they . know the people of this country would rise up and quickly ratify it.' In his weekly broadcast Mr Obama continued to insist that it was necessary to remove some tax breaks. 'Simply . put, it will take a balanced approach, shared sacrifice, and a . willingness to make unpopular choices on all our parts,' he said. 'That . means spending less on domestic programmes,' the President said. 'It . means spending less on defence programmes. ... And it means taking on . the tax code, and cutting out certain tax breaks and deductions for the . wealthiest Americans.' 'The truth is, you can't solve our deficit without cutting spending,' Mr Obama said. 'But . you also can't solve it without asking the wealthiest Americans to pay . their fair share - or without taking on loopholes that give special . interests and big corporations tax breaks that middle-class Americans . don't get.'","White House and congressional aides were continuing discussions over the weekend .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 11:21 AM on 12th December 2011 . Several al-Qaeda militants are on the loose today after tunneling their way out of a Yemeni prison in the second spectacular jailbreak this year. Up to 15 convicts in the jail in Aden, southern Yemen, escaped early on Monday, according to a prison officer. A security official said 15 militants fled in the prison break, including 12 convicted for the killing of security officials and a bank heist. Jailbreak: The latest reports of prisoners escaping jail in Aden, Yemen is the fourth reported jailbreak in the country in the past eight years, and the second in six months. The discrepancy in the number of escaped prisoners could not be immediately reconciled. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation, has been wrecked by months of political turmoil and unrest. A popular uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule - inspired by other Arab Spring revolts that toppled autocratic rulers in Egypt and Tunisia - has been met by a fierce government crackdown. The crackdown triggered widespread defections earlier this year by soldiers and officers who joined the protest movement. Powerful tribes and their armed fighters also turned against Saleh and waged battles against his forces. Nearly a year of protests demanding the ousting of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, punctuated by bouts of fighting between his forces and tribesmen and military units who oppose him, have seen Islamists gain power in the south. Deteriorating security in the area, where parts of the Abyan province are under control of Islamist fighters, have fanned fears in Saudi Arabia and Washington - which long backed Saleh in its campaign against al Qaeda - that the Yemeni branch of the group may gain a foothold near key oil shipping routes. Gearing up to sign the deal: Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh (right) in a meeting in his Presidency Office in Yemen last month as he agreed to step downAl Qaeda members, including one convicted in a 2002 attack on the French-flagged oil tanker Limburg off Yemen, escaped from a jail in the capital Sanaa in 2006, helping to revive the group after Saudi security forces weakened it in that country. Saleh's foes have accused him of deliberately letting Islamists in the south grow stronger to reinforce his argument that his rule alone can prevent the country sliding into chaos that would empower al Qaeda, whose Yemeni wing has planned abortive attacks on U.S. and other targets. Yemen is also home to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which the U.S. considers the terrorist network's most active and dangerous offshoot. Islamic militants with links to the group have taken advantage of the country's turmoil to seize control of several towns in southern Yemen. Yemen has seen spectacular jailbreaks before. In 2003, 11 al-Qaeda militants convicted for the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 others, escaped from the Aden prison. In 2006, 23 al-Qaeda militants broke out of a detention facility in Sanaa, including Nasser al-Wahishi, who went on to become the leader of al-Qaeda's Yemeni offshoot. And in June, nearly 60 suspected al-Qaeda militants tunneled their way out of a prison in the southern Mukalla city. Investigations into these breakouts and subsequent trials showed that some prison security officers were involved in helping the convicts flee and several officers have been jailed.","Second Yemen prison break in six months .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:25 AM on 10th December 2011 . Tribute: The family of Elijah Bond have praised the 'amazing' Sapper after he died following an IED attack . The family of a British soldier who died following an explosion in Afghanistan today paid tribute to his ability to 'light up a room as much as he lit up our lives'. Sapper Elijah Bond, 24, from 35 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, died in Queen Elizabeth NHS Hospital in Birmingham on Thursday. He was brought back to the UK following the blast from an improvised explosive device in the Nahr-e Saraj District of Helmand Province on Tuesday. Spr Bond, from St Austell, Cornwall, was a member of a team that was conducting an engineer reconnaissance task. His colleagues provided immediate first aid following the explosion, before he was evacuated by helicopter to the military hospital in Camp Bastion where he received further treatment. He was then flown to the hospital in Birmingham, where he died of his wounds. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said Spr Bond had a vibrant personality, but in quieter moments proved to be an excellent chess player. He leaves behind his mother Lizz, father Mark, brother Isaac, and sisters Kimberley, Jose and Bethany. His family said in a statement: 'Elijah Cooper Bond left the world in the way he chose to live his life. 'He was a beautiful son, amazing brother, a proud uncle and our best friend. 'From a wicked grin to a righteous smile he could light up a room as much as he lit up our lives, so mischievous and fun yet grounded and down to earth. 'He will forever be a piece of us and remain in our hearts. 'We are thankful for the memories we have been given and the precious time we spent with him. We have faith in the sure and certain knowledge that we will be reunited together again.' A total of 391 British troops have died since the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001. Mission: Spr Bond's death came in the province of Helmand (file picture) Spr Bond joined the Corps of Royal Engineers in August 2008. After two years of training he joined 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron, a part of 35 Engineer Regiment based in Paderborn, Germany, and was launched straight into pre-deployment training for Afghanistan. He volunteered and excelled at the general purpose machine gunners' course, and completed the Pashtu language course. Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Copsey, Commanding Officer, 35 Engineer Regiment, said: 'Spr Elijah Bond will be sadly missed by his close-knit troop and squadron. His lively and outgoing nature was founded on an inner confidence that saw him excel during his time in the Royal Engineers. 'He was a rising star within his squadron and he had a bright future ahead of him.' Lt Col Copsey said he was 'a first rate soldier' and noted his 'complete reliability, enthusiasm and commitment'.

Vladimir Putin is to be challenged by one of Russia's richest tycoons in the Kremlin presidential election scheduled for March. Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov - his country's most eligible bachelor - could present a real threat to the strongman premier if he can enlist the support of voters furious over ballot rigging claims in last week's parliamentary elections. This came yesterday as the Kremlin's pollster abruptly stopped issuing figures for politicians' ratings, amid suspicions that Putin's showing has suddenly slumped. Bid for presidency: Mikhail Prokhorov (pictured) has declared he will run against Putin in the election . 'Society is waking up,' said the 6ft 8 inch businessman worth £11.5 billion of dramatic people power protests led by the disillusioned middle classes. 'I have made the most serious decision in my life. I am running for president.' Fraud allegations: Russian PM Vladimir Putin's authority has been dented . The one-time street jeans-seller backed many of the anti-Putin slogans voiced at the demonstrations, he said. Prokhorov, the 46 year old owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, declared he would run as Putin slapped down a fresh parliamentary poll, the key demand of tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets across Russia at the weekend. Often seen with attractive women, Prokhorov was arrested at a French ski resort in 2007 on suspicion of making prostitutes available to guests. He spent several days in jail but was later cleared of all charges. His big cash windfall came in selling the world's largest nickel mine in Norilsk. Putin aide Dmitry Peskov claimed that the fraud allegations touch less than one per cent of the vote so "" it will in no way affect the legitimacy of the election"". But the strongman faced more problems yesterday as his former trusted finance minister Alexei Kudrin threatened to set up a new right-of-centre political party - and to campaign against Putin. In another blow, at least one regional governor quit in protest over the handling of the elections. And the Public Opinion Foundation - one of Russia's main pollsters - abruptly stopped issuing ratings for politicians.

Prokhorov - like most business figures - used to be reluctant to cross Putin. But he is furious after his bid to set up a political party Right Cause several months ago ended in failure after it was blocked by Putin crony Vladislav Surkov.

Anger: Trevor Phillips said the human rights laws had 'fallen into disrepute' and were seen as protecting criminals, terror suspects and illegal immigrants at the expense of everyone else . Human rights laws are being interpreted in a way that is ‘thoroughly bonkers’ – according to Britain’s own human rights chief. Trevor Phillips, head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said the laws had ‘fallen into disrepute’ and were seen as protecting criminals, terror suspects and illegal  immigrants at the expense of everyone else. These rights should not be ‘the exclusive property of minorities’. Mr Phillips said: ‘Almost every morning I am confronted with examples of how the Human Rights Act is being used which any reasonable person would describe as thoroughly bonkers. ‘Prison service vans that travel 90 miles to take a prisoner 90 yards; paedophiles freed to leer at children in the very parks where they have committed horrific crimes.’ Mr Phillips also attacked plans by secularists to use the Human Rights Act to stop Christian prayers being said before council meetings. Mr Phillips said he ‘dropped his coffee’ when he heard Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, saying on the radio that he wanted to use the act to prosecute councillors in Devon. He said the move was ‘nonsense on stilts’. Embarrassed: Clive Bone said Christian prayers at Bideford council breached his human right to freedom of belief. He has taken the case to court . The NSS has launched legal action against Bideford Council, claiming council meetings should be ‘equally welcoming to everyone living in the local community’  and should therefore be ‘religiously-neutral and secular’. It had supported former Bideford councillor Clive Bone, who insisted the tradition breached his human right to freedom of belief. Mr Bone said he was ‘disadvantaged and embarrassed’ when Christian prayers were said in the council chamber. His case is being considered by the High Court. The NSS has based its legal challenge on the claim that Mr Bone, as an atheist, should not be subjected to religious ritual, and that to do so broke his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. However it has emerged Mr Bone stopped being a councillor in May. Mr Phillips said human rights laws should not be ‘used or twisted to prevent public servants doing things which protect and serve the public’. Marking Human Rights Day on Saturday, he said such laws were the ‘last line of defence’ for elderly, disabled or vulnerable Britons who are mistreated or neglected. He added: ‘Human rights should help us better protect vulnerable people who are targeted with violence because of who they are, or who suffer because our police, local councils and courts don’t take their calls seriously or provide enough support to get them justice. ‘But while we must defend human rights tenaciously, it is also essential that supporters of human rights recognise and address the reasons why these great principles have fallen into disrepute. ‘For too many people nowadays human rights have come to mean the defence of the rights of unpopular minorities – of criminals, terror suspects and illegal immigrants – at the expense of everybody else.’ His comments came as Europe’s human rights chief prepared to launch a fresh attack on Britain for denying prisoners the right to vote. Thomas Hammarberg, the European commissioner for human rights, also attacked Tory plans for a British Bill of Rights. Mr Hammarberg will say in a speech tomorrow that any ‘weakening’ the Human Rights Act would encourage autocratic governments in other countries to ignore human rights laws. And he will attack British politicians for criticising the European Court of Human Rights, saying such comments are ‘ill-informed, populist and xenophobic’.","Trevor Phillips says human rights should not be 'exclusive property of minorities'

Italian financial market jitters worsened today as workers angry about austerity reforms went on strike and staged nationwide rallies. Fiat's car plants stood idle and a performance at La Scala opera house in Milan was cancelled as unions kicked off the first in days of walkouts and demonstrations against spending cuts and tax increases. Confidence dipped, with Milan's stock index down two per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond yield rising 0.52 of a percentage point to 6.76 per cent. Backlash: Members of the Unione Sindicale di Base occupy the Porta Nuova train station in Torino in protest at austerity measures . Industrial action: Metalworkers march through downtown Torino, Italy, after Mario Monti's government passed the measures . It comes after Greek government figures warned talks with international debt inspectors on a second bailout package were 'difficult and critical'. Italy managed to raise €7billion in a bond auction, though the relatively strong demand was boosted by a bank association waiving fees to buy them. Investors remain worried about the future of both Italy and the wider 17-nation eurozone, despite an EU deal last week to tighten controls on spending. Guard: Carabinieri watch a monitor showing the stock exchange index in Milan, which slumped two per cent today . Worries: Critics have said the reforms hit pensioners and workers too hard . Crisis: A man wraps himself in a Cgil labour union flag in Milan, Italy. Union leaders have warned of further strike action next week . While that deal will boost longer-term budget discipline, it does little to lower the current debt. The . Italian government's efforts to stabilise its finances, boost growth . and lower debt - which stands at 120 per cent of GDP - have come under . fire from unions. Workers joined rallies in several labour sectors to protest about pension reforms earlier today. It was the first in a series of . walkouts called over the emergency austerity measures which Prime . Minister Mario Monti insists are vital to avert financial disaster. Metalworkers, . including on assembly lines at Fiat's car factories, were staging an . eight-hour strike, while others planned to walk off the job hours before . the end of their shift. Resentment: A woman wears a sign around her neck reading 'make those pay who never pay', a reference to the belief the austerity measures are not affecting the rich as badly . Clash: Metalworkers in Torino participate in a demonstration after Fiat imposed new working conditions in its factories. Public transport is expected to grind to a halt on Thursday . The first draft of a new fiscal treaty for the eurozone and nine other EU countries will be ready by next week. The head of legal services for the European Council briefed EU ambassadors at a meeting earlier today, an EU diplomat has revealed. '(He) told the 27 ambassadors this morning that a first draft will be ready by the end of the week, at the latest early next week,' he said. Twenty-six EU member states - apart from Britain - agreed on Friday that would pursue deeper fiscal integration as part of efforts to overcome the debt crisis. Several non-euro countries, including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, still need parliamentary approval before they can give their full backing. The aim is to have the intergovernmental treaty signed by March next year, and have it ratified by all countries, apart from Britain, by June. The European Central Bank cut back its purchase of government bonds to €635million last week - underlining its determination to limit support for indebted governments. That compares to €3.66billion last week, and €8.58billion the week before that. The purchases are a key tool in fighting Europe's debt crisis, because they tend to lower the borrowing costs faced by indebted governments such as Italy, the recent focus of the continent's debt crisis. But the ECB, the chief monetary authority for the 17 countries that use the euro, has kept the purchases limited despite calls from many economists to buy more. The bank says countries should take the politically difficult steps to get their finances under control themselves - such as cutting spending and raising taxes - and not wait for support from the central bank. Public transport unions have called strikes for Thursday and Friday, with yet more action likely to take place next week. Mr Monti's government, which took . office last month, is urging Parliament to swiftly pass his rescue plan, . which includes investing €10billion in austerity savings in . infrastructure to boost growth. Labor . Minister Elsa Fornero has said some pension reforms might be softened, . but that overall spending cuts must remain for the country to regain . credibility on financial markets. Italy . is under pressure to cut its €1.9 trillion public debt amid worries . that persistently high borrowing costs will make it unable to turn over . the debt with new bonds. Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos met representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, this morning. He said: 'The discussions are difficult and critical. The country must take very important decisions. There is no room for any evasion.' Greece was granted a first bailout in 2010 after years of government overspending. But it soon became clear that a second deal was needed, although the details remain to be fully worked out. Greece is heading for a fourth year of recession, amid high taxation and growing unemployment. Mr Venizelos added: 'The recession is worse than any prediction. We are in our third successive year of recession and heading to a fourth. 'For this to end the atmosphere must change: banks must feel secure, and we must fully fulfill the decisions of October 26.' He has insisted no new austerity measures would have to be taken next year, provided the country fully implements those it has already committed to.","Metalworkers, typographers and staff at La Scala opera among those taking part in rallies against reforms .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 5:01 PM on 12th December 2011 . A mother and daughter offered former News of the World investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood children as young as 13 for sex in return for £18,000, a court heard today. Angela Martin, 46, told the undercover journalist she could provide 'anything you want' for cash during a series of secretly taped meetings. During a series of meetings girls as young as 13 were paraded in front of Mahmood - famously dubbed the 'Fake Sheikh' - and made to hand over their discount travel cards as proof of their age. He struck a deal with Martin and her . daughter Natasha Martin, 24, to provide four teenagers for sex at a . party at the luxury Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane, central London. Angela Martin (left) and her daughter Natasha (right), pictured today arriving at Southwark Crown Court, offered to sell an undercover reporter children for sex . The women demanded he pay £6,000 for a 13-year-old Polish girl and £4,000 each for three other girls aged 14 and 15-years-old, a court was told. At one point Angela was heard to say: 'I can get you anything you want, black, white, Indian, anything.' But the women claim they lied about being able to provide the girls and said it was a ruse to get their hands on the reporter's money. Both women are to be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to steal. Prosecutor Emma Deacon told the court: 'In summary, it is a conspiracy to steal where the defendants intended to steal money from a man who they believed at the time to be a fixer for what were described as ""wealthy Arab men"". 'The defendants were going to pretend in return for substantial payment they had available, and would supply, underage girls prepared to engage in sexual activities with the men at the Dorchester Hotel.' The court heard the two women met with Mahmood three times at the Premier Inn, in Barking, Essex. A deal was struck for Angela Martin to provide teenage girls for sex at a party at the Dorchester Hotel . Ms Deacon said Angela 'took the lead' in financial negotiations while Natasha Martin presented herself as 'being in charge of the girls' and had 'provided details of the sexual activities she could get the girls to engage in'. The prosecutor said: 'At two of the meetings the defendants actually took girls along with them. 'At the final meeting the defendants turned up with four underage girls with a view to them being taken to the Dorchester with the idea being that they were to provide sexual services. 'The defendants intended to secure for these four girls £18,000 as that was what they had agreed with Mahmood. 'It's clear from the recordings that the defendants' motivation was their own dishonesty and greed. 'It is an aggravating feature that the defendants were prepared to use underage girls in this way for their own means.' Ms Deacon said the first meeting took place on March 17, 2011, after Mahmood contacted the women in connection with a separate matter. He had been told by a fellow reporter that Angela Martin could provide drugs couriers and women for arranged marriages, she said. After that meeting he asked the other reporter to approach Angela Martin about underage prostitution and a second meeting was arranged for the following night. Ms Deacon said: 'On March 18, they took with them two girls, a 15-year-old and a 14-year-old. 'They took them along to show to Mahmood on the basis that these were two of the girls willing to have sexual intercourse with men at the party.' The court was shown video footage of the meeting taken by Mahmood in which Angela Martin is seen alone with the reporter discussing the girls. She said: 'I can get you anything you want, black, white, Indian, anything.'Slim, chubby, pretty, ugly, whatever they want. [My daughter] is in control of all the girls.' Natasha Martin is then brought into the room and Mahmood asks 'Will they s**g?', to which Angela replies: 'Yes they do.' Ms Deacon said: 'Natasha Martin then goes on to give detail of what services the girls could provide, saying that they're ""nasty little girls"" and she has got girls who can do ""dirty stuff"". 'She says she can get a girl who is 13-years-old, a Polish girl.' At another meeting six days later four girls are brought into the room and Angela Martin is heard talking to them about what they are going to do. She says: 'We're going to the Dorchester and we're going to have fun. Does that sound good?' When Mahmood asks them what fun means one of the girls replies 'sex'. The pair admitted conspiracy to steal on the grounds they intended to take the reporter's money and run and did not intend for the young girls to engage in sexual activities with customers in September. A charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the prostitution of children was ordered to lie on file after the prosecution accepted their guilty plea. Angela Martin, of, Leytonstone, and Natasha Martin, Walthamstow, both east London, have both admitted to one charge of conspiracy to steal between March 16 and March 26, 2011. The hearing continues.","Angela and Natasha Martin uncovered by News of the World's 'Fake Sheikh' reporter .

"By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 12:04 AM on 8th December 2011 . Protection: Taking the contraceptive pill could reduce the risk of childless nuns developing cancer . Nuns should go on the Pill because it would protect them from cancer, according to researchers. Like any other women who don’t have children, nuns are at an increased risk of dying from certain forms of the disease. But the contraceptive Pill can cut the likelihood of developing breast, ovarian and womb cancer. For this reason – regardless of their vows of celibacy – researchers in Australia say nuns should take the Pill. Studies show overall death rates are 12 per cent lower in women who have used or are using the Pill, compared with those who never took it. The risk of developing ovarian and womb cancers falls by 50 to 60 per cent in users, with the benefits lasting more than 20 years – and long after women stop taking it. The Pill is believed to offer protection because women taking it are not producing eggs. The process of egg release triggers cell damage and repair that raises the risk of tumour development. Permissible: Researchers claim the Roman Catholic Church does not prevent the Pill being used for health reasons . Similarly, women who have children cease to produce eggs during pregnancy and often during breastfeeding. Dr . Kara Britt of Monash University, Melbourne, and Professor Roger Short . of Melbourne University, argue that nuns are at increased risk of cancer . through their celibate lifestyle, and deserve protection. They claim the Roman Catholic Church’s own teaching does not prevent the Pill being used for health reasons. They conclude: ‘The Catholic Church condemns all forms of contraception, as outlined by Pope Paul VI in Humanae Vitae in 1968. Although Humanae Vitae never mentions nuns, they should be free to use the contraceptive Pill to protect against the hazards of nulliparity (not having children) since the document states that 'the Church in no way regards as unlawful therapeutic means considered necessary to cure organic diseases, even though they also have a contraceptive effect'. 'If the Catholic Church could make . the Pill freely available to all its nuns, it would reduce the risk of . those accursed pests, cancer of the ovary and uterus, and give nuns’ plight the recognition it deserves.’ Research has shown that women using the Pill are at lower risk of getting any kind of cancer. 'They gain most protection at a time . in life when they are at greatest risk – their 50s and 60s – because of . the long-term preventive effect of oral contraception. A . study of the records of 46,000 women held by the Royal College of . General Practitioners since 1968 found a 12 per cent lower risk of . cancer among women who had used the Pill at some time during their . lives. It appears to cause a . short-term increase in breast and cervical cancer, but the risk reverts . within ten years of ceasing to use it to the same as a woman who has . never taken it. Mothers-to-be . who are highly stressed in the later stages of pregnancy are more at . risk of giving birth pre-term and miscarrying boys, say researchers. A team investigated the effect of the stress caused by the 2005 Tarapaca earthquake in Chile on pregnant women. Professors . Florencia Torche and Karine Kleinhaus, of New York University, analysed . the birth certificates of all babies born in the country from 2004 to . 2006. Their . research – published online today in the leading reproductive medicine . journal Human Reproduction – found that women who lived closest to the . magnitude-7.9 earthquake and were in their second and third trimesters . of pregnancy when it hit were at higher risk of delivering pre-term, . before 37 weeks gestation. Normally, . about six in 100 women had a pre-term birth, but among those exposed to . the earthquake in the final third of their pregnancy, this rose to more . than nine in 100. Usually, . the ratio of male to female births is around 51:49. But the researchers . found a 5.8 per cent decline in the ratio among mothers exposed in the . final three months, meaning fewer boys than girls survived to delivery.

A fancy-dress reveller was killed in a hit-and-run accident when the driver failed to see him in his 'Rambo' camouflage costume. Ian Hamilton, 27, had camouflage paint on his face and arms and was wearing combat trousers, a black T-shirt and black boots when he was knocked down by a car going at twice the speed limit. Driver Jamie Gray, 23, who has been jailed for four years and eight months, claimed he didn’t spot Mr Hamilton in the road in the village of Pontllanfraith, near Caerphilly, South Wales, at 3am as he drove a borrowed BMW. A court heard that Mr Hamilton, who was a fan of Sylvester Stallone's action hero Rambo, always wore his jungle camouflage kit to fancy-dress events. Ian Hamilton (left) was knocked down and killed by Jamie Gray (right) while wearing a camouflage outfit. Gray was going twice the speed limit . He had just left a family birthday party and was walking along a road when he was hit. And instead of getting medical help Gray drove off leaving his Rambo-costumed victim for dead in the road. The court heard Gray, who was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, was doing an estimated 67mph in a 30mph zone. Mr Hamilton was found dead by a passing motorist and a search was launched for the driver. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said: 'Mr Hamilton went to a family party dressed as Rambo which was what he would always wear at fancy-dress events. 'He was dressed in camouflage trousers, black vest and boots with camouflage paint on his face and arms. 'In the early hours of the morning he was seen stumbling along a road smiling to himself in his Rambo outfit.' Ian Hamilton was a huge fan of Rambo and would always go to fancy dress parties as the Sylvester Stallone character . A passer-by heard the car hit Mr Hamilton and drive away at speed, but didn’t realise it was a fatal crash until reading police appeals the next day. Police launched a major hunt for the hit-and-run driver after the tragedy. Gray was caught after police found a tiny piece of black plastic from the silver BMW 3-series on the road and traced all 150 similar models in South Wales. They visited 50 owners before they found the car which killed Mr Hamilton, of Bristol. Cardiff Crown Court heard Gray was driving at 'terrifying' speeds of up to 67mph in a 30mph residential area when he hit the camouflaged pedestrian. John Ryan, defending, said: 'This was not a standard pedestrian who was easily visible. 'Mr Gray panicked and fled - he is deeply sorry for his actions and has been left mentally scarred.' Gray, of Cross Keys, near Newport, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance, driving without a licence, failing to stop after an accident and failing to report an accident. The court heard his licence had been revoked after convictions for speeding and other motoring offences. He was jailed after the court heard he was on bail for alleged drink-driving at the time of the collision in July this year. Recorder of Cardiff Judge Nicholas Cooke told him: 'You struck the head of another human being while driving very fast - you failed to stop and effectively left him for dead. 'What was more important for you was the chance of evading detection. That is shameful.' Gray will be banned from driving for four years when he is released from prison. After the case, Mr Hamilton’s family paid tribute to a much-loved young man who dreamed of joining the army. His brother Clyne said: 'He was kind, caring, thoughtful, cheeky and charming. 'He was a person with a bright future in front of him with his own family and that chance was taken away from him. 'If Jamie Gray had not been doing such a reckless speed we would not be here - that is why we could never forgive him.'",Ian Hamilton was knocked down by car going more than twice the speed limit .
"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 3:33 PM on 10th December 2011 . Huge: This serrated Tyrannosaurus tooth was found with other Alamosaurus bones by the researchers . The enormous bones of what is believed to be the biggest dinosaur in the U.S. have been unveiled by university researchers. A research paper produced jointly by the Museum of Rockies in Montana State and the State Museum of Pennsylvania describes two gigantic vertebrae and a femur that the team collected in New Mexico from 2003 to 2006. The bones belong to the sauropod dinosaur Alamosaurus sanjuanensis: a long-necked plant eater related to Diplodocus. The Alamosaurus roamed what is now the southwestern region of the U. S and Mexico about 69 million years ago. In the paper, Montana State University researcher, Denver W. Fowler and Robert M. Sullivan from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania write how carrying the the vertebrae alone was a 'killer' task taking up an entire day because the paleontologists carried them 1.2 miles through 100-degree heat. Life-size: Nate Carroll, left, and Liz Freedman, right pose with a complete reconstruction of the neck vertebra of an Alamosaurus at Montana State University . Dr Fowler said: 'Alamosaurus has been known for some time, its remains were first described in 1922 from the Naashoibito beds of New Mexico. 'Since then, more bones have been discovered in New Mexico, Utah, some really nice material from Texas, and Mexico, including a few partial skeletons.' He said the sheer size of the new bones had caught the researchers by surprise. He said researchers had believed that a fully grown Alamosaurus measured around 60 feet long and weighed about 30 tons. But a 2009 study by another MSU researcher, Dr. Holly Woodward, led to discovery of a femur thought to belong to an adult that was still growing. Dr Fowler said. 'This told us that Alamosaurus got even bigger, but we didn't imagine that it could get quite this big.' The enormity of the new bones puts . Alamosaurus in the same size league as other giant sauropods from South . America, including Argentinosaurus which weighed about 70 tons, and is . widely considered to be the biggest dinosaur of all. Dr . Fowler added: 'Over the past 20 years, Argentinean and Brazilian . paleontologists have been unearthing bigger and bigger dinosaurs, . putting the rest of the world in the shade. Comparison: It is difficult for researchers to estimate body size from only fragmentary remains, but overlapping skeletal material gives an indication of maximum sizes for the biggest dinosaurs . 'However, our new finds not only show that Alamosaurus is newly recognized as the biggest dinosaur from North America, but also that it was right up there with the biggest South American species: the US is back in the fight for the No.1 spot.' Although comparison of the new Alamosaurus bones with the South American species gave the researchers an idea of size, giant specimens of sauropods like Alamosaurus and Argentinosaurus are only known from very fragmentary remains. This means they only offer a glimpse of what a complete Alamosaurus might look like. 'We'd love to find more complete material', said Dr Fowler. 'Fortunately, Alamosaurus bones are quite common in the Naashoibito of New Mexico, so we have a good chance . of going back and finding more, but in order to dig up one of the . world's biggest dinosaurs you need one of the world's biggest dinosaur . digging teams and large digging equipment.' The Pennsylvania State Museum field . crew is made up of just two to three people, so there are limits on how . many bones can be collected in one season. Vast: Paleontologists Robert Sullivan, left, and Denver Fowler work in badland exposures of the Naashoibito beds at Alamo Wash in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico . Even . so, many new and important specimens have been recovered over the past . 10 to 15 years, including new species, and other members of the fauna . including the iconic carnivore Tyrannosaurus. 'We found a shed Tyrannosaurus tooth with another Alamosaurus neck bone that we were excavating,' Dr Fowler said. 'The Tyrannosaurus may have lost its tooth while feeding on an Alamosaurus carcass.' He added that other recent discoveries by paleontologist Jack Horner's paleo lab at the Museum of the Rockies have emphasised the importance of understanding growth and ontogeny in interpreting dinosaur evolution. 'Increasingly, we're finding that very large or small individuals often look very different, and are often described as different species. 'Our findings show that Alamosaurus was originally described based on immature material, and this is a problem as characteristics that define a species are typically only fully gained at adult size. 'This means that we might be misinterpreting the relationships of Alamosaurus and possibly other sauropod dinosaurs too.'","Two gigantic vertebrae and a femur found in New Mexico .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 8:07 AM on 8th December 2011 . Benchmarks: Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, wants NHS doctors and hospitals to be graded . Andrew Lansley was yesterday accused of creating a ‘recipe for chaos’ after introducing more than 60 performance goals despite a previous promise to scrap targets. The Health Secretary unveiled a series of benchmarks - designed to save more than 10,000 lives, and that he claims will measure whether patient care is improving by covering a range of treatments across the NHS. When Mr Lansley took over as health secretary last year he promised to ‘free’ the NHS from unnecessary targets to enable doctors to concentrate more on patient care. He abolished a series of goals brought in by Labour, including the four-hour wait in A&E. And he has insisted that his new measures are different as they focus on patient results. In a speech at Guy’s hospital in Central London yesterday, Mr Lansley promised to ‘dispense with the jargon’, adding: ‘We make it clear that the NHS has one ambition and one ambition alone – improving results for patients.’ However Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘Doctors and nurses will roll their eyes in sheer disbelief at this news. This is inept and no way to run the NHS. It’s a recipe for complexity and chaos when the NHS needs to be allowed to get on with the job.’ Figures on hospital death rates, the . performances of GPs and surgeons and patients’ experiences will be . published as part of the NHS Outcomes Framework. The Government's reforms of the NHS ""continue to cause chaos"" on the ground, doctors leaders said today. The British Medical Association (BMA), which opposes the Health and . Social Care Bill in its entirety, said changes taking place now before . legislation has even been passed are ""chaotic and poorly co-ordinated"". Groups of GPs have been told they must form groups to determine how the . NHS budget is spent but, according to the BMA, they are being told they . are too small. Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA, said: 'There has been a growing . level of unease about how the reforms are panning out - we hear repeated . concerns from doctors about mounting chaos on the ground. 'For example, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), that had initially . been told they'd have freedom to form to suit their local communities, . are now being told they're too small and have to re-form. 'People are still unclear how primary care will be managed as we don't . yet know where staff currently working in primary care trust 'clusters' will eventually be based or if they'll have jobs at all. 'Even at this stage, there are still unanswered questions about what . statutory functions some bodies will have, making planning very . difficult. 'Guidance is being issued that is overly restrictive and more and more . bureaucracy is being created to try to deal with issues which should . have been dealt with at the beginning. 'A huge amount of time, energy, money and commitment has been wasted because of a lack of a clear plan from the outset.' The sixty indicators will replace . the former target-led system and will include a focus on improving . cancer survival and a zero-tolerance approach to hospital-acquired . infections such as MRSA. The plans are designed to ensure patients are treated with dignity by measuring the ‘responsiveness’ of staff to patient needs. They aim to improve women’s and . families’ experiences of maternity services, increase the number of . people who can access an NHS dentist and help older people recover . independence after illness. Under the plans, fewer people with . long-term conditions like asthma and diabetes will be treated in . hospitals, and patients undergoing hip and knee operations will receive . better care. An indicator on carers who look after sick and elderly relatives is also included. Mr Lansley said: ‘We have to clear the decks and be clear this is what we are focusing on. ‘People say in three and a half years’ time, in 2015, at the next election, how will we know whether you’ve . succeeded or not? The answer is, “Have the outcomes improved?” ‘It will be my failure if we haven’t . improved them and the NHS should feel that it has not succeeded, that is . what we are setting out to do.’ The Government will publish details of . the current performance for each of the sixty benchmarks next week. National targets from improvement will then be set out by the time of . the next election. Today, the Government will publish for . the first time data comparing patients' experiences at individual GPs' surgeries, including recovery times. It is hoped that revealing the . information will force up standards by allowing patients to choose to . avoid poorly performing doctors or institutions. Where performance falls below minimum . requirements the NHS Commissioning Board and Care Quality Commission . will intervene to drive up quality, although how this will work in . practice is unclear. The aim of the plan is also to move away from a focus on targets, such as those for waiting times introduced under Labour. However, patients will still have the . right to prompt treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their GP as set . out in the NHS Constitution. Held to account: Nurses and other NHS staff will be judged against nearly 60 tough new goals designed to save more than 20,000 lives a year . Mr Lansley hopes the framework will . also provide reassurance to parliamentarians about the accountability of . the Health Secretary for the NHS. There have been concerns that the . Health and Social Care Bill, currently going through the Lords, . dramatically weakens accountability of the secretary of state. Mr Lansley also hopes the plan will . provide a much greater level of NHS accountability by allowing better . comparison with other health systems around the world. The NHS has been criticised for lagging behind other countries in areas such as cancer survival. Ministers will be expected hold the . health service to account on delivering increasing improvements across . all areas in the new framework. Where performance falls below minimum . requirements they will intervene to drive up quality, although how this . will work in practice is as yet unclear. The framework will also draw on . existing information collected about the NHS to reduce the potential for . 'administrative burden'. PREMATURE DEATH . 1.

"By . James Tozer . Last updated at 12:58 AM on 13th December 2011 . It was a tale of our times played out on the pages of social  networking sites. Kelsey Shaw was 12 and Callum Willcocks 14 when they started going out together. Within two years they had a child and  their relationship was already scarred by drug abuse, binge drinking and allegations of infidelity. Teenage mother: Kelsey Marie Shaw, killed by boyfriend Callum Wilcocks, and her 3 year old baby Caitlin . And by the time Kelsey was 17 she was dead – strangled by Willcocks in an  alcohol-fuelled row over claims of  sleeping around. In the words of his barrister, ‘they . were much too young, both of them’. Stuart Driver QC added: ‘It was a . disastrous cocktail, because they had powerful adult feelings but the . immaturity of children.’ Yesterday at Chester Crown Court, Willcocks was jailed for a minimum of 16 years after being convicted of murder. The jury rejected his claim of . diminished responsibility as a result of borderline personality . disorder. Defence experts claimed this explained his disruptive . behaviour at the many schools he passed through and propensity for . starting fires and reckless driving. Wilcocks and Kelsey were described as having a volatile relationship . However a psychologist called by the . prosecution said his state of mind had more to do with his . self-confessed consumption of a bottle of spirits a day and £1,000 worth . of cocaine every weekend. Willcocks met Kelsey in Speke, . Liverpool, only a year after she had started secondary school, and . within 12 months he had made her pregnant. He was already a heavy . drinker and had been thrown out of ten schools which could not cope with . his ‘extreme anger problems’. Their daughter Caitlin was born in 2008 when Kelsey was 14 and Willcocks 16. A few months later, Kelsey wrote on . MySpace how she could not wait to leave school and enjoyed ‘goin out . with tha girls drinkin n all tha’. Telling how she adored their . daughter, she added: ‘love my callum 2 bits as well there both amazin.’ By now, Willcocks had dropped out of . the education system and was using cocaine and high-strength cannabis, . paid for by car theft and burglary. In 2008 he was given three years’ detention for supplying crack cocaine and heroin, a separation which . fuelled what would be  persistent and overwhelming  suspicion that . Kelsey was unfaithful to him. Saying he could not face their child . being raised by another man, he wrote on MySpace that he hoped she would . have a nice Christmas ‘cus i no i wil of bin away n kiled meself by . then’. He attempted to take a drug overdose and later tried to hang himself with his bedsheets, but was rescued by prison staff. On his release in 2010, to the alarm . of Kelsey’s family, the relationship resumed and Willcocks got a job at a . skip hire firm. But far from bringing him stability, it helped him . afford a drug habit which had spiralled to spending £1,600 on cocaine . every weekend with friends. Not surprisingly, the relationship remained chaotic. ‘When it was good it was brilliant, . but when it was bad it was absolutely terrible,’ Willcocks told the . court, admitting he had slept with Kelsey’s cousin. Kelsey Shaw had told Callum Wilcocks their daughter wasn't his during a heated argument . ‘We often had fights, hitting each other. There have been times when we have both called the police on each other.’ Kelsey – who had gone on to college – . became pregnant by him again, but in the spring of this year she had an . abortion, saying she was seeing a man called Roy and wanted to break . up. Willcocks called her to say he was . about to hang himself by the River Mersey, but after she pleaded with . him he came home. On April 28, the eve of Prince William’s wedding to . Kate Middleton, they spent the evening at a friend’s flat in Widnes. Kelsey was drinking alcopops while Willcocks downed vodka on top of . around eight cans of Stella Artois lager he had drunk earlier in the . day. The following day, he told the court, she accused him of being an ‘alkie’ and he held her neck until she passed out. When she came round, he said she . taunted him, saying neither their daughter nor her aborted baby had been . his and telling him: ‘You are a s*** sh*g, Roy is ten times better’. ‘I was filling up with anger and I couldn’t hold it any more,’ he told the court. ‘I just exploded.’ He strangled her again, leaving her lying unconscious, and she died in hospital the following day. 'They had powerful adult feelings but had the immaturity of children' the court was told . He told police: ‘I wanted her to die. I felt she had to get out of my life. If I was sober it probably . wouldn’t have even entered my mind. But I was off my head big time.’ The . jury took just an hour to reject the 19-year-old’s plea of manslaughter . on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Kelsey’s mother Patricia, who is . looking after Caitlin, said she accepted the sentence, adding: ‘All I . know is he can never hurt my beautiful girl any more.’ She went on: ‘Kelsey’s death . devastated the whole family and has left a huge hole in our lives. To . have her taken away from us so suddenly is something we have all . struggled to deal with, but we have had to stay strong for her little . girl  who has been left without a mummy.’ On Facebook, a friend of Kelsey . wrote: ‘CALLUM WILCOX u sik evil twistd t***, how cud u murder the . mother of ur bby girl now she has to grow up noin her daddy killed her . mummy!! ‘RIP KELSEY shud be plannin ur 18th . not ur funreal! u wer so young an guwjus everyones thinkin of u my heart . gose out to ur family n babby girl RIP xxxx.’","Callum Wilcocks, 19, said 'he just exploded' after his girlfriend's repeated taunting .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 4:22 PM on 13th December 2011 . A homeless man drowned one of the contestants at a Saturday morning fishing match in a totally random attack, a court heard. Anthony Ogburn, who had been having a 'psychotic episode' at the time, claimed he was doing God’s will, Chester Crown Court was told. In the run-up to the killing he had been making bizarre allegations about his family and he had books about murder and the Lancashire Witches in his possession, prosecutor Andrew Thomas QC said. Ogburn, 41, left, drowned angler Harry Morris, . 57, right, a much-loved family man and father-of-six in the canal at Sankey . Valley Park, Warrington in June this year . Ogburn, 41, drowned angler Harry Morris, 57, a much-loved family man and father-of-six in the canal at Sankey Valley Park, Warrington in June this year. He denied murder but admitted . manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. His plea was accepted by the prosecution . and Judge Elgan Edwards, QC, the Recorder of Chester, ordered him to be . detained at Ashworth secure hospital. Mr Thomas said: 'When challenged by one of the others present during the attack he said: ''He has killed my dad and done my family''. Both claims were untrue. Mr Thomas added: 'He was a complete stranger to Mr Morris and it was a completely random attack'. Mr Morris was a father-of-six and drowned in the canal at Sankey Valley Park, Warrington, pictured, in June this year . In the weeks before the drowning Ogburn, originally of Widnes, who had no history of mental problems, had been making bizarre allegations which prompted his daughter to call the police, said Mr Thomas. He told the centre manager at Warrington YMCA, where he was living, that he was 'fleeing violence towards myself.' After he had made false complaints that his sister had been murdered, police searched his room and found books on murder and the Lancashire Witches. Ogburn told the YMCA manager (prior to the drowning) that he had been out fishing and some males had stolen his drink, kidnapped him and held him in a van. Police became concerned about his mental state and referred him to a local mental health crisis team. Assessments were done at two venues. It was established that Ogburn had a history of drug and alcohol addiction since the age of 16. Judge Elgan Edwards, QC, the Recorder of Chester, ordered Ogburn to be detained at Ashworth secure hospital in Merseyside . Mr Thomas said: 'The assessment at the time was that there was no obvious mental disturbance and his methadone dosage was reduced'. Ogburn had been receiving treatment for drug addiction since 1995. Since 2009 he has been clean of Class A drugs but he was still taking methadone, alcohol and cannabis. Three psychiatrists who examined Ogburn after his arrest all agreed he had a 'psychotic disorder' at the time of the incident. Ogburn was ordered to be detained at Ashworth secure hospital under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act. Judge Edwards said: 'At present I consider you to be a profoundly dangerous man. You will not be released until a Mental Health Tribunal considers it safe to do so.'","Anthony Ogburn denied murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility .

Officer David Estele Jones III, 37, was charged with assaulting Richard Samuel McVicker, 38, near Charlotte, North Carolina, last Wednesday. McVicker himself was charged with driving while impaired (DWI) after hitting Officer Jones’s 63-year-old mother in a low-speed collision. Ouch: Richard Samuel McVicker, 38, was allegedly assaulted near Charlotte, North Carolina, after driving into the back of a police officer's mother's car . Officer Jones’s mother had stopped at a red light in Matthews when McVicker's vehicle hit its rear end at a low speed, with no injuries caused. Police say the woman called her son and he then got into a fight with McVicker, who admitted he had drunk ‘a couple’ of beers beforehand. He then got out of his car to ask if she was alright - but she allegedly took his driving licence, pulled up her window and would not speak. ‘Her first words were, “Give me your licence”. Her second words were: “My son's a cop”,’ McVicker told the Charlotte Observer. McVicker began knocking on her window and she called her son, who arrived and allegedly left him with two black eyes and a cut on his nose.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 8:34 PM on 12th December 2011 . Victim: David Burgess, 63, known as Sonia, died in October, last year . A 35-year-old man today admitted pushing a cross-dressing top lawyer under a Tube train during the rush hour. Human rights solicitor David Burgess, 63, known as Sonia, died in October last year, after falling in front of a train at King’s Cross station, central London. Senthooran Kanagasingham, of Cricklewood, north London, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. But the prosecution at the Old Bailey refused to accept the plea and a jury was sworn to try him for murder, which he denies. Kanagasingham, had been undergoing sex change therapy at the time and used the name Nina. The shaven-headed defendant, wearing a shirt and grey jumper, claims he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time. The pair had been to see Nina's GP to . get a repeat prescription for a combined anti-depressant and sedative . when it is alleged animosity brewed up between them. Sonia told the doctor about her concerns . about Nina's level's of stress and anxiety and that she was waiting for . a psychiatric appointment, it was said. 'Disapproving' of the interference, it is alleged Nina hatched the plot . to kill Sonia as they made their way back to central London from . the Cricklewood surgery. Solicitor David Burgess, 63, known as Sonia, died in October last year, after falling in front of a train at King's Cross station, central London . As they waited for a westbound . Piccadilly Line train at King's Cross underground station, Nina allegedly struck . just after 6.35pm at the height of the evening rush hour on October 25 . of last year. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'She had been pushed from behind into a . path of an oncoming train, which was travelling along the busy . platform, in front of a number of shocked onlookers. 'The push was entirely deliberate and it was executed with the intention of killing Sonia Burgess. 'After all it could hardly have been done with any lesser intention than . to send Sonia to her death. The person who did that was this defendant. 'Each was well known to the other, and . had been in the company of the other for around an hour-and-a-half . before that calculated push that was to end Sonia Burgess's life.' The Old Bailey was told that Sonia was born a man called David Burgess. In her professional life as an immigration and human rights solicitor, . she was known by her male name. But in her personal life the divorcee was known as 'Sonia Jardiniere' or . Sonia Burgess and her three children, two daughters who live in Canada . and a son who live in Korea, were happy with her lifestyle. Mr Altman added: 'She was gender variant. She had no desire to become a . woman through gender reassignment and all that that entails. 'Everyone including her children . both accepted and embraced this. The evidence suggests this made her . happy and her happiness being of importance to her children made them . happy for her.' The devout Christian worshipped at St . Martins-in-the Field in Trafalgar Square near to her home in . Shaftesbury Avenue in London's theatreland and was on hand to help . others. He said: 'As a person she was caring . and generous with her time. She was tolerant of others and habitually . helped others with their problems. The defendant was one such person.' He told the court Nina was born a man called Senthooran Kanagasingham in Sri Lanka and came to the UK in 2000. By 2010 he was 'going through the process of gender reassignment' and . 'it had become his desire to pass as a woman.' Sonia befriended Nina . after they met at a bar or club but 'at first Sonia was wary of the . defendant because she suspected Nina, as she knew Senthooran . Kanagasingham, was having hormonal treatment. 'From past experiences she had had, this could render the person . volatile, over emotional and unbalanced.' Because Nina was temporarily . homeless, Sonia allowed her to use her flat to shower but over time . found her 'needy' and was 'lapsing into psychosis.' On the day of her . murder Sonia sent a text to a friend that said she was waiting to see a . doctor and added 'I have a transphobic friend.' When Sonia later raised . her concerns, the doctor saw a disapproving look on Nina's face. Mr Altman said: 'The prosecution say the text message provides an . important insight into what became the developing tension between Sonia . and Nina, culminating as it did in the defendant deciding quite . deliberately to push Sonia under the train at King's Cross a mere hour . later. 'It was, say the prosecution, born of anger and malice.' The jury heard . Nina, who know wishes to be known by his male name Senthooran . Kanagasingham, denies murder but has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on . the grounds of diminished responsibility. However Mr Altman said the plea was not acceptable to the prosecution. The trail expected to last two weeks continues.","Senthooran Kanagasingham claims he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 8:07 PM on 13th December 2011 . Shrien Dewani Dewani, who has been diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, was not at today¿s hearing . The British man accused of murdering his wife on honeymoon 'could kill himself' if he is extradited to South Africa to face allegations of masterminding the killing, the High Court was told today. Shrien Dewani's mental health has deteriorated to the point where he was 'too ill to be extradited' and was a suicide risk, his barrister said. He could also face violence from other prisoners if held in south Africa, she warned. Care home owner Dewani, from Bristol, is accused of arranging the contract killing of wife Anni in Cape Town in November 2010. He denies any wrongdoing. Home Secretary Theresa May signed an order for his extradition after District Judge Howard Riddle ruled at Belmarsh Magistrates’ Court in south east London in August that the 31-year-old should be sent back to South Africa to stand trial. But today Clare Montgomery QC, appearing for Dewani, asked two judges to block the extradition order on mental health grounds. As family members looked on, Ms Montgomery also argued he was at serious risk of violence - including sexual violence - at the hands of other prisoners if kept in custody in South Africa. Ms Montgomery said 'explicit public . hostility' towards him had been fanned by the country's police and . prosecutors, and the authorities would not be able to provide sufficient . protection. 'It will not be consistent with humanitarian principle to send some for extradition who is not fit to stand trial,' Ms Montgomery told judges. 'Were Mr Dewani to be extradited today, according to English standards, he would not be fit to stand his trial.' She added: 'We do submit it will always be unjust to extradite somebody who is unfit - no matter how serious the charge.' Mrs Dewani, 28, from Sweden, was shot when a taxi the couple were travelling in was hijacked in the Gugulethu township on the outskirts of Cape Town. Anni Dewani was killed on the second night of her honeymoon in Cape Town by armed robbers who hijacked the couple's taxi . Vinod Hindocha and wife Nilam, parents of murdered bride Anni Dewani arrive at the High Court today . She was found dead in the back of the . abandoned vehicle with a bullet wound to her neck after taxi driver . Zola Tongo drove the newlyweds to the impoverished area. He and Mr Dewani were ejected by the hijackers before Mrs Dewani was driven away and shot. Tongo, . who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement . with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit . on his wife. Dewani, who has been diagnosed with . severe post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression, was not at . today’s hearing at London’s High Court. Ms Montgomery argued he was so ill that he would be incapable of giving instructions to his lawyers or following trial proceedings, and extradition should be delayed until he had recovered. Shrien and Anni Dewani were carjacked in Cape Town. He was ejected from the car before the attackers drove off and killed her . The QC told Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley, that the businessman had always wished for a fair trial. 'However that is, at the moment, on the advice we have been given by those who are treating him, not possible.' His illnesses began to develop shortly after the murder of his wife and before he was accused of her murder. In April this year he was sectioned under the 1983 Mental Health Act to a psychiatric unit for his own protection, and in November was re-sectioned for a further six months following a deterioration in his condition. All the doctors who had examined him, including the expert instructed by the South African government, agreed that he was suffering from PTSD and depression, said Ms Montgomery. In a hearing expected to last two days, she asked the High Court to discharge the extradition order, or adjourn its implementation. She argued that District Judge Riddle had fallen into error when he accepted South African assurances that Dewani’s life and health would not be endangered if he was sent back to South Africa. She argued the limited assurances that were given were 'incapable of fulfilment'. Ms Montgomery told the court Judge . Riddle should have ordered Dewani’s discharge under section 91 of the . Extradition Act 2003 on the grounds that sending him back would . 'manifestly endanger his health or risk his life'. Shrien Dewani's father Prakash (left) arrives for the hearing in London with an unidentified man . Today's application is being opposed by the South African government.Written statements before the court from Dewani's legal team say that his illnesses cannot be treated with anti-depressant medication because he suffers from a life-threatening drug reaction. His recovery is likely to be 'slow and unpredictable'. They state he is being visually checked every 15 to 20 minutes at his psychiatric unit because he is a high suicide risk. Ms Montgomery told the judges that the risk would increase 'to an unacceptable level' if he was extradited. The suicide management capacity of the South African prison system was 'inadequate', as had been admitted by the Prisons Inspector, she contended. Experts also agreed that there was no evidence that the psychiatric hospital available to care for him could adequately treat his complex illnesses. Extradition would be incompatible with articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protect the right to life and prohibit inhuman and degrading treatment. In addition to Dewani being at . increased risk of suicide, he would also be at serious risk of violence . from other prisoners in the South African prison system, she claimed. Ms Montgomery argued that Judge . Riddle had wrongly relied on limited South African undertakings to . protect his health, and no effective undertakings had been given to . protect him from sexual violence or other violence at the hands of . prisoners.","Dewani is accused of arranging the murder of wife Anni in Cape Town in November 2010 .

"By . Nick Enoch . Last updated at 6:55 PM on 13th December 2011 . One of Britain's most . prolific egg thieves who scoured the country to steal almost 700 eggs from seriously endangered birds was jailed for six months today. Despite being . jailed three times previously for identical offences, Matthew Gonshaw, 49, from Bow, east London, donned . climbing equipment to steal entire nests - including . those of ospreys, golden eagles and peregrine falcons. Some of the stolen . eggs are believed to have had chicks in them nearly ready to hatch, which would . have been killed as he prepared the shells for display. Matthew Gonshaw, 49, from Bow, east London . (pictured today outside court, left), donned climbing equipment to steal . entire nests - including those of ospreys, golden eagles and peregrine . falcons . Gonshaw targeted more than 170 nests - some repeatedly. He now faces being the first person to also be slapped with an Asbo for the offence . The trophy hunter, who travelled widely around the UK for his hobby, was found with his collection of 697 eggs . stored in specially adapted homemade cabinets. He also now faces being the first person . to be slapped with an Asbo for the offence. Jailing him for the maximum . term, District Judge William Ashworth said: 'This was an ongoing venture that . wasn't going to stop. 'The offence is serious that only a . custodial sentence can be justified because this represented a methodically and . meticulously planned venture targeting rare British birds and placing them in . peril and causing substantial losses to the local community. A collection of eggs, from various birds of prey, recovered by police following the arrest of Matthew Gonshaw . Among the eggs found in Matthew Gonshaw's haul: . 'It is made . worse by your previous convictions.' Like many of his 'underground community', . he would make small holes in the shell and blow the eggs to get rid of the contents. However, many of the eggs were close to hatching and he had to remove chicks - killing the young and damaging the collection. Gonshaw targeted more than 170 nests, some repeatedly, and his theft of golden eagle and osprey eggs was 'unprecedented'. Becky Owen, prosecuting, said: 'A . significant number of the eggs had large and untidy holes in them which suggest . that the eggs were taken too late in the incubation and therefore he removed . developing chicks... including from the golden eagles' eggs. 'The egg . thieves will watch a nest over a considerable period to attempt to identify . when they are being laid and it is in fact a lack of skill on the part of the . egg thief that he has got this entirely wrong.' The eggs will now have to be . destroyed rather than passed on to a Natural History Museum as this would be . seen as an 'achievement' for the egg thief. Speaking outside court ,RSPB officer . Mark Thomas said: 'He is one of the most prolific collectors of wild bird eggs . in the UK and he has got a disregard for wild birds, particularly rare ones, . and the people who spend thousands of hours looking after them. 'With the golden eagle eggs in particular, . it was incredibly cruel. He took them about a week from hatching - he basically . removed a live chick... and all he could do was put [the eggs] in a wooden tray and hide them in his home. 'He is obsessive, he can't stop collecting . eggs and he is putting some of the most endangered birds in the UK in peril.' The balding defendant, who would steal entire clutches, had 45 eggs from Schedule One birds, which are particularly . rare. Officers noted how the eggs had been stored and categorised in a professional and organised way. Gonshaw admitted six offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 . at Thames Magistrates Court today. A collection of avocet eggs retrieved from Gonshaw's haul . This . included possession of 652 'ordinary' wild bird eggs, possession of 18 . wild bird eggs from peregrine falcons, dotterels, and merlins, red kites . (a bird of prey that had been . persecuted to extinction in England and has only recently returned as . the . result of a reintroduction programme) and redwings. Gonshaw also had . possession of eight osprey eggs - a rare bird. He also admitted taking . five golden eagle eggs from Lewis, Scotland, possessing seven golden eagle . eggs, taking 12 avocet eggs (the bird used for the RSPB emblem) from a nesting . site in Two Tree Island, Essex and possessing them at his home, and two charges . of going equipped to take eggs. Maps used by Gonshaw as he travelled around Britain stealing the eggs . Among the haul were 12 avocet eggs. The bird (above) is used for the RSPB emblem . His tools to steal the wild birds eggs . included wooden trays, storage containers, books, notebooks, maps, climbing equipment, . clothing, egg blowing tools and photographs. This is his fifth conviction relating to . his collection. In April 2001, he was caught raiding a golden eagle's nest in . the outer Hebrides and fined £500. In 2002, he received a three-month sentence . for stealing rare British species of eggs, but officers were unable to find his . collection. In 2004, he was jailed for four months and fined £5,000 in Scotland for taking eggs and he was jailed again . for six months in 2005 after being caught with more than 700 eggs. Benefits claimer Gonshaw - who complained 'It's . a free country, isn't it' - said he funded his excursions by hitch-hiking and . living wild. Matthew Hood, defending, said: 'He has . been collecting eggs as a hobby since childhood. It is an interest he has never . been able to lose but he has told me today that he wants help.'","Matthew Gonshaw's collection included 45 Schedule One eggs, from particularly rare birds .

"By . Stephen Wright and Ryan Kisiel . Last updated at 12:57 AM on 14th December 2011 . One of the men accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. In an appalling racist rant recorded by a police surveillance camera, David Norris boasted he would use ‘two sub-machine guns’ in a plan to ‘skin a black ****’ and ‘blow their two arms and legs off’. Then, he said, he would tell them: ‘Go on, you can swim home now’. He added: ‘They would be bobbing about like that.’ Suspects: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris both deny murder . Norris, 35, and Gary Dobson, 36, are alleged to have fatally stabbed 18-year-old Stephen, an A-level student, in Eltham, South East London, in April 1993. Twenty months later, in December 1994, police installed a covert camera inside Dobson’s rented flat in Footscray Road, Eltham. Over a period of 17 days, detectives heard Dobson frequently use racist terms to describe black and Asian people, jurors were told. Dobson was seen in one video clip recalling a time when he threatened a black colleague with a knife. A brawl started between the pair when Dobson stole his baseball cap, and he later threatened the colleague with a Stanley knife. Dobson said on the video: ‘I said, “Tap me once more, you silly **** , I’m going to slice this down you seven times”.’ He was also seen wandering around the flat with a large knife, and telling another man who is not on trial, Neil Acourt, that a ‘Paki’ had won the lottery jackpot. On one occasion, Acourt was seen to hide a knife in his jacket before leaving the flat with Norris.Before . jurors were shown a series of clips from the surveillance video, the . trial judge Mr Justice Treacy warned they might find the material . distressing. ‘The material . you will be watching shows the behaviour the prosecution alleges is . racist and violent but you will have to be the judges of what it shows,’ he told them. ‘You may well find it shocking. If you do, you must remember that emotion has no part to play in this trial.’ The black and white sequences were shot over a number of days on a tiny camera installed low in the front room of the flat, close to the television. Murdered: Black teenager Stephen Lawrence who was stabbed to death in April 1992 . The conversations between Dobson, . Norris and Acourt were heard with programmes such as Coronation Street, . News at Ten and Gladiators in the background. Stephen . was stabbed to death in Well Hall Road, Eltham, shortly after 10.30pm . on April 22 1993, after being attacked by a gang of white youths who had . shouted racist abuse. Detectives asked Dobson about his grey bomber jacket which prosecutors say is now at the heart of the case. Dobson said: ‘Neither me or my jacket was out that night, the night of the murder.’ He went on: ‘Stabbing innocent people is not something we get off on, it’s not something we enjoy doing . . . we’re not animals.’ The court has previously heard that brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt were suspects in the original investigation and items of clothing were seized from their family home in Eltham during a police search. Dobson and Norris were charged after a forensic breakthrough during a review of the case in 2007 and 2008. Prosecutors claim that 16 fibres linked to the clothes Stephen wore on the night of his death were found on Dobson’s jacket and a multi-coloured cardigan, or in the evidence bags they were kept in.Scientists also found a tiny blood stain on the collar of his jacket and a fragment of blood which encased two fibres. Defence lawyers claim that neither Norris nor Dobson was at the scene at the time of the killing and have suggested forensic evidence has been contaminated. At the time of the killing Dobson was living in Eltham, and Norris lived three miles away in Chislehurst. Dobson later rented the flat in Footscray Road with a friend. Dobson and Norris deny murder. The trial continues. They were separated by nearly two decades – the foul-mouthed teenager with a knife in his hand, and the sober-suited, quietly spoken man in the witness box. One was Gary Dobson aged 19, filmed on a secret police camera the year after Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death. The other was Gary Dobson aged 36, facing a murder charge 17 years later. Yesterday an Old Bailey jury saw both of them – first when the 1994 video recording turned the clock back to the time when he and his associates were suspects; then when he took the witness stand to deny any involvement in killing the 18-year-old black student. For the first time in this marathon trial, jurors witnessed the venom and racial hatred that was captured by a covert camera set up in Dobson’s rented flat. His friend David Norris, now his co-defendant, was heard bragging that he wanted to torture and kill black people. Dobson and one of his friends were seen holding large knives. But yesterday Dobson, sitting just yards from Stephen’s parents in court, said he was ‘disgusted and embarrassed’ by the racist language he was heard using on the covert film. He conceded there was ‘no denying’ he held racist views at the time it was made, but he added: ‘I don’t dislike people because of the colour of their skin.’ He said he had black, Asian and Chinese friends. The stark contrast between the 1994 film and the figure in the witness box came on the first day of the defence case after nearly a month of prosecution evidence. It was the first time the court has heard either defendant speak, save for answering to their names on day one – the first time, too, that either has been out of the dock. Earlier Dobson had sat in silence as the film was played to the court. Now he adjusted his striped blue tie, pulled down the waistcoat of his three-piece suit and sat facing the eight men and four women jurors. Above him, in the public gallery, his mother and relatives watched. A dark-haired woman was in tears. Asked by his counsel Timothy Roberts QC how he felt as he watched the film, Dobson replied: ‘To be honest with you, I’m not comfortable sitting there watching it. It’s the first time I’ve seen it in 15 years. It’s not something I’m proud of. It’s certainly not the way I was brought up to speak either.’ When he was filmed talking to his friend Neil Acourt about threatening to ‘slice’ a black workmate with a Stanley knife, it was ‘just a bit of bravado’, he said. ‘I think I was just talking up the situation and relating it to my friends . . . just being a bit stupid.’ Why did the surveillance film at his flat show him at one stage with a knife in his hand? ‘I can’t quite recall, but watching the video, I’d been cleaning and tidying up and everything else . . . there’s a chance I was making dinner at that time.’ What did he feel about being heard to call someone a Paki? ‘It’s not right,’ he said. ‘I can’t defend it. I can’t justify it.’ He would ‘definitely not’ have used that sort of language in front of his parents, he said. And calling someone on TV a n***** ? ‘I suppose you could call it idiotic banter,’ he said, ‘. . . for the amusement of my friends sitting there with me. It was just a rude and stupid conversation.’ Dobson was adamant he was at home with his parents on the night of April 22, 1993, when Stephen was attacked by a gang of white youths at around 10.30pm. Dobson had been in his bedroom listening to music and playing computer games, he told the jury. The only time he went out was some time around 11.30pm, when he called at the home of his friends Neil and Jamie Acourt, who, the court has been told, later became suspects in the police investigation. He went to borrow a Bob Marley CD and ask if they had a joint for him to smoke. Wasn’t that rather late to be making a social call, his barrister asked? ‘It was,’ he agreed. ‘But at that age in life, for me and all my group of friends, it wasn’t too unusual to be going round late at night.’ Mr Roberts asked him: ‘Did you have anything to do with the events that led to the death of Stephen Lawrence? ‘No,’ Dobson replied. ‘I did not.’",Gary Dobson told court he was 'embarrassed' by secretly filmed racist language .

Mohamed Z underwent crucial surgery five times at the Martin-Luther Hospital in Berlin, Germany, to reconstruct his lips, parts of his nose and his jaw. The 29-year-old was travelling in a car in Misrata in June when the fallout from a missile ripped through the vehicle and tore a gaping hole in his face. Confident: Mohamed Z underwent several bouts of life-saving surgery to reconstruct his lips, nose and jaw . Mohamed Z pictured before the attack . Speaking yesterday for the first time since the horrific incident, he said: 'I'm happy, I can laugh and eat.' Following the blast his uncle took him to Egypt, where doctors fed him through a tube into his stomach. Otherwise he would have starved to death. Relief organisation Doctors for Germany in Libya then brought him to Europe, where plastic surgeon Dr Johannes Bruck convinced his bosses at Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin to foot the bill. Their first challenge was to reconstruct his jaw and nose. To do this, they took a palm-sized piece of skin from his groin, which they put on his face. Dr Bruck said: 'The skin there is very . thin, making it possible to produce a better facial expressions.' Then, . with skin from his arm, his mouth was restored. Mohamed, who needed translators to keep him up to date with what was going on, underwent almost daily surgery. Life-saving: Mohamed Z pictured shortly after the attack (left) and after his first crucial operation (right) Having . arrived in a deep state of depression, and unable to look at himself in . the mirror, Bruck revealed his patient was now getting to grips with . his new look.

A male model who suffered horrific burns to his face after a thug set him on fire has said: 'I pity the man who did this to me.' Russell Banks, 21, was left scarred for life after a hooded yob sprayed him with lighter fluid and threw a lit match at him in a pub beer garden. The arsonist inadvertently set fire to himself and CCTV cameras captured the moment he sprinted out of the pub with his torso covered in flames. Mr Banks suffered third-degree burns . to 20 per cent of his body including his hands, arm, chest, neck and . face after the attack in October. Surgeons removed skin from his legs and implanted it onto his chest and face but he was told he would be permanently scarred. Yesterday the barman and part-time model, said he felt 'pity' towards his attacker, who also suffered major burns. Speaking . from his parents’ home in Sileby, Leicestershire, Mr Banks said: 'The . past weeks have been grim - I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, not even my . attacker. 'I feel anger and pity towards my attacker - but mainly pity for the man who did this to me. 'He’s totally changed my life but I can’t go on feeling anger towards him.' Mr . Banks was enjoying a drink with his friend Robert Laszewsk, 21, at the . Rainbow and Dove gay bar in Leicester city centre when the incident happened . at 12.40am on Tuesday, October 25. The attack was totally unprovoked and Mr Banks said he had never seen or spoken to his attacker, who approached him from behind. He desperately tried to put the flames out and suffered burns to his face and right arm. Mr Banks recalled: 'I can actually remember it very clearly - he came from behind and the next moment I was set on fire. This is the dramatic moment the hooded yob was captured on CCTV engulfed in flames just after the unprovoked attack at the Rainbow and Dove, in Leicester . The arsonist, who inadvertently set fire to himself, sprinted out of the pub with his torso covered in flames - but did not seek medical assistance . Model: Russell Banks before the attack. He said he 'pities' the man who covered him in lighter fluid and set fire to him. He has been left scarred for life . 'There wasn’t much pain but I was consumed with panic. 'My eyes were open and I could see the orange flames all around me. 'Once . the fire was extinguished, I was absolutely freezing from the shock . then it all went blurry - I don’t remember anything till I woke from my . coma weeks later.' Police believe the attacker also suffered major burns but did not seek medical treatment. Mr . Banks was rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary where doctors sedated him . and attempted to open his airways which had swollen after he inhaled . the flames. His step-mother Jane, 33, said: 'My husband Harry and I were terrified when we saw . police at the hospital - that’s when we knew it was serious. Hospital: Surgeons stripped the dead skin from his hands and arms before separating his fingers to prevent them melting together . 'Russell is such a lovely guy, he wouldn’t hurt a fly - that's what made this unprovoked attack so hard to comprehend. 'When we saw him, he was wearing a white mask impregnated with special chemicals for his burnt skin. 'It was very distressing - the skin on his hands looked like snake skin and was peeling away.' Mr Banks was enjoying a drink with his friend when the incident happened at 12.40am on Tuesday, October 25 . Mr Banks was transferred to Nottingham City Hospital’s specialist burns unit where he spent three weeks in a chemically-induced coma. He was connected to a dozen tubes feeding him a cocktail of drugs - including morphine, sedatives and antibiotics. Surgeons stripped the dead skin from his hands and arms before separating his fingers to prevent them melting together. He added: 'It took a long time to pluck up the courage to look at my burned face - I’d always been a perfectionist, a gym fanatic, and obsessed about my body. 'Whenever I walked into a room, the nurses - who provided amazing care - would tape up any mirrors or reflective surfaces. 'When I finally decided to look at myself it was the biggest shock - I thought I was a different person. 'I broke down, it was just too much. The attack had taken my identity away. 'But after that initial shock, I’m coming to accept it - I can’t change my scars, they tell a story after all.' Mr Banks finally came home on Thursday, November 24, but has been plagued by pain and discomfort. He said: 'Everything is sore and tight and the nights are tough - I’m roasting one moment, freezing the next. 'Climbing the stairs is very tricky and I’ve lost all the grip in my fingertips so turning on the tap is hard too. 'I want to get on with my life and I’d love to get back to modelling but I know that is probably not going to be possible.' A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the attack. A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: 'A 21-year-old man was arrested in the London area on Wednesday November 23 and has been bailed pending further inquiries for the Leicester offence, but he remains on remand for an offence in Essex.'","Hooded yob sprayed Russell Banks with lighter fluid and threw a lit match at him .

"Last updated at 5:07 PM on 13th December 2011 . Mexican marines have captured a founding member of the brutal Zetas drug cartel, the navy announced today. Marines arrested Raul Lucio Hernandez Lechuga in Cordoba, in the state of Veracruz, where the Zetas are fighting for control against a gang allied to the Sinaloa drug cartel, the navy said in a statement. Hernandez, known as 'Lucky', was the leader of the Zetas for the states of Veracruz, Puebla and Oaxaca, it said. Not so lucky: Raul Hernandez Lechuga (aka El Lucky pictured left) presented to the press in Mexico City today after being arrested by Mexican marines (pictured right) Suspects shown to press: Lucky (sixth from right) and other suspects are shown to the press under the custody of navy marines at the Organized Crime Special Investigations Unit headquarters . The federal government had offered a 15 million-peso reward, about $1.2 million, for information leading to his arrest. The . Zetas organisation was formed by a small group of elite soldiers based . in Tamaulipas state, across the border from Texas, who deserted to work . for the Gulf drug cartel in the 1990s. The . Zetas began gaining independence from the Gulf cartel after their then . leader, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, was extradited to the U.S. in 2006. They finally split from their former bosses last year, setting off bloody fights throughout Mexico as they seek to expand south. The navy didn’t say if Hernandez was a soldier when he joined the Zetas in the 1990s or give any other details about him. Seized ammunition: The ammunitions taken in the arrest of Hernandez - an alleged leader of Los Zetas drug cartel . Weapons: These guns were also seized during Hernandez's arrest and shown at the press conference in Mexico City . Earlier yesterday, the Mexican army said its soldiers battled suspected drug cartel members just south of the Texas border, killing 11 gunmen. One soldier was reported wounded. The clash began when soldiers on . patrol were fired on Saturday from a building in the city of Valle . Hermoso, south of Brownsville, Texas, the Defense Department said in a . news release. The troops later seized the building, finding 11 dead gunmen and 73 rifles inside, it said. Two suspects were arrested. The wounded soldier was taken to a hospital for treatment. His condition was unknown. Both the Gulf and Zetas drug cartels operate in that area. In Veracruz, a Gulf coast state bordering Tamaulipas to the south, unidentified assailants tossed a bomb into a building where a cockfight was being held early Sunday, state prosecutors said in a statement. One man was killed and nine others slightly wounded, the statement said. The wounded were treated at hospitals and released. Navy personnel arrange confiscated weaponry during a presentation to the media in Mexico City . Flak jackets with the Zetas drug cartel's 'Z' logo, cartridges and boxes with bullets are on display . State prosecutors did not specify what type of explosive was involved. They also did not say if they had arrested any suspects or uncovered a motive for the attack. Federal prosecutors also announced yesterday that a judge sentenced five former soldiers to 25-year prison terms for aiding a drug cartel. The rare convictions occurred in the northern state of Sinaloa, home to the drug cartel of the same name. The five included a major assigned to the military court system, three lieutenants and a sergeant. They were convicted of organised crime and assisting in drug trafficking. Prosecutors said in a statement the former officers gave 'strategic military information and protection' to Alfredo Beltran Leyva, who was a leader of the Beltran-Leyva drug cartel before he was arrested in January 2008. Beltran Leyva and his brothers were allied with the Sinaloa cartel, but the two gangs split in part because of Alfredo’s arrest.

A young child has become only the second person in the U.S. to develop a rare form of flu that is usually found in pigs rather than humans. The Minnesota child has developed the H1N2 virus, which does not usually infect humans. The only previous case was in Michigan four years ago. Medical officials have warned this shows how tough flu can be to pin down, after 6,000 people died in the U.S. from the H1N1 strain in 2009. Scroll down for video .

H1N2 is more commonly found in pigs in the Upper Midwest - but as the boy had no contact with the animals, the virus must have mutated.

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 8:10 PM on 13th December 2011 . After a year-long search, police investigators on New York's Long Island announced today they believe they have discovered the skeletal remains of New Jersey prostitute Shannan Gilbert, who vanished last December after fleeing a client's home in a panic. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said searchers found the bones at around 9:15am in a dense wetland thicket, not far from where the 24-year-old disappeared from the area in May 2010. He said authorities believe it is Gilbert's corpse, although further examination will be conducted by the county medical examiner. Remains: A body believed to belong to Shannan Gilbert was found in thick bramble this morning about a quarter of a mile away from where her belongings were found . Crime Scene: Investigators used metal detectors and K-9s to search a marsh for the remains of Shannan Gilbert who was last seen in 2010 running hysterically from a client's home in Oak Beach . Map: The locations where eight of ten bodies were found near Gilgo Beach since December 2010. The remains of Shannan Gilbert will make it 11 . Police began searching for her last . December when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide . victims' remains. They were strewn along several miles of thicket along . a parkway leading to Jones Beach. They think Gilbert may have drowned . accidentally while fleeing a client's home for an unclear reason. The body was found about a quarter of a mile from where her belongings were found in a thick, brambled area. Last week, the search turned up Gilbert's purse, containing her ID, cell phone and lip gloss, as well as her jeans and shoes. The 24-year-old was a prostitute who advertised her services on Craigslist . Commissioner Dormer said: 'We went in with the idea we were going in one last time to see if we could find anything and we did. 'This is very tough brambled area, difficult to traverse, you can't walk through that area and this is why it has taken us so long to find.' He said the location of the skeleton suggests that Gilbert may have been trying to flee across the wetland to a causeway. He suggested that she had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which he called a 'tough, desolate, tangled mess'. He said: 'The terrain would have made it impossible. Our people who were in there over the last few days had to cut through that brush and bramble area, before she was located.' Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site. Gilbert's disappearance prompted the investigation which led to five bodies found in burlap sacks on Gilgo Beach last December. The bodies have been positively identified as prostitutes advertising on Craigslist. Since then, five more bodies have been found which have yet to be identified. Police said they think Gilbert's disappearance is unrelated to the other bodies but a single killer may be responsible for the ten dead. Relatives of Megan Waterman and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose bodies were among the ten found, visited the scene on the first anniversary of the grisly discovery. 'It's been a living hell,' Waterman's mother Loraine Ela told reporters on Monday. 'It really is. Not a day doesn't go back where I don't think of Megan.' Relatives of some of the murdered women are due to hold a vigil today from 2pm to 5pm to mark the anniversary of when their loves ones’ remains were found. Thick bramble: Clothing and other items were found in the marsh in the community of Babylon which belonged to Shannan Gilbert . New search: Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site . A police officer and his cadaver dog were following up on the disappearance of Gilbert when they came across the first set of human remains on December 11, 2010. Two days later, three more bodies were found. By April, the total had risen to 10 bodies, all strewn along several miles of Ocean Parkway, on a barrier island south of Long Island that leads to Jones Beach. Authorities at first believed several people could be involved, but Police Commissioner Richard Dormer has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade. The victims included eight women, a man and a toddler. Police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was found wearing women’s clothing. The toddler is believed to be the child of one of the prostitutes.","Relatives of other victims to hold candle-lit vigil today to mark a year since first remains were found .

U.S. Congress has frozen $700million in aid to Pakistan until it gives assurances it is combating the spread of homemade explosives in the region. Calls are growing in the U.S. to penalise Pakistan for failing to act against militant groups and, some argue, helping them. Relations between the two countries are already at rock bottom after a number of U.S. drone attacks have killed Pakistani civilians and the secret raid in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in May. Scourge: U.S. Army soldiers secure a road after an IED exploded during a patrol in Logar, Afghanistan. Fertiliser used in making the explosives is being smuggled from Pakistan . Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid and the cutback announced is only a small proportion of the billions in civil and military assistance it gets every year. Salim Saifullah, chairman of Pakistan's Senate foreign relations committee, warned ties could worsen further after the decision. He said: 'I don't think this is a wise move. It could hurt ties. 'There should instead be efforts to increase cooperation. I don't see any good coming out of this.' Militancy: Fuel trucks burn in Bolan, Pakistan, after an insurgent attack.

Suspicions: Senator John McCain has said fertiliser used in many of the IEDs targeting coalition troops in Afghanistan originates from two factories in Pakistan . Homemade bombs, or improvised . explosive devices (IEDs), are among militants' most effective weapons . against U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan as they struggle to . fight a resurgent Taliban insurgency. Many are made using ammonium nitrate, a common fertiliser smuggled across the border from Pakistan. The U.S. wants 'assurances that Pakistan is countering improvised explosive devices in their country that are targeting our coalition forces', Howard McKeon, a House Republican, said. Some $20billion of security and economic aid has been allocated to Pakistan by the U.S. since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 - much of it in the form of reimbursements for assistance in fighting militants. But U.S politicians have expressed increasing frustration with Pakistan's efforts in the war. There . have been proposals to make U.S. aid to Pakistan conditional on more . cooperation in fighting militants such as the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani . network, which Washington believes operates out of Pakistan. Cause for complaint?

Former general and security analyst . Talat Masood said: 'I think the Pakistan side will understand the type . of signal that is coming, which shows it's not only a question of aid. 'The . whole attitude of the U.S. and the relationship will be affected by . these measures because they know Pakistan will not be in a position to . control smuggling.' Republican Senator John McCain said . last week: 'The vast majority of the material used to make IEDs used . against U.S. forces in Afghanistan originates from two fertiliser . factories inside Pakistan.' A Congressional Research Service . report in October said the Pakistani factories, owned by one of the . country's biggest companies, Pakarab, have been producing over 300,000 . metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate per year since 2004. The . U.S. has urged Pakistan to strictly regulate the distribution of . ammonium nitrate to Afghanistan. So far, Pakistan has only produced . draft legislation on the issue. Analysts say U.S. demands will be tough to meet because of rampant corruption on both sides of the porous border that makes smuggling easy. One businessman explained how easy it is to get through security. ""We pay a 1,200-rupee ($13) bribe to the Pakistani Frontiers Corps on the border for every car carrying fertiliser,"" said Kamal Khan in the border town of Chaman. ""Fertiliser is smuggled on trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and donkey carts.' Pakistan's fragile economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, so cutting down on fertiliser output would hurt the sector. The provision freezing $700 million in aid was agreed upon by leaders of the armed services committees from both parties in the House and Senate, including Mr McCain. It is part of compromise legislation authorising U.S. defence programmes expected to be approved this week, Mr McKeon said. The bill would also require the Pentagon to deliver a strategy for improving the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Pakistan, he said.","Fertiliser used in many IEDs targeting coalition troops comes from two factories in Pakistan .

Probe: Inaki Urdangarin will not take part in official royal engagements in Spain because he is under investigation for siphoning off funds . King Juan Carlos' son-in-law will stop taking part in official ceremonies because his business dealings are under investigation, Spain's Royal Palace said today. Inaki Urdangarin, 43, is suspected of siphoning away funds from public contracts awarded from 2004 to 2006 to a non-profit foundation he then headed. The allegation looks terrible for the royal family at a time of acute hardship and economic crisis in Spain, where unemployment stands at 21.5 per cent. Mr Urdangarin, husband of the monarch's daughter Princess Cristina, made the decision mutually with the Royal Palace, according to its chief of staff. He has not been charged with a crime and issued a statement on Saturday saying he regrets the 'damage' the case is causing the royal family, but admitted no wrongdoing. Rafael Spottorno, chief of staff at the palace, said Mr Urdangarin will be removed from the royal family's agenda and will no longer attend official ceremonies involving it. He said it was not yet known if Princess Cristina would also stay away from activities. Ceremony: Mr Urdangarin, far right, stands with (from left) Princess Letizia Ortiz, Crown Prince Felipe, King Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia, and his wife Princes Cristina . Duties: Princess Cristina at the World Swimming Championships in Barcelona in 2003. She lives with her husband in Washington D.C. The couple and their four children now live in Washington, D.C., where Mr Urdangarin works for Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica. Spanish newspapers, quoting investigators, have reported that he is suspected of taking part of around €6million the foundation received from regional governments in Valencia and the Balearic Islands for organising events such as sports seminars. The money is said to have gone to for-profit companies he ran. The case is part of a broader, long-running corruption probe involving the regional government in the Balearic Islands, the capital of which is Palma on the island of Mallorca. News of the scandal has made the front page of Spanish newspapers for the past two weeks and forced the Royal Palace to take the rare step of addressing publicly the activities of one of its members. Mr Spottorno said that by the end of December, the Royal Palace website will publish a breakdown of the money earmarked for the family in the government budget. In 2011, it was €8.43million. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia have three children. Crown Prince Felipe is the youngest, Princess Cristina in the middle child and the eldest is Princess Elena.","43-year-old is accused of siphoning away funds from public contracts awarded to foundation he headed .

Mustafa Tamimi, 28, died of his wounds on Saturday and yesterday the Israeli army faced backlash after a senior military spokesman was accused of mocking him on Twitter. As mourners attended Tamimi's funeral in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh yesterday, the spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Major Peter Lerner, tweeted: 'What was Mustafa thinking running after a moving jeep while throwing stones #fail.'

His tweet follows an unapologetic response from other Israeli military officials, who released the images of a sling that they allege was found on Tamimi's body - apparently proving that he had shot stones at the soldiers. Further pictures were released of the demonstrator's body lying in a pool of blood after the incident, before he was taken to hospital where he later died of his injuries. Despite Major Lerner denying mocking Tamimi, saying the word 'fail' was directed at activists who gave a one-sided version of events, clashes erupted at the victim's funeral.

As many as 2,000 rural post offices are to close in favour of downgraded services which will open up in other commercial premises, it has emerged. Around one fifth of the network's 11,500 branches will be changed into new 'PO Locals' offering limited counter services in garages and shops. Under the plans, which start next June, it will no longer be possible to apply for driving licences, send bulky post overseas, pay car tax or make cash withdrawals using pass books. Concerns: Around 2,000 rural post offices will close next summer under plans to replace them with 'PO Locals' offering a limited service in garages and shops . Post Office Limited has been gradually rolling out a trial of the new service, which has resulted in the number of PO Locals doubling from 60 earlier this year to 115, according to the Daily Telegraph. Consumer Focus, the postal services watchdog, has expressed serious concerns over the move. Andy Burrowes, a postal expert at Consumer Focus, said the trials found that often postal services were treated as a 'secondary offer' by the shop or garage owner in PO Locals. He added: 'These are subtle but quite fundamental changes for customers concerned.' It is claimed that longstanding post office customers would have to queue up behind people buying milk and crisps in order to receive their weekly pensions. 'Fundamental changes': Customers will not be able to apply for driving licences, pay car tax or withdraw cash using passbooks under the new scheme . Some PO Locals even ran out of money and were not able to pay benefits because they cannot hold as much cash as Post Office branches, it was reported in the Telegraph. Sub-postmasters are apparently being offered the equivalent of 18 months’ salary if they agree to close down or convert into a PO Local. Michelle Mitchell, Charity Director of Age UK, said: 'It is imperative that there is as little disruption as possible to the service for older customers during this programme of conversion.' Last night, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which is expected to take over the running of the post office network from Royal Mail in April next year, defended the plans. A spokesman said: 'The Post Office network will be maintained at its current size and coverage of 11,500 outlets nationwide and strict access criteria must be met to ensure reasonable access to services for all.'","One fifth of 11,500 branches to become limited 'PO Locals'

Crazy: Paulo Franco outside the Fyffes factory in Coventry where he claims he was asked to leave his job after complaining that he couldn't communicate with his Polish staff . A supervisor at Britain’s biggest banana-packing factory claims he was forced out of his job after complaining that he was unable to communicate with his mainly Polish staff. Paulo Franco says it was virtually impossible to work at the Fyffes plant in Coventry without being able to speak Polish. Key meetings and training sessions were all conducted in the language, he alleges. He claims that when he tried to speak to workers in English, they would simply tell him to learn Polish. An English colleague even downloaded a language translation app on to his mobile phone so that he could do his job. Mr Franco, 37, was shocked to discover the language gap shortly after starting at the factory last month. ‘I . couldn’t believe what was happening,’ said Portuguese-born Mr Franco, . who came to Britain in 2000 and is a fluent English speaker. ‘All the supervisors were Polish apart from me and one Englishman. And of 300 packers, almost all of them were Polish. ‘I speak four languages – Portuguese, English, French and Spanish – but none helped. I was told if I wanted to get on, I should learn Polish. It’s crazy. I spent nine years studying English, yet here in England it’s Polish I need to speak.’ Barriers: Mr Franco alleges that when he tried to speak to his subordinates at the banana-packing factory (above) in English, they would simply insist he speak to them in Polish . Mr Franco, an experienced factory line manager, was taken on by Fyffes for the £9.23-an-hour job after making contact via the Staffline recruitment agency. He had a 30-minute interview with Fyffes director Mike Cartledge, but Mr Franco says he was not warned he would need to understand Polish. ‘He told me he wanted new guys with experience to improve things,’ said Mr Franco. ‘When I got to the factory floor, I found the language used was Polish. The supervisor in charge of the training had very poor English so he gave instructions in Polish. ‘I was in charge of 18 packers on my . line: one Russian, the rest were Polish. They’d look at me blankly when I . spoke and say they didn’t understand me. ‘It was an impossible job. I wanted to . change some practices in the factory but without Polish I couldn’t . attempt to change anything. The packers would laugh and say, “Learn . Polish, mate.” ’ Paulo Franco . Mr Franco, who lives in Coventry with his Portuguese girlfriend, complained to Mr Cartledge in a letter two weeks ago. He wrote: ‘All the training has been provided in a low level of English, causing misinterpretations, and most of the line workers do not understand the basic instructions. At meetings, Polish replaces English, causing communication breakdowns.’ After sending the letter, he was told he had a ‘chip on his shoulder’ and was later asked to leave his job. He has since filed a grievance procedure against Fyffes and Staffline alleging harassment and unequal treatment. Mr Franco said: ‘I’ve nothing against Polish people but I’m sad to see this happen in a great country like England. I don’t know why English people tolerate situations like this. 'They’ll lose their identity if something isn’t done. Poles are guests in this country and should learn the language.’ An English supervisor at Fyffes, who did not want to be named, resorted to downloading the translation app to understand Polish words. He explained: ‘I didn’t know what my staff were saying.’ Another quality controller at the factory, which packs ten million bananas a week, said: ‘The senior management is all English but on the factory floor you have to speak Polish if you want to know what’s going on.’ Fyffes brand manager Paul Barrett said: ‘Our staff need a minimum standard of English and are tested before they start. But you will never change the fact that people prefer their native tongue. You can’t ban people speaking in their own language.’ Forza AW (pictured), a meat-packing firm in Norfolk, caused an outcry last year after it was found to be conducting health-and-safety training in Polish . He added: ‘Paulo raised these issues with us and we were carrying out our own assessment. He became agitated about his interpretation of what was happening. We got back on to the agency to say it was not working out.’ Fyffes has been importing tropical fruit for 123 years. It has 20 sites globally, including five in Britain. Last year, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Forza AW, a meat-packing firm in Norfolk, effectively barred non-Poles from jobs by conducting health-and-safety training in Polish. Think-tank Migration Watch says Poles constitute three-quarters of the estimated 800,000 migrants who have arrived in Britain from former Eastern Bloc countries since their admission to the EU in 2004.","Meetings and training sessions 'all conducted in Polish'

Upset: Linda Kallish, 66, of Boynton Beach, Florida, needs an insulin pump and fruit juice to control her diabetes and was left 'traumatised' by a search . Ms Kalish claims she had her fruit juice taken away for 10 minutes and had to partially take off clothing to show a security official her pump implant. ‘There has to be a way to address this,’ she told the New York Daily News, saying she will only accept heavy security if she is treated better. Should senior citizens be exempt from airport body searches?

The extensive search was prompted because she asked to avoid a metal detector as she did not want her defibrillator to be affected, she claims. 'I walk with a walker - I really look like a terrorist,' she said sarcastically. 'I'm tiny. I weigh 110lbs - 107 without clothes - and I was strip-searched.’ On top of that, as Ms Zimmerman removed her metal walker, it banged her shin and she started bleeding. She had to be treated by a medic. 'My sock was soaked with blood. I was bleeding like a pig,' she said, claiming the officers were unsympathetic and showed no emotion to her.

Scientists used to believe that Mercury permanently turned 'one face' towards the Sun - with one side scorchingly hot and the other cold. A Mercury 'day' was believed to be the same as the planet's year. But radar scans of the planet revealed that this wasn't the case - the planet wobbles round three times for every two circuits it makes round the sun. Why the planet had escaped the 'tidal locking' of the Sun's gravitational pull - the same force that makes our moon face one way towards the Earth - had been a puzzle. Now scientists have fingered a likely culprit - a huge asteroid. Mercury, as seen from Mariner 10: Now scientists believe that the tiny planet's wobbly orbit could be due to impact with an asteroid big enough to leave a 'basin' in its surface . The tiny planet is so close to the sun that it should be tidally locked to the sun - such orbits are 'highly stable', say scientists. Now scientists believe an asteroid impact may have 'pushed' the planet into its current wobbly orbit. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, says that the planet's unusual orbit could have been caused by an asteroid impact so huge that it left a basin in the planet's surface. The scientists, led by Alexandre Correia, speculate that the wobble could be caused by 'large, basin-forming impact event' - potentially, the planet's odd orbit could be explained by hollows detected in its surface. Mercury is the innermost planet in the solar system - and it would make sense for the tiny planet to be 'tidally locked' to the sun, with one 'day' being the same as the planet's 'year'. But it isn't - and scientists have been puzzled as to why . Nasa's messenger spacecraft is currently in orbit around the planet, and has already provided far 'fuller' scans of the surface, than the last visitor, Mariner 10, which flew past in 1975. Mariner 10 only captured partial views of the surface. Correia and her colleagues are hopeful that Messenger, which continues to orbit the planet, will unearth a likely crater that could explain why the planet orbits as it does. The Messenger probe captured the first 'full day' image of Mercury's surface earlier this year - could one of the impact craters shown be the reason the planet 'wobbles' round the sun?","Tiny planet should be 'tidally locked' to sun, say scientists - with one face permanently facing inwardsm, like our Moon .

"Last updated at 6:57 PM on 13th December 2011 . Duncan McAlpine (pictured) drove his car at a group of 'beer-drinking dossers', as he called them, seriously inuring Terry Canavan . A teenager who harboured a deep-seated hatred of the lower classes has been jailed for two years after he drove his van into a man drinking outside a pub. Duncan McAlpine, 19, claimed he wanted simply to frighten the pub patrons, whom he described as beer-drinking football-watching 'dossers', after two of them ‘humiliated’ him by intervening in an argument with his girlfriend, the court was told. But his van slammed into 49-year-old Terry Canavan, who was flung across the street, leaving him with 'life-changing injuries’. And when he called 999, McAlpine, who was living opposite the pub in Old Woking, Surrey, at the time, told police: 'I look out the window every day and they’re standing there with their pints of Stella and their packets of pork scratchings watching the football - it’s all they do. It’s like they are a bunch of dossers.' Wendy Cottee, prosecuting, said he ‘looked down on these sort of people’ and the unpleasant comments were indicative of his attitude. Jailing him, at Guildford Crown Court, Judge Peter Moss told him: 'What you did was unforgiveable. No sentence I can impose can right the wrong you have done to Mr Canavan - which is very severe.' He said McAlpine, whose father Ian runs one of the UK’s leading equestrian centres, had used his van as a weapon and driven it at the crowded pub 'with appalling consequences' to the victim who just happened to be in the way. Mr Canavan has been left without a sense of taste or smell and is deaf in one ear, and is unable to work as a result of the injuries he had sustained. He also sustained a fractured cheek and experienced problems with his vision. Judge Moss told McAlpine: 'He has suffered very seriously at your hands.' The court was told the incident happened on May 7 this year, when Mr Canavan and his friend Ben Ryan intervened after witnessing what they thought was the defendant assaulting his pregnant partner Vicky Brackley, outside the Kingfield Arms pub in Old Woking. In the process McAlpine was knocked to the ground and made to look foolish with the pub customers laughing at him, the court heard. McAlpine, who said he suffered from spinal problems from a young age and feared assault in case it would leave him paralysed, said the incident had brought back memories of being bullied as a child. Jurors were told that McAlpine, who . suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome, was bullied so often that he . frequently had to change schools, leaving him with a fear of . humiliation. Duncan McAlpine reacted after two men intervened in what they believed was a fight with his girlfriend Vicky Brackley (pictured) And it was this that led to him ‘completely losing control’ when he saw what he regarded as 'nasty working men' escorting his partner away. 'He was blinded by rage,' Ms Cottee said. The situation was not helped by the hatred he felt for drinkers at the Kingfield Arms. Ms Cottee told the court: 'The defendant looked down on these sort of people.' She said it was the defendant’s desire to get his own back which led to him driving his van at the patrons of the Kingfield Arms with such appalling consequences. She added that if McAlpine’s vehicle had ploughed into the pub or the party of customers drinking outside the building, the outcome could have been unimaginable. 'It would have been a massacre.’ McAlpine admitted threatening to smash up cars belong to people at the pub. But he added: 'I never meant to hit anyone.' He said he had only driven his Ford Transit at the pub to frighten the customers there. 'I wanted to scare them. But Mr Canavan leapt in front of my van,' he said. Ms Cottee added, however, that there was evidence that McAlpine’s vehicle had mounted the pavement by the pub. Mr Canavan was unconscious for two weeks after being hit by the defendant’s van and suffered a fractured skull which caused internal bleeding into his brain, the court was told. In evidence to the court, the defendant’s mother Ms Annee Charland described her son as a bright boy but someone who found it difficult to make friends of his own age. McAlpine, whose father runs Painshill Farm Stables in Cranleigh, Surrey, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily harm. The defendant had been acquitted by a jury after a week-long trial of a separate charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent - an allegation which he had denied. But Judge Moss said the offences which McAlpine had admitted were serious enough. After studying reports on the defendant, the judge described him as a 'volatile' young man. 'His views on the world are very ego-centric. He finds it very difficult to see things from the point of view of other people,' said Judge Moss. He added that it was time that the defendant 'grew up' instead of trying to shelter behind his undoubted psychological difficulties. David Castle, defending, said his client had found life on remand in custody very tough indeed. 'He has been subject to bullying. He was beaten up and spent two days in the infirmary,' he said. Referring to the jail term that McAlpine faced, Mr Castle said: 'It’s a sentence that he’s going to find extremely difficult to serve.' McAlpine was also banned from driving for 18 months.","Duncan McAlpine claimed he wanted simply to frighten pub patrons .

Shoppers and passers-by expecting to see something traditional in the window of Peckhams delicatessen, in the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh, have been shocked to see an altogether more surreal interpretation of the Twelve Days Of Christmas. Taxidermy, moving dolls and live animals have been used to create the festive window display - and includes a bizarre inclusion of eight maids-a-milking with lambs at their bare breasts. Controversial: The elaborate window display in the delicatessen pays homage to the 18th century carol The Twelve Days Of Christmas . The window display was created by Scottish gin company Hendrick’s and is titled ‘The Hendrick’s 13th Day of Christmas' - a homage to the 18th century James Haliwell carol. Passers-by thought the images of the maids in the display were ‘a bit tasteless.’ But the man behind the artwork defended said though it might cause some controversy, it was ‘very beautiful'. Three live giant snails with painted shells fill in for the three French hens in the display. The creatures have to be fed lettuce by Peckham’s staff every morning. A lone partridge also sits in a cucumber plant, an ingredient of Hendrick’s gin. Eight mocked-up photographs show young women suckling lambs. David Piper, curator and Hendrick’s ‘commander of special operations,’ said: 'We wanted to do something about the 12 days of Christmas and Hendrick’s always likes to do things in as unusual a way as possible. 'A bit tasteless': The display included bizarre images of bare-breasted maids-a-milking, suckling lambs . 'The carol is very confusing anyway, if your true love had given you a partridge and doves and 10 lords a leaping, your true love is a bit weird. 'You’re going to be pretty confused and on the morning of the 13th day you’ll be dreading what they give you next.' He continued: 'People have reacted to it with everything from bafflement to joyous wonder to a little bit of shock., usually at the maids-a-milking. 'It might cause a little bit of controversy, but we feel the piece is actually very beautiful.' The display will be taken down at the New Year, but there are plans for it to be moved to the Little Shop of Horrors in London, a museum of strange objects including winged cats and shrunken heads. Passers-by reacted with surprise at seeing the display appear in the genteel streets of Bruntsfield. Mum Fiona Mason, 34, from the area, said: 'The maids one is a bit weird. 'The rest of it’s really great, I love the haggis and the lords-a-leaping, but I think the whole eight-maids-a-milking thing is about a maid milking a cow, not breastfeeding a sheep. 'It’s a bit tasteless when there are small children going past.' Patricia scales, 60, from the West End of Edinburgh said the display might raise eyebrows in the city. She said: 'It’s a really interesting display, but I can imagine a few of the Morningside ladies having a heart attack when they see it!' The creation was built into the shop window overnight and unveiled on Thursday morning. Shop manager Lyndsey Hogg said: 'Overall the reaction has been positive. 'Peckham’s is full of lots of interesting and unusual products and this ties in as being something quirky and modern.' Eight artists were involved in creating the piece, including puppetmakers, an undersea diver and a surrealist performer.","Taxidermy, moving dolls and live animals used in 'bizarre' interpretation of the Twelve Days Of Christmas .

A young mother was stabbed to death after she complained about thumping music from a party, it was claimed yesterday. Emma Jones, 30, walked to a block of flats opposite her home at around 2am to ask partygoers to turn the music down. During a heated argument Miss Jones was allegedly stabbed and collapsed on the floor. Paramedics rushed to the flat and battled to save her but she died from massive blood loss. Yesterday residents of the North . Wales village of Penygroes claimed Miss Jones, whose five-year-old son, . Llyr, has learning difficulties, had repeatedly asked revellers to turn . down the music. She told them they were ‘keeping half the neighbourhood . awake’. One resident said: ‘To be stabbed to . death for simply asking someone to turn down the music at a house party . is shocking and awful. ‘You would think that any decent person would have apologised and abided by the request, especially at two in the morning. ‘She did such a good job with her son . as he suffers from severe learning difficulties – she was totally . dedicated to him. Everyone is in total shock over this tragic death.’ Miss Jones was popular in the village . a few miles from  Carnarvon, and dozens of friends and residents have . posted tributes online. One said: ‘You are loved so much. I . feel like a part of my soul has gone. You touched so many hearts. You . were always there for many of us.’ The incident happened in the early . hours of Saturday. Annoyed at being kept awake, Miss  Jones went over to . the flats  and asked revellers to turn down the music. A resident said: ‘There was an almighty row. When the ambulance got to the flat there was nothing paramedics could do.’ Miss Jones’s son is believed to have . been staying with his grandparents, who live nearby. The death came as . Penygroes was due to hold a Christmas fair, with preparations for the . community event filmed for the Welsh language channel S4C. Elwyn Jones Griffith, a councillor, said: ‘The whole village is in shock. Nothing like this has happened before.’ Resident Jean Owen added: ‘It’s a terrible thing to happen in a village like this. ‘We know the families, we know the grandparents, both sides of the families. It’s terrible that such a thing can happen.’ Mrs Owen described Miss Jones as ‘a lovely young lady’. Yesterday . North Wales Police said in a statement: ‘The  police have trained . family liaison officers supporting the family of the deceased. Crime scene: Emma Jones' family lay flowers outside her flat . Community in mourning: Tributes to Emma, left, were placed near the scene of her untimely death . ‘Police can now confirm that Emma died as a result of a stab wound she received.’ Last night Alwen Eluned Jones, 23, from the nearby village of Llanllyfni was charged with murder. She appeared before magistrates today and was remanded in custody. Police said a man and woman had been released on bail without charge.

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 9:48 AM on 9th December 2011 . Incredible live images of a chamber maid reporting Dominique Strauss-Kahn for alleged attempted rape were today broadcast on French television. The CCTV images taken inside New York's Sofitel hotel show Nafissatou Diallo, 32, some 40 minutes after performing oral sex on the 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund boss. Pictures shot inside the Times Square hotel on May 14th shows a clearly shocked Ms Diallo gesticulating wildly as she tells colleagues about what happened. Claim: Nafissatou Diallo can be seen in a Sofitel hotel corridor gesticulating with a colleague after the alleged rape . In turn, other images show Mr Strauss-Kahn checking out of the hotel, and heading off for lunch with his daughter in a yellow cab. The hotel released the images through French TV news channel BFMTV because they want to put an end to conspiracy theories claiming Mr Strauss Kahn was set up by French government agents because he wanted to be the country’s next Socialist president. Part of the footage shows two male hotel workers appearing to take part in some kind of 'victory dance' before high-fiving each other in a 13-second segment. It is not clear why the hotel workers celebrate together, but reports of the episode fuelled speculation that Strauss-Kahn was set up by his political enemies. U.S. investigative journalist Edward Epstein had claimed their ‘celebration’ lasted some three minutes, and made it look as though they had executed a trap to perfection. In fact the tapes show that the ‘victory dance’ lasted less than 10 seconds, with the hotel staff allegedly celebrating a ‘sporting result’, according to a spokesman for the Sofitel. Later in the footage two burly male hotel workers can be seen high-fiving during a 'victory dance', sparking rumours DSK had been set up by political rivals . The male hotel staff 'celebrate' for 13 seconds, descrediting claims by a U.S. investigative journalist they had embraced for three minutes . Write caption here . Mr Epstein has since admitted a ‘mistake’, with the New York Review of Books, which originally published his conspiracy theory, publishing a correction. Henri Leclerc, a lawyer for Mr Strauss-Kahn, admitted today: ‘I have no proof that there is a conspiracy. I have no evidence that there is a conspiracy.’ Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested by U.S. police on May 14th and imprisoned, but after a lengthy legal process was finally cleared and returned home to Paris. He admitted having a sexual encounter with Diallo, but said it was consensual. Back in France, Mr Strauss-Kahn was accused by writer Tristane Banon, now 32, of trying to rape her in 2001, but the statute of time limitations on the case meant it could not be reopened. The alleged rape happened at the Sofitel Hotel in New York's Times Square in May . Last week, 62-year-old Mr Strauss-Kahn claimed that his 'uninhibited' sex life cost him his chance to become president. He is at the centre of a judicial inquiry into a vice-girl ring operating out of a hotel in Lille, northern France. He has admitted attending 'sex parties' but said: 'I have a horror of prostitution and pimping. Can you imagine the damage caused to my wife, our children?' At the weekend, France’s Interior Minister Claude Gueant revealed that Mr Strauss-Kahn was stopped by police in the Bois de Boulogne, a notorious red light area after dark, five years ago. Mr Gueant also rubbished conspiracy theories linking President Nicolas Sarkozy with a bid to undermine his political rival.","CCTV also shows hotel workers performing 'victory dance' fuelling claims DSK was set up .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 2:46 PM on 12th December 2011 . A former soldier is facing his last Christmas with his children after being refused a life-prolonging cancer drug because he lives in the wrong town. Mark Bannister’s long battle with cancer has culminated in a fight for the drug Avastin which his consultant said could give him vital time with his daughter Sophie, six, and son Thomas, five. But NHS bosses have refused to fund the medicine, even though it is readily available to patients just 15 miles from where Mr Bannister lives in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. 'They are playing God': Mark Bannister, pictured with his wife Karen with their children Sophie and Thomas, has been denied access to the drug Avastin to treat his brain cancer . The 37-year-old was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003. He was told in August this year that his cancer had spread and that Avastin, which costs £21,000 for a . ten-month course, was his last hope. His doctor gave him just 12 months to live. The former private, who completed . tours in Northern Ireland and Bosnia during nine years with the Army, . said: 'I was hoping the drug would help me see another couple of . Christmases. 'I love my . family to bits and want to be able to spend as much time as I can with . them. It wouldn’t be a cure, but it would be the best thing to prolong . my life. 'This Christmas we are just going to try and make as many memories as we can as it will probably be my last one.' Soldier: Mr Bannister completed tours in Northern Ireland and Bosnia during nine years with the Army . His wife Karen added: 'It’s devastating that they haven’t said yes to this treatment, we just can’t understand it. 'It should just be that everyone is given the same access to treatment regardless of where they live. 'It just seems so unfair that if we lived in Scunthorpe, which is only 15 miles away, we would get it.' Mr Bannister was first diagnosed with a benign tumour in 2003 when he was 29, which was removed through open brain surgery. Doctors . told the couple that the tumour would probably return and routine scans . in 2006 found the tumour had come back - only this time it was . malignant. Mr Bannister underwent another operation to remove it, followed by six months of radiotherapy. Then . in January 2010, another tumour was discovered and further open brain . surgery carried out, followed by nine months of chemotherapy. Despite all the treatment, the tumour . returned aggressively in January this year and it was discovered in . August that further chemotherapy treatment had not worked. It . was at that point Mr Bannister said his consultant suggested Avastin, a . tumour-starving therapy that works by preventing the blood vessels . reaching the tumour. But letters to the Cancer Drugs Fund as well as East Midlands Specialised Commissioning Group were knocked back. The drug is not currently 'readily approved' as a treatment by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which means funding for it sits with the Cancer Drugs Fund. NHS Lincolnshire said decisions to . fund treatments are based on clear clinical evidence, . cost-effectiveness, the benefit to patient and consideration of national . guidance. Avastin works by preventing the blood vessels reaching the tumour. The drug is Mr Bannister's last hope . A spokesman . from EMSCG said: 'We were sorry to hear about this patient’s individual . circumstances. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment further on . individual cases. 'Currently, . Avastin is not readily approved by Nice guidance and therefore funding . for treatment that falls outside of Nice sits with Cancer Drugs Fund. 'Decisions about whether to fund drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund are made solely by cancer specialists.' NHS East Midlands does not fund Avastin for brain cancer patients, but NHS Yorkshire and the Humber does. This . means it is available for patients just 15 miles away in Scunthorpe, . and in Sheffield where Mark had all of his cancer treatment, but not in . Gainsborough. Mr Bannister said: 'I’m just so angry that people can play with your life by saying who can and can’t have treatment. 'They are playing God.' With . an uncertain future ahead of them, Mr and Mrs Bannister renewed their . vows last month on their tenth wedding anniversary.","Mark Bannister, 37, has been denied access to the drug Avastin which his doctor said could prolong his life .

A drunken row over the attractiveness of X Factor runner-up Rebecca Ferguson (pictured) led to a man having boiling water poured over him and part of his ear bitten off . Two men who burned and mutilated a . semi-conscious man after they reportedly argued over last year’s X . Factor final were jailed today. Lee Stynes, 28, and Mathew . Gannaway-Pitts, 18, subjected Brian Wade to a vicious attack in which . part of one of his ears was severed and his face scalded with boiling . water from a kettle. The kettle was then used to bludgeon him, hours after the three had . watched an episode of the reality talent contest. It has been reported the men, who . had been drinking heavily, earlier argued over finalist Rebecca . Ferguson, who came second to winner Matt Cardle during the 2010 final, . discussing whether she would win and whether she was likely to sleep . with any of the three of them. The court heard Wade, aged in his . 40s, was left with a disfigured ear and skin pigmentation on his head . after the attack, which had also left him in fear of Stynes and worsened . his epilepsy. Paranoid schizophrenic Stynes, who had . a past history of violence, was jailed indefinitely for public . protection at Exeter Crown Court today. The court heard that he . jumped on Mr Wade, who was almost unconscious, and shouted to . Garraway-Pitts: 'Watch this, I’m going to bite the b*****d’s ear off.' The court heard he had 42 . previous convictions, including two for threatening to bite people’s . noses off and one for throwing boiling water at someone. Judge Erik Salomonsen told the men: 'Your victim was falling asleep, his speech was slurred and you set upon him. Regardless of who started it, you have been involved in a horrific attack.' Lee Stynes, 28, and Mathew Gannaway-Pitts, 18, admitted the charge at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) Stynes, of no fixed abode, pleaded . guilty to GBH with intent on October 10, with police saying after the . court appearance that they had argued over the X Factor. He will serve a . minimum of three years and four-and-a-half months but will only be . released when he is deemed not to be a danger to the public. As he was led away, he said 'Cheers, guv' to the judge. Gannaway-Pitts, also of no fixed . abode, who was 17 at the time of the attack on December 18 last year, . admitted GBH at the earlier hearing and was sentenced to 16 months. The . court heard he 'hero-worshipped' the older man and had started the . beating before Stynes joined in. The court heard that the two . defendants were frequent visitors to Mr Wade’s flat in Exeter, the . location of the attack, where they went to drink and take drugs. On the night of December 17 last year . the three of them, along with Mr Stynes’ girlfriend and another man had . been drinking in the flat which was such a mess because of Wade’s . 'hoarding' that he slept in the lounge. Finalist: Rebecca Ferguson with Cheryl Cole (centre) and Cher Lloyd (left) in the X Factor last year . Prosecutor Terry Holder said that they . had at some point watched an episode of X Factor which they previously . recorded, before carrying on drinking. Stynes, his girlfriend and . Gannaway-Pitt then left to go to the home of the younger man’s father, . but returned after failing to get in. 'The matter seems to have been started by Gannaway-Pitt showing off,' Mr Holder said. 'He started punching Mr Wade, who was by then rather zombie-like.' Stynes joined in, before running into . the kitchen to get the kettle of boiling water, which he said, falsely, . also contained sugar - which burns badly when it contacts with skin. He . came in and poured it over his 'defenceless' victim, saying 'take that . you bastard'. Gannaway-Pitt then picked up the . kettle and beat Mr Wade so severely he smashed the kettle. It was then . that Stynes bit off part of Mr Wade’s ear. The court heard that the . younger man stole the piece of ear and later showed it to his . girlfriend, boasting that he had bitten it off himself. Mark Jackson, defending Stynes, said . his client had not premeditated the attack but said he was previously . told that Wade had committed a sexual assault on his girlfriend. He said his client had been abused as a . child and 'continued to hear voices', turning to drink and drugs to . cope with an illness that left him quick to anger. Stynes once attempted . to get himself admitted to a psychiatric unit and set himself on fire . when he was refused, Mr Jackson said. 'At 28 he is a relatively young man. He has had an awful life so far,' he said. 'He has done what he can to get help from authorities. He will take it as and when it is offered.' Gannaway-Pitts was ordered to serve 16 . months but because he had served almost a year on remand he was . released immediately on licence.","Victim had boiling water poured over him and part of his ear bit off .

A pocketbook with a mobile phone and ID belonging to a missing prostitute who sparked the ‘Craigslist Ripper’ investigation has been found. Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, went missing in May 2010 on Long Island in New York. A pair of jeans and shoes were also found. Her remains have still not been located 18 months on - but the search has so far helped officers make the gruesome discoveries of 10 other bodies. Prostitute: Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, went missing in May 2010 after last being seen at a home on Long Island in New York . ‘I just don’t know what to think right now,’ her mother Mari Gilbert told the New York Post. ‘You try to just hold out hope of some kind.’ Police are not linking her to the other 10 people, some of whom advertised as escorts on Craigslist, believed to have been murdered by a serial killer. But search teams have focussed on marshland because they thought damage from Tropical Storm Irene may have unearthed new evidence. Mari Gilbert said she does not think her daughter drowned accidentally, because she could not swim and never went near water. All dead: The bodies of Amber Lynn Costello (top left), Megan Waterman (top right), Melissa Barthelemy (bottom left) and Maureen Brainer-Barnes were found . ‘I don’t buy the drowning theory for a second,’ she told the New York Post. 'She would never have gone close to any sort of water.’ 'I just don’t know what to think right now. You try to just hold out hope of some kind' Mari Gilbert . Michael Pak was her driver on the night she went missing and claims the latest finding suggests she could have fallen into the water herself, if her phone or wallet was found still in her purse. ‘Shannan always wanted to be famous - and now she is famous,’ Mr Pak, of Jersey City, told the New York Post. Meanwhile, it was claimed last week the serial killer may have learnt how to cover his tracks by watching television crime dramas like CSI. Also discovered: In March police found the head and forearm of 20-year-old Jessica Taylor whose torso had been found in 2003, also on Long Island . An investigation officer said a familiarity with such shows could explain how he has avoided capture and delayed the identification of his victims. Police are looking for a single killer . for the deaths of eight women, a man and a baby whose remains have been . found over the past year.

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 10:25 AM on 9th December 2011 . Road crash deaths in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level since 1949 - despite Americas driving more, figures have revealed. The U.S. Department of Transportation said highway deaths hit a six decade low of 32,885 in 2010. That's a 2.9 per cent drop from 2009 even though Americans drove three trillion miles in 2010 - almost 46 billion more miles than in 2009. Road deaths have fallen, according to new figures. Here police and ambulance services in Clearwater, Florida, attend the scene of an accident . Safer: A car accident on a highway, John F Kennedy Causeway, in Miami, Florida . However, figures also showed texting while driving increased 50 per . cent last year as two out of 10 drivers say they've sent text messages . or emails while behind the wheel. The jump comes despite a rush by . states to ban the practice amid safety concerns about diverting drivers' focus away from the road. Drivers were using Web-capable smart . phones or cell phones to view travel directions, check e-mails or . calendar appointments, or surf the Internet, manual dialing, playing . hand-held games, and holding phones in front of their faces. Overall, the activity increased to 0.9 per cent of drivers, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year. DoT secretary Ray LaHood . said: 'While we have more work to do to continue to protect American . motorists, these numbers show we're making historic progress when it . comes to improving safety on our nation's roadways.' Industry representatives cited . several contributing factors for the drop, such as graduated license . programs for young drivers, hands-free cell phone laws and stiffer drunk . driving penalties. Ignorance of youth: The rate of drivers that text jumps dramatically when looking solely at people between the ages of 21 and 24 . Warnings: The number of driver fatalities actually dropped even though more people are texting and more people are driving longer . Jake Nelson, director of traffic . safety advocacy and research at AAA, said: 'Safer vehicles, safer roads . and safer drivers as a result of traffic-safety policies that have been . implemented over the last few years are certainly contributors. 'It's the combination of all these factors that have given us the results we're seeing today.' But Mr Nelson warned: 'Distracted driving has become a much . bigger issue in the last few years. 'The measure . they'll now report will be a better indicator of the true impact . distractions have on traffic crashes. 'The challenge is to identify the . areas where we're making the greatest gains and leveraging those to see . the numbers drop even further.' Figures showed deaths in crashes involving drunk . drivers dropped 4.9 per cent in 2010, resulting in 10,228 fatalities . compared to 10,759 in 2009. Deaths among young drivers aged 16 to 20 have also dropped 39 per cent over the last five years, compared to a 23 . per cent drop in the general population. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Strickland said: 'Even . as we celebrate the incredible gains we're making in reducing traffic . fatalities, we recognise our responsibility to improve our understanding . of the dangers that continue to threaten drivers and passengers.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 3:22 PM on 12th December 2011 . Iranian experts are planning to 'reverse engineer' the U.S. drone captured by its armed forces in a bid to recover data and mass-produce a superior version of the aircraft. Tehran has been flaunting the capture of the downed U.S. drone which 'violated Iran airspace', with experts saying the drone could now be reproduced through reverse engineering. Gen Hossein Salami, deputy head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, said on state television that the violation of Iran's airspace by the U.S. drone was a 'hostile act' and warned of a 'bigger' response. Keeping it: Iran says it will not return the US RQ-170 Sentinel . high-altitude reconnaissance drone that crashed in Iran earlier this month . Officials in Iran even believe they can 'mass produce' the captured bat-winged stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel and build a 'superior' version following its crash on December 4. Parviz Sorouri, the head of Iran's parliamentary national security committee, said today: 'Our next action will be to reverse-engineer the aircraft. 'In the near future, we will be able to mass produce it ... Iranian engineers will soon build an aircraft superior to the American [drone] using reverse engineering.' Iranian officials say a Revolutionary Guards cyber-warfare unit hacked the aircraft's flight controls. Sorouri said Iran experts were in the 'final stages of cracking (the drone's) code'. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him . He also denied accusations from the U.S. that Iran didn't have the technology to replicate the drone, and that it would only be able to do so with Russian of Chinese help. He added: 'we will not need Russian or Chinese cooperation' to copy the drone. 'They will definitely not be involved. This great defensive capability is reserved for us, and we are not ready to share it with others. 'We will use this capability as a deterrence. And I doubt the Islamic republic would share this technology with other countries.' Iranian television broadcast video . last Thursday of Iranian military officials inspecting what it . identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel drone. Gen . Salami called its capture a victory for Iran and a defeat for the U.S. in a complicated intelligence and technological battle. 'Iran is among the few countries that possesses the most modern technology in the field of pilotless drones. The technology gap between Iran and the US is not much,' he said. Worries: U.S. officials are concerned about the Iranians potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to China or Russia . Military officials: These images give more credence to Iran's claims of having the highly-sensitive drone . Broke down: US officials say Iran had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth. They contend it simply malfunctioned . Officers in the Guard, Iran's most powerful military force, had previously claimed that the country's armed forces brought down the surveillance aircraft with an electronic ambush, causing minimum damage to the drone. American officials have said that US intelligence assessments indicate that Iran neither shot the drone down, nor used electronic or cybertechnology to force it from the sky. They contend the drone malfunctioned. The officials had spoken anonymously in order to discuss the classified program. But Gen Salami refused to provide more details of Iran's claim to have captured the CIA-operated aircraft. 'A party that wins in an intelligence battle doesn't reveal its methods. We can't elaborate on the methods we employed to intercept, control, discover and bring down the pilotless plane,' he said. The European Union 'definitely' will not impose sanctions on OPEC member Iran's oil exports because such a measure would harm the global crude market, Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi said on Sunday. EU leaders called on Friday for more sanctions against Iran by the end of January, in an effort to increase pressure on Tehran over its disputed nuclear program. 'Our policy is sustainable supply of oil to Europe... Iran is a major oil producer and any sanctions on our oil export would harm the global market,' Qasemi told a news conference.

She has starred in cult movies, Woody Allen intrigues and BBC sitcoms. But for 'Face of the Eighties' actress Lysette Anthony, her most dramatic role yet came yesterday in the more banal surroundings of Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court. The court in North London heard a complicated tale of alleged affairs, domestic violence, a relationship breakdown, and an apparent suicide attempt. Miss Anthony’s long-term partner, . BAFTA-nominated film composer Simon Boswell, was facing a charge of . assault after the actress, 48, claimed the father of her young son had . punched and slapped her during an argument about an alleged affair she’d . had with one of their mutual friends. In . emotional scenes she told the court how their nine-year relationship . had broken down, and that on April 9 Mr Boswell, 54, had come home in a . ‘black mood’, they had argued about the alleged affair before he pinned . her on the sofa and attacked her. In evidence Ms Anthony, 48, had said: . 'The relationship had broken down two years earlier but we kept trying . to keep things better for our son. 'That evening I came down stairs from putting my son to bed and Simon was in a very black mood. 'He was in a really really dangerous mood and it started about money and . the house and how little he would give us. It was getting heated and I . was frightened. 'He would pick me up and throw me down to the ground. At this point he . would leave and that would be that but he came back and sat on the sofa. 'And foolishly maybe because I was accustomed to these activities I sat . on the sofa with him.' She said when Boswell attacked her he threatened . to reduce the amount she would get from the joint sale of their home. 'He then used his weight against me, screaming 'Did you like it?' and . when I wouldn't answer he said - 'Right that's £100,000 off' - and again . 'Did you like it? - 'Ok that's £150,000 off. Victory: Simon Boswell leaves court after being found not guilty . 'And then I replied: 'Yes I loved it' and he started punching and slapping me repeatedly. 'I tried to get him off at which point he flipped me over and started . dragging me and I am desperately trying to hang onto the sofa. 'I kicked him hard but he didn't stop until my son came down saying 'stop, stop'. 'My child has memories no child should. Thank god he came down.' Lysette Anthony pictured with her long-term partner, BAFTA-nominated film composer Simon Boswell at the premiere of Mr Father's Den . But then Mr Boswell gave the court an entirely different version of events that followed a row over money when the actress allegedly tried to climb out of a window of their £1.7million North London home, in an apparent suicide attempt. Boswell told the court: 'The next morning we had a heated discussion about money, it was always about money. 'There was this house she wanted but it was going up and up - it had become too much and I wanted to discuss it with her. 'She was angry because it was unaffordable. Ms Anthony became hysterical. Actress Lysette Anthony: She has appeared in the BBC's Three Up, Two Down and Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives . 'She ran to one window in our bedroom on the top floor and she put one . leg and her head outside. I was terrified and I pulled her back in. 'She then ran to the window in the bathroom and did the same thing straddling the windowsill. I managed to drag her back in. 'I was preventing her from committing suicide. She was screaming and . very volatile. I thought she was going to jump - it was distinct . possibility. Lysette Anthony: Her claims were dismissed . 'She then grabbed a wine glass, which was on the side of the bath, smashed it and began to draw it across her wrists. 'I said - 'For Christ's sake you have a son what are you doing?' And she . threw it at me and collapsed sobbing.' Boswell then claims things . calmed down between them and they had even shared a 'joke about having . sex' on a trip they were to take to a film festival in Brussels. He said she was 'driven by insecurity and jealousy' in bringing the assault charge to court. Following Mr Boswell’s evidence, Miss Anthony changed her mind on the date of the alleged incident. Mr Boswell’s defence barrister then applied for the case to be dismissed and the three magistrates duly found Mr Boswell not guilty of assault. Magistrate Anthony Butler, threw out the . case and said: 'We would expect the crown to clarify the date prior to . the trial date.' Former model Miss Anthony, has appeared in the BBC’s Three Up, Two Down and Woody Allen’s Husbands And Wives. Mr Boswell has been BAFTA-nominated for his film scores, worked with Elton John and Dolly Parton, and the wealthy couple lived in a four-storey London townhouse in north London. But the wheels started to come off their relationship two years ago when Miss Anthony allegedly had an affair with one of their mutual friends. They had tried to repair things for the sake of their seven-year-old son Jimi, but eventually Mr Boswell had moved out to a studio flat where he did much of his composing. They decided to separate and sell the . family home, but Mr Boswell still visited regularly to see Jimi and . read him a bedtime story. But things became acrimonious as they argued about how much each side would get from the proceeds of the house. Mr Boswell will not face any further charges following yesterday's ruling. Miss Anthony was ordered to pay defence costs and was denied a restraining order against Mr Boswell. Outside court Mr Boswell gave a thumbs up sign and said: ‘The verdict speaks for itself.’",Her partner Simon Boswell found not guilty of assault .

A BBC producer accused of groping a paramedic claims he was not in control of his actions – because he was suffering from a bad reaction to seafood at the time, a court heard. Friends called an ambulance for James Whitmarsh, 41, when he began answering questions with the word ‘Honk’ after a seafood starter at a restaurant in London. As he was being treated, he grabbed the female paramedic’s bottom and groped her between her legs. Whitmarsh claims he was not responsible for his actions after the Christmas meal. As he was being treated in the back of . the vehicle he grabbed the paramedic’s bottom and groped her between . her legs, the court heard. Whitmarsh denies sexually assaulting the medic, claiming he was not responsible for his actions after the Christmas meal. Prosecutor . Victoria Ailes told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Put very shortly what James . Whitmarsh is accused of is sexually assaulting a paramedic who was . treating him in an ambulance by touching her through her clothing. ‘You . may be wondering what the defence might be and, put very shortly again, . and you will hear a great deal more about this, the defence is that . this is not something that James Whitmarsh did deliberately at all, his . actions were not under his control because he was having a bad reaction . or suffering from a toxin as a result of some fish or seafood he ate for . dinner.’ Ms Ailes told the jury Whitmarsh had . gone out with friends on December 13 and after a drink had gone for a . meal at a restaurant near Covent Garden. She said: ‘There were five of them in the party and they all had drinks and they went out for dinner. Southwark Crown Court, pictured, heard Whitmarsh is accused of is sexually assaulting a paramedic who was treating him in an ambulance . ‘In the course of the trial you will want to pay close attention to the evidence about how much alcohol was drunk and the extent to which that might provide and explanation for what happened. ‘In outline it seems that he James . Whitmarsh, even by his own admission, had a pint of lager before the . party went for dinner and that Prosecco, white wine and red wine were . drunk with dinner. ‘There were also oysters and smoked salmon which were consumed as part of the starter.’ The . prosecutor said that during the course of the dinner Whitmarsh’s . friends became concerned at the way he was behaving and called an . ambulance. Mr Whitmarsh ate oysters and smoked salmon as a starter a court heard . She said: ‘He was unsteady on his feet. He was swinging his arms around and when he was asked how he was he intermittently answered them with wither ‘Yes’, ‘No’, or ‘Honk’. ‘The conclusion of the group was that he was drunk. ‘When he had been in the ambulance and under the care of the paramedics for some time, around fifteen minutes, one of the paramedics had her back to him. ‘In the course of his treatment he reached out towards her lower body.' He then sexually assaulted her, the court was told. The paramedic and her colleague, an emergency medical technician, said Whitmarsh had been acting strangely when they arrived at Covent Garden station. Before getting into the ambulance, the paramedic said Whitmarsh was 'smirking a lot and found the situation to be funny.' When initially asked some questions about his conditions, he refused to answer and 'just smirked.' The paramedic said when he did speak all he would do was 'Honk' and that as he was getting into the ambulance he had reached out to her colleague to grab her chest. Whitmarsh had then tried to grab her chest area and groin whilst she was doing routine medical checks, the paramedic said. It was when she was then leaning over to a the ECG machine that the BBC employee sexually assaulted the paramedic with an open hand. 'I felt his hand reach underneath and grab me. I could feel his fingers, so I wouldn't call his touch soft. His hand was grabbing at me as he groped, she said. Also giving evidence, the medical technician said that she had warned Whitmarsh about his behaviour. 'If you touch us, we will have to involve the police. You are making life changing decisions here,' she said. According to Whitmarsh’s website he has worked as a new media producer since 1994 and is currently working for BBC Radio in London. Whitmarsh, from Devizes, Wiltshire, denies sexual assault. The trial continues.","Friends called an ambulance after he became 'unsteady' after seafood starter .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:27 PM on 12th December 2011 . Its tear-jerking advert, featuring a boy who can't wait to give his parents a Christmas present, struck a chord with the British public. Now it appears to have struck gold for John Lewis after the department store today announced record-breaking sales for last week. The retail giant reported takings of £123.5million, - the most it has ever taken in a single week. This represents a rise of 2 per cent on like-for-like sales from last year. Bucking the trend: Despite the gloomy outlook for the rest of the high street, John Lewis said last week had been its best ever . Is this little guy to thank? The department store's tear-jerking festive advert, starring Lewis McGowan, has no doubt gone some way to driving sales . Last week's figures were up 8.7 per cent on the previous week's, to buck a general downward . trend elsewhere on the high street. Overall UK retail sales figures for . December are not published until January, but November's figures were . 1.6 per cent lower on a like-for-like basis from November 2010, . according to the British Retail Consortium. Speaking to the Telegraph about the . rise, John Lewis MD, Andy Street, said: 'Who would have bet on that at . the end of October, given all the doom and gloom? 'Last . year, we outperformed the market for the whole of 2010 by 10 per cent. We also . outperformed at Christmas 2009 so this looks like being the third . Christmas in a row where we will outperform.' The brand put the sharp rise down to the cold weather as coats and gloves were among the items to fly off the shelves. The department store is seen as . something of a retail bellwether for the high street. And this weekend . millions braved the cold to splurge £2billion in Britain's beleaguered . shops. Out in force...finally: Shoppers took to London's Oxford Street this weekend to snap up Christmas goods at slashed prices . Bargain hunters: In Manchester shoppers flooded the streets to snap up winter bargains, left, and piled into the city's Arndale Centre on Sunday, right . Nearly a third of people will ignore the economic turbulence and take on debt to finance their Christmas plans, a report warned today. A survey by YouGov on behalf of banking platform Intelligent Environments said 31 per cent of Britons will get through the festive period by taking out loans or by borrowing money from friends and family. Among that group of people, 58 per cent will spend more than average on their credit cards, 39 per cent will be overdrawn, 11 p er cent will borrow from friends and/or family and 6 per cent would borrow money via a personal loan, with some people doing more than one of the above. The research found that one in 10 Britons will lose control of their Christmas spending, even as another recession looms. Nearly half of the nation is in debt, with those aged between 25 to 34 struggling most with money. Jerry Mulle, a director at Intelligent Environments, said: 'Christmas is typically a cash-strapped time of the year but as harsher economic conditions start to bite, the number of people falling into debt or behind on their payments looks set to rise.' On Oxford Street and in . London's West End 2.2million shoppers shrugged off their financial woes . to spend £280million - £50million more than an average weekend. Perhaps they were enticed by a high street awash with bargains as many big-name brands slashed their stock by up to 70 per cent. 'Christmas has gone off with a bang this weekend,' reported Richard Dickinson, of traders' group the New West End Company to The Sun. It was the same picture of shopping . frenzy further north as Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), which runs 14 . malls including Manchester's Trafford Centre, reported that trade had . been brisk over the weekend. CSC's Peter Beagley told The Sun it had been a similar story in Glasgow's Braehead Centre. 'An army of shoppers were on the march,' he said. Back down south, more than 250,000 shoppers descended on the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, up 15 per cent on this time last year. Meanwhile shoppers in London racked up an average £180 each on computer games, toys and gadgets. However, at shopping emporium Selfridges, customers were snapping up iPads, Kindles and chocolates. Store director Meave Wall told The Sun: 'Customers are on a mission to buy.' However, a spokesman for the British Retail Consortium warned the weekend's surge may not have very much influence on yearly sales figures overall. 'Sales have been very slow for October and November,' the spokesman said. 'Potentially that means people were saving for December in those months but will tighten their belts again in January.' Queen of Shops Mary Portas is set to delivery her report into saving Britain's high streets tomorrow.","John Lewis reports sales rose by 2 per cent .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 12:08 AM on 14th December 2011 . A Labour MP's researcher has been accused of hypocrisy after a picture emerged of her giving a Hitler salute hours after she slammed a Tory MP for attending a party where guests chanted Nazi slogans. Charlotte Hale, who works for MP Emma Reynolds, said that Conservative Aidan Burley was 'disgraceful' for attending the stag do where he sat next to the stag who was wearing a Nazi SS uniform. However, her jibe on Twitter castigating the Tory now appears to be rather premature as a picture emerged of her next to a waxwork model of Adolf Hitler with her right arm thrust in the air. Salute: Charlotte Hale was accused of hypocrisy after this picture emerged of her giving the Nazi Salute on the Guido Fawkes blog . The picture of the 21-year-old Wolverhampton University war studies and politics student, taken at Madame Tussauds,  was leaked to the Guido Fawkes political blog. After Mr Burley was exposed, had written on Twitter: 'Story about the Cannock Chase TORY MP is disgraceful. He should step down.' She has worked for Ms Reynolds, the Wolverhampton East MP, as a constituency assistant since September last year. Ms Reynolds was first elected as an MP at the general election. SS officer: Mark Fournier, 34, gives a Nazi salute, which is illegal in France . The picture was apparently taken in April 2009. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in South Staffordshire District Council local elections this year and is chair of the Wolverhampton University Labour Students society. Conservative Aidan Burley was forced to apologise in a bid to save his career after attending a party with 12 Oxford-educated some of whom chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, Hitler’, . at a restaurant in a French ski resort. Labour called for David Cameron to sack Mr Burley, a senior aide to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, for bringing ‘shame on the country’. Mr . Burley, the MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was filmed by . journalists from the Mail on Sunday raising his glass before a fellow . guest made a speech saying: ‘Let’s raise a toast to Tom for organising . the stag do, and if we’re perfectly honest, to the ideology and thought . process of the Third Reich.’ Salute: Charlotte Hale was accused of hypocrisy after this picture emerged of her giving the Nazi Salute on the Guido Fawkes blog . The MP did not raise his glass during the speech. He did appear to pay the bill for the meal, although he later said he had paid only his share. Mr Burley said on Twitter: ‘Deeply regret inappropriate behaviour by some guests at stag party I attended and I am extremely sorry for any offence caused.’ Members of the stag party may face prosecution in France, where it is a crime to wear Nazi uniform in public except in a film or play. Fury: Aidan Burley, pictured here sat next to David Cameron in 2006, has faced calls to resign after he attended the party . Mr Burley, 32, has known the Prime Minister for at least five years and the pair ‘high five’ when they meet, according to Mr Burley’s friends on the stag night, who joked the MP was ‘the candidate for Berlin East’. The Nazi incident happened on December 3 in Restaurant La Fondue, an upmarket venue in the centre of the ski resort of Val Thorens. The MP, elected in 2010, sipped wine as one of the group taunted a waiter for being French. Neither the Labour Party nor Emma Reynolds' office had responded to a request for comment.","Charlotte Hale, 21, pictured next to giving Nazi salute next to waxwork Hitler .

"Criticism over veteran foreign correspondent's place on U.S. political show . Replaced GMA host Stephanopoulus for little more than a year . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:10 AM on 14th December 2011 . Veteran foreign correspondent Christiane . Amanpour is to be replaced as the host of political show This Week by the former presenter George Stephanopoulos. Amanpour, 53, is returning to CNN, where she began her career, as an international correspondent. Stephanopoulos, 50, will go back to presenting ABC's Sunday morning slot as well as carrying in his . current job for Good Morning America on the same network. On the way out: Christiane Amanpour is leaving This Week for CNN and GMA host George Stephanopoulos will step into the Sunday morning slot . However Amanpour is not entirely cutting ties with ABC. She enters an unusual . job-sharing role where she will become ABC's global affairs anchor, . contributing to prime-time shows on world news, while also being host of . a daily show on CNN International. Amanpour said: 'This role is groundbreaking, bold and very different. I am thrilled and honored.' Critics . wondered from the start whether the Iranian-born Amanpour, a seasoned . foreign correspondent for CNN, was a good fit for a panel show dominated . by American politics. She replaced Stephanopolous as host in August 2010. This Week hasn't budged from third place . behind NBC's Meet The Press and a resurgent Face The Nation on CBS, . with the ABC show down 1 per cent in ratings from last year. Mixing with the A-list: Christiane Amanpour with her husband Bloomberg executive James Rubin and Brad Pitt at the premier of Angelina Jolie's film In The Land Of Blood And Honey earlier this month in New York . Amanpour's reporting connections in the Middle East served ABC News particularly well during the Arab spring, and she scored an exclusive interview with then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. But the dawning of an American election year seemed to serve her competitors, old Washington hands Bob Schieffer at CBS and David Gregory at NBC, better. The Sunday morning show was much stronger . in the ratings when hosted by Stephanopoulos from 2002 to 2010. ABC moved him to New York and Good Morning America, which has done . well in the ratings by teaming him with Robin Roberts. Glamour shot: Sharing a laugh with Angelina Jolie during an interview for Nightline . Amanpour said she was looking forward to getting back out to do more international reporting and speaking to a worldwide audience on CNN, where she worked for more than two decades. Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide said: 'Christiane Amanpour has been synonymous with international reporting and with CNN for many years. 'We could not be happier that through this unique arrangement with ABC News her experience and global perspective are returning to a nightly news broadcast for our international audience.' Morning person: George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America, with host Lara Spencer, where he has been popular with viewers . Amanpour will be making occasional appearances on CNN's U.S. channel, spokeswoman Christa Robinson said. Meet the Press has averaged 2.92 million viewers every Sunday this season - down 5 per cent from last year. Face the Nation, at 2.86 million viewers, is up 6 per cent, ratings company Nielsen said. This Week has averaged 2.26 million viewers. CBS announced at the weekend that Face the Nation would expand to one hour next spring from its current half-hour format. Both Meet the Press and This Week air for one hour. Frontline: Amanpour pictured on assignment in Iran in 1997. She has said that she is looking forward to working on international stories again at CNN . Battle ready: An American Army officer adjusts the helmet of Amanpour during her stint on the frontline during the Gulf War in 1991 . Amanpour grew up in Iran but was educated at public school in England and later at the University of Rhode Island where she studied journalism. She made a name for herself in her first job at CNN covering the Iraq-Iran war and later gained a reputation for being fearless when she parachuted into conflict zones during assignments in the Gulf and Bosnian Wars. She has interviewed countless presidents and political leaders. Notably she has held an interview with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and was the first international journalist to interview then British prime minister Tony Blair in the wake of 9/11.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:49 PM on 14th December 2011 . It's a startling number: one in four women surveyed by the government say they were violently attacked by their husbands or boyfriends. The study - released Wednesday by the Centre for Disease Control -  also says that one in five U.S. women will be or have been raped in the course of their lifetime. The report showed that as many as 29million women said they've been victim of serious rage, including being choked, beaten, shot, stabbed, or punched. Shocking: A new study says that one in four women were violently abused by their partner - including beatings, choking, and slammed into things . The survey also revealed If slapping, . pushing, and shoving are included in the already horrific definition of . abuse, that number rises as high as 36million women in the U.S. Though polling was anonymous, the claims of aggression are real, and are much higher than many agencies predicted. A government official who oversaw the research called the results 'astounding.' 'It's the first time we've had this . kind of estimate' on the prevalence of intimate partner violence, said . Linda Degutis of the centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts in domestic violence don't . find it too surprising, although some aspects of the survey may have led . to higher numbers than are sometimes reported. One expert called the new report's . estimate on rape and attempted rape 'extremely high' — with one in five . women saying they were victims. About . half of those cases involved intimate partners. No documentation was . sought to verify the women's claims, which were made anonymously. But advocates say the new rape numbers are plausible. 'It's a major problem that often is . under-estimated and over-looked,' said Linda James, director of health . for Futures Without Violence, a San Francisco-based organization that . advocates against domestic abuse. The CDC report is based on a randomized telephone survey of about 9,000 women. Several of the CDC numbers are higher than those of other sources. For example, the CDC study suggests that 1.3 million women have suffered rape, attempted rape or had sex forced on them in the previous year. That statistic is more than seven times greater than what was reported by a Department of Justice household survey conducted last year. There may be several reasons for the differences, including how the surveys were done, who chose to participate and how 'rape' and other types of assault were defined or interpreted, said Shannan Catalano, a statistician with the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

But two blue gnomes, perhaps aptly named Grumpy and Dopey, have caused a sparked a massive war of words in the seaside town of Totnes in Devon. The town’s Britain in Bloom group has been accused of ‘insulting the value of Totnes’ while a group called the Council of Gnomes has condemned the statues as offensive. 'It's not Las Vegas': Residents are not too sure about the latest idea to spruce up Totnes, blue gnomes . It all started when members of the town's Britain in Bloom group put out an appeal to smarten up its main roundabout. The blue statues called Grumpy and Dopey were then donated by a local china company and now stand on the Coronation Road roundabout which fallen into neglect after recent cutbacks. Around 27,000 drivers a day pass the roundabout on their way through Totnes into the South Hams. Speaking at the time the statues were put up Vernon Gay of china firm China Blue said: 'Totnes has been voted the third wackiest town in England by British Airways so I thought we should live up to our reputation and have some Disney figures living on the roundabout - coloured blue of course.’ Gnome trouble: Grumpy and Dopey have sparked a war of words in Totnes, Devon . But since then the gnomes have come under attack by unhappy locals and a group called the Council of Gnomes saying they are in fact dwarves and not gnomes at all. Chris Keleher , who lives in Totnes, said: 'The offending gnomes may be appropriate in Las Vegas or in Disneyland but to claim that they enhance the image of Totnes in any way is to insult the values of what Totnes is supposed to stand for. Donation: Vernon Gay of china firm China Blue thought his gift of gnomes would be appreciated . ‘At a major entrance to the town we should be presenting visitors with that kind of image rather than these tacky things which some misguided souls believe reflect the spirit of the place.’ But Diana Cusack, of Totnes In Bloom, defended the move. She said: 'What’s not to like? Blue gnomes are just a question of personal taste.' And someone describing themselves as Esbe Taloo, secretary general of the Council of Gnomes, wrote a letter to Totnes in Bloom, saying : 'It has come to our attention that the ornaments of cartoon Disney dwarves on the roundabout in Totnes are being called gnomes. 'We would like to explain that a dwarf is a small human, who is seen as having a disability due to the problem of having to fit into a larger-scale society. 'A gnome is a non-human being that inhabits a different society, as do elves, pixies and fairies.  'We would like you to desist from calling cartoon dwarves gnomes.'","Drivers moan 'it's Totnes not Las Vegas'

When the pain became too much, Leah-Beth Richards made the bravest choice of her short life. Faced with yet more debilitating radiotherapy for a rare cancer, the then eight-year-old asked her mummy to stop the treatment because ‘it was hurting’. Her plea left her family facing a legal battle with medical staff who wanted her to continue going to hospital. But it also illustrated Leah-Beth’s determination to live life to the full. Displaying maturity beyond her tender years, the courageous schoolgirl became an inspiration to all with her positive attitude as she tried to make the most of every precious day. There was even a period of remission, and she was introduced to her Chelsea football club heroes Frank Lampard and John Terry. Earlier, she had touched the hearts of actress Catherine Zeta-Jones and husband Michael Douglas, who visited while she was being treated at the Children’s Hospital for Wales. Leah-Beth battled on for five years. But earlier this year, parents Kathryn and Mark, who had been told there was no hope of curing the cancer, were informed it had returned and there was little hope. Last week, Leah-Beth died aged 13 at the family home in Pontypridd, South Wales. Her funeral was held on Monday and she was taken to the crematorium in a pink coffin on a horse-drawn hearse. Leah-Beth was just two when she was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a kidney cancer which affects around 70 children a year in the UK. She asked for the treatment to end when she was eight and had a 5lb tumour in her stomach. Leah-Beth said at the time: ‘Sometimes I don’t feel like going into hospital ... I’m frightened that they’re going to keep me in. ‘I was upset about the radiotherapy and I asked Mummy to stop it, to stop taking me there because it was hurting. ‘I would rather stay at home than keep going back there.’ Mother-of-four Mrs Richards, 41, said at the time: ‘We would rather she had some special months than painful years. ‘She can’t even walk downstairs without getting out of breath - what kind of life is that?

Leah dressed in her favourite colour with her mother Katheryn in 2007 . ‘We are thinking of her quality of life not quantity.’ However, the couple faced a battle with doctors who threatened to take legal action to make Leah-Beth carry on with her radiotherapy. Mrs Richards continued: ‘I was shocked when the doctors told us we had no choice. They said that was why they had child protection services.’ Health chiefs ruled they had a responsibility to Leah-Beth because she was so young. However, the dispute never reached court and Leah-Beth is understood to have received some further treatment. At her funeral, a family friend told the 200 mourners: ‘Leah-Beth was a very strong and positive lady whose life was turned upside down by illness. ‘She was an old head on young shoulders with a wicked sense of humour. She had no fear and lived to the full – she was loved by all who knew her. Mark and Kathryn could not have had a more wonderful daughter. ‘Leah-Beth made her parents the proudest on earth. She had an infectious personality and touched everyone she met.’ Mourners carried out the family’s wish to wear something bright to the service and the pallbearers all wore pink. A family spokesman said: ‘We are devastated. Kathryn can’t find the words to say how painful it is to lose her.'

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Last updated at 12:24 PM on 15th December 2011 . Read the riot act: Home Secretary Theresa May launched a scathing attack at the findings of a study into the root causes of August's events . Most August rioters were hardened criminals driven by a desire for ‘instant gratification’, Theresa May declared last night. The Home Secretary rounded on apologists for the summer riots, dismissing claims those involved had been protesting about spending cuts and police harassment. In an unforgiving speech to the London School of Economics, she criticised the Reading the Riots research it conducted jointly with the Guardian newspaper as ‘limited’, adding that the rioters’ actions were ‘inexcusable’. The report claimed the rioters were driven by anger over police stop-and-search techniques. But, to heckles from the audience of academics, Mrs May said: ‘Nearly two thirds of those brought before the courts were charged with either burglary, robbery or theft – so we know the vast mass of rioters weren’t protesting, as they claimed; they were thieving. ‘The riots were about instant gratification.’ Facing down barracking from the audience, Mrs May said the study had ignored the views of victims and the ‘law-abiding majority’ and focused instead on the ‘excuses’ of the rioters. ‘They would of course try to . rationalise and excuse their inexcusable and irrational behaviour,’ she . said. Speaking later, she said: ‘What the LSE/Guardian report tells me . more than anything is that the rioters still have not accepted . responsibility for their actions. Devastating: This image became one of the iconic images of the riots, Theresa May says a study which spoke to those involved was 'limited' Inexcusable: Theresa May said rioters 'would of course try to rationalise and excuse their inexcusable and irrational behaviour' (pictured Tottenham riots) ‘They’re still blaming others – the . police, the Government, “society”. They’re still making excuses. But I . don’t accept their excuses because it was their choice to riot and their . crimes had consequences.’ Research conducted by the LSE and Guardian found a deep-seated anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor behind the riots. Analysts, who studied 270 interviews with people who took part in the disturbances, said distrust and antipathy towards officers was a key driving force behind why thousands took to the streets. A complex mix of other political, social and economic factors also contributed, they said. Out of those questioned, 85 per cent said policing was an 'important' or 'very important' factor in why the riots happened. It was second only to poverty, which saw 86 per cent of rioters class it as one of the main causes of the four consecutive nights of unrest during the summer. Poor parenting and gangs were also said to be an important cause of the trouble, which led to the deaths of five people and saw more than 4,000 arrested. Analysts said the view that the police were 'the biggest gang out there' was a reoccurring theme among rioters. Mrs May said the research, followed . extensively by the BBC, lacked a ‘control group’ of non-rioters with . impartial views. It interviewed very few rioters from outside London, . she said, three from Nottingham, seven from Salford and 16 from . Merseyside. ‘It’s important to highlight the limitations of such a study, limitations that I’m sure you also all recognise,’ she said. ‘Rather than listening solely to the . rioters’ stories, I think it’s important that we take all of the . evidence together and that we draw a more comprehensive and accurate . picture of what actually happened this summer.’ Ministry of Justice research showed . about two-thirds of rioters had convictions or cautions. Yet the . Guardian/LSE research highlighted the one third without convictions. The research claimed that  deep-seated . anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor . behind the riots, with officers’ incivility a major concern. Political, social and economic grievances contributed to the unrest, the report said. But Mrs May said: ‘In fact, on average . each rioter charged had committed 11 previous offences. In other words, . they were career criminals. And these are the very people saying they . feel harassed by the police. ‘Frankly, I’m delighted that career . criminals don’t like the police, that they feel the police are always . targeting them and, as one said, that the police are always “causing . them hell”.’ The riots broke out in Tottenham, . North London, on August 6, following the fatal shooting by police of . alleged drug dealer Mark Duggan. They spread to other parts of the . capital and to other English cities, including Birmingham, Liverpool, . Nottingham and Manchester. ■ A thug who set up a Facebook page . called ‘Letz start a riot’ in August was jailed yesterday. Danny Cook, . 22, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, had admitted intentionally . encouraging or assisting in the commission of theft or criminal damage. He was jailed for 30 months at Worcester Crown Court.","Theresa May rejects Reading the Riots study, claiming it is 'limited'

Bob Flowerdew, 58, has admitted that he relies on peat-based compost to grow plants. But his comments have outraged conservationists, who complained that they would encourage the destruction of wildlife-rich peat bogs by amateur gardeners following suit. They say Mr Flowerdew, a regular panellist on Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time, is setting a poor example to the nation’s gardeners. Bob Flowerdew, one of Britain's leading organic gardeners who has outraged green groups by championing the use of peat by amateur gardeners . Peatlands take centuries to form and ‘lock up’ carbon that otherwise contributes to global warning. In his column in Amateur Gardening magazine, Mr Flowerdew wrote: 'Right here I go into the fire both feet first. 'I demand the right to use a modicum of peat in my garden.' Mr Flowerdew, author of several organic gardening guides, admitted he uses small amounts of peat-based compost on some of his seeds. He went on: 'So far, in all my trials, I have found no other compost to be anywhere near as reliable for turning seeds into healthy, robust seedlings. 'Would all those protesters wishing to reduce peat usage please remember that no matter how slow it can in fact regenerate - allegedly only an inch or so a century - with the thousands of acres available, this does gradually become a renewable resource, just like a forest. 'And he called for a licensing system for peat 'sourced from managed and sustainable sites.' Friends of the Earth spokesman Helen Rimmer said: 'We are disappointed that Flowerdew has used his magazine column to promote peat when, as an organic grower, he should promote peat alternatives. 'We face an urgent climate change crisis. Peat bogs are vital carbon sinks and home to thousands of insects and birds. 'There is little lowland bog left, so it’s vital we protect what remains.

Myles Bremner, chief executive of charity Garden Organic, said: 'We don’t believe there’s any need or justification for using peat. 'Minimising peat use to virtually nothing is what we want more people to do. 'If every gardener took Flowerdew’s approach, then the UK would be using more than mere handfuls of peat, which isn’t sustainable.' Earlier this year, gardening guru Alan Titchmarsh, 62, also sparked a storm by admitting that he uses small amounts of peat-based compost. But the pair were defended by Amateur Gardening editor Tim Rumball, who said: 'Any common sense debate about peat has become swamped by hysterical invective from environmentalists and opportunistic politicians who deliberately fail to look at the bigger picture. 'Everyday activities like driving a car, switching on a light or cooking are much more damaging than using small amounts of peat to grow plants. 'No gardener wants to harm the planet.

"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 2:21 PM on 14th December 2011 . The head of the BBC yesterday blamed the deluge of criticism about its ‘faked’ scenes of polar bear cubs on newspaper bitterness over the corporation’s comprehensive coverage of the phone-hacking inquiry. Director-general Mark Thompson suggested the issue of the misleading Frozen Planet footage was being used as a way of retaliating against the BBC for its reporting of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards. ‘I do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about Lord Leveson and other matters,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Faked: Some footage of this woolly caterpillar freezing was not filmed in its natural environment, but in a box instead. It was shown in an episode of Frozen Planet on November 2 . Not quite so natural: As the caterpillar gets colder, its breathing stops before finally its gut and blood freeze . Misleading: When the caterpillar thaws again, it scurries off. Some of the footage was doctored for the programme . The BBC filmed deadly spiders in Britain for its documentary Human Planet earlier this year, it has emerged. The programme showed children hunting Goliath tarantulas in Venezuela for food - but close-ups of the world's largest spiders were filmed in the UK using tame spiders. During the show this was not explained and it was not mentioned in the 'making of' film at the end either. The details were located in a PDF called 'Human Planet Filming Techniques' on the programme's website, the Mirror said. A BBC spokesman said 'we only ever use footage filmed in controlled conditions in extreme circumstances - for example when it's too dangerous'. Mr Thompson also said viewers had . already effectively given it the go-ahead to fake scenes in natural . history shows without telling them. Millions thought the scene had been captured by BBC cameramen inside an . underground cave in the sub-zero temperatures of the Arctic wilderness. But the footage, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and interspersed . with real shots of the Arctic, was in fact filmed in a den made of . plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure at a Dutch zoo. Appearing . before MPs yesterday to answer questions over the BBC’s annual report, . Mr Thompson played down the controversy about the footage in the Winter . episode of the hit wildlife series. The director-general said the BBC would not be re-editing the show’s . commentary, adding that the corporation had done audience research and . that viewers were fine with the practice. He told MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘Some . years ago we asked the public the specific question of whether they . would prefer it if there were on-air mentions, either captions or . labels, and the overwhelming response of the public is they did not want . us to do that. ‘They were quite happy with the idea of us simply explaining where we . can after the programme, always on the website, how we do it, so those . who want to know how it is made can find out.’ On thin ice: Sir David Attenborough with an anaesthetised polar bear in Svalbard during episode seven of the hit show Frozen Planet . Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs . Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth . He claimed it had ‘talked to the public’ and ‘sought their advice’ and . that they ‘understand’, provided the commentary is ‘written extremely . carefully’ and was ‘generic’. But Tory MP Therese Coffey said she was . one of those that ‘did believe that the extraordinary coverage of the . polar bears was genuine’. She said the BBC had ‘spoilt’ the ‘fantastic’ programme, adding: . ‘For me I will probably never look at a BBC nature . programme in the same way, [but instead] to see, was it trick cameras.’ Mr Thompson then turned his fire on newspaper coverage of the issue. He said: ‘All I would say is there is a leader in today’s Mirror that is . quite interesting – “The national broadcaster is quick on the draw when . it comes to pointing fingers at others. Perhaps when it comes to their . own editorial standards and ethics a little more action and a little . less pontificating would be handy”. ‘I do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about Lord Leveson and other matters.’ Moving scene: The pair of two-day-old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary. At this age they weighed less than a kilo, but were filmed in a zoo . The polar bear and cub inside the man-made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow . Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo . Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers . Panorama: The BBC apologised in June after it was found ‘likely’ that Panorama had faked scenes of boys said to be working in an Indian sweatshop. Blue Peter: BBC fined £50,000 in June 2007 after a young studio guest posed as a caller when the telephone system failed during a 2006 phone-in. Children in Need: A fictitious winner’s details were broadcast during Children in Need on BBC1 Scotland in November 2005 after no calls came through from the public. A Year With The Queen: BBC apologised to the Queen in 2007 after a trailer wrongly implied that she had stormed out of a sitting with photographer Annie Leibovitz. The Liz Kershaw Show: BBC6 Music found to have repeatedly faked competitions where no prizes existed and that callers had been members of the production team or their friends. BBC chairman Lord Patten told the committee the fakery had probably only . come to light as a result of an item on the show’s website which . explained how the images were achieved. Sir David, 85, has also defended the methods used by Frozen Planet. He . said: ‘If you had tried to put a camera in the wild in a polar bear den, . she would either have killed the cub or the cameraman.’ Mr Thompson and Lord Patten also faced a call from Labour MP Jim . Sheridan to sack Jeremy Clarkson over his comments on the One Show about . striking public sector workers being shot. Lord Patten said the Top . Gear presenter and the One Show had apologised for the remarks. Mr Thompson said: ‘I don’t intend to sack him because in my view the remarks were clearly intended as a joke.’ Conservative MP Philip Davies attacked the BBC’s coverage of Europe, . saying he had seen research which showed that a minuscule percentage of . guests on news programmes were from a point of view that the UK should . withdraw from the European project. Mr Thompson replied that voices of scepticism could be heard ‘morning, noon and night’ across the BBC’s network.' The documentary drew in eight million viewers transfixed by moving scenes of a polar cub being born . This is not the first time Sir David Attenborough has been accused of misleading viewers in his wildlife documentaries. In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior, . a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn . cub. Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In . fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2001, . Sir David was accused of using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when . it included a lobster spawning scene that was filmed in a British . aquarium. Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the . coast of Nova Scotia. And in 2008, Sir David was accused of . staging a confrontation between himself and a cobra in a South African . desert for the series, Life in Cold Blood.","Mark Thompson suggests criticism misleading footage comes from bitterness about Corporation's reporting of the Leveson inquiry .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:24 AM on 15th December 2011 . Michael Jackson's doctor on Tuesday asked for a publicly-funded lawyer to handle his appeal on a manslaughter conviction in the pop star's death, saying he could not afford to pay for one himself. Dr Conrad Murray, serving a four-year jail term for the involuntary manslaughter of Jackson in 2009, filed papers with Los Angeles Superior Court saying he was unable to fund his legal help any longer. 'The defendant is indigent and respectfully requests the appointment of counsel on appeal,' the court papers said. Fight: Conrad Murray was sentenced for involuntary manslaughter after a six-week trial giving the most detailed account yet of Jackson's final hours . Murray indicated in a two-page court . filing that he would rely on a court-funded attorney to help craft his . appeal for both his conviction and his sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court . has ruled that felony convicts have a constitutional right to assistance . of counsel. The 58-year-old cardiologist had . hired two lawyers for his six-week trial, but he was convicted in . November of involuntary manslaughter, or gross negligence, after . admitting he gave the 'Thriller' singer nightly doses of the surgical anaesthetic propofol to help him sleep. The drug is normally given in . hospital settings with extensive monitoring equipment, but testimony . showed Murray had only basic equipment and left Jackson’s bedside on the . morning of Jackson's June 25, 2009 death, at age 50 - just weeks before . a series of planned comeback concerts. Shortly after Murray's request, his . newly-appointed civil attorney, Charles Peckham, said on Tuesday . sheriff’s deputies appear to be subjecting Murray to more security than . other inmates at Men’s Central Jail and that the physician was left . heavily shackled during their jailhouse meeting. Although Mr Peckham said his client . is coping with tight security and isolation he said he remains . optimistic he will win the an upcoming appeal. 'Treating him like Hannibal Lecter is . offensive,' Mr Peckham said, referring to the fictional serial killer . from popular books and films. A sheriff’s officials defended the . security measures, saying they were for Murray’s safety. Too pricey: Conrad Murray's attorney J Michael Flanagan talks with the media as he leaves Murray's sentencing hearing on November 29 . Legal team: Murray filed papers with Los Angeles Superior Court saying he was unable to fund his legal help, including J Michael Flanagan (2nd R) any longer . The attorney had to obtain a court . order Tuesday to meet with Murray to discuss strategy on a wrongful . death lawsuit filed by Jackson’s father. Mr Peckham said despite the . judge’s order, he was denied entry to the jail, but officials relented . after speaking with the civil trial court handling the case. He said their initial 30-minute . meeting was cut short when the jail was placed in lockdown, but Mr . Peckham said the time was enough to upset him and see that Murray’s . fortunes had dramatically changed. Civil defender: Charles Peckham will craft Murray's appeal . 'This man who saved lives made a . mistake, and they’re going to him pay like a mass-murderer,' Mr Peckham . said. The doctor spoke extensively to documentary filmmakers before his . conviction, but few details of his life behind bars have been divulged. Murray 'is a real target because of . his notoriety and because of the Michael Jackson connection,' sheriff’s . spokesman Steve Whitmore said. 'We’re just being extra cautious right . now.' He said jail officials will evaluate . how to handle Murray’s incarceration, but that he may not serve his . whole sentence in isolation from other inmates. He noted that without a . recent change in state law, Murray would be serving his term in state . prison, not a county lock-up. Mr Peckham said Murray, who has been . jailed since a jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter on . November 7, is optimistic that an appellate court will grant an appeal . on the case. His visit came hours after the . physician, who was never paid the $150,000 a month he expected for . serving as Jackson’s personal physician, asked the court to provide a . publicly funded attorney to handle his appeal because he is indigent. Icon: Murray had only basic equipment and left Jackson's bedside on the morning of Jackson's June 25, 2009 death, at age 50 . J Michael Flanagan, who was one of . Murray’s criminal defence lawyers, agreed with Mr Peckham’s description. He said that when he visited Murray recently, four deputies escorted . the physician into the meeting room and shackled him to a table. 'He can’t even scratch his nose,' the . attorney said. Mr Flanagan said he saw another inmate who was charged . with murder meet with his attorney without the same restrictive . measures. 'This is because of his notoriety,' Mr Whitmore said. 'It’s not so much the crime itself.' Mr Flanagan and Murray’s other . criminal attorneys had sought to present evidence to jurors about . Jackson’s finances, details of his deal for a series of comeback . concerts, and information about other doctors treating the pop . superstar. But the judge refused and ruled the trial would be about . Murray’s care of the singer. Mr Peckham said he didn’t 'think the . sheriff’s department is being anything but professional. I do however . believe the amount of security for Dr Murray is vastly out of proportion . with the potential threat.' He said Murray told him he appreciates the support and prayers he’s received from former patients and friends. In the early days of his confinement, . Murray was classified as suicidal in jail records, according to a . probation report. Mr Peckham said he saw no indications that the . physician intended to take his own life and that he seemed to be in . control of his mental health. Meanwhile, Pastor has scheduled a . hearing for January 23 to decide whether to order Murray to pay any . restitution to Jackson’s family or reimburse them for funeral expenses, . which totaled more than $1.8million. Jackson’s estate estimated the singer . would have earned at least $100million if he had performed his 'This Is . It' concerts planned for London’s O2 arena. Murray will lose his medical license as a result of the conviction is upheld.","Murray indicated in court filing he will rely on a court-funded attorney .

"By . Lucy Buckland and Chris Parsons . Last updated at 3:19 PM on 14th December 2011 . 'Victim': Student Sam Main shows the injuries he apparently sustained after being thrown off the train by a fellow passenger for not having a ticket . The 'fare-dodging' student who was manhandled off a train by a fellow passenger has defended his actions and claimed he was the victim in a video which has become a YouTube hit. Footage of the teenage troublemaker being thrown off a train by a fed-up fellow traveller on the ScotRail service between Edinburgh and Perth has become a viral hit after being uploaded to You Tube. It begins when a conductor is told the teenager doesn't have a ticket and tells the driver of the train to stop until the youngster gets off. When the youth refuses a shouting match ensues until a passenger, later referred to as 'the big man' leaps to his feet and frogmarches him off the train - and keeps pushing him off when he repeatedly tries to re-board the service. A two-and-a-half minute video clip - ‘Scotrail No Ticket’ - was posted three days ago and has already been viewed almost 200,000 times. But the 19-year-old student, from Falkirk, has since insisted he was in the right after being tracked down at his home by a local newspaper. He said last night: 'I had been out celebrating after an exam and I was half asleep on the train. ‘I did have a ticket but I must have handed over the wrong one to the conductor. The next thing I know this big guy is manhandling me to the door and throwing me off. University student Sam Main, who is studying surveying, added: ‘I couldn’t believe it when the footage turned up on YouTube.' He said he still has cuts and bruises over his cheeks (pictured above) and legs. In the clip, the white-haired ScotRail worker tells the youth: 'I’ll sit here all night pal. I’m getting paid for this but they (the passengers) will start moaning.' Is there a problem? After the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager (his white beanie hat can just be seen popping over the seats), the 'big man' stands up and approaches the conductor . Time to move on son: The burly passenger looks down on the teenager and offers the conductor his assistance . Off and away: The 'big man' hoists the youth up from his seat and throws him off the train . The video continues with the lad protesting his innocence and claiming that he showed the ScotRail employee his ‘f*****g ticket’ while a group of stunned young children sit close by with their furious mother. But the conductor adds: 'No you have not. Stop swearing.' The video goes on to show the boy, wearing a beanie hat, produce a single ticket that allows travel in the opposite direction. The conductor repeats his previous threat telling the youth: 'No you are off, we will sit here all night. Why should they pay and not you?' Scroll down for the video . The clip begins by showing the ticket inspector demanding the youngster leaves the train. He says he only has a single ticket to travel in the opposite direction. The youth responds by swearing back at him . It is at this point that a tall, heavyset passenger gets up, approaches the pair and asks ‘Is there a problem here?’ before declaring ‘No problem - right you, off’. He then grabs the lad by the scruff of his neck and bundles him off the train, trying not to clatter into other passengers. The teenager tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to barge his way back on before the train doors close. As the large man heads back to his seat the carriage erupts into applause and one passenger is clearly heard saying 'Cheers, big man'. While Sam himself has defended his actions on the train, the student's father has called for the man who threw him off to be charged. Sam was sitting exams today, but salesman Lenny Main, 43, from Falkirk, called for Mr Pollock to face assault charges. He said: 'This big guy has basically thrown him head first on to the platform. Sam's landed on his face, and has a big graze.  'He's tried to get back in the carriage to get his bag. 'He's diabetic and all his things were in that bag - his medication, his university notes, his money, his mobile phone and his Ipod. Once at the train doors, the 'big man' and the ticket collector heave the youngster off the carriage . And out you go: The passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform. Each time he tries to get back in, he pushes him back out again . 'But he's been thrown off again. This man has to be charged and have his day in court. He had no right to do what he did. 'If I was him, I'd expect to be charged.' He added: 'Some of the comments about Sam online have been vile.' Sam's uncle, who asked not to be named, claimed Sam did have a ticket, but it was the wrong one. He said Sam went to the railway station at Polmont at 8am to buy a return ticket, but was told two singles would be cheaper as he planned to return off peak. He said: 'He was sitting on the train when he noticed both tickets were for Polmont to Edinburgh Park, but he decided to concentrate on his exam and explain the mix-up to the inspector on the train home. 'After his exam he went out for a few drinks. He got on the train and everyone's seen the video, but he's no fare dodger, he was just sold the wrong ticket and the inspector's decided he's off at Linlithgow. 'The big guy's got no right to get involved, and Sam's face is cut up. 'The footage is all over YouTube now and people are viewing it all over the world.  'He'd had a drink and swore at the old man, but he's no ned or fare dodger. He paid for a ticket but was sold the wrong one. 'He's spoken to police, and told them they can check CCTV because he bought a ticket. But he's just trying to get on with his exams.' A ScotRail spokesman said: 'While we welcome the public’s support of our zero-tolerance stance on anti-social behaviour, our staff are trained in conflict management and we do not expect members of the public to take matters into their own hands. 'We are investigating the incident, which appears to show a person travelling without a valid ticket, refusing to pay for the journey, and swearing at a staff member in full view of customers.' The ticket inspector waves away any further protests by the teenager .","Teenage 'fare dodger' Sam Main, 19, comes forward to defend his behaviour, saying he did have the right ticket and was 'manhandled' by the 'big man'

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 10:22 AM on 15th December 2011 . Cull: Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman announced two test areas will be selected and allowed to slaughter badgers . Animal rights groups have hit out at government plans to allow badger culling. Plans for the trials in two secret locations were announced today by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman in a bid to try and eradicate Bovine tuberculosis in cattle. For six-weeks next year marksmen will be licensed to shoot badgers in the two specific areas before experts decide whether the slaughter of . badgers is rolled out more widely across England. Mrs Spelman told the Commons that she wished there was an alternative but an oral vaccine for the disease is 'years away' and injections were difficult to administer to wild badgers which needed to be trapped first. There are approximately 190,000 badgers in England. The move was condemned by Labour, with one MP saying the thinking behind the move was 'bad science' founded on greed. Newport West MP Paul Flynn said: 'Shouldn't a clarion call, gone . out from this House today to all the right thinking, compassionate people in . this country to frustrate this cruel and unnecessary slaughter of animals. 'Isn't it right that this is founded on greed and bad . science by the nasty party?' While Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw agreed saying shooting the countryside creatures would not eradicate Bovine TB. Speaking in the commons he said: 'Could she be quite clear with the House what level of mortality she expects shooting to achieve, because the very clear advice that we received... was that shooting would not achieve a level of mortality high enough to make any difference to the disease at all.' 'We can't just do nothing': Environment minister Caroline Spelman said her decision hadn't been easy . The two areas have yet to be selected but Mrs Spelman said the culling will lead to a reduction of 16 per cent in bovine TB. This claim was violently refuted by animal rights groups. The RSPCA has recorded a version of the 12 days of Christmas showing how 12 furry badgers will be shot, five cows will still be sick and four farmers will still be angry, three MPs still confused and one vaccine still unused after the trial. Stacey Frier, the charity's senior Parliamentary adviser, said: 'We, and so many others, have been telling the government for years that this cull is not the answer to the problems with bovine TB but they are just not listening. 'We feel like we are banging our heads against a brick wall for ages. So we have decided to sing about our frustrations instead.' And PETA said the evidence slaughtering badgers would eradicate bovine TB is 'spurious at best.' A spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'Evidence that a mass slaughter of badgers would reduce levels of TB is spurious at best. The spread of bovine TB is, however, conclusively linked to the movement and intensive rearing of cattle in the meat and dairy industries, which ignore the fact that these sensitive, intelligent animals are subjected to exhaustion, pain, boredom, loneliness and fear.' But Mrs Spelman refuted the claims, saying this afternoon: 'I know there is great strength of feeling on this issue but I also know that we need to take action now before the TB situation deteriorates even further.’ Nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England last year alone because of bovine TB, with the cost to the taxpayer set to top £1billion over the next ten years. The problem is particularly bad in west and south-west England, where nearly a quarter of all cattle farms were affected by the disease during 2010. Both trials are expected to cost £500,000 in . each of the designated areas for the pilot. The cost will be split . between the Home Office and Defra. At risk: If the scheme rolls out 190,000 badgers could be at risk of being shot, regardless of of they are carrying the disease . Mrs Spelman said the areas are expected to be around 300 sq km, double the minimum area required for licences to be granted. The Badger Trust said it was 'clearly very disappointed' and would consult lawyers to decide what action could be taken. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic, contagious disease which can affect all animals including dairy cows. Due to the seriousness of the disease, farmers take great care to minimise the risk of their cows catching it. Research has shown that one of the major causes of infection in cattle is through contact with infected badgers. At the moment farmers can only try . to stop contact between badgers and dairy cows, including . 'badger-proofing' farm buildings and feed stores. And Humane Society International executive director Mark Jones, himself a vet, said Mrs Spelman's decision appeared to be in 'clear breach' of the Bern Convention and amounted to 'institutionalised cruelty'. 'For Defra to blindly push ahead with a pilot badger slaughter, despite compelling scientific evidence that it will be ineffective, hugely damaging to local populations and cruel, is an absurdly misguided decision,' he said. 'Badgers are supposed to be a protected species so plans to decimate them surely cannot be reconciled with an international convention on wildlife conservation.' Mrs Spelman said the government were ready for any legal challenges and saying minsters had a 'copper-bottomed approach to it'. Both trials are expected to be delayed until after the Olympics because of a heavy police presence is thought to be required to protect the public. A report by the Farm Crisis Network had . found there were feelings of 'panic, stress and emotional devastation' for farmers and their families as they repeatedly had to send cattle to . slaughter, she told the Commons. Farmers want to see a policy to control badgers to tackle a problem they say is one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers . 'In the meantime we cannot just do nothing,' Mrs Spelman added. 'This terrible disease is getting worse and we have got to deal with the devastating impact it has on farmers and rural communities. National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall said: 'Today is another massive step forward in achieving our end goal of a healthy countryside - both for badgers and for cattle. 'I commend Defra for introducing these two pilot areas to confirm the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of controlled shooting. 'We must tackle this terrible disease, a disease that sees tens of thousands of cattle destroyed each and every year. The most recent science shows badger controls are absolutely necessary, together with cattle controls, to get on top of TB. 'No other country in the world has successfully tackled this devastating disease without first addressing the reservoir of TB in the wildlife.' 'I think we would all agree that we need to stop the disease spreading further, to bring it under control and ultimately eradicate it. Evidence tells us that unless we tackle the disease in badgers, we will never eradicate it in cattle. 'No country in the world that has TB in its wildlife has been able to eradicate it in cattle without addressing it in the wildlife population.' 'Nevertheless, we still see a useful role for vaccination, particularly in the future.' She . said badger control licences would be issued by Natural England to . farmers and landowners under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 to carry . out culling at their own expense. Applicants will have to meet strict . conditions to ensure the culling is carried out safely and humanely, . with each licence covering a minimum area of 150 sq km over at least . four years. The farming . industry will be invited to come forward with a selection of two areas . for the pilot and then they will be able to apply for a licence.","Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said trial is necessary to control bovine TB .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:38 AM on 15th December 2011 . President Barack Obama yesterday marked the end of the Iraq war with a tribute to the thousands of brave American troops who fought and died in the conflict. Accompanied by his wife Michelle, the president travelled to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to address service members and their families as he brought the war to a close. He told thousands of troops at the base: 'As your commander-in-chief and on behalf of a grateful nation, I'm proud to finally say these two words: welcome home, welcome home, welcome home.' Scroll down for video . Tribute: Barack Obama spoke at Fort Bragg in North Carolina yesterday to mark the end of the war in Iraq . Mr Obama highlighted the . human side of the war, reflecting on the bravery and sacrifices of U.S. forces now on their way back home. The North Carolina base alone has seen more than 200 . deaths over nearly nine years of fighting in Iraq. He told the crowd members, clad in fatigues and maroon berets to signify active airborne status, the total costs of the battle - more than 1.5million U.S. troops served; 30,000 were wounded and 4,500 died. But he added that the effort had not been in vain. 'Of course, Iraq is not a perfect place,' he said. 'But we are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people. We are building a new partnership between our nations.' All U.S. troops are to be out of Iraq by December 31, though Mr Obama has pledged the country will continue to help Iraq as it faces an uncertain future in a volatile region of the world. Promises: Thousands of troops gathered to hear the president, who has vowed to work to ensure them jobs . Thanks: Mr Obama was joined by his wife Michelle, who encouraged troops to 'marry up' Upon his arrival in Fort Bragg, . Mr Obama met with five enlisted service members who had recently returned . from combat. He also met with the family of a soldier killed overseas. Mr Obama . has on several occasions addressed his reasons for ending the war, . casting it as a promise kept after he ran for president as an anti-war . candidate and speaking of the need to refocus U.S. attention on . rebuilding the troubled economy at home. 3,187 Days the U.S has been in Iraq . 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) Cost in dollars of Iraq war . 1,500,000 Number of U.S. citizens who have served in Iraq since beginning of the war . 170,000 Number of U.S. troops in Iraq at peak in 2007 . 4,485 Number of U.S. military members killed in Iraq . 32,226 Number of U.S. service members wounded in hostile action . 113,728 Number of Iraqi civilians killed in war . 180 Number of Iraqi civilians killed this month . 2.5 Percentage above the national average for unemployment among Iraq veterans . 1 Number of U.S Iraq or Afghanistan veterans who try to kill themselves every 80 minutes . Today, his focus was principally . on the troops and their role and his commitment to ensuring veterans get . the jobs and resources they need once they're back home. Mr Obama told the troops at Fort Bragg: 'You stood up for America; now America must stand up for you. Our commitment to you doesn’t end when you take off the uniform.' His appearance capped several days of Iraq-related events for the president, who hosted  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on Monday at the White House. The two discussed their agenda for postwar cooperation, which Mr Obama said includes 'military-to-military ties that are no different from the ties that we have with countries throughout the region and around the world'. On Tuesday, the president granted a series of interviews to local television stations in cities and towns with large military bases - Norfolk, Virginia; Pensacola, Florida; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Seattle, Washington - to talk about the end of the war. In an interview with David Alan, an anchor with ABC affiliate WVEC in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Mr Obama responded to a question about how the Iraq war had changed him. Referring to his visits to wounded . troops at Bethesda Naval Hospital and Walter Reed Medical Center, Mr Obama . said, 'It’s the most sobering aspect of being president.' Approval: The troops, wearing berets to signify their active status, cheer in support during Mr Obama's speech . Warm reception: President Obama shakes hands with troops following his speech in the plane hanger at the military base. 'I am proud to say these two words,' he had said in the address. 'Welcome home' But, he added, 'It’s also the one thing that gives you the most pride. These young men and women make such . extraordinary sacrifices, such dedication, with so much skill and so . much determination. It just reminds you they’re the best we have to . offer.' In a separate interview, Mr Obama had previewed some of his likely themes for his Fort Bragg speech. 'We . must not forget the men and women who gave their lives, tens of . thousands wounded, all those missed birthday parties, missed soccer . games and missed dinners because folks were on their second or third . deployment. 'We should not take that for granted,' the president told KOAA-TV in Colorado Spring. 'It is an extraordinary testimony to the bravery, courage, dedication and patriotism of our soldiers.' Mr Obama's . approval rating on handling the situation in Iraq has been above 50 . per cent since last fall, and in a new Associated Press-GfK poll, has . ticked up four points since October to 55 per cent. Duty of care: Michelle Obama hugs a woman at the base, which has lost more than 200 troops over the war . Among independents, his approval rating tops 50 per cent for the first time since this spring. It is the president's first visit to Fort . Bragg, which is home to Army Special Operations, the 18th Airborne . Corps and the 82nd Airborne, among others. Special Forces troops from . Fort Bragg were among the first soldiers in Iraq during the 2003 . invasion and its paratroopers helped lead the 2007 troop increase. North Carolina, which Obama narrowly . won in 2008, also is an important state for the 2012 presidential . election and will host the Democratic convention. Welcome: The Obamas arrive at Fort Bragg on Wednesday. They met with five service members who had recently returned from combat and the family of a soldier killed overseas . To underscore the political . significance, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, one of the leading . GOP presidential contenders, addressed an open letter to Mr Obama and sent . it to the Fayetteville (North Carolina) Observer decrying the unemployment rate . for veterans. Unemployment for veterans who served after September 11, 2001, was 11.1 per cent in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Romney called such a statistic a 'disgrace'. 'In the face of such economic hardship, fine words welcoming veterans home are insufficient,' he wrote. 'It is time for a fundamental change of direction. If you won't or can't lead our country out of the economic morass you've deepened, then I would suggest that it's time for you to go.'","Commander-in-chief addresses service members at Fort Bragg .

"By . James Tozer . Last updated at 6:40 PM on 13th December 2011 . Facing jail: Rev Canon Dr Patrick John Magumba admitted staging 31 shamed marriages . A vicar was yesterday warned that he faced going to jail 'for some time’ after he admitted staging 31 sham marriages. The Rev Canon John Magumba, 58, conducted weddings between illegal immigrant brides and grooms and EU passport holders they barely knew so they could remain in Britain. The Ugandan-born vicar also admitted pocketing over £8,000 that was given to his church in fees or donations from genuine weddings and funerals. Investigators from the UK Border Agency were tipped off earlier this year that Magumba, who covered three churches in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was helping illegal immigrants take part in bogus weddings. Equipped with marriage certificates, immigrants were then able to obtain a visa allowing them leave to stay in Britain with full access to education, healthcare and welfare benefits. Often the couples would immediately drop the pretence of a relationship straight after the ceremony and go their separate ways. At Bolton Crown Court yesterday, Magumba pleaded guilty to conspiracy to breaching UK immigration law by conducting sham marriages and also two counts of theft. Thief: Rev Canon John Magumba also admitted stealing £5,437 from St Peter's Church in Rochdale, pictured . Judge Thomas Teague QC told the defence counsel for the shamed vicar: 'It is a very serious case and he must obviously expect to lose his liberty for some time.’ Speaking to Magumba, who stood in the dock with his head bowed, the judge added that it was 'a very serious matter’. The married father-of-six, who wore an open-neck shirt with no dog collar, was accompanied by the Venerable Alan Wolstencroft, from the Bishop of Manchester's office. Afterwards he said: 'He will not be saying anything - he is very upset.’ Magumba admitted conspiring with a number of people - who cannot be named for legal reasons - in facilitating the commission of a breach in immigration law between April 2008 and February 2011. Sham weddings involve EU citizens marrying non-Europeans so they can earn the right to live here. In many cases, the bride and groom have never met and don't even speak the same language. (Posed by models) Business: Rev Canon John Magumba would marry up to eight couples a day in the Rochdale (pictured) area . He also admitted stealing £5,437 from St Peter's Church and £2,908 from St Luke's Church, both in Rochdale – a total of £8,345. He was granted bail and will be sentenced in January. The vicar, of Deeplish, Rochdale, was arrested in March after an investigation into 100 sham marriages and suspended by the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch. Sham: Rev Alex Brown was jailed for four years last year after marrying 360 illegal immigrants to complete strangers . Immigration investigators have been examining allegations that marriage banns were not read out by Magumba for ceremonies involving immigrants. Names and addresses of brides and grooms should be read out at three services prior to the wedding and details posted for anyone to see. Magumba was team vicar for the South Rochdale team ministry, overseeing three churches in the area - St Peter's, Newbold, St Luke's, Deeplish, and St Mary's, Balderstone. A member of the Association of Christian Counsellors, he has lectured on the challenges of ministering to Britain’s growing African population and written a Phd on Christianity in Uganda. Yesterday a Diocese of Manchester spokesman said: 'Reverend Canon John Magumba has pleaded guilty to contravening the Immigration Act by conducting irregular weddings and theft from churches. 'The highest standards are expected from all clergy. It is extremely rare for clergy to abuse the trust placed in them by their congregation, community and bishop. 'At present Rev Magumba is suspended by the Bishop of Manchester. His suspension will continue while formal procedures begin into his conduct.’ Rev Brown was in charge at St Peter and St Paul church in the East Sussex village of St Leonards . Last year another Church of England minister was jailed for four years over the biggest fake-wedding scam Britain has seen. Rev Alex Brown abused his position at his Victorian parish church in the seaside town of St Leonards, East Sussex, to marry 360 illegal immigrants to complete strangers. Between 2005 and 2009, Brown married up to eight couples a day and was found guilty of breaching immigration laws. He also pleaded guilty to solemnising a marriage according to the rites of the Church of England without banns being properly read.","Rev Canon John Magumba also admitted stealing £8,000 in church donations .

A Royal Navy submarine had its silent running breached today when the Military Wives Choir came on board to reunite one of the singers with her submariner husband. Eleven members of the choir, comprising wives and girlfriends of military personnel brought together by impresario Gareth Malone for the BBC2 series The Choir: Military Wives, went on board HMS Turbulent in Plymouth Sound before she arrived back at her home base of Devonport. It was an emotional reunion for choir member Victoria Forth, 28, whose husband Tim, also 28, has been away on the sub for five-and-a-half months since his last leave. Reunited at last! Choir member Victoria Forth and her husband Tim share a long-awaited kiss on board the sub . Making waves: The Military Wives' Choir takes HMS Turbulent by storm with a flawless rendition of their charity Christmas single Wherever You Are on board the submarine in Plymouth Sound yesterday . The choir's arrival on board was a surprise known only to a select few. Leading Engineering Technician (LET) Forth and his wife were reunited after the choir performed a pitch-perfect rendition of their Christmas charity single, Wherever You Are, in the cramped control room next to the periscope. The crew - and LET Forth - looked on in stunned amazement as they burst into song. Mrs Forth, after greeting him with tears and a hug, said having him home was better than getting the Christmas Number One - pipping X Factor winners Little Mix. Back in the UK: HMS Turbulent stopped temporarily at Plymouth Sound for the reunion before returning to her base in Devonport after 284 days on duty . 'But with a very, very close, almost equal second, the Christmas Number One,' she added. 'If we get the number one, it means we raise that much more for the Royal British Legion and SAAFA (Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association). 'It will be a really magic Christmas this year.' The song is in prime position to be the Christmas Number One, according to bookmaker William Hill. The choir has been backed by figures such as Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, who has been urging listeners to support the single, and last Sunday they performed on Strictly Come Dancing. All smiles: Members of the choir, who were brought together for the BBC2 series The Choir: Military Wives, enjoy a well-earned cup of tea after their performance . They have also been invited to meet Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street. Tomahawk-equipped submarine Turbulent has been away for 284 days, spending 190 of them submerged. The vessel was East of Suez for much of her deployment. Singer Nicky Kenyon, 36, whose husband Adrian serves with 29 Commando Royal Marines, said that she had left her husband to look after their children - and do all the Christmas shopping. 'He said: ""You support me when I go away (on active service) for six months, the least I can do is support you when you do this"",' she said. There will be no problem with the Christmas dinner, as Mr Kenyon is a master chef with the commando unit, based in North Devon.","Ladies perform Christmas charity single Wherever You Are .

A fashion model who claimed she was raped by a wealthy Saudi Prince has given a fresh testimony after prosecutors said some details needed to be clarified. The 23-year-old woman, who arrived at court in Ibiza yesterday wearing a black hat and dark sunglasses, repeated her accusation against the prince, despite what her lawyer called 'tough questioning'. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 56 - one of the world's richest men with an estimated fortune of £12.3billion - is accused of raping the model in Ibiza three years ago. The alleged victim claims she was lured on to the 384ft yacht Turama after her drink was spiked in a nightclub on the island. The prince is a leading investor in both Citigroup and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. media empire, and held 26th place on this year’s Forbes list of the world’s richest people. He is the nephew of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and bought London’s Savoy Hotel in 2005 for £250million. CNN said a statement issued by the prince's lawyer in Madrid reiterated the innocence of the billionaire. The statement said the prince . was with his family in France in August 2008, on a visit documented by his passport, mobile phone records, hotel receipts, photographs, video and eyewitness accounts. The prince and his lawyers were not . present at the hearing, but he insists he has not been in Ibiza in more than a decade, and that others have . tried to impersonate him. His lawyer Horacio Oliva said in a statement seen by CNN: 'We . strongly support the action of the Ibiza prosecutors and the judge to . fully examine the false, unsubstantiated and constantly evolving story . of the alleged victim, her mother and her lawyers. 'The multiple inconsistent accounts . lack even one corroborating witness nor do they present a single piece . of evidence regarding [the prince].' The two-hour, closed-door hearing . included the woman, two of her lawyers, the prosecutor and the . investigating magistrate who is in charge of the investigation, according to CNN. Prince Alwaleed is a leading investor in News Corp and bought the Savoy Hotel in 2005 for . £250million . The woman, a dual Spanish and German citizen, first made the allegation in Ibiza . in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it last year on grounds of insufficient evidence. However, after the model's appeal to the Balearic Island Provisional Court, the lower . court in Ibiza reopened the . investigation last July. It has made Prince Alwaleed a person 'imputado', or someone 'under official . investigation', said CNN - which is a step short of an . indictment. The prince has not yet been formally charged with . any crime. The magistrate is expected to ask the . prosecutor to formulate questions that Spain will send to officials in Saudi Arabia to ask of the prince, . according to CNN. The woman's lawyer, Max Turiel, said the prosecutor's pointed questions treated her 'as if she were the one under investigation and not the victim', reported CNN. According to an earlier court document, the woman believed her drink had been drugged and sent a text message to a friend stating as much. She said she awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as Prince Alwaleed. Mr Turiel told CNN last September that 'there were remains of semen' that should be examined against the prince's DNA, as well as 'remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had'.","23-year-old woman repeated claim she was drugged and attacked by prince three years ago .

A war veteran severely injured during Occupy Oakland protests in October made a stirring comeback yesterday as demonstrators blocked gates across some of the West Coast's busiest ports. Scott Olsen, who suffered a fractured skull when he was hit by a police tear gas canister on October 25, led more than 1,000 demonstrators from downtown Oakland, California, to the city's port as part of marches intended to bring cargo traffic to a halt. Wearing a neck brace, the 24-year-old was greeted with loud cheers as he addressed the crowd. War veteran Scott Olsen, who was injured by a police projectile during an Occupy Oakland protest on October 25, speaks in front of demonstrators at Oakland City Hall during the West Coast port blockage yesterday . War hero: Mr Olsen is carried to safety after suffering a fractured skull during the Occupy Oakland protests . 'Hi Occupy Oakland. It's a great day to be out here for my first event,' he told the throng in Frank Ogawa Plaza, site of the movement's former tent camp. 'I look forward to marching with you and joining you once again.' 'Stay peaceful, stay safe, let's do some real action today,' he added. Olsen served two tours in Iraq, working as a technician and earning a handful of service medals. But friends say he soured on military life after his discharge and started a now-defunct website called 'I hate the Marine Corps'. Yesterday's closures affected some of the terminals at the ports in Oakland, California, Portland, Oregon, and Longview, Washington, though it was not immediately clear how much the shutdowns would affect operations and what the economic loss would be. Determined: Scores of protesters remained at the Port of Oakland as darkness fell last night . A demonstrator wears a tent outside the Port of Oakland last night. There were a handful of arrests . From California to as far away as Vancouver, British Columbia, protesters picketed gates, beating drums, carrying signs such as 'Shutdown Wall St. on the Waterfront' and causing longer wait times for trucks. There were a handful of arrests so far, but no major clashes with police. While the demonstrations were largely peaceful and isolated to a few gates at each port, local officials in the union that represents longshoremen and, in some cases, port officials, determined that the conditions were unsafe for workers. In Oakland, shipping companies and the longshoremen's union agreed to send home about 150 workers, essentially halting operations at two terminals. In Portland, authorities shuttered two terminals after arresting two people who were carrying weapons. Blockade: Protesters set up a picket line at a Port of Portland terminal in Portland, Oregon as part of yesterday's West Coast 'day of action' And in Longview, Washington, workers were sent home out of concerns for their 'health and safety.' The movement, which sprang up this fall against what it sees as corporate greed and economic inequality, is focusing on the ports as the 'economic engines for the elite' in its most dramatic gesture since police raids cleared out most remaining Occupy tent camps last month. It was unclear whether demonstrators could amass in sufficient numbers to significantly disrupt or force more port closures as they did last month during an overnight shift at the Port of Oakland. The union that represents longshoremen says it doesn't support the shutdowns. Occupied: From the Port of Portland (here) to as far away as Vancouver, British Columbia, protesters picketed gates, beating drums, carrying signs such as 'Shutdown Wall St. on the Waterfront' Clash: Police push back protesters during the Occupy movements' attempt to shut down west coast ports in Long Beach, California yesterday . Handcuffed: San Diego police arrest a member of Occupy San Diego near the entrance to the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal during the demonstration . United: Across the country, protesters (here in Portland) say they are standing up for workers against the port companies, which have had high-profile clashes with union workers lately . Protesters are most upset by two West Coast companies: port operator SSA Marine and grain exporter EGT. The bank, Goldman Sachs, owns a major stake in SSA Marine and has been a frequent target of protesters. They say they are standing up for workers against the port companies, which have had high-profile clashes with union workers lately. Longshoremen at the Port of Longview, for example, have had a longstanding dispute with EGT. In Oakland, officials urged protesters to consider the impact on workers. Port workers and truck drivers say the protests will hurt them. Several hundred people picketed at the port before dawn and blocked some trucks from going through at least two entrances. A long line of big rigs sat outside one of the entrances, unable to drive into the port. 'This is joke. What are they protesting?' said Christian Vega, 32, who sat in his truck carrying a load of recycled paper from Pittsburg, California, on Monday morning. He said the delay was costing him $600.

Strong armed: Police push back protesters during the Occupy movement in Long Beach . 'It only hurts me and the other drivers. We have jobs and families to support and feed. Most of them don't,' Ms Vega said. Police in riot gear monitored the . scene as protesters marched in an oval and carried signs. No major . clashes were reported. Protesters cheered when they learned about the . partial shutdown and they then dispersed. The . longshoremen's union said 150 workers were sent home after . demonstrators blocked two entrances. Union spokesman Craig Merrilees . said shipping companies agreed with workers' concerns about their . safety. Those in unaffected parts of the port remained on the job. 'It's . disappointing that those union folks were not able to go to work today . and earn their wages,' SSA spokesman Bob Watters said. He added: 'We . think that everything is pretty well in hand and operations are moving . along pretty well now.' In . Portland, Oregon, a couple of hundred protesters blocked semitrailers . from making deliveries at two major terminals. Security concerns were . raised when police found two people in camouflage clothing with a gun, . sword and walkie-talkies who said they were doing reconnaissance. Tackled: San Diego police arrest a member of Occupy San Diego near the entrance to the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal . Push back: A protester is shoved by an Alameda County Sheriff Department officer as police attempted to leave the Port of Oakland . Marching on: Protesters hold up signs of opposition as they walk to the port entrance in Long Beach . Port officials erected fences and told workers to stay home, port spokesman Josh Thomas said. He said port officials didn't know early Monday afternoon the full economic impact of the blockade. 'We're talking about tenants, customers, truckers, rail providers, a pretty far reaching group, and most of these people are not employed by the port,' Mr Thomas said. 'To say it's going to be X amount of dollars right now is impossible.' Kari Koch, an Occupy spokeswoman, said the two people taken into custody were not part of the demonstration. 'We do not send out folks with guns,' Mr Koch said. The decision to shut down the two terminals was relayed to about 200 workers from the longshoremen's union, which said it sympathized with the goals of the movement but disagreed with shutting down operations that would deprive its members of pay. In Vancouver, demonstrators briefly blocked two gates at Port Metro Vancouver. The Canadian Press reported demonstrators held up a large banner proclaiming solidarity with longshoremen involved in the Port of Longview dispute. The disruption lasted an hour before the protest moved to a second gate, blocking it for less than 30 minutes before moving on.

Defiant: A protester stands in front of police at the entrance to the Port Authority in Vancouver, British Columbia, blocking traffic . Bottlenecked: Police hold back protesters to allow trucks through at the entrance to Port Authority in Vancouver . Longshoremen at the Longview port went home for the day over concerns for their health and safety, union spokeswoman Jennifer Sargent said. A port spokeswoman, Ashley Helenberg, said the both the port and the union made the decision. Helenberg said about 20 shifts were affected. The port had one vessel to work today. Sargent said that if union workers participated in the protest, they did so as individuals, not as part of the union. Organizers of the port demonstrations said they hope to draw thousands to stand in solidarity with longshoremen and port truckers they said are being exploited. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, however, distanced itself from the shutdown effort. The union's president suggested in a letter to members that protesters were attempting to co-opt the union's cause to advance their own. Shutdown supporters said they're not asking longshoremen to organise a work stoppage in violation of their contract. They said they are simply asking them to exercise their free speech rights and stay off the job, in keeping with the union's historic tradition of activism. If protesters muster large enough numbers to block entrances, arbitrators could declare unsafe working conditions. That would allow port workers to stay home. Officials at West Coast ports said they have been coordinating with law enforcement agencies as they prepare for possible disruptions. Protesters said police crackdowns in any city will trigger an extension of blockades in other cities as a show of resolve.","Closures affected terminals at ports in Oakland, Portland and Longview Washington .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Last updated at 12:40 AM on 14th December 2011 . It's a shame you can’t claim diplomatic immunity from the weather. If you could, ex-ambassador Richard Wilkinson would still have his roof, his bedroom and his left ear intact.Sadly for him, not even our man in Chile was protected from the severe storms that battered Britain yesterday. Lucky escape: Former ambassador Richard Wilkinson was asleep in bed when he received a rude awakening . Incredibly, he did escape serious injury when a beech tree crashed through his house at 4am – and landed on his bed. Elsewhere, homes were evacuated and left without power, roads were closed,  ferries cancelled and flood warnings put in place as 60mph winds swept in. Close shave: Richard Wilkinson, a former ambassador, avoided serious injury . Mr Wilkinson, 65, who held ambassadorial posts in Chile and Venezuela, was hurt when the 60ft beech tree snapped in half and crashed into his £600,000 home in  Winchester, Hampshire. The majority of it fell on to the side of the bed where his wife Angela, 52, normally sleeps. Thankfully, she was away from home at the time. Mr Wilkinson, who is now chairman of the board of governors at Winchester University, said: ‘I was lying in bed half asleep, half-awake because of the storm when suddenly there was this incredible crash. I knew exactly what had happened. ‘When I awoke fully, either a tile or a brick or a piece of branch struck my head quite hard. Luckily it just sliced my ear.’ Reliving the moment the tree hit, he said: ‘I am just so lucky that I wasn’t lying on the other side of the bed – it was very close. The debris missed me by inches but it would have been on my wife’s side of the bed.’ The Met Office said the storms battering Britain could worsen later this week. Chief forecaster Tim Hewson said: ‘There is potential for a significant storm and we are keeping a close eye on the situation.’ Crash site: Fortunately for Mr Wilkinson, the tree landed on the empty side of the bed . Yesterday, more than 300 homes were . left without power in Brixton, Devon, as gusts of up to 70mph lashed the . South West. Some homes were evacuated for fear of trees falling on . them. Cornwall was . also badly hit by heavy rain and flooded roads. Ferries were affected . and the supply ship between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly was forced . to stay in port. In Ashford, Kent, a mother gave birth to a baby boy in the back of her car after gales delayed her journey to hospital. Mother-of-three . Caelyn McDonnell made it as far as the ambulance bay of the William . Harvey Hospital when her 5lb 12oz son arrived. He was delivered safely . by a rain-soaked ambulance crew. Waves batter the harbour wall and lighthouse at Porthcawl, in south Wales, as the strong winds continued to batter Britain yesterday . Forecasters have said the stormy conditions are likely to last for at least the rest of the week . In . Charvil, Berkshire, a van full of money being taken to fill cash . machines was abandoned after becoming stuck in a swollen ford, which . rose 2ft in 24 hours. The van had to be winched by firemen out of the . River Loddon. In . Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, dozens of people had to flee after gusts of . wind stripped the roof off a block of flats. High winds also swept away . an anti-capitalist camp in Brighton. At Burgess Hill, West Sussex, the storms raised fears for a pensioner who disappeared after walking his wife to work on Monday. Blizzards on higher ground across the north, including here at the Yorkshire/Durham border, made for dangerous driving conditions . The wintry storms will mean more snow on higher ground, such as here near High Force in Teesdale, County Durham . Police believe Eric Price, 79, may have become confused on public transport after deciding to take a trip to Eastbourne. In West Chiltington, West Sussex, a family of four had an amazing . escape after stormy weather sent a tree crashing through a conservatory . used as a play space by their children. Mike . and Katie Gower, aged 46, were sitting in the living room of . their bungalow shortly before going to bed when the branches shattered . the glass and alluminium structure. Storm clouds begin to gather over the snow-covered Yorkshire/Durham border . Waves break over the sea wall behind houses on the Cobb at Lyme Regis as the stormy conditions continued across the UK . 'It sounded like a loud clap of thunder initially but then I quickly realised it wasn't,' said management consultant Mike, 59. 'We've . got trees all around but they are quite far back. I'm quite shocked by . the situation really - it's not like we hadn't been in that room. 'It's . usually a playroom for the children and their toys were in there. My . wife had put some toys away about an before it happened so she's quite . lucky she wasn't in there when it happened. It's just a nightmare.' Children Jamie, six, and Isobel, nine, were tucked up in bed on the other side of the house. The stormy conditions whip up the sea at Lyme Regis, Dorset . Today: . Staying mostly cloudy across north-west Scotland with further showery . outbreaks of rain, once again falling as sleet or snow over the high . ground. Sunny spells and showers across the rest of the UK,the . showers most frequent across Wales and southern and western areas of . England. The showers will be heavy with the risk of hail and the odd . rumble of thunder. Winds easing across northern areas, but strengthening . in the South through the afternoon. UK Outlook: Turning increasingly cloudy from the South West through the . afternoon with heavy rain arriving in southern and western areas. Very . windy for a time across eastern England on Friday with . heavy rain and hill snow clearing, to leave a bright day across the UK . with sunny spells and heavy showers, these mostly in the South West . Meanwhile in Scotland, severe weather warnings of snow were issued yesterday – with gusts of up to 80mph expected. Heavy snowfall above 200 metres could lead to blizzard conditions. The alert follows last Thursday’s storm, which battered the country leaving thousands of homes without power. The . bad weather also forced a seal pup to find sanctuary with a flock of . sheep after being driven ashore by winds in Holm, Orkney. The pup, . nicknamed Snowy, was separated from his colony and crawled into a field . full of sheep where he fell asleep. Tom Tobler, of Meteogroup, the Press . Association's weather arm, said that tomorrow and Friday would . potentially see 'the strongest winds of the week'. He said 70mph gusts had been recorded in Devon, and were likely to continue. 'Anywhere along the south coast could . see gusts of up to 70mph,' he said. 'It is windy everywhere . particularly around the western and south coasts.'","Former British ambassador to Chile is injured when tree falls on his house .

"By . Kirsty Walker and Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 1:29 AM on 14th December 2011 . Email exchange: Documents have shown that James Murdoch received a message in 2008 saying hacking at the News of the World was 'rife' but he claims he didn't read it . News International chief James Murdoch was sent details of claims that phone-hacking was ‘rife’ at the News of the World in 2008, explosive new emails have revealed. Mr Murdoch was contacted by the paper’s then editor Colin Myler which discussed the decision to settle a court case with footballers’ union chief Gordon Taylor. The exchanges between News of the World executives and lawyers warn that Mr Taylor was determined to ‘demonstrate what happened to him was rife throughout the organisation.’ Mr Myler, who forwarded the email exchanges to Mr Murdoch, added: ‘Unfortunately it is as bad as we feared’. In the email dated Saturday, June 7, 2008, Mr Myler went on to ask for ‘five minutes’ with him the following Tuesday. Mr Murdoch replies two minutes later saying: ‘No worries. I am in during the afternoon.  If you want to talk before I’ll be home tonight after seven and most of the day tomorrow.’ Mr Murdoch has repeatedly denied he had any knowledge that phone hacking at the New of the World went beyond one ‘rogue’ reporter. The News International chief yesterday stuck to these claims saying he was ‘confident’ that he had not read the full email chain. His denials have been disputed by former executives who say they discussed a crucial email proving that hacking was more widespread at the subsequent meeting on 10 June 2008. The email - known as the ‘for Neville’ email – implied that the practice went beyond Mr Goodman, who was jailed in 2007 after pleading guilty to phone hacking. Hasty reply: James Murdoch responded just two minutes after receiving this email from Colin Myler, later claiming that he did not read the full email chain below it . Correspondence: The second page of emails between Julian Pike and Tom Crone talking about the case involving PFA chief Gordon Taylor . Mr Myler and former News International . legal chief Tom Crone have told MPs the email was the sole reason for . deciding to pay a settlement of £425,000 to Mr Taylor. Mr Murdoch insists that the meeting was simply to authorise an increased settlement offer to Mr Taylor and that he was not shown the email or told that it proved that wrong-doing was more widespread than previously thought. In a letter to MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, Mr Murdoch yesterday said he could not have read the email exchange in full because of the  ‘timing of my response, just over two minutes after Mr Myler sent his email to me, and the fact that I typically received emails on my Blackberry on weekends. Murdoch's reply: This is the letter the News International chief sent to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee saying that he did not read the email properly . ‘Instead, having agreed to meet the following Tuesday, I would have relied on the oral briefing on 10 June 2008 that I have previously described in my testimony before the committee. ‘I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my past testimony that I was not aware of evidence that either pointed to widespread wrongdoing or indicated that further investigation was necessary.’ Yesterday Mr Crone admitted to the . Leveson inquiry into Press standards that the paper’s attempts to blame . the phone hacking scandal on a single ‘rogue reporter’ would ‘come back . and bite it’. He accepted . there was the appearance of ‘a cover-up’ at the paper after former royal . editor Clive Goodman was jailed for phone hacking in January 2007. Meeting: Colin Myler and Tom Crone say they told Mr Murdoch about the notorious 'For Neville' email which said hacking was not limited to a single reporter during a meeting with him on June 10, 2008. Murdoch denies they did so . Mr Crone, head of legal at News International for 20 years, said he became aware ‘other journalists’ might have hacked phones after Goodman was jailed. Claims: The email exchange concerned allegations made by PFA head Gordon Taylor, and are thought to be the sole reason he received a £425,000 pay off . He said his view was based on private detective Glenn Mulcaire pleading guilty to hacking five ‘non-Royal victims’, who were not hacked by Goodman. These included supermodel Elle MacPherson, the publicist Max Clifford, footballers union boss Gordon Taylor and Simon Hughes MP. Robert Jay, QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked if ‘the party line being peddled’ that there was only one rogue reporter ever caused concern. Mr Crone said: ‘Yes. My feeling is I thought it would probably come back to bite the people who were saying it.’ Asked if he was concerned there was a ‘culture of cover-up’, Mr Crone said ‘to some extent.’ The inquiry also heard from Julian Pike, a partner at the law firm Farrer & Co, which advised News International. He said he believed the ‘rogue reporter’ defence was untrue and unsustainable after the police disclosed evidence in the Gordon Taylor privacy case brought against News International, in April 2008, in which Mr Taylor was paid more than £700,000 in damages and costs. He told the inquiry it was ‘self evident’ that News International did not want allegations about its ‘culture of illegal information access’ aired in public.","News International chief says he did not read email exchange .

"By . David Richards . Last updated at 4:13 PM on 14th December 2011 . Nick Clegg took his seat alongside the Prime Minister today for the final session of Prime Minister's Questions before Christmas today. On Monday the pro-European Deputy Prime Minister failed to take his seat on the Government front benches to hear David Cameron defend his use of the veto at the EU summit which saw him dubbed 'the incredible sulk'. Shortly after the start of the session to loud cheers from Labour MPs Ed Miliband gestured to Mr Clegg and said: 'It is good to see the Deputy Prime Minister back on the frontbench.' Rather not be here? Nick Clegg looks into the distance as David Cameron begins PMQs in the Commons today . The Prime Minister speaking on Monday in the House of Commons where he defended his decision to veto a new European Union treaty amid criticism from Mr Clegg that the move was 'bad for Britain' Paul Waugh, editor of PoliticsHome.com, pointed out with this tweet that with David Miliband not in the Chamber, he'd effectively 'done a Nick' Labour MPs mocked Mr Clegg for exposing coalition rifts over Europe by staying away from the chamber on Monday for the Prime Minister's statement on the Brussels summit. Mr Miliband said that Mr Cameron had promised the coalition Government would operate in a 'collegiate' way, and asked: 'What's gone wrong?' But Mr Cameron retorted: 'No one in this House is going to be surprised that Conservatives and Liberal Democrats don't always agree about Europe... 'I make no apology for standing up for Britain.' Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron that negotiations on the implementation of last week's inter-governmental agreement on a new fiscal compact for the eurozone would continue until March and it was not too late for the UK to rejoin discussions. 'In the cold light of day, with other countries spending the weeks and months ahead trying to see if they can get a better deal for themselves, isn't the sensible thing to do to re-enter the negotiations and try to get a better deal for Britain?' asked the Labour leader. Mr Miliband also offered his sympathy to Mr Clegg, who was woken in the early hours of last Friday to be told that Mr Cameron had used the veto to block EU treaty changes designed to impose new fiscal disciplines on eurozone states. The Deputy Prime Minister addresses business leaders this morning. European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said yesterday that a demand by Britain for its financial services industry to be exempted from EU regulation threatened to break up the single market . David Cameron leaves Downing Street as he prepares to address Prime Ministers Question's at the House of Commons . 'I think our sympathy is with the . Deputy Prime Minister,' said the Labour leader. 'His partner goes on a . business trip, he is left waiting by the phone and he hears nothing . until a rambling phone call at 4am confessing to a terrible mistake.' But Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband had . failed to make clear whether he would have signed the proposed treaty, . taunting him: 'This leader of the Labour Party makes weakness and . indecision into an art form.' Mr Cameron sought to turn Mr . Miliband's accusations of a rift back on the Labour leader by . highlighting his own differences with brother David. Responding to the Labour leader's . taunts about his row with Mr Clegg, the Prime Minister said to loud Tory . cheers: 'He shouldn't believe everything he reads in the papers. It's . not that bad - it's not like we're brothers or anything.' Paul Waugh, editor of PoliticsHome.com, tweeted that with David Miliband not in the Chamber, he'd effectively 'done a Nick' Then looking directly at Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron hit back at the Labour leader for not saying what he would have done at the Euro summit. 'He has completely united his party, . every single one has asked Santa for the same thing, a new leader for . Christmas,' said the Prime Minister. The clash came shortly after Mr Clegg . met a group of pro-European business leaders who are concerned over the . use of the veto and over Mr Cameron's threat to block the use of EU . institutions to support the new compact. Despite the deep differences on . Europe between the coalition parties exposed by Mr Cameron's decision to . deploy the UK veto last week, Mr Clegg insisted he spoke for the whole . Government in asserting the need for Britain to 're-engage' with Europe. The . Deputy Prime Minister was addressing members of pro-single market group . Business For New Europe (BNE), whose director Philip Souta said Mr . Cameron was mistaken to wield the veto. The breakfast meeting in a London hotel . came just hours before Mr Clegg was appeared alongside Mr . Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. Mr Clegg and his Liberal Democrat MPs abstained en masse last night rather than back a motion congratulating Mr Cameron for protecting British interests in Brussels. He told the business leaders: 'As the dust settles on the summit that took place last week, I speak here on behalf of the whole coalition Government, notwithstanding the differences of view between the parties within the Government. 'The whole Government is absolutely determined to re-engage with our European partners, to get back on the front foot and to make sure that our vital national economic self-interest in being at the heart of the single market is properly followed through the weeks and months ahead.' He told the BNE Advisory Council members, including Tory peer and former European Commissioner Lord Brittan, Centrica chairman Sir Roger Carr and BAA chief executive Colin Matthews: 'You know as well as I do that your businesses and millions of people's jobs in this country depend on our place at the heart of the single market.' Mr Clegg said there was 'a considerable amount of uncertainty' about how the fiscal compact agreed by up to 26 EU states in Brussels last Friday would work in practice. Following yesterday's Cabinet meeting, there was speculation that Mr Cameron may be prepared to offer an olive branch to Lib Dem colleagues by softening his objections to the EU institutions, like the Commission and European Court of Justice, being used to support the compact. Mr Clegg called for 'calm' after the confrontational rhetoric seen yesterday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, where some MEPs issued demands for Britain to lose its rebate in retaliation for its lack of 'solidarity'. 'We saw some pretty intemperate remarks aimed at Britain yesterday in the European Parliament,' said Mr Clegg. 'I hope we can move beyond that and work together to ensure that our calm, reasoned and engaged voice is heard positively within the EU institutions in the period to come.' With three million British jobs dependent on the single market, he said Government and business should work together to ensure that 'those countries that invest very heavily in the UK from Asia, from Latin America and elsewhere are absolutely in no doubt that Britain is and will always remain a gateway for trade and for the exchange of services and goods into the European single market'. He added: 'That is the reason they invested in Britain in the first place and we must make absolutely sure that they remain confident that these reasons still prevail and still support further decisions for increased investment in the UK.' Mr Clegg was flanked at the meeting - chaired by BNE chairman Roland Rudd - by Lib Dem Cabinet colleagues Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and Danny Alexander as well as senior backbencher David Laws. Mr Souta told the Press Association that BNE was a coalition of 'pragmatic pro-European business leaders who want the British Government to be engaged in the process'. 'We think that we need to support the eurozone and the best way of doing that is by ensuring that the Commission and Court and the institutions are involved in this new fiscal compact,' said Mr Souta. 'If the euro collapses it will have a massive negative impact on Britain. 'We think the PM did the wrong thing in using the veto.' Leaving after an hour's discussions, Mr Rudd said: 'We had a really good meeting and we are all on the same page and want constructive engagement and finding the formula that gets us back in with the 26. 'Business clearly wants a deepening and widening of the single market and that is what our message is in terms of wanting to see greater reforms. We are not defending the status quo, we are trying to see a changed and reformed Europe.' Asked if Mr Cameron was wrong to use the veto, Mr Rudd said: 'I think people are concerned about the position we are in but they are encouraged at what they have heard recently.'","To Labour cheers, Ed Miliband : 'It is good to see the Deputy Prime Minister back on the front bench'

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 5:03 PM on 14th December 2011 . Slimming is always easier if you have a dieting partner. So how lucky for bride Kate Bonwick that her husband, John Butler, also wanted to lose weight before their wedding. And they are clearly both great motivators. The pair lost nearly 20 stone between them ahead of their big day - with Kate leading the way. The bride-to-be, 25, lost half her body weight - going from 24 stone to 12 - after falling for John, 27, two years ago. Before and after: Kate and John before they started dieting (left) and on their wedding day . After shedding the pounds, the telesales manager from Bognor Regis, Sussex was finally able to fit into the wedding dress she had always dreamed of. And with supportive Kate's encouragement, 23-stone builder John lost more than seven stone, reaching 15.5 stone for the ceremony in November. Kate said: 'Our wedding was the best day of my life. I felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person. 'It was very emotional for my family, seeing me like that. They love me for who I am on the inside and so does John, but they knew how much I wanted to be slim, so it was special for them too. 'The day was magical. We married at a beautiful church in an intimate ceremony, and then flew off on honeymoon to Florida. For the first time in years I wasn't ashamed to go to the beach.' Kate said before she met John she had no confidence and was always the butt of jokes about her weight. She said: 'When I went into pubs with my friends I was used to hearing people say ""look at the size of her!"" I pretended I didn't hear it but I was so unhappy. I was 23 and hated the way I looked. 'I hated my clothes and thought I looked awful - I didn't have a social life. I was always first to leave the party because I felt uncomfortable. Kate said: 'Our wedding was the best day of my life. I felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person' 'I ate the wrong things. I could eat four packets of crisps and a whole packet of biscuits in one day. I never ate fruit and vegetables - I preferred to eat takeaways and kebabs four or five times a week. 'But when I walked down the aisle on my wedding day, people were saying how beautiful I looked. It was amazing.' Kate used to consume thousands of calories per day eating burgers and pizzas every night. She skipped breakfast in the morning preferring to snack on crisps and chocolate from the vending machines at work during the day. For lunch Kate would buy an unhealthy sandwich or burger from a shop, then for dinner gorge on chicken nuggets and pizza. Each meal would be washed down with litres of fizzy drinks. But fearing she would be alone forever, Kate vowed to turn her life around. 'I hated the way I looked': Kate on holiday in Alicante when she weighed more than 20 stone . After joining the Lighter Life slimming programme she lost four stone before starting internet dating. Kate said: 'John was the first person I contacted on the site. 'We spoke on the phone and emailed but when the time came to meet I was so nervous. I weighed 20 stone and even though he was large as well I was worried he would take one look at me and run a mile. 'We went to a restaurant and I ordered the healthiest thing on the menu - even though I hated it.' After finding love the pair encouraged eat other to lose weight and start regular exercise. Now Kate says she feels like a different person and enjoys cooking healthy food for her and her husband. Weighed down: Kate weighed 24 stone when she was 18, and John has lost more than seven stone since this picture was taken in 2008 (right) She said: 'Now I love going out - I actually feel like I've never done it before because it's so different as a slim person.' For breakfast Kate now eats two scrambled eggs and a banana, lunch is grilled chicken or fish with salad and for dinner she enjoys roast vegetables with grilled meat. She said: 'I was determined to get into the kind of dress I always wanted to wear to my wedding. 'When I met John I was a dress size 26, but by the time we came to get married I was wearing a size 14 dress. 'John has always been a yo-yo dieter, but now he eats healthily like me, although he will eat more of what we make. We encourage eat other to live a healthier lifestyle and we go swimming and to the gym together. 'John is hilarious, he's the soppiest man I've ever met and he's also my best friend. When he proposed in June 2010 he told me he loved me and wanted to spend of his life with me.' John added: 'I feel so lucky to have met Kate. We're perfect for each other and she keeps me looking my best.'",Kate Butler lost 12 stone ahead of her wedding and John lost more than seven stone .
"John Atterberry, 40, had worked with the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson . By . Lydia Warren . Last updated at 4:22 PM on 13th December 2011 . Champagne lifestyle: John Atterberry, 40, died after being shot in the face while driving to the bank on Sunset Boulevard last week . A music executive has died after he was randomly shot by a crazed gunman while running a quick errand to the bank. John Atterberry, 40, passed away on Monday at Cedars-Sinai . Medical Center in Los Angeles, three days after he was gunned down on Sunset Boulevard. Mr Atterberry, who had worked with the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson, was shot in the jaw and torso by gunman Tyler Brehm. The 40-year-old, who worked as a film producer, was driving his Mercedes-Benz when he was seriously injured. The . businessman had risen to vice-president at Death Row Records which . produced artists such as Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. He later founded Infusion Music Group, a . music publishing company with credits on albums by Michael Jackson, . Christina Aguilera, Brandy, the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson. Mr Atterberry's Facebook page was flooded with tributes from friends and colleagues. Shaunie . O'Neal, wife of former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, wrote on . Twitter: 'RIP John keepin the Atterberry family n my prayers.' All My Children actress Liz Vassey added: 'RIP John Atterberry. Shot by the gunman on Sunset and Vine on Friday of last week. God bless his family. 40 years old. Tragic.' Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton said: 'R.I.P. #JohnAtterberry Sending love and strength to his family and friends!'

Brehm's ex-girlfriend said the couple had recently broken up but police said they're still looking . for a motive for the attack. Brehm walked down the middle of . Sunset Boulevard, firing on motorists with no clear target and injuring . three of them before two police officers who happened to be in the . area - an off-duty motorcycle officer working movie set security and a . detective - shot and killed him, according to authorities. Party-loving: Mr Atterberry with basketball player Shaquille O'Neal whose wife Shaunie left her condolences on Twitter . The gunman's former girlfriend has described how she woke to 14 text messages informing her of his death. Alicia Alligood, 24, had broken up with her boyfriend of four-and-a-half years just days before he went on the shooting spree. She . was unaware of his involvement in the shooting until she woke at 7 am . the following day to 14 text messages - some from the shooter himself. Brehm, . who neighbours said struggled to get over the December 1 breakup, sent . messages minutes before he stood on the Hollywood intersection and shot . at passing vehicles. He had also left Alligood a voicemail hours earlier, telling her he loved her. But Alligood described her former boyfriend . as a 'humanitarian', and someone who was 'extremely motivated to change . the world for the better', even managing a non-profit organisation for a . friend. He had met a woman he thought was a . pharmaceutical saleswoman who had given him some kind of pills, Alligood . said. He began taking the pills, which Alligood found alarming as he had never taken 'hard' drugs before. After the breakup, he had moved to his own apartment half a mile from the scene of the shooting, she said . Down: Police shot the gunman dead after he injured three motorists and refused to drop his weapon . Happier times: Tyler Brehm and ex-girlfriend Alicia Alligood are believed to have broken up four days before he went on a shooting rampage through Hollywood. The couple had been together for more than four years . Drama: The gunman stands in the middle of the road as he prepares to shoot the driver of the passing pickup . Neighbours said Brehm had been . struggling to overcome the separation. ‘He wasn't a bad guy, he just got fed up,’ friend Christina Mesropian told KNBC. ‘He was like “Ah, I'm over it, I'm over it,” but I could tell he wasn't over it.’ Ramon Hernandez, who lived in the . apartment next door to Brehm, said the couple had recently moved out. He . told KABC-TV he had heard them arguing. ‘I could tell that he was an unstable person,’ Hernandez said, ‘but I don't know the details on what actually made him snap.’ Police have not yet announced a motive for the crime, but Alligood said she believed the breakup was the trigger. Brehm, who was Hispanic and dressed in . a white vest, walked down the middle of Sunset Boulevard on Friday, firing . on motorists and in the air until he was shot and killed. Passers-by initially thought he was an actor from a movie being filmed nearby. Brehm . killed Mr Atterberry and wounded two others before he was killed by an . off-duty officer working as a security guard on the neighbouring film, . believed to be Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling's crime drama, Gangster Squad. It is unknown if the actors were on set during the real-life shooting, but they would have heard the gunfire. He was filmed from an office block as he stood in the middle of the road firing on pedestrians and motorists. In the video, he can be seen pacing . back and forth near the busy intersection with Vine Street, firing close . to 20 rounds from what appeared to be a .40 caliber handgun. Witness Micah Williams said he . thought the suspect was part of a movie. ‘Then the third bullet . ricocheted right by our head and I was like, “Dude, they’re shooting at . us,” ’ he said. Questionable interests: In his Twitter profile picture, Tyler Brehm clearly displays a bong in the background . Another bystander, Gregory Bojorquez, . said: ‘At first it seemed like a movie but then I heard the sound of the . bullets hitting metal. It was bizarre, like something from a cop show. You get so used to seeing filming in LA that lots of people were . watching it thinking it was for a film.’ It is thought the gunman ran out of bullets and had pulled a knife from his belt when he was shot by the policeman. ‘He was screaming he was going to die and that he wanted to die,’ Bojorquez, a photographer who captured images of the shooting's aftermath, told the Los Angeles Times. 'He was just kind of shooting spontaneously,' witness William Wiles told The Baltimore Sun Times, recalling what he saw as he watched incident from his bedroom window. Dead: Brehm's body is covered with a blanket after the confrontation where he screamed: 'I want to die' 'He didn't really have any mission or purpose or anyone in particular,' Mr Wiles continued. One . man suffered a grazing wound to his left thigh when a bullet passed . through his car door. Another man had minor cuts from broken glass after . bullet struck the driver door where it met the window. Another witness, Chris Johns, said: . 'This was like a serious mad man. He snapped and he's going to try to . kill as many people as possible.' He continued shooting at vehicles and in the air when he was confronted by the officers. They . ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He was shot when he pointed his . weapon at the officers. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene. Success: Record executive John Atterberry strikes a formal pose with former vice-president Dick Cheney . A truck and another car were struck by bullets, and two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. In . the Los Angeles area, every movie production is required to have a . permit, so if there is shooting,  for a movie, locals are notified for . any loud noises and big signs are placed on street corners. The . area was cordoned off and the gunman lay under a white sheet in the . street hours after the gunfire, leaving traffic tangled on busy . Hollywood streets, an area is packed with stores and restaurants. See below for video .","John Atterberry, 40, had worked with the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson ."
"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:34 PM on 15th December 2011 . A man accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence today apologised to a jury after a police tape of his racist tirade was played to the court. David Norris told the Old Bailey he was 'ashamed' of comments he made in 1994 when he said he would torture black people. He said: 'I apologise for what you've had to listen to in the courtroom.' David Norris gives evidence to the Old Bailey today in the Stephen Lawrence murder trial. He said he was 'certainly not' involved in the killing . Extracts of surveillance footage shot at co-defendant Gary Dobson's flat in Eltham, south-east London, were played to the jury for a second time today. In one of the clips, Norris is heard . saying: 'If I was going to kill myself do you know what I would do? I . would go and kill every black c***, every Paki, every copper, every mug . that I know, I'm telling you.' Later . he said: 'I would go down Catford and places like that, I am telling . you now, with two sub machine guns, and I am telling you I would take . one of them, skin the black c*** alive mate, torture him, set him . alight... I would blow their two arms and legs off and say ""go on, you . can swim home now"". They would be bobbing around like that.' David Norris' mother was today accused of giving a false alibi for her son. Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC told the Stephen Lawrence murder trial that Theresa Norris invented the story that her son was at home when the black teenager was murdered in April 1993. He told her: 'The first that we've heard of any suggestion that you can alibi your son for this murder is today. I suggest to you that as a result of that you have made it up and it's a recent thing that you have made it up.' Mrs Norris said: 'I haven't made nothing up.' Mr Ellison said: 'There's not been a breath uttered until today that you were in a position to give your son an alibi.' She answered: 'My son would have been at home.' Today Norris, 35, told the jury that he was angry after being accused of Mr Lawrence's murder and would never stage such an attack. 'I wouldn't dream of doing something like that, I was just angry, I was suffering from all sorts of stuff,' he said. Norris went on: 'I got accused of a murder, a terrible murder, and I was angry, especially with the police force... I'm not saying I'm perfect, I'm far from perfect, but to accuse me of murder. I was angry, very angry.' Before the clip was shown, he said: 'I don't like to watch it to be honest with you, I'm ashamed.' Norris told the court that people would swear at him and threaten him after he was accused of the killing. He said: 'I had to see my mum cry herself to sleep every night and it broke my heart.' Later he added: 'I was not party to Stephen Lawrence's death. 'I played no part whatsoever in his death. I'm not an angel, never have been an angel, but I'm also not a murderer.' The surveillance footage also showed Norris recounting a fight when he called a black man 'a black c***' and a f****** c**n'. The man had come to intervene in a brawl that Norris was having in a park. David Norris, right, today apologised to the jury after a tape of his racist tirade was played to the court. Both Norris and Gary Dobson, left, deny murder . Today Norris said: 'I thought he was . getting involved so I punched him... He basically came to help me which . made me feel terrible... I believe I called him a racist word.' But he denied being racially prejudiced at the time despite using racist obscenities. Stephen . Batten QC, for Norris, asked him: 'It's not just using language Mr . Norris, it's holding views. Did you as a boy aged 16 not just use . impolite language about black people but were you prejudiced against . them?' Norris replied: 'No I would say I was not, I just said words and didn't really know what I was saying.' Murdered: Stephen Lawrence, 18, who was stabbed to death at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993 . The court heard Norris, who was 16 at the . time, was living with his mother in Chislehurst, and . had ‘given up on school’. He added that at the age of 16, his . mother would not have allowed him to be away from his home in . Chislehurst, Kent, on a weekday night. Another clip showed his friend Neil Acourt hiding a large knife in his trousers before the pair went out. Norris said this was unremarkable at . the time, and that Mr Acourt had told him he went out armed because 'he . was worried about attacks'. The . defendant, who was 16 at the time of the murder, also told the jury . that a sweatshirt and jeans upon which forensic evidence was found did . not belong to him. The jury was shown pictures of his brother wearing the clothes while out fishing. Norris said he could not explain how . fibres got there. He said the clothing was not his and he had only moved . to the room a week before. Asked if there could be an innocent explanation, he said: 'If I don't . know who killed that Stephen Lawrence, then I don't know if I bumped . into them.' Pressed on whether it could have been one of his friends, he replied: 'I don't . know. They told me they had nothing to do with it and I believe them.' The defence has suggested that the clothes could have been contaminated after they were seized by police. Asked later about whether he had a girlfriend named Cheryl in Eltham at the time, Norris said he did not recognise the name. But Mr Ellison asked him to look at a transcript of a 1999 television interview he did with Martin Bashir. He asked him if he had agreed that it was 50-50 whether he was in Eltham on the night. He said: 'No, sir.' Norris said he had never been able to remember what he was doing on the night, but he had not attacked Mr Lawrence. He added: 'I had no girlfriend by the name of Cheryl that I can remember.' Mr Ellison read from the transcript: . 'Interviewer ""On the day in question, as best you can remember, it is . most likely you spent some of the day in Eltham?"" 'Answer: ""Yes."" Interviewer: ""So you may have been in Eltham with your girlfriend that night?"" 'Answer: ""50%, yeah"".' Mr Ellison asked: 'Making things up for TV?' Norris replied: 'I don't remember saying it. Norris and Dobson, 36, both deny murdering the black A-level student at a bus stop in Eltham in April 1993. The case continues.","Norris, 35, tells court he was 'angry' after being accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence when he said he would torture black people .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 4:07 PM on 15th December 2011 . The entry-level phone is the first Windows Phone from Nokia in the U.S. and is targeted at the 150 million Americans who have yet to make the transition to smartphones . It's a pairing of two also-rans - Nokia, the Finnish phone company whose phones have lost market share to rivals such as Apple and HTC, and T-Mobile, the no. 4 U.S. mobile service. But Nokia's 'starter' smartphone, Lumia 710, might have the secret sauce required for succces - it's just $50. It's aimed at the 150 million Americans who have yet to use touchscreen 'smartphones' such as iPhone. Nokia's 'comeback' phone - running Microsoft's colourful, simple Windows Phone software - will launch in the U.S. on January 11, exclusive to T-Mobile. It has a 3.7-inch colour touchscreen and five-megapixel camera - which puts it behind technology leaders such as iPhone 4S and Samsung's Galaxy S2. But it offers internet, email and downloadable apps, just like its rivals - and also Angry Birds. The phone will miss the crucial holiday sales season, though. It's the first Nokia smartphone running Windows in the U.S. Windows Mobile has also failed to make a dent in the market so far - analysts Gartner said that the software only accounted for 1.6 per cent of the market worldwide earlier this year. It's a make-or-break launch for both Nokia and Microsoft - and aimed squarely at first-time smartphone buyers. Nokia's Lumia 710 will be available on T-Mobile's 4G network on January 11 next year - priced at just $50, and aimed at the 150 million Americans who don't use smartphones such as iPhone . The $49.99 price could be crucial in luring some of the 150 million U.S consumers who still use more basic phones. But Nokia needs to convince bigger national operators to carry its handsets if it wants to be back in the game. Nokia’s share of the U.S. smartphone market will be around 1 percent in 2011, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. Nokia had promised in October that it was regaining U.S. operator support and would have a portfolio of new products for the U.S. market starting early 2012. Nokia Lumia 710 will offer hi-tech features such as apps, mapping, email and internet at a much lower price than rivals such as Apple's iPhone 4S . Chris Weber, the head of Nokia’s U.S. business, said the company would push hard to give operators a reason to carry Nokia devices. Since T-Mobile USA is the smallest of the national U.S. operators, Nokia investors will be anxious to hear when it expects to sell the smartphones with the bigger carriers like Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc and Sprint Nextel.     'We’ll have a full portfolio with multiple operators,' in the U.S. market in 2012, Weber promised.","Aimed at 150 million Americans who use basic phones .

Dozens of young punk rock fans have had their heads shaved and body piercings confiscated after police in Indonesia said they were a threat to Islamic values. The 59 male and six female music lovers were also stripped of dog-collar necklaces and chains and then thrown in pools of water for 'spiritual' cleansing, police chief Iskandar Hasan said. After replacing their 'disgusting' clothes, he handed each a toothbrush and barked 'use it'. The 65 youths were then sent to a police school to receive mental and spiritual guidance for ten days.

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 13th December 2011 . Jobseeker: Bob Jewers has been rejected from 400 jobs in the last year . A teenager who applied for more than 400 jobs in a year only received four letters of reply and one offer of a job interview. From pot washer to McDonald's manager Bob Jewers, who has 11 GCSEs, has been turned down for every job he applied for. The 19-year-old from Darlington, County Durham, said his life was 'hell' and has accused the government of 'wasting an entire generation'. Mr Jewers said he was forced to abandon a college course after the government scrapped the Education Maintenance Allowance because he couldn’t afford the bus fare. He immediately started applying for engineering apprenticeships. But after being repeatedly turned down, and having to move back in with his mother, he widened his search. Mr Jewers, who has 11 GCSEs at B and C grades and three AS Levels,  then applied for a series of management apprenticeships. He contacted McDonald's, but, having thought he would be offered an interview, he was surprised when he was rejected. 'I've applied for everything that I know with a bit of training I could do. I'm now applying that I know that I could do, that I'd like to think anyone could do', he said. 'I'm gong for the sort of jobs that I was told were entry level at school.' He has also applied for standard kitchen and counter positions at various fast food outlets, all of which turned him down. And the former college student says . that employers do not tend to respond to applications, leaving . applicants in the dark as to the reason why they were unsuccessful. Difficult: Bob Jewers said living on Job Seekers' allowance has been tough, especially since he wants to work . Mr . Jewers said: 'I don't think people realise that it's not as if you apply . for a job then after a week you get a letter for X, Y or Z saying you . didn't this job because of this, they don't reply. 'I don't think they realise that people are going through a really hard time looking for work. They just think that this person isn't suitable, so we don't need to speak to them.' Mr Jewers describes the past 11-and-a-half months as 'hell' as he is left wondering when he will be put out of his misery and be given a job. He said: 'It's the fact that I don't know when it's going to end. When I became unemployed in January, if I was told then that by May I would have a job, I could have got through those five months because I knew when it would end. 'But I don't know when this is going to end, it's like the past year I've done nothing and I've got nowhere, my life's been on hold.' Mr Jewers said: 'Living on Job Seekers’ Allowance of £53.45 a week is very difficult. I was living with my brother, but I’ve had to move back in with my mum and dad because I couldn’t afford it. 'I want to work, I want to pay tax, I want to feel as though I am contributing to a strong, cohesive British society.' 'I find it almost slanderous that the mass media in this country has portrayed me, and the one million young unemployed people as feckless, work-shy and downright lazy.'","Bob Jewers, 19, turned down for every job, including working at McDonald's ."
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 4:20 PM on 14th December 2011 . A gang of nine yobs who beat an autistic teenager, punching her about 20 times in the face and forcing her to take 10 months off school to recover, have escaped punishment. Sophie Russell, 16, was attacked by the teenage yobs who left her seriously injured with a broken nose and shattered face at her school in February. But the gang of four girls and five boys were let off after police only handed one of the mob with a caution. Beaten: Sophie Russell was attacked by the teenage yobs who left her seriously injured with a broken nose and shattered face at her school in February . The teenager from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, had to have facial surgery and was forced to take 10 months off school to overcome traumatic panic attacks and rebuild her life. Her mother Helen, who owns a heating ventilation company with husband Iain, 45, in Louth, Lincolnshire, has criticised police for not prosecuting the youths, saying ‘there has been no justice.’ Sophie, who has Asperger’s syndrome, said: 'What I went through was really traumatic and ripped the family . to bits. I was just walking to my boyfriend’s house and wasn’t expecting . to be attacked. 'I had to jump over a wall to get away from them, then I called my Dad and he came and took me straight to hospital.' Mrs Russell, 45, said: 'I am absolutely devastated. If they are doing that at the age of 15 what are they going to be doing at the age of 25? 'There is no justice. They have got away unpunished, but it will always be at the back of Sophie’s mind. That is terrible. Sophie, pictured this month, has only just been able to return to school 10 months on and regained the confidence to relive the horror of the attack . 'I still can’t look at the pictures. It’s like somebody ripped my heart out and threw it away. 'To think someone could do that to another person is horrific. She is scarred for life. It will be seen on wedding photos. 'It tore her world apart, she was so upset and couldn’t sleep but she’s really turned her life around.' She continued: 'At my age there would be somewhere these kids would be sent - stick them in the army I say. 'Because . they are juveniles they have got away with it. If the main offender . does it again she will end up in front of a judge, but why give them a . chance to do it again?' In the moments after the attack, . Sophie managed to hide behind a wall and call her father, who rushed to . help her and took her to hospital. She was discharged that evening but found out four weeks later her nose was in fact broken and had to have surgery. Despite . suffering serious internal bruising, post traumatic stress disorder and . being left with a permanent scar on her top lip and jaw, the aspiring . RAF servicewoman has put the attack behind her. The attack happened at her school in Louth at 5.30pm in February. She . has since moved to a new school in Lincoln and despite missing most of . year ten is on track to take her GCSEs at the same time as everyone . else. She has now been chosen by the Olympic Games committee to be a 2012 torch bearer. Sophie added: 'I want to show everyone they can turn their life around no matter what has happened to them. 'I was on a downward slope but managed to turn things around. I still can’t go to Louth but I’m doing so much better than I thought I could ever be. 'This is the happiest I’ve been since the attack, I couldn’t believe it when my mum phoned me to tell me I’d been selected. I’m really excited, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity.' A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said the case was passed to the Youth Offending Team who decided not to press charges but to give a caution for common assault. She said: 'Age is a factor in the decision but everything would have been taken into account. Her (Sophie) injuries would form part of the evidence. 'The case would have been handed over the the Youth Offending Team and various other agencies. 'Evidence would have been looked at to come to the decision that a caution was the necessary action to take in this case.'","Sophie Russell, 16, was punched about 20 times in the face .

"Insists Australia should not wait 'till the old lady dies or leaves' before looking to become a republic state . Believes Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall should not eventually replace the Queen . By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 7:32 AM on 16th December 2011 . Debatable: Paul Keating has launched a new tirade on the Monarchy . Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating - dubbed 'the Lizard of Oz' after he once put his arm around the Queen's waist - has sparked new controversy in a new attack on the Monarchy. He said Australia should get on with the move to a republic and not wait 'till the old lady dies or leaves.' If Australia hesitated until after the Queen's death, he suggested, 'the next day King Charles and Queen Camilla will be there. And of course they (Australians) will say 'Let's give the new bloke a go.' His comments have sparked outrage among Monarchists living in Australia, one fan of the Queen describing him as 'a bitter, bitter old man living in the past. His enormous ego and hatred still lives on.' Mr Keating, who was Prime Minister between 1991 and 1996 - during which he caused outrage when he put hand on the Queen's waist in 1992- hit out at Australia's failure to start the process of becoming a republic during a tv interview. While acknowledging what he said was the great affection Australians had for the Queen, 'the fact is that Australia can only be a great country when it claims its head of state as one of its own. 'It will for ever have that derivativeness about it while ever our head of state is the Queen of Great Britain and we share her with 16 other countries. 'And by the way, we get around with the British flag in the corner of our flag. Great states to not do these things.' Controversy: Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating (right) sparked outrage when he put his arm around the Queen, during her visit to Australia in 1992 . Mr Keating pointed out that British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd, John Howard and Bob Hawke all believed Australia should not become a republic until the Queen was no longer the Queen. That said a lot about Australians, he said - fundamentally, what a weak nation they were. 'I mean, we are not going to take our republic, we are going to wait till the old lady dies or leaves.' He said the royal family would have been quite happy to kiss Australia goodbye. The Queen, he said, could then visit Australia and receive an even bigger reception as the head of state of Great Britain, not Australia. 'I think the House of Windsor understands that well. It's only the sort of anarchists and dropkicks here who don't get it.' As for the current Labour government under Miss Gillard, he told Sky that they were 'half-baked republicans. 'They don't have the imagination about this. They don't see the importance to the country. 'The republic will say much more to us about ourselves' Writers to a newspaper comment page savaged Mr Keating, one pointing out that even the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, is British born and adding 'the only old lady I wish would die is Paul'. 'Here we go again - another Labour has been shooting off his big mouth,' said another writer. Another said of Mr Keating: 'Absolutely classless.

Purlantov forged Ali’s name on a letter telling the Swiss bank to add Purlantov as a joint account holder, reported El Cerrito Patch. Purlantov spent the next 17 months moving $1.17million to his own bank accounts in London and New York, the court heard.

A dog walker who became an internet sensation when he was filmed running after his black Labrador Fenton as he charged after deer has been unmasked. Father-of-two Max Findlay, an editorial consultant, said 'I just want to move on' after the footage, recorded by a 13-year-old boy, went viral on YouTube. In the 47-second clip the runaway dog  chases after the herd of deer in Richmond Park, London, completely ignoring the increasingly desperate shouts of his owner. Mr Findlay's furious attempts to stop Fenton are in vain as the . frightened animals stampede across a road, forcing cars to stop and . leaving an exasperated Mr Findlay swearing in despair. The dog owner has apparently not been seen walking his pet in the park since the incident. Jake Goodyear, 13, from Holloway, north London, filmed the video while visiting the park with his father Ali last month. When questioned on Fenton’s antics Mr Findlay said: 'I don’t really want to add anything to the zillions of words already out there. I'd rather just leave the story where it is and move on.' Mr Findlay is thought to be worried about facing sanctions from the Royal Parks for failing to keep his pet under control. He is a former barrister, legal journalist and leader writer for the Observer and Financial Times who lives in a large detached house close to Richmond Park. After spending the early part of his career writing for the broadsheets and various legal journals he set up his own consultants Max Findlay Associates in 1988, advising companies how to write effectively.

Two sports fans who stole an estimated 98,000 litres of water from a fire hydrant to create an ice hockey rink in their back garden have been arrested. Tony Nelin and Timmy Ryan, both 20, used a fireman's hose to link up a school hydrant with the makeshift, and almost full-size, rink in Tinley Park, Illinois. The 250ft-long hosepipe, which was borrowed from a relative who was a firefighter, trailed though woods to the property. Scroll down for video . From left: Ice hockey fans Ken Schmidt, Tony Nelin, Jake Maas and Timmy Ryan sit alongside their homemade rink in Tinley Park, Illinois. Nelin and Ryan are scheduled to appear in court next month charged with stealing 98,000 litres of water from a school fire hydrant . Ambitious project: Tony Nelin and Timmy Ryan, both 20, used a fireman's hose to link up a school hydrant with the makeshift, and almost full-size, rink . But a school caretaker who spotted the hose attached to the hydrant called police on Sunday night. Officers followed the hose through a wooded area until they reached the partially-frozen 91ft by 43ft rink. Two other friends who helped construct the rink did not receive citations. Nelin told the Chicago Tribune: 'We had good intentions. We just wanted to do something productive for the winter instead of sit on the couch and play video games.' The pair are due in court on January 26, where police believe they are likely to be fined and ordered to pay for the estimated $127.44 (£82.22) of water they used. But in a gesture worthy of the season of goodwill a stranger who read about their plight in a local newspaper yesterday volunteered to pay any fines and legal costs Nelin and Ryan might accumulate. Heart surgeon Brian Foy, of Burr Ridge, Illinois, said he is happy to pay and expects the costs to be less than $1,000 (£645). When police were called to investigate the mysterious hose linked to a school fire hydrant, they trailed it through these woods and up to the ice rink . Repairs needed: Warmer weather has caused the rink to start melting, while water has drained away after police stakes used to measure its dimensions ripped small holes in the tarpaulin . The Good Samaritan said: 'I don't want this to put a big damper on the thing they are excited about and worked so hard on. 'I told them if there's a fine that comes from this, I'll take care of it.' Mr Foy decided to come forward with his generous offer because the young men were only trying to have some healthy fun outdoors. He added: 'I know the police have to do what they have to do, but probably they could have accomplished the same thing by saying, ""Hey, guys, that's not a good idea.""' The rink has so far taken the hockey fans two weeks to build and has cost $350 (£225) in raw materials. Nelin said the group still plans to finish filling the rink up with water - but this time using the garden hose. Adding to their problems are small holes in the rink's tarpaulin, made when police used stakes to measure its dimensions. Nelin said: 'We lost a lot of water. But we've gone through so much with this, we really want to play on it.' View more videos at: http://nbcchicago.com.","Stolen water for rink in Tinley Park, Illinois, is estimated to have cost $127 .

Australia's lesbian finance minister has added a tiny addition to her life with her partner - showing off their new baby to the world today . Just a week after she backed the the Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Penny Wong announced that she and her partner Sophie Allouache have a bouncing baby girl. 'This is a life-changing experience,' said the 43-year-old Senator. New addition: Penny Wong and her partner Sophie Allouache pictured with their new baby daughter Alexandra in Adelaide . 'She's wonderful, just wonderful.' Baby Alexandra was born at Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital a week after Miss Wong supported a hard-fought change to the Labour Party's platform on gay marriage. While same-sex marriages have yet to be legalised, gay people throughout Australia have celebrated Labour's support - but it has led to the resignation from the party of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's sister. Miss Loree Rudd said she could not work for a party that endorsed homosexuals marrying. While her brother had introduced laws when he was Prime Minister so gay people were not discriminated against, she said that 'to make that huge leap from their rights to breaking a commandment of Moses, to say homosexuals' relations is marriage, is utter nonsense.' Proud mother: Penny Wong has been backing the Labour Party's stance on gay marriage . Miss Wong said that both mother and child were well, although partner Sophie was 'pretty tired'. The baby, weighing in at 7.1lbs, was conceived from a donor known to the couple, but he will not be identified. 'Sophie and I are delighted beyond words - she's just beautiful.' Miss Wong said she had sent a text to Prime Minister Julia Gillard with the news and the Prime Minister had replied that she was delighted. 'The PM's given me a bit of leave, so I'm going to take time off' she told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. 'Hopefully we can get the important things in life, like feeding and nappy changing and sleeping under control.' Miss Wong and her partner showed off their baby on the same day that it was revealed a Catholic school was ordered to accept the daughter of a same sex couple following the intervention of the church. The Sacred Heart Primary School in the outback town of Broken Hill had refused to take the girl into its kindergarten because of her female parents' same sex relationship. When Acting Bishop Kevin Manning heard about the ban, he ordered the school to take the girl. He told the Australian Broadcasting Commission that the refusal came about because of a misunderstanding on the part of the school principal and parish priest as to the church's position on the issue. Mr Trevor Rynne, principal of the Sacred Heart school, confirmed the young girl had been rejected because of her parents' relationship, but he declined to comment further. NSW politician John Kaye, from the Greens party, said the school's action had been offensive and indefensible.","The baby was conceived from a donor known to the couple, who will not be identified .

The U.S. Air Force has launched an internal investigation after a disturbing photo of 15 airmen posing with a live soldier chained up in an open casket with a noose around his neck surfaced online. The photo, dated August 23, appeared on Facebook in early October, with the caption: 'Da Dumpt, Da Dumpt... Sucks 2 Be U' scribbled on the bottom. Published in the Air Force Times this week, the image has sparked outrage from soldiers and military wives and widows, appalled by the display. Disturbing: The photo, dated August 23, shows a group of airmen at Air Education and Training Center at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas . The photo shows the group of male and . female soldiers wearing fatigues crossing their arms to make 'X' signs as they gather around a fellow airman who appears lifeless lying in a metal casket used to transport fallen soldiers. Air Force Times reports a former . soldier who saw the photo on the social networking website forwarded it . to friends, including Staff Sergeant Elias Bonilla of the 82nd Airborne . Division. Sergeant Bonilla emailed the photo to . the Times with a note reading: 'I cannot help but picture the faces of . my dead [soldiers] that we drug out of burning vehicles, dug out from . collapsed buildings.' The soldiers' names have not yet been . released. However, it is believed they are 'Port Dogs' who load planes, who were attending Air Transportation technical . school.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 7:44 PM on 14th December 2011 . The News of the World’s ex-legal manager today insisted that he told James Murdoch there was 'direct and hard evidence' that phone hacking extended beyond a single reporter in 2008. Tom Crone said he showed the News International chief a printout of the now-notorious 'For Neville' email at a meeting also attended by the paper’s then-editor Colin Myler. The email, which contained transcripts of illegally intercepted voicemail messages, apparently showed that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter. Email claims: Tom Crone, pictured giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry yesterday, today said he showed James Murdoch in 2008 there was evidence phone hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter . Mr Crone told the Leveson Inquiry that he had shown Mr Murdoch a number of documents which included the 'For Neville' message during the meeting on June 10, 2008. 'I cannot remember whether they were passed across the table to him, but I am pretty sure I held up the front page of the email,' he said. 'I am also pretty sure that he already knew about it - in terms of it had been described to him already, which I think the other documents that have come out suggest anyway.' Clive Goodman, the News of the World’s former royal editor, was jailed along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides’ phones. Claims: James Murdoch was shown evidence that phone hacking was more widespread than just one reporter, Tom Crone said . Yesterday the inquiry was told Mr . Murdoch was sent emails which revealed that phone-hacking was ‘rife’ at the . News of the World in 2008. Mr Myler forwarded the executive an email exchange and added the note: ‘Unfortunately it is as bad as we feared’. Today Mr Crone said: 'What was certainly discussed was the email - not described as For Neville, but the damning email - and what it meant in terms of further involvement in phone hacking beyond Goodman and Mulcaire. 'And what was relayed to Mr Murdoch was that this document clearly was direct and hard evidence of that being the case.' Mr Murdoch has insisted that he was not shown the email or told that it proved phone hacking was more widespread at the News of the World than previously thought. The crucial 'For Neville' message is thought to have been intended for Neville Thurlbeck, the paper's chief reporter. The meeting with Mr Murdoch had been arranged to discuss a claim brought by Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor over the hacking of his phone by the News of the World, the inquiry heard. Former News of the World editor Colin Myler arrives at the Leveson Inquiry today . Mr Crone said he only 'temporarily' breathed a sigh of relief when the case was settled, adding: 'I was expecting another claim, frankly.' Explaining why the paper’s publishers agreed to pay Mr Taylor £425,000 plus costs, the lawyer said the company wanted to protect its reputation and reduce the likelihood of further expensive litigation. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked him: 'This might also be interpreted as, to use a blanket term, a culture of cover-up. Would you accept that?' Mr Crone replied: 'No, I don’t think I would. It’s a culture of avoiding reputational damage through bad publicity, but it certainly isn’t a culture of cover-up if the damning documents are in the police’s possession and in fact came from the police.' Mr Crone also said he understood a representative of Madeleine McCann’s family gave the News of the World permission to publish the personal diary of the missing girl’s mother. Kate McCann told the inquiry last month that she felt 'violated' and like 'climbing into a hole and not coming out' when the intensely private journal appeared in the paper on September 14, 2008. Mr Crone said today: 'My understanding was that the representative of the McCanns had given the OK, the permission to the head of the newsdesk at the News of the World, to run the diaries or extracts from the diaries. I think he had emails to support that.' Mr Jay said: 'I have seen some documents which on one interpretation of them broadly support what you are saying.' Separately, appearing before the inquiry today, former News of the World editor Colin Myler said he 'did not recognise' much of the evidence given by Paul McMullan, the paper's ex-deputy features editor. Mr McMullan told the hearing last month that phone hacking was in the public interest, claimed celebrities often 'loved' being chased by journalists, and argued that 'privacy is for paedos'. Mr Myler said today: 'The criminality that took place, if it did take place, at the News of the World, is one thing, and whatever acts that individuals took part in, the full force of the law should take care of them. I'm sure it will. 'Mr McMullan often drifted off into a world of car chases, hacking phones, blagging, doing rather disagreeable things, and that is no world that I recognise.' Mr Myler took over running the News of the World in January 2007 after Andy Coulson resigned as editor when Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed. He spoke of losing his job as the Sunday Mirror's editor in 2001 after publishing an interview that led to the collapse of the first criminal trial of footballers Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate. 'Being an editor is all about learning, and you learn from experience, and sometimes you make the wrong decision. The impact of making the wrong decision as an editor can be severe,' he said.","Madeleine McCann representative 'gave NOTW permission to publish Kate's diaries' claims lawyer, contradicting Kate's claims .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 9:58 AM on 15th December 2011 . Miner: Foreman Trevor Steeples was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June 2006 . A judge today ordered Britain’s biggest mining firm to pay £1.2 million in fines and costs after he heard how four miners died following safety breaches in four separate incidents. UK Coal admitted offences under health and safety laws in relation to the deaths of Trevor Steeples, Paul Hunt, Anthony Garrigan and Paul Milner. Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery, near Coventry in 2006 and 2007. Mr Milner died after an incident at the now-closed Welbeck Colliery, in Nottinghamshire, in 2007. Mr Justice MacDuff said at Sheffield Crown Court he would not impose a penalty so high it would cripple a company suffering real financial problems. He said UK Coal would be fined £112,500 in relation to each incident and would pay a further £187,500 in costs in each case. But he urged the families of the dead men to focus on the total combined financial penalty for the firm. The judge said: 'These were, of course, dreadful accidents. They were preventable accidents. 'However, unlike most criminal acts, there was no intention to kill or injure. 'But the law rightly demands a high duty of care by employers for the safety of their employees and other workers. 'Mining is and will remain a dangerous occupation. These accidents all occurred in the depths of the earth.' Safety breaches: Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery pictured . 'This is not easy work - neither in conception nor in execution. But safety is paramount in the modern world. 'Long gone are the days of 60 and more years ago, when men were allowed to die and suffer dreadful injury in pursuit of profits for coal owners.' Prosecutor Rex Tedd told an earlier . hearing that the miners were in the habit of riding the train rather . than taking a long walk to the coal face but management did nothing to . stop the practice. He said: 'The practice continued . because there was no practical alternative given the gruelling nature of . the journey which otherwise had to be done on foot.' The judge today told the court: 'In each . of the cases the death would have been prevented if proper safe systems . of working had been in place - and if those systems had been enforced.' Bob Leeming, HM Inspector of Mines, left said there had been 16 deaths in pits in the last five-and-a-half years and right Andrew Mackintosh, UK Coal's director of communications . But he added: 'I am not sure that that is entirely true in respect of the death of Mr Steeples. In his case the major cause of death was dereliction of duty by a number of his colleagues who, unbeknown to senior management, unaccountably, and probably unforeseeably, failed in their duties.' Paul Hunt, 45, a contractor, of Swadlingcote, Derbyshire died after falling off an underground train at Daw Mill. He was riding on the leading car facing backwards as it reached the surface following the one-in-four climb. The driver nearly stalled the train then put on speed which jolted the cars throwing off Mr Hunt. 'He was dislodged and fell to the track and was struck by the train with tragic results,' said Rex Tedd, prosecuting. Trevor Steeples, 46, a foreman, was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June, 2006. Anthony Garrigan, 42, of Thorne, near Doncaster was killed at Daw Mill when he was trapped under a 100-tonne rock fall. Changes had been made to the roof of a tunnel and short support bolts used which put stress on the sides. Previous rock falls had been reported but the information was not passed to the Mining Inspectorate until the tragedy. Two months before his death, a miner received deep cuts to his arm as he leaped clear of a fall. Mr Garrigan, a contractor, was due to operate a bulldozer but it was under repair so he was switched to a three-man team. The others were drilling when the rock fell and buried him. despite 'exceptional' rescue efforts he died. A fourth miner Paul Milner, 44, was fatally injured at Welbeck Colliery when a shaft gave way trapping him under a rock. Production on the seam had stopped and a salvaging operation was taking place after a new code of practice had been drawn up. Mr Tedd said the code, which provided for temporary roof supports, was 'ignored' on site. The judge said he had a difficult task as UK Coal was suffering financially and had seen its share price fall from £5 to 29p in the time since the accidents. He also said the firm had made a 'massive investment in safety measures' since new senior management took over. He said there had been an enormous improvement in the defendant’s safety record. The judge said: 'Coal mining used to be a part of the fabric of our society - particularly here in South Yorkshire. 'In spite of the privatisation of the mines and the closure of so many of them in recent years, coal is still needed. 'UK Coal is an important contributor to the economy of the United Kingdom. 'Coal mined within the defendant’s mines makes a significant contribution to the generation of the nation’s electricity.' He . said the company was 'trading on the edge of viability'. He said: 'It . would be in no one’s interest if the company ceased to trade or if it . had to reduce further the scope of its operations.' Anne . Steeples the mother of Trevor Steeples said after the hearing: . 'Our . family are relieved that UK Coal has been fined over the tragic deaths . of four men but are bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the trial . regarding Trevor’s death. 'Somebody was to blame. We know who they are and they will have to live with this knowledge for the rest of their lives.' During . sentencing the judge remarked that the cause of Mr Steeples’ death was . 'dereliction of duty' by a 'number of his colleagues who unbeknown to . senior management unaccountably and probably unforseeably failed in . their duties. 'One of those fellow workmen made false recordings of oxygen and methane levels upon which reliance was placed. 'These dishonestly recorded that he had taken readings when he had not.

Madeline Mann is a 22-year-old honors college student studying psychology in Rock Island while Rumaisa Rahman is seven years old and goes to school in Chicago. But this pair have one very special thing in common - at the time of their births they were both the tiniest babies to have survived. Not only that but their lives were saved following their early births by the same doctor. Madeline Mann is 4ft8"" but suffers no long-term health complications despite weighing just 9.9oz at birth . Dr Jonathan Muraskas of Loyola University Medical Center, who resuscitated both children has now released a report based on his experiences to help answer the question - when do premature babies reach a point when they are likely to survive? His report looked at Madeline, born . in 1989 weighing 9.9 ounces, which was then the world record; and Rumaisa, whose 9.2-ounce weight at birth in 2004 remains the world's . tiniest. Both of them could fit into the palm of an adult hand at birth and required intensive medical intervention. They were delivered by cesarean section more than a month . early because their mothers had developed severe pre-eclampsia, . dangerously high blood pressure linked with pregnancy. Both babies were . hooked up immediately to breathing machines with tubes as slender as a . spaghetti strand slipped down their tiny airways. Before the births, both mothers were . given steroid drugs to speed up growth of the babies' immature lungs. Even so, Rumaisa and Madeline were on breathing machines for about two . months, and hospitalised for about four months. Madeline had mild brain bleeding, common . in tiny babies but with no lasting effects apart from asthma. Her father Jim said that at just 4ft8"" tall, his daughter's main problem was finding clothes to fit her. Rumaisa is also expected to develop normally. My how you've grown: Rumaisa Rahman weighed a record-breaking 9.2oz at birth, but was pictured happy and healthy a year later. She is expected to develop normally . However Dr Muraskas was keen to point out that these were extreme cases and should not be considered as a 'bench mark'. 'These are such extreme cases,' he said in the report published in Pediatrics. He added that although they were both the equivalent size of an 18-week-old foetus, Rumaisa was nearly at 26 weeks gestation, while Madeline was at almost 27 weeks. This meant their lungs and other organs were mature . enough to make survival possible. Therefore the report highlights a sometimes overlooked fact: gestational age is even more critical for survival than size. Dr Muraskas and his co-authors said . most newborn specialists consider babies born after 25 weeks of . pregnancy to be viable - likely to survive - and so they should receive . medical intervention if necessary to breathe. Younger babies are . generally in a 'gray zone,' where intervention isn't always so clear . cut. In Japan, doctors have lowered that threshold - the gestational age - to 22 weeks. Normal pregnancies last about 40 weeks. Dr Edward Bell, from the University of Iowa estimates that about 7,500 U.S. babies are born each year weighing less than 1 pound, and that about 10 per cent survive. 'What is the real age of viability? No . one knows,' said Dr Stephen Welty, neonatology chief at Baylor College . of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Madeline's father is also stumped as to why his daughter survived. 'I don't know why, we were just extraordinarily lucky,' Mr Mann said.","Madeline Mann, 22, weighed 9.9oz at birth, while Rumaisa Rahman weighed 9.2oz ."

"George Weber, 47, was stabbed 50 times and duct taped at the ankles . Journalist's family forgave the killer in court . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:28 AM on 14th December 2011 . A teenager who stabbed a radio journalist more than 50 times must serve 25 years to life in prison, a judge said today. John Katehis, 18, murdered  47-year-old George Weber after they met on Craigslist and arranged a sexual encounter at the broadcaster's home. Katehis, from Brooklyn, New York, winked and smirked in his videotaped confession and during court proceedings. Slaying: John Katehis posed on his MySpace page holding knives. He confessed to stabbing George Weber to death in Brooklyn when he was 16 . Justice Neil Jon Firetog handed down the maximum sentence at Brooklyn Supreme Court to Katehis who was dressed in a suit and tie and and had his hair closely shaved. Prosecutor Anna-Siggac Nicolazzi called Katehis' brutal slaying of Mr Weber in March 2009 a 'thrill kill', according to the New York Daily News. The murderer carried out the crime when he was just 16. She said: 'This is exactly the kind of person society should be protected from.' However the family of the ABC reporter showed compassion for the teenage killer. Sexual encounter: Radio journalist George Weber was stabbed more than 50 times after he had arranged a meeting for kinky sex at his New York apartment . Mr Weber's brother-in-law faced Katehis in court, saying: 'I forgive . you. I have no hatred.' At his sentencing, Katehis said: 'For the death of George Weber, I am sorry. I regret it.' The 18-year-old had been in court last year but proceedings ended in a mistrial. However a second round of jurors rejected Katehis' claim last month that he had acted in self-defence. Teenage killer: John Katehis, aged 16 leaves the 76th Precinct in New York after being charged with the murder of George Weber, 47 . The two men met via Craigslist, where Katehis advertised sexual services and Weber had posted that he was looking for someone to smother him. Mr Weber was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Brooklyn on March 20, 2009. His pants and underwear were at his ankles which has been duct taped, according to an autopsy carried out at the time. He had injuries to the neck, chest and back along with stab wounds on his hands, indicating he had tried to fight back. Katehis was taken into custody five days later after he was found hiding out at a friend's apartment. On a MySpace page, Katehis has posted a series of photos with various knives, one with the caption, 'Love this blade'. He described himself as 'a very easy person to talk to', but also as 'an Extremist, an Anarchist and a Sadomasochist'. According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Katehis had once appeared in court with 'Prince of Darkness' scrawled on the sides of his shoes.","George Weber, 47, was stabbed 50 times and duct taped at the ankles .

A knickers thief was caught with a stash of 860 pairs of women's underwear he had stolen from washing lines, magistrates were told. Farmer Geoffrey Wilde, 48, a married father-of-five, took the undergarments over a two-year period. He was given a six-month nighttime curfew by the court. When he was finally arrested police discovered he was wearing a pair of blue knickers when they asked him to change his clothes. Wilde, who was held after being spotted in a passageway acting suspiciously in Welshpool, Powys, admitted that he needed help when interviewed by officers. A homeowner called police after the well-respected father was seen carrying a torch and three pairs of women's underwear. Magistrates were told that the haul of knickers and bras - some of which belonged to elderly women - were found during a search of his home. Helen Tench, prosecuting, told Welshpool . magistrates: 'In interview he said ""I need help. I shouldn’t be doing . what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m doing it’."" Wilde admitted 18 counts of theft at an earlier hearing. Paul Inns, defending, said that Wilde . made a full admission and had even helped police in matters that were . above and beyond what they were investigating. 'He is remorseful and ashamed of his . behaviour, not only for himself, but for the impact of his behaviour on . his family,' said Mr Inns. 'He is well thought of in his community and the loss of his good character may be viewed as punishment by some. Thief: A stash of 860 pairs of womens' underwear were found at Geoffrey Wilde's house . 'This is a gentleman who has suffered a significant fall from grace.' Mr Inns said that there was an underlying psychological disorder surrounding Wilde’s behaviour.

"By . Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 1:21 AM on 14th December 2011 . Celebrations: Corey Brown, 20, escaped being tagged so he can go out for his 21st birthday and over Christmas . A judge agreed not to fit a criminal with an electronic tag because of his 21st birthday plans – and that only a ‘tyrant’ would impose such a punishment. Corey Brown had been ordered to do 150 hours of community service for his role in the theft of a pensioner’s car, but when he failed to turn up for the work sessions five times  he was hauled back into court to be given a  curfew and an electronic tag. But he was spared after complaining that the punishment would ruin his plans for a night out on his 21st birthday. Recorder David Hall told a stunned courtroom: ‘It would be a tyrant who tagged someone on their 21st birthday and at Christmas.’ Turning to Brown– who had sat smirking throughout the hearing at Warwick Crown Court – Recorder Hall then said: ‘If I give you seven more hours [of community service] to do, and you keep out of trouble, is that a fair deal?’ Brown, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, simply nodded, and then walked free from court. Yesterday, victims’ groups reacted furiously to the decision, saying it would ‘undermine confidence in the criminal justice system’. In March, Brown was given a 36-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, and 150 hours’ community service after he was caught with the keys of a Lexus that had been stolen from a  70-year-old woman. The £30,000 car had been used in a series of raids on shops in the Coundon area of Coventry in November last year. When police raided Brown’s home, they discovered the keys hidden in his bedpost. Brown admitted handling stolen goods. Punishment: Corey Brown, 20, escaped with seven hours additional unpaid work after repeatedly missing probation sessions . But after failing to turn up for his . community service placements on five occasions, on Monday he was brought . back into court – which could have seen him sent straight to prison to . carry out his original 36-week sentence. The court heard that Brown, who lives . with his grandmother, had also missed three sessions of a ‘Thinking . Skills’ programme that he had been ordered to complete. Despite this, . his lawyer asked the court to be lenient, because Brown was about to . celebrate his birthday. Annabel Hamilton, defending, told the . court: ‘He is very reluctant to have a curfew because of his 21st . birthday and Christmas coming up.’ To the astonishment of court staff, . Recorder Hall agreed to go easy on Brown, and told him he would not be . fitted with a tag – which alerts police if offenders leave their homes . during curfew hours. And Brown – who has already been to prison three times – admitted that even he was surprised he had been let off. He said: ‘I was expecting to get a . tag for missing my probation dates. Technically, they should have . activated my prison sentence. But the judge told me I’d done well so . far. He said he didn’t see the point. ‘Thanks to the judge, I can enjoy a few drinks for my birthday, instead of being stuck in with my gran or in prison.’ When asked why he had not turned up . to do his community service, he replied: ‘I don’t know; just didn’t . think about it. I didn’t care. ‘I suppose I did see the whole thing as a bit of a joke.’ As he prepared to celebrate his 21st . birthday yesterday, Brown added: ‘I’ve been to jail three times and I . haven’t learned a thing. ‘I’ve already told the judge that . jail doesn’t work for me. What’s the point of sending me to prison now?’ Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim  Support, said: ‘Tough community . sentences can work in stopping  reoffending, but there need to be . consequences if offenders repeatedly break them. ‘If that means disrupting a criminal’s enjoyment of the festive season, then so be it. ‘Otherwise decisions like these could undermine victims’ confidence in the justice system.’ A court insider said: ‘It was obvious the judge was feeling warm-hearted in the run-up to Christmas. ‘But it did leave the solicitors a little surprised, considering the defendant’s record.’","Corey Brown, 20, who was caught with the keys to a £30k car, repeatedly failed to turn up for unpaid work .

"By . David Richards . Last updated at 4:46 PM on 15th December 2011 . To seasoned Robert Mugabe watchers who have to reach for a pair of sunglasses every time he puts in a personal appearance, this might come as a bit of a surprise. For the 87-year-old Zimbabwean tyrant has agreed for his signature to be used with a new fashion label in a bid to reach out to younger voters. The news - unlikely to send a shiver through the fashion houses of Milan and Paris - was been reported in gushing tones by the Zimbabwe Broadcast Corporation which said demand had already been high after the fashion line was launched in the capital, Harare. The network reported: 'A new fashion stable, House of Gushungo, whose label is President Robert Mugabe's signature, has hit the capital by storm. If you like this, you'll just love my latest fashion line: Robert Mugabe gestures during a tree-planting ceremony while sporting a interesting take on the Hawaiian shirt. It appears to have a pictures of him as a young man (top left of shirt), a cow being milked (bottom left) and the wheels of a steam train (peeking out from under the paper in his hand) The looks that's taking Harare by storm, apparently. No prizes for spotting Mugabe's signature - it covers the entire chest area of this House of Gushongo T-shirt in stylish black . Another speech, another outfit. Here the Zimbabwean leader sports a batik-style shirt with Seventies style lapels . 'The newly formed House of Gushungo clothing stable has introduced a new clothing line from the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, President Robert Mugabe's signature. 'The clothing stable is set to redefine the country's fashion industry which is mostly dominated by foreign clothing labels. 'The contemporary line appeals to today's modern men and women, offering style, comfort and a splash of attitude.' This time the former freedom fighter wears a shirt with chains being broken and the name of his party, Zanu PF, emblazoned on his lapels . Attempts by Mugabe -  rumoured to be suffering from prostate cancer - to reach out to the young are not new. Last month it emerged that Mugabe is to appear in pop songs by a local band linked to Zimbabwe's information minister Webster Shamu. The ZBC reported that the line of Mugabe clothing was launched recently by a Zimbabwean company Yedu Nesu Holdings. The firm's range is designed for men and women and includes formal clothes, t-shirts, winter wear, jackets and caps. Mugabe's signature is emblazoned on every item to allow their wearers to demonstrate their support for the freedom fighter-turned dictator. Label boss Nicholas Munyonga said the range had been designed to honour Mugabe after his three decades of power. He told ZBC: 'We decided to come up with something that is long lasting, something that will last for ever and in honour of the our President.' The news has been interpreted by some as part of an attempt by Mugabe to appeal to young voters. Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. But in recent years he has seen support for his Zanu-PF party collapse after the country's once-booming economy went into meltdown. At the last presidential election in 2008 Mugabe suffered the indignity of losing in the first round of polling to the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. He later claimed victory in a controversial run-off poll after Mr Tsvangirai withdrew from the race amid widespread political violence. The two men later formed an uneasy unity government which has theoretically controlled Zimbabwe since February 2009. However Mugabe has repeatedly spoken of his desire to secure a fresh mandate for his own party to rule alone once again. He was last week re-elected Zanu-PF leader and told the organisation's annual conference he planned to call new elections next year. Some analysts believe he would be unable to secure sufficient support to win a free and fair election and could resort to intimidation and terror in an attempt to shore up his support. Zanu-PF leaders are also reportedly worried that Mugabe's advancing years could count against him at the polls. The octogenarian has recently faced repeated rumours about his failing health and is believed to be suffering from prostate cancer.","House of Gushungo claims clothing line 'has hit the capital by storm'

Safety mechanisms should prevent elevators from moving . while their doors are open. Sentry: An officer keeps a grim vigil at the scene where Ms Hart was killed in Manhattan, New York . A buildings department spokesman said the elevator was inspected in June and no safety issues were found then. The last time the elevator received a violation for a safety hazard was in 2003, and the condition was corrected, he said. The elevator is one of 13 in the tower . and was taken out of use. Y&R announced days ago that it plans to . vacate the building for a new base. Ms Hart, originally from California, . had worked at the agency - which represents Campbell Soup, Land Rover . and Xerox - since June 2007.

Thousands of migratory birds died on impact after apparently mistaking a Wal-Mart car park and other areas for bodies of water and plummeting to the ground. Crews went to work cleaning up the dead birds and rescuing the survivors after the creatures crash-landed in St. George, Utah, in what one wildlife expert called the worst downing she's ever seen. The crash happened on Monday night and by midday Wednesday, volunteers had helped rescue more than 3,000 birds, releasing them into nearby bodies of water. Bird issues: A surviving grebe huddles in the snow on Tuesday, left, and a Utah Division of Wildlife Resources employee frees some surviving grebes at Stratton Pond in Hurricane, Utah, right, after the crash landing . ‘They're just everywhere,’ said Utah Division of Wildlife Resource spokesman Teresa Griffin. ‘It's been non-stop. All our employees are driving around picking them up, and we've got so many people coming to our office and dropping them off.’ Stormy conditions probably confused the flock of grebes, a duck-like aquatic bird likely making its way to Mexico for the winter, which tried to land in a Cedar City Wal-Mart car park and elsewhere. The birds plunged into the car park, football fields, highways and over miles of property that had been blanketed by about three inches of gleaming snow. At least 1,500 are believed to have died. Moving: Surviving grebes swim across the waters of Stratton Pond in Hurricane, Utah, following their release . ‘The storm clouds over the top of the . city lights made it look like a nice, flat body of water. All the . conditions were right,’ Ms Griffin told The Spectrum newspaper in St. George. 'Before there were (artificial lights), the sky was always paler than the ground. When all of a sudden there's light all over the place, they don't know which way is up anymore' Kevin McGowan . ‘So the birds landed to rest, but ended up slamming into the pavement.’ No human injuries or property damage have been reported. Kevin McGowan, who studies birds at . the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, said grebes rely on . starlight to navigate during their nighttime migration. 'Before there were (artificial lights), . the sky was always paler than the ground,' he said. 'When all of a . sudden there's light all over the place, they don't know which way is up . anymore.' Released: Wildlife officials said they were continuing the rescue effort that started on Tuesday afternoon and included an enthusiastic group of volunteers . It's . not uncommon for birds to mistake hard surfaces for water. However, Ms . Griffin noted most downing cases are localised, while ‘this was very . widespread’. 'They're just everywhere. It's been non-stop. All our employees are driving around picking them up' Teresa Griffin . ‘I've been here 15 years and this was the worst downing I've seen,’ she said. Wildlife . officials said they were continuing the rescue effort that started on . Tuesday afternoon and included an enthusiastic group of volunteers. ‘I have never in my life encountered . such a thing,’ Stephen Gwin told The Spectrum. Snow joke: Officials say storm clouds above city lights Monday night probably confused thousands of grebes, which are a duck-like aquatic bird that migrates south for the winter . Scene: Thousands of migratory birds died on impact after apparently mistaking this Wal-Mart car park and other areas for bodies of water and plummeting to the ground . It's not uncommon for birds to crash en masse, especially if they confuse the ground for water. A crash in Arkansas in January killed about 4,500 birds, mainly red-winged blackbirds. They were startled by loud noises in the area, including celebratory fireworks on New Year's Eve, and crashed amid their poor night-vision. More than 175 mass death events, in which at least 1,000 birds died, have been reported to the National Wildlife Heath Center in 10 years. Causes for those die-offs included disease, weather, poisoning, trauma and starvation. ‘I've heard of fish . die-offs and other strange natural phenomenon, but I've never . experienced one before.’ Mr Gwin has an environmental biology degree and added: ‘It was very strange, but very fun.’ The surviving grebes were gathered up - some in cardboard boxes - and dropped into bodies of water in southern Utah's Washington County, including a pond near Hurricane. Residents who came across remaining grebes were asked to either call wildlife officials or bring the birds to their office. ‘If we can put them on a body of water that's not frozen over, they'll have a better chance of survival,’ said wildlife agency spokesman Lynn Chamberlain.","Crews have been cleaning up dead birds and rescuing survivors in Utah .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:00 PM on 15th December 2011 . Lindsay Lohan appeared in a Los Angeles court this morning for a brief probation hearing where she was lauded with praise. The 25-year-old actress, who arrived back just in the nick of time from Hawaii last night, turned up wearing a gaping white cardigan top, which exposed her cleavage, teamed with champagne-coloured trousers and heels. But it appeared the starlet may have over indulged on her mini-break as she was looking a little bloated and sporting a double chin - something the cameras didn't happen to catch during her recent nude Playboy photoshoot. While her court dates usually see her admonished - today golden girl LiLo was given the thumbs up for completing her probation requirements early over the past month. Judge Stephanie Sautner - apparently . feeling the festive spirit - told Lohan she was pleased with her . progress and told her to keep it up. Fuller-faced: Lindsay Lohan arrived at court in Los Angeles this morning for a probation hearing, but looked somewhat bloated and was sporting a double chin . Racy appearance: Lindsay was wearing a gaping cardigan top, which exposed her cleavage, and champagne-coloured trousers with heels . 'You are doing well and I'd like to see it continue,' the Los Angeles Superior Court judge told her. 'The morgue seems to be pleased - as pleased as a morgue can be,' she added. Judge Sautner also chirped: 'I think . she likes coming here and seeing me,' in a comment to Lohan's lawyer . Shawn Chapman Holley, who asked if Lindsay needed to return to court . next month if she completes her next stint of probation requirements . early. Lohan will indeed have to show her . face again because, as the judge put it: 'She won't complete her . probation otherwise,' prompting Lohan to chuckle. The actress - who features nude in the . upcoming issue of Playboy magazine - has been ordered to complete . another 12 days of community service and four therapy sessions ahead of . her next court date on January 17. Judge Sautner told Lohan that he . recent trip to Hawaii was perfectly acceptable because it was to . celebrate her sister Ali's birthday, who turns 18 later this month. Thumbs . up: The smiling actress, pictured with lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley, was . praised by the judge for keeping up with her probation requirements . Lohan . has progressed ahead of schedule with her community service and was . told that she can now travel for pleasure whenever she has completed her . 12 days of service she is slated to do per month. Otherwise Lohan is . only allowed to travel to see her family on holidays and special . occasions with the approval of her probation officer. 'In any month . you complete your twelve days early you can travel for pleasure, to . see her family to not see her family - to go to a spa or whatever. 'The holidays are coming up so you can travel to see your family. 'But travel for pleasure or fun is only allowed after you've completed the 12 days.' Lohan was ordered last month to spend 30 days in jail after she admitted . violating her probation in a DUI case and another involving the theft of . a necklace from a Venice jewellery store. Due largely to jail . overcrowding, she served only about five hours at the Century Regional . Detention Facility in Lynwood, California. Relief: While Lohan is usually admonished at her court appearances, today was a different matter and the actress could hardly contain her happiness as the Judge Sautner told her to keep up the good work . Light moment: Lindsay covers her face after letting out a laugh when the judge joked that Lindsay will have to return to court next week because otherwise 'she won't complete her probation'. Sautner added that Lindsay likes coming to see her in court . Lohan admitted she had violated probation by failing to show up for community-service appointments and therapy sessions. Judge Sautner technically sentenced . the actress to 300 days behind bars but only required her to serve 30 . days. The remaining 270 days of the sentence will be stayed as long . as Lohan adheres to a specific schedule of community service work and . therapy sessions, Sautner ruled. Included in that schedule was a . requirement for her to perform 12 days of community service at the Los . Angeles County morgue and attend four psychotherapy sessions prior to . today's hearing. She will now have until Jan 17 to serve another 12 days at the morgue and attend four more therapy sessions. If . she remains on track, Lohan will then have until February 15 to complete . another 12 days at the morgue and four more therapy sessions. After that, she will have until March 29 to perform 17 more days at the morgue and six more therapy sessions. If . Lohan sticks to the schedule, her probation in the 2007 DUI case will . terminate at the end of March, and her probation in the Venice theft . case will be downgraded to summary, non-supervised probation, Sautner . said. Lohan pleaded no contest May 11 to a misdemeanour grand theft . charge involving a necklace priced at $2,500 pilfered from a Venice . jewellery store. Walk on the wild side: The Mean Girls star teamed her look with an animal print handbag . Time for the crime: The probation stems from a 2007 . drink-driving conviction and a jewellery theft conviction earlier this . year . She was placed on three years probation and ordered to . spend 120 days in jail and complete the 480 hours of community service . to which she had been previously sentenced for violating her probation . in a 2007 misdemeanour DUI case. Lohan was ordered to have her 480 . hours of community service completed by April 2012, with 360 hours at . the Downtown Women's Center and another 120 hours at the county morgue. However, her attendance was so sporadic at the Skid Row center that . shelter officials terminated her from the community-service program . there. That prompted Sautner to revoke the actress' probation. She . later ordered that Lohan perform all of her community service work at . the morgue. Jetting back: Lindsay arriving back to Los Angeles last night following mini break in Hawaii . Since her last court hearing, the Freaky Friday star posed for a much-publicized photo spread in Playboy. Pictures from the photo shoot leaked online, prompting the magazine to . move up the release date of the Lohan issue. Lohan made news earlier this week . when her purse was stolen while she was vacationing in Hawaii - a trip . that was previously approved by her probation officer. Lohan's purse was recovered, but an estimated $10,000 she was carrying in it was missing.

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 12:06 AM on 8th November 2011 . Ministers have been criticised for writing off opponents of a controversial high-speed rail route as Nimbys and Luddites. The rebuke came from the Transport Select Committee, even as it gave broad support for the £34billion HS2 project. Yesterday the committee said the route would be ‘a catalyst for economic benefits’ and added that there was a ‘good case’ for expansion beyond Birmingham to the North and Scotland. Not on their backyard: An anti-HS2 sign in picturesque Wendover in Buckinghamshire . But it also urged supporters of the scheme to stop ridiculing their opponents as wealthy, selfish homeowners who care more about their lawns than the fate of the economy – and warned that there could indeed be ‘a substantial negative impact on the countryside’. HS2, which would run through areas of outstanding natural beauty in the Chilterns and Warwickshire, faces bitter opposition from residents and councils. Former transport secretary Philip Hammond frequently described HS2’s detractors as Nimbys and Luddites, and in June the ‘Yes to HS2’ campaign paid for posters on buses and trains which asked: ‘Their lawns or our jobs?’ The ‘No’ camp took a similarly catty approach, touring the country with an inflatable white elephant to illustrate their claim that the scheme is a waste of money. Dismissive: Philip Hammond . With the Government due to make a decision on the route by the end of the year, the Transport Committee’s report chided: ‘What should have been a serious and factually-based debate about how best to address the transport, economic and environmental challenges of HS2 has too often been reduced to name-calling and caricature. ‘Luddites, Nimbys and white elephants fought out a battle of “jobs versus lawns”.’ It continued: ‘We urge the Government to desist from disparaging opponents of HS2 as Nimbys, and for both sides in the debate to show respect for each other and to focus on the facts.’ HS2 would see 250mph trains able to carry 1,100 passengers running from London to Birmingham by 2026, with further extensions ready by about 2032. The Transport Committee  chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said the network ‘would  provide a step change in the capacity, quality, reliability and frequency of rail services between our major cities’. But she also accepted that HS2 could have ‘a substantial negative impact on the countryside, communities and people along the route’. The committee report backed the plan in principle and stated that a high-speed line ‘offers potential economic and strategic benefits that a conventional line does not’. These were said to include a ‘dramatic shift’ in connectivity between cities and access to Heathrow and continental Europe, as well as ‘time savings and crowding benefits’. It added that plans for HS2 ‘must be accompanied by complementary regional and local strategies for transport, housing, skills and employment’. However, the committee members ultimately admitted that ‘if a new line is to be built, it should be a high-speed line’. ‘Our judgment is that HS2 could indeed be the catalyst for economic benefits,’ they concluded.","HS2 'a catalyst for economic benefits' says MPs .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:45 PM on 14th December 2011 . Tech giant Google announced Wednesday it is donating $11.5million to several coalitions fighting to end the modern-day slavery of some 27million people around the world. In what is believed to be the largest-ever corporate grant devoted to the advocacy, intervention and rescue of people being held, forced to work or provide sex against their will, Google said it chose organizations with proven records in combating slavery. 'Many people are surprised to learn there are more people trapped in slavery today than any time in history,' said Jacquelline Fuller, director of charitable giving and advocacy for Google. Google.org: The internet company is donating $11.5million to combat modern slavery. Google donated more than $100m this year to different organisations . 'The good news is that there are solutions,' she said. The Washington-based International Justice Mission, a human rights organization that works globally to rescue victims of slavery and sexual exploitation, was chosen by Google to lead the efforts. It will partner with Polaris Project and Slavery Footprint and a handful of smaller organizations for the multi-year effort to rescue the enslaved, and push for better infrastructure and resources for anti-slavery enforcement agencies overseas. It will also raise awareness here in the United States and help countries draft anti-slavery legislation. 'Each year we focus some of our annual giving on meeting direct human need,' Ms Fuller said. 'Google chose to spotlight the issue of slavery this year because there is nothing more fundamental than freedom.' 'It's hard for most Americans to believe that slavery and human trafficking are still massive problems in our world,' said Mr Haugen. 'Google's support now makes it possible for IJM to join forces with two other leading organizations so we can bring to bear our unique strengths in a united front.' Important issue: Google's director of charitable giving Jacquelline Fuller says there are solutions for modern slavery . Those leading the U.S. efforts will meet in Washington on Wednesday to kick off the joint initiative. The project will focus on improved legislation to protect vulnerable children and adults in the United States, as well as a push for more accountability and transparency in the U.S. supply chain by retailers and manufacturers to make sure their products are 'slave-free.' President of the International Justice Mission Gary A. Haugen said Google's coalition will focus on three initiatives: . The trafficking of women for the sex trade is common in big American cities. Some illegal immigrants find themselves forced to work in sweatshops, in private homes as domestic servants or on farms without pay under the threat of deportation. The new effort will launch new initiatives that ordinary Americans can take to help abolish modern-day slavery, such as understanding how their own clothing or smartphones might contain fabrics or components manufactured by forced labour. 'Whether it's by calling the national human trafficking hotline, sending a letter to their senator, or using online advocacy tools, millions of Americans will be able to use their voices to ensure that ending this problem becomes a top priority,' said Bradley Myles, executive director of Polaris Project. Global issue: Some 27million people are slaves or servants today . Google.org — the philanthropy arm of the Silicon Valley firm — announced the anti-slavery effort as part of its $40million in end-of-year giving that brings its charitable donations to more than $100million in 2011. The grants will also support science, technology, engineering and math education; girls' education in the developing world; and the use of technology for social good. Justin Dillon, the founder of Slavery Footprint, said the Google grant would allow the movement to move from 'anecdote and emotion,' to tangible action that could make a dent in history. 'Having a company like Google recognize the value of our work marks a major turning point for the anti-slavery movement,' said Mr Dillon. His non-profit gives consumers some tools to determine whether slaves were used in the making of their goods and teaches them to use social media to sound off about slavery and engage with corporations about their supply chains.","Donation split to go to various coalitions, including ones that combat and educate against slavery .

An asylum seeker who raped a woman and dumped her on a rubbish tip when he was 'finished' has been freed despite Home Office attempts to deport him. Alphonse Semo, 54, was jailed for eight years for the rape and at the end of his term was due to be sent back to the Congo. However two hours before his flight he was given permission to marry his girlfriend and stay in the country. Now a judge has allowed the father-of-five to be released from an immigration detention centre. Convicted rapist Alphonse Semo arrives at his wedding last year after he was granted permission to stay in Britain . He has been fitted with an electronic tag and is required to check in regularly with the authorities. The Home Office is still fighting to have Semo removed but he has applied for judicial review and the case could take the courts years to resolve. Semo was told three years ago that he would be deported after serving the prison sentence he was handed in 2002. However, a Home Office blunder meant he was granted permission to wed his girlfriend, another refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo who became a German national, hours before he was to be sent back to Africa. Officials initially agreed to give the refugee a 'certificate of approval' to wed, then changed their mind. Held: Semo, 54, had been kept at the Colnbrook Immigration Centre in Uxbridge, west London, since 2007 . Then a 'very reluctant' Mr Justice . Collins, sitting in the High Court in March last year, said the Home . Office 'really cannot be allowed to play hot and cold' so decided Semo . could stay for the ceremony. After . a new immigration hearing, the rapist was released on Tuesday from the immigration centre . near Heathrow where he had been held since 2007. Semo, who used to live in Deptford, south-east London, is believed to have now married his long-term partner Bunsana Kalonji. Until the courts make a final ruling on his deportation he can stay in Britain. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'We vigorously opposed this individual’s application for bail and are very disappointed by the court's decision. 'He will be subject to rigorous monitoring, including an electronic tag, and we are continuing to fight for his removal from the UK.'","Alphonse Semo, 54, was allowed by judge to marry girlfriend so can stay in Britain .

A blind golfer was crushed to death by a tram after he accidentally stepped off a platform seconds before it arrived at the station. Gary Thompson, 33, who is believed to have been out at a work Christmas party, was trapped by his chest in Manchester city centre last night. Although witnesses raised the alarm the keen sportsman was later pronounced dead. Mr Thompson, a volunteer at the Imperial . War Museum North, was with a friend who had walked him to the station. But it is thought he then mistimed his approach and fell off the platform in front of the incoming tram. Security guards ran from a nearby hotel to help but the man could not be saved. Watch Commander Ian Spaven, from Manchester Central station, was one of the first on the scene. He said: 'It looked as though the man had stepped from the platform in front of the tram as it was pulling in. 'Our job then was to provide dignity and reduce the impact on the witnesses. According to all accounts it appears to have been a tragic accident.' Mr Thompson, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, was hit at around 11pm last night. He appeared in a local newspaper in 2006 in an appeal for a guide to help him play golf after taking up the sport despite his disability. He was born with deteriorating vision, lost all sight in his right eye at the age of eight and was registered blind. Mr Thompson also enjoyed swimming, darts, indoor bowls and snooker. The North West Ambulance Service said they were inundated with calls from onlookers. A . spokeswoman said: 'We responded to reports of a male trapped under a . tram. He had suffered serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the . scene.' Emergency services work at the scene after Mr Thompson was crushed to death in St Peter's Square, Manchester, last night . A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A man has died following a collision in Manchester city centre. 'Shortly after 11.05pm on 15 December, police were called to St Peter’s Square following reports a man had collided with a tram. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 'The tram service was suspended for several hours while emergency services dealt with this incident.' Several people dialled 999 after the blind man was struck and killed by this tram in Manchester last night . A spokesman for the Imperial War Museum North said Mr Thompson had worked as a volunteer with them for the last four years. He said: 'The team at IWM North are devastated to hear about the tragic accident involving Gary Thompson. 'Gary started volunteering at the museum in 2007 helping visitors to get the most from their visit and was an extremely valued member of the Volunteer team. 'Although visually impaired Gary was exceptionally independent and had a courageous spirit. 'He was very active in the museum world providing advice and support for access issues at IWM North and other museums and organizations in the region.' Mr Thompson is the seventh person to be killed by trams in Manchester since 1992. His parents Corrine and Eric, and his brother Karl, said in a statement that Gary lived a 'fulfilling life' They said: 'Gary was a son and brother we are all proud of. He overcame his disabilities and lived a fulfilling life, achieving a degree at Bolton University in business management earlier this year. 'Gary enjoyed writing poetry and had a number of poems published. 'He did a lot of work for the community, including volunteering at the Imperial War Museum North as a guide.

"By . Sarah Harris . Last updated at 7:04 AM on 16th December 2011 . Proud: St Mary's headteacher Kim Hall, whose school is one of the best-performing in the country . The devastating extent to which primary schools are failing bright pupils was revealed yesterday. Up to 51,000 11-year-olds who achieved top grades at age seven have effectively gone backwards after being left to coast in maths and English. Four in ten youngsters who were above average in the three Rs at seven are failing to fulfil their early promise, official league tables show. Around half of primary schools – more than 7,500 – have failed to get each of their brightest pupils up to the highest grades in Key Stage Two tests at 11. Among these schools, more than 800 could not get all their young high achievers even up to the national average. This left around 1,300 pupils at a disadvantage when they started secondary school in September. Despite their flying start, they were still struggling to grasp the point of a story, write sentences using commas or add, subtract, multiply and divide in their heads. The Department for Education has identified a hard core of 15 schools where more than 20 per cent of pupils who were high attainers at seven sank to the ranks of the lowest achievers at 11. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said the Government was ‘shining a light’ on these schools. Critics claim the figures are a damning indictment of a league table culture which has encouraged schools to concentrate on youngsters of low to middle ability at the expense of the brightest. Schools are judged on how  well they do in getting pupils to level four, the expected standard, in the basics and many teachers focus their efforts on borderline pupils to improve their league table positions. The Department for Education . yesterday published school-by-school data for around 15,000 state . primaries in England, based on national curriculum test results in . English and maths. The tables reveal for the first time . how low, middle and high achieving pupils at seven go on to perform in . the Key Stage Two tests four years later. The statistics show that more . than 2,000 primary schools are serving their middle achievers better . than their brightest pupils in English lessons. There is at least a 20 percentage . point gap in the levels of progress made by middle versus high achievers . in the subject in 2,160 schools. This emphasis has also contributed to . 11 per cent of children – around 32,000 – who were ‘middle’ achievers . at seven rising to join  the ranks of the highest achievers at the age . of 11. The figures show that 74 per cent of . pupils achieved level four in both English and maths this year, up one . percentage point in 12 months. The proportion of bright boys and girls . exceeding the standard expected – level five – fell by four percentage . points to 29 per cent in English and increased by one percentage point . in maths to 35 per cent. Professor Alan Smithers of Buckingham . University said children in the top ability range are ‘perhaps too . often left to their own devices’. He said: ‘The way schools are judged . has a massive effect on their behaviour. If they are asked to account . for how many children are getting to level four, that’s where their . effort is going to go. ‘We don’t do enough for the really able in our education system.’ Nearly one in ten state primary . schools face possible closure or takeover after failing to hit Coalition . targets in the three Rs. Nationally, 1,310 are falling short of Government benchmarks in English and maths. Ministers have already identified the . 200 worst primaries which will be pulled out of local authority control . and turned into academies under new leadership teams as early as next . September. Hundreds more will now be ordered to improve or face similar intervention. The head of one of the country’s best primary schools has attacked the Coalition’s education reforms. Paul Fisher, of Oakridge Primary . School in Stafford, claimed yesterday that the changes would focus on . facts instead of skills, and said: ‘Do we want a society that’s great at . pub quizzes or one that’s great at thinking and problem solving?’ Nearly all the 34 children at his . school taking English and maths tests exceeded the standard expected of . their age to gain the higher level five.","1 in 3 pupils fails to reach the expected standard in English and maths .

An elderly woman has been left a prisoner in her own home for three months after the building's owners refused to mend a broken lift. Widow Florence Bailey suffers from heart problems and is too ill to get down the stairs of her flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The 84-year-old, who has lived in the property for 14 years, last left her home in Rena Court in Sparth Lane, Heaton Norris, on September 21. Trapped: Widow Florence Bailey has been stuck in her flat in Stockport since September 21 and cannot get down the stairs . She fears she will now be stuck in the top floor flat for Christmas and New Year. The owners of the building, Northern Estates, refused to mend it claiming it will cost too much to fix. In addition, they are not legally obliged to provide lift access for people living there. Mrs Bailey said: 'I am really missing going out, I don't like losing my independence. I feel like a prisoner in my own home.' The firm, which is based in Manchester, wrote to all the residents at Rena Court on September 22 saying repairs would cost £15,000 and it had been decided that it was not 'economically viable to continue to maintain the lift in operational condition'. Mrs Bailey, who used to run a sweet shop in Heaton Chapel with her late husband, has been relying on neighbours to get her shopping. The owners of Rena Court, Northern Estates, refused to mend the lift claiming it will cost £15,000 which it says is too much to fix . She said: 'I would normally get a bus to Stockport two or three times a week. I don't know when I will get out again.' 'It is very frustrating, I feel guilty having to rely on the kindness of others. But they shouldn't have to do it - there should be a lift that works.' Sarah Woods, residential properties manager for Northern Estates, said: 'We have been working hard to identify the problems with the lift at Rena Court, but it has been deemed unsafe and beyond economic repair by our lift engineers. 'Under the circumstances, and because we cannot procure appropriate insurance cover, we have no alternative other than to de-commission the lift at this time for the safety of tenants. 'We sincerely regret any inconvenience or difficulties that this may have caused.' The company submitted plans to the council to renovate the flats in September 2010, including proposals for a new lift. But the plans are yet to be approved. Mrs Bailey added: 'These plans could take years to go through, if at all. So then we would never get a lift. I just don't know what I would do then.'","Florence Bailey fears she will be stuck inside over Christmas and New Year .

Theatregoers watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs this Christmas are complaining of being short-changed in more ways than one after producers replaced the dwarfs with child actors to cut costs. The children appear on stage wearing masks, but their lines are pre-recorded by adult actors and played to the theatre on a loop while the young performers try to match their movements to the soundtrack. The dwarfs have been replaced by children in masks but this has upset some pantomime loved who feel they are being short-changed . Axed: Dwarf actors have been axed from Wolverhampton's Grand Theatre's production of Snow White because they are too expensive. Child actors, pictured, have stepped into the role instead . And audience members aren’t the only . ones giving directors short shrift over the move, as dwarfs are furious . that the ‘greedy’ decision has put them out of work. A spokesman for the production at . the  Wolverhampton Grand, which stars Sam Kane and his wife, former page . three girl Linda Lusardi, said the decision was taken because dwarf . actors were ‘very, very expensive’ and most of the show’s budget was . taken up by special effects. But Peter Burroughs, director of . Willow  Management, an agency specialising in the representation of . dwarf actors, complained that the move ‘destroyed the magic’ of the . classic pantomime. Mr Burroughs, who is a dwarf himself, . added: ‘It’s not fair at all – it destroys the magic  to have the . voices pre-recorded. It’s tradition to have dwarfs in this role, the . clue is in the name in the first place. ‘I had one guy on our books who was . due  to perform there. He is absolutely devastated. I have never heard . of a company pre-recording the words that will be spoken by  the dwarfs. There’s no way that  will seem right. ‘I suppose it’s a sign of the harsh . economic times, but there remain plenty of other companies who are able . to put on shows with some of our actors in their proper roles.’ The wicked queen: Former page 3 girl Linda Lusadi is appearing at the Wolverhampton Grand Theatre . Mr Burroughs admitted dwarf actors . command a slight premium over other supporting actors in shows because . of the ‘niche market’ they operate in. He said the cost of hiring a dwarf to . appear in the pantomime would be between £600 and £850 per week, . adding: ‘These guys are trying to earn a living wage. Wolverhampton . theatre is stripping small people of their livelihood. ‘It’s not very nice to be exploiting them like this and I hope the general public see this. To me this is just plain greedy.’ Qdos entertainment, the company . behind the pantomime, would not reveal how much the child actors would . be paid for playing the seven dwarfs. But over the show’s six-week run, if . each dwarf was paid £700 per week the bill would amount to almost . £30,000. In the theatre’s 2006 production of the same fairytale, seven . dwarfs hired from an acting agency did appear. The attempt to save cash this year . comes despite the theatre breaking its own sales record last year with a . different pantomime, which took more than £1.1million. Jonathan Kiley, a director of Qdos . Entertainment, said the company was still investing ‘hundreds of . thousands of pounds’ in the theatre’s annual spectacular. He added: ‘Shows have become . incredibly expensive as audiences expect amazing effects and sound . quality they would get from the stereo in their homes. ‘We want the shows to be as fantastic as possible and we spend a lot of money on effects. ‘But money isn’t limitless and dwarfs . are very, very expensive.’ Mr Kiley claimed the children worked ‘quite . well’, adding: ‘With the masks and costumes on they look just like the . Disney dwarfs.’ However, the move has not gone down . well with theatregoers. One said: ‘I could go to any amateur production . and see children playing dwarfs.’ And John Eley, a 27-year-old teacher from Walsall who was planning to go to the performance, said he had now changed his mind. He added: ‘It’s cutting corners, . isn’t it? I could understand it at a school pantomime but not in a big . theatre.

But four weeks later her mother Kay noticed the surgery scar was bubbling. To their horror, it suddenly exploded, leaking foul-smelling green puss. Number one fan: Leah spent months recovering at home between hospital visits in her bedroom festooned with JLS memorabilia . Leah was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery on the infected wound and then treated at home. Leah lost two stone in weight as she struggled to eat and the wound exploded again in June. This time she was diagnosed with chronic septicaemia. She underwent a blood transfusion and emergency surgery revealed she had a huge abscess on her bowel. Her parents Kay and Michael were warned there was a chance they could lose her. But the JLS fan slowly started to recover boosted by a surprise phone call a few weeks later. While she was staying at Royal . Manchester Children's Hospital nurses had alerted a charity to Leah's . plight who got in touch with JLS. Leah, wearing a JLS jumper, reveals her infected wound.

Mrs Price said: 'I was hoping they would send . her card but Aston picked up the phone and rang the hospital . personally. When Leah took the call she burst into tears.' Leah had to spend six weeks in isolation in hospital over the summer during which time she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. But the teenager managed to battle on by listening to her favourite JLS songs as she lay in bed. Her mother Kay, 45, an optician's assistant from Leigh, Greater Manchester, said: 'Throughout her stays in hospital listening to JLS was the only thing that really got Leah through. 'She had their posters up all around her room as well as having their DVD and CDs on constantly. 'No matter how many antibiotics and . pain-killers she took, there was only one thing that could really help . her feel better and that was listening to JLS.' Then the charity Rays of Sunshine gave her an even greater reason to get better - they organised for Leah and her family to travel down to London to meet JLS in person in November. 'The lads were absolutely wonderful,' Mrs Price said. 'At . one point Leah asked Aston where he got his bracelet from, so he just . took it off and gave it to her. 'The day was so emotional because to go . through so many months of unhappiness to finally see her so happy was . fantastic, she didn't stop crying tears of happiness. 'Without them I just don't know how Leah . would have pulled through.' Dream come true: Leah met her idols last month after her wish was granted by the Rays of Sunshine charity . Although Leah's recovery is far from over and she faces more surgery, the family is looking to the future. Kay said: 'Leah has been through so much and we are so proud of the way she has dealt with everything. I don't think I'd have coped in her situation. 'We were so close as a family but with Leah being away from us for so we feel like we were split up as a family because her dad, Michael, and I had to take it in turns to stay at hospital with her. 'We know that there are going to be many more challenges in front of us but we are focusing now on sorting the immediate problems out and getting Leah better and back to school.'

"By . Richard Kay . Last updated at 9:53 AM on 6th December 2011 . As our best-known animal lover, the Queen has taken a keen interest in the mystery illness that has struck down dogs after they have been walked in woods on her Sandringham estate, killing at least eight of them. Now, just as she prepares for her family Christmas at Sandringham, Her Majesty has received some welcome news. The Queen, who asked scientists from the Animal Health Trust to investigate the canine illness, had warned dog walkers to be vigilant after her land became the worst hit area in the country. Welcome news: The Queen had taken a keen interest in the mystery bug which had struck down the dogs . Her own dogs are equally at risk, including her corgis and the Labradors that pick up pheasants on her Boxing Day shoot. The trust believes that the outbreak of so-called Seasonal Canine Illness, which affected 49 dogs exercised in woodland at Sandringham this autumn, appears to be over. No new cases have been reported for more than a month, so the Queen can relax, knowing that royal shooting parties on the estate are no longer at risk. The trust also believes it has discovered the cause, after a botanist from the Natural History Museum was able to rule out various theories. Outbreak: The Seasonal Canine Illness had also affected dog walkers in Sherwood Forest (pictured) There was no sign, I gather, that any plant or fungus was the cause following soil tests which proved negative. Instead, the trust now thinks the bug is linked to bites from an infestation of harvest mites. It says that there have been 95 cases this year in five areas, including Sherwood and Thetford forests, but Sandringham was worst affected. Two dogs walked on the royal estate this year have died, while six died last year. However, survival rates improved after the Queen ordered estate managers to put up signs warning dog owners to watch for symptoms. Buckingham Palace has refused to say if the Queen has stopped walking her dogs on the estate because of the outbreak. A spokeswoman says: ‘The Sandringham estate is taking  the reports of sick dogs very seriously.’ Next Labour leader? Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper appeared on The Andrew Marr Show last weekend . Fortune appears to be smiling on shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper: bookmakers have her as 3-1 favourite to succeed Ed Miliband as the next Labour leader. She also has the seal of approval from multi-millionaire novelist Ken Follett and his  former Labour MP wife, Barbara. The Folletts bankrolled Cooper’s husband Ed Balls’s failed attempt to become party leader last year to the tune of £127,500. With Balls’s chances of taking the top job all but sunk, they have now moved on to funding his wife. According to the latest register of MPs’ interests, Barbara gave Cooper £4,550 to help pay a member of staff. Verbier bash: Holly Branson joined ber future husband on his stag do . Coming from such an unconventional family, it was perhaps not surprising that Holly Branson broke with tradition to celebrate her hen night. For rather than being parted from fiancé Freddie Andrews, he came along too for his stag night. The daughter of Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson flew with shipbroker Freddie to Switzerland at the weekend for a lavish party at her father’s luxury ski lodge in upmarket Verbier — along with 26 friends. All the girls wore matching T-shirts — but, fortunately for Holly, she was spared the usual embarrassment of a hen do when the suitcase containing her party kit was lost. ‘It was such a pity Holly’s hen bag didn’t turn up,’ I am told. ‘There were a few surprises in there.’ The group boarded a coach at Geneva airport and were whisked to Sir Richard’s nine-bedroom chalet, which rents out at £99,800 a week at the height of the skiing season. The retreat has 13 full-time staff, including a Raymond Blanc-trained chef. Although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are close friends of the couple, they were not at the jollities. Freddie and Holly are due to wed on Necker, Branson’s privately-owned Caribbean island, this month. Joanna Lumley and her former husband Jeremy Lloyd will be reunited on . stage at the Royal Albert Hall . The last time actor and writer Jeremy Lloyd and Joanna Lumley, his former wife, worked together was in a 1971 TV series. David Croft, who helped with the script, was persuaded on-set by Lloyd to do a sitcom based in a department store. The rest is history as Lloyd and Croft’s comedy classic Are You Being Served? is still shown in more than 50 countries. On Sunday, Lloyd and Lumley will be reunited on stage at the Royal Albert Hall for a charity production of Captain Beaky & His Band, the poetry Lloyd set to music in 1977. The 80-year-old will be introduced on stage by Lumley. ‘It felt like we were married for ten minutes, but it was for a year,’ he says. ‘Joanna wrote that maybe we shouldn’t have got married, and just had an affair instead. ‘But I don’t regret it for a second and we have remained great friends.’ And Lloyd is clearly still on good terms with Charlotte Rampling, to whom he was engaged for three years: she is travelling from her home in Paris for the show. Tribute: Poppy Floyd, daughter of Keith Floyd, is developing a television tribute to her late father . More than two years after the death of maverick celebrity chef Keith Floyd, his daughter Poppy, 27, is developing a television tribute to her late father. Hard-living Floyd died on the same night a less-than-flattering Channel 4 documentary was screened about him — a film that upset his family and friends. Floyd’s manager Stan Green tells me . plans are afoot for Poppy — from Keith’s second marriage to Julie . Hatcher — to front a show, Floyd On Floyd, celebrating her father’s . eventful career. ‘She’s very much her father’s daughter,’ says Green. ‘She’s like a little Keith, but only with his nice side! ‘I’ve . long thought we needed a programme that actually celebrates Keith’s . career and Poppy is the perfect person to do it. When I approached her, . she thought it was a great idea.’ He . adds: ‘Poppy is a trained architect, not a cook. But she will be . visiting the places her father went to during his career, re-telling his . stories and adventures.’ Architectural historian Gavin Stamp is furious with architect Lord Foster, who used an Oxford University lecture to attack Heathrow airport as unviable (Foster wants it sold off and turned into housing). Of course, it just so happens that Foster, 75, is promoting his own proposals for a new four-runway airport in the Thames estuary which would earn his company several millions. Professor Stamp is unimpressed: ‘Am I alone in getting rather tired of that distinguished tax exile Lord Foster pontificating from his Swiss eyrie on how London should be re-planned — always with megalomaniac schemes requiring the benevolent intervention of some large architectural practice such as his own?’ PS What has Radio 4 presenter Libby Purves got against biographer Sarah Bradford? Yesterday, Purves used her newspaper column to take aim at the author, who has a new royal book out, after Bradford’s admission that she was possibly mistaken to have once written that Prince Philip had been unfaithful. ‘No indication of an apology to the husband of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England for suggesting he broke the seventh Commandment,’ she thundered. Bradford insists she and Purves have no history of hostility. ‘I’ve not met her and have nothing against her,’ she says. ‘The whole thing made me laugh. I’m an innocent bystander.’",Outbreak of Seasonal Canine Illness appears to be over .
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:10 PM on 16th December 2011 . Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is reportedly addicted to alcohol and can’t get to sleep without having a drink. A source told the Chicago Sun-Times the ex-politician drinks himself ‘into a condition’ to get some sleep but is not addicted to sleeping pills. The claim comes as his lawyers asked to have him placed in a drug abuse programme when he starts his 14-year prison sentence for corruption. Addicted to alcohol? A source told the Chicago Sun-Times former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich drinks himself 'into a condition' to get some sleep . Blagojevich and his lawyers have not publicly identified any problems with drug abuse in the three years since his arrest in December 2008. The request could be a move to cut time off his sentence. Many criminals ask to join the drug rehab or other programmes, legal experts say. His lawyers are trying to cut down his sentence, and if it turns out he has alcohol or drug problems then a rehab programme could reduce his term. Prisoners in the programme generally live apart from other inmates, work fewer hours and are eligible for up to a year in reduced prison time. Judge James Zagel will recommend him for the programme but federal prison officials get the final say on whether he can enter it. Jail: Judge James Zagel agreed on Tuesday to recommend Blagojevich for the low-security Englewood prison in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver . Blagojevich faces 14 years in prison for corruption, including charges he tried to sell or trade the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama. 'Rod can’t sleep without drinking. So he drinks himself into a condition to do so, and it became an addiction' Chicago Sun-Times source . The disgraced politician was also convicted of trying to shake down hospital and racetrack executives and of lying to the FBI. Judge Zagel agreed on Tuesday to recommend Blagojevich for the low-security Englewood prison in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver. About 60 inmates out of about 800 are in the residential drug abuse programme. Blagojevich is scheduled to report to prison on March 15.","Former Illinois governor faces 14 years in Colorado jail .

"Separate incidents happened within hours of each other in Las Vegas . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:19 AM on 16th December 2011 . A ten-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl who shot themselves may have intentionally pulled the trigger, police said today. Kameron Asgari, ten, died from his injuries on Tuesday and the girl, who has not been identified, was left in a critical condition in a separate incident nine hours later. Both are believed to have found the weapons at their homes in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shooting: Kameron Asgari, ten, is believed to have killed himself at his home in Las Vegas but a cause of death has not been confirmed . The children did not know each other, . according to spokesman Bill Cassell said. It was unknown whether the . firearms belonged to their parents. Kameron Asgari, was in the fifth grade at Helen Jydstrup Elementary School in Las Vegas. It was unclear if he attended school the morning he shot himself, said David Roddy, spokesman for the Clark County School District. Privacy laws prohibited school officials . from disclosing whether Kameron had been involved in any disciplinary . actions or requested counselling before the shooting. Both incidents are under investigation. The medical examiner has not released an exact cause of death for . the ten-year-old boy. Counsellors were supporting Kameron's classmates and teachers. School officials wrote to parents asking them to keep a close eye on their children's behaviour. Grieving: Classmates and teachers were being offered counselling at the child's school in Las Vegas, Nevada . In a letter, Principal David Fydman said: 'Please monitor any signs of grief or behavioral changes in your child/children as this loss may affect them in unexpected ways. 'It is important to be honest with him or her and to allow them to express feelings of grief, anger and/or disbelief. 'Reassure your child that there is always someone with whom he/she can talk and that the many mixed emotions they might be feeling, and may feel for some time, are normal.' Police spokesman Bill Cassell said the shootings should remind gun owners to securely store their weapons and to instruct children to avoid touching any gun found inside the home. He said: 'When we have the awesome power of a firearm, we have to control it and protect everyone from an unwanted occurrence.' Kathleen Sandoval, wife of Nevada's governor Brian Sandoval, said people should be made aware of government-backed counseling resources. Mrs Sandoval said: 'I am extremely saddened to hear recent reports of youth suicide in our state and in our country.'",Separate incidents happened within hours of each other in Las Vegas .
"By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 7:32 AM on 16th December 2011 . Tensions in Europe took on a literary . flavour yesterday as the French snatched a tiny but historically . priceless Charlotte Bronte manuscript from under the nose of a British . museum. The unpublished . work, written in 1830 when she was just 14 and containing a story which . is a precursor to a famous passage in her novel Jane Eyre, was bought . for a record £690,850 by Le Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris at . auction. The Bronte . Parsonage Museum, in the literary family’s home in Haworth, West . Yorkshire, was so keen to acquire the miniature treasure that it had . launched a fundraising appeal before the sale at Sotheby’s in London. Tiny tale: The colourful tale of murder and madness is part of a 4,000-word magazine with 19 pages, written by the young Bronte . It secured a £613,140 grant from the . National Heritage Memorial Fund, leaving enough to bid up to a hammer . price of £560,000 for the work, which Charlotte Bronte wrote to . entertain her sisters Emily and Anne, and brother Branwell. But . after several minutes of intense bidding against the French, the museum . team sadly had to stop when their rivals upped their offer by £20,000. The hand-written 19-page miniature magazine, called Young Men’s . Magazine Number 2, sold for a hammer price of £580,000. The . total sale price – including the buyer’s premium, a commission . routinely paid to the auctioneers on top of the hammer price – was . £690,850, well above the amount the Bronte Parsonage Museum could . afford. It was a new record at auction for a manuscript by any of the Bronte sisters, a Sotheby’s spokesman said. Emily Bronte is best known for Wuthering Heights, her only novel. Anne Bronte wrote Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. One of the tales in the manuscript is . a precursor to a passage in Charlotte Bronte’s 1847 novel Jane Eyre, in . which Mr Rochester’s insane wife Bertha, who is kept in the attic, . seeks revenge by setting fire to his bed curtains. The Young Men’s . Magazine Number 2 tells of a  murderer driven to madness after being . haunted by his victim. ‘An immense fire’ burns in his head and he . envisages his bed curtains going up in flames. Size of a credit card: Reading the magazine requires a magnifying-glass as the entire manuscript is in miniature, the pages only 35 x 61mm . After the auction, Bonnie Greer, . president of the Bronte Society, said: ‘This “Little Book” puts down in . luminous prose not only the daydreams of a little Yorkshire girl, but it . also contains the seed of the work of one of the greatest writers in . the English language, Charlotte Bronte. ‘It will not be going home, back to . the place where it all began, the Parsonage at Haworth. Its presence . there would have placed it not only at the heart of the proud community . in which she was born and raised, but would have brought full circle a . Yorkshire story, a Northern story, a British story, a world story.’ Andrew McCarthy, director of the . Bronte Parsonage Museum, added: ‘This is unquestionably the most . significant Bronte manuscript to come to light in decades and an . important part of our broader literary heritage. ‘It belongs in Haworth and we are . bitterly disappointed that scholars and members of the public may now . not have the opportunity to study and enjoy it as part of our public . collection.’ The . French museum, on Paris’s fashionable Left Bank, plans to exhibit the . manuscript next month.  It is one of the richest and most prestigious . archives in France, and receives direct government funding through the . country’s Culture Ministry. Mr McCarthy said it was ‘some consolation’ that it would be on public display somewhere. He . added that his museum would be seeking to contact the new owner with . the hope that the manuscript might at least be loaned to it at some . point. The miniature . magazine, previously owned by an unnamed private collector in Europe, . contains 4,000 words and each of its page measures just 1.4 in by 2.4 . in. It is one of six . volumes in a series of miniature magazines created by the young Brontes, . inspired by a box of toy soldiers bought for Branwell by his father. They began creating tiny books for the toy soldiers to ‘read’. The Bronte Parsonage Museum already owns four of the others. The sixth remains untraced.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 9:31 AM on 16th December 2011 . The computer hacker who betrayed alleged Wikileaks whistleblower Bradley Manning - who faces a lifetime in prison without parole - said he 'thinks about him every day'. Adrian Lamo, 30, has been dubbed the 'world's most hated hacker' after he passed information about Manning - who today appears in court charged with illegally transferring U.S. state secrets to the website - to U.S. military intelligence. He also said it would be to his 'lasting regret' if the man he described as an 'idealistic young man who could change the world for the better' was sent to prison for a long period. Controversial: Adrian Lamo (left) was labelled a 'snitch' for telling the U.S. military what Bradley Manning (right) was allegedly up to . He said: 'I think about him every day. The decision was not one I decided to make, but was thrust upon me.' But, despite supporters of 23-year-old Manning fears that the soldier could be locked up for the rest of his life, he still insisted he had done the right thing. He added: 'Had I done nothing, I would always have been left wondering whether the hundreds of thousands of documents that had been leaked to unknown third parties would end up costing lives, either directly or indirectly.' Lamo made his comments last night, hours before the start of a pre-trial hearing in the prosecution of Manning in Fort Meade, Maryland. It is alleged that Manning, a soldier, contacted Lamo on AOL instant messaging on May 21, 2010, using the name Bradass87. He knew of Lamo because of his celebrity status in the hacking world. He had been prosecuted in 2003 for breaking into the New York Times network, and put on six months' house arrest. Information: Wikileaks was set up in 2007 by journalist and computer programmer Julian Assange so whistleblowers, journalists and activists could publish sensitive materials without fear of being identified . During the internet chat, it is alleged that Manning asked: 'if you had free reign [sic] over classified networks for long periods of time, things that belonged in the public domain, what would you do?' It is then claimed he told Lamo he had been downloading U.S. state secrets on to a CD, on which he had written Lady Gaga. Wikileaks was set up in 2007 by journalist and computer programmer Julian Assange (pictured). Mr Assange said he wanted to allow whistleblowers, journalists and activists to publish sensitive materials without fear of being identified. His parents met at a demonstration against the Vietnam war. As a teenager, his mother rode into city hall on a horse to protest against the closing of pony trails. Mr Assange has refused repeated requests by the U.S. intelligence agencies to meet them on 'neutral territory' to discuss his sources. His website's complex setup is designed to ensure that information sent to it is anonymised before it is passed to the web servers. Its servers are spread all over the world and do not keep logs, so governments and other organisations cannot trace where the information is being sent and received from. Even so, WikiLeaks encourages donors of sensitive material to post the material to them on CDs, over encrypted internet connections or from net cafes. They say this is so that even if WikiLeaks were infiltrated by a government intelligence agency, submitters could not be traced. Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a US air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007. But Assange recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds. The stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange. Lamo passed the details of the conversation to the U.S. military and, on May 26, Manning was arrested while on duty at the Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad. He had been working there as an intelligence officer. Lamo was labelled a 'snitch' by hackers, but remained unrepentant. He said: 'I'm not a politician running for re-election. I don't need to be popular among the hacker community, and I most likely will never be liked in the hacker community.' He said he thought long and hard about what to do but in the end believed Manning's wellbeing was not as important as the security of U.S. armed forces. Manning is set to make his first public appearance today at the opening of his pre-trial hearing. The secretive military base is, ironically, home to U.S. Cyber Command, the organisation whose mission includes protecting computer networks like the one Manning allegedly breached by illegally downloading huge numbers of classified documents in Iraq. He is suspected of giving them to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that last year began publishing the materials. The hearing is expected to last through the weekend and possibly beyond. It is intended to yield a recommendation to Army Major General Michael S Linnington, commander of the Military District of Washington, on whether Manning should be court-martialed. Linnington could choose other courses, including applying an administrative punishment or dismissing some or all of the 22 counts against Manning. If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Manning could face life in prison. The government has said it would not seek the death penalty. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday called Manning's alleged actions damaging and unfortunate in remarks to reporters at the State Department. She said: 'I think that in an age where so much information is flying through cyberspace, we all have to be aware of the fact that some information which is sensitive, which does affect the security of individuals and relationships, deserves to be protected and we will continue to take necessary steps to do so.' The Manning case has led to a debate over the broader issue of whether the government's system for classifying and shielding information has grown so unwieldy that it is increasingly vulnerable to intrusions. The New York University School of Law's Brennan Centre for Justice wrote in a recent report that the case points up a central problem with government secrets: 'There simply are too many of them.' Detained: The military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas where Wikileaks whistleblower suspect Bradley Manning was being held . It added: 'As long as over-classification remains rampant, there will be those who see no harm in leaking classified information and/or who believe they are performing a public service by doing so - and the nation will continue to face the risk that such leaks will include secrets genuinely worth keeping.' Absent from the Meade proceedings will be Julian Assange, who runs WikiLeaks from England. He is fighting in British courts to block a Swedish request that he be extradited to face trial over rape allegations. A U.S. grand jury is weighing up whether to indict Assange on espionage charges, and WikiLeaks is straining under an American financial embargo that Assange says has starved it of revenue. Friends: Bradley Manning (right) with Tyler Watkins . The materials Manning is accused of leaking include hundreds of thousands of sensitive items: Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. At the time, Manning, a native of Crescent, Oklahoma, was a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Manning, who turns 24 tomorrow, was detained in Iraq in May 2010 and moved to a Marine Corps brig at Quantico, Virginia, in July. Nine months later the Army sent him to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after a series of claims by Manning of unlawful pretrial punishment. When it filed formal charges against Manning in March 2011, the Army accused him of using unauthorized software on government computers to extract classified information, illegally download it and transmit the data for public release by what the Army termed 'the enemy'. The first large publication of the documents by WikiLeaks in July 2010, some 77,000 military records on the war in Afghanistan, made global headlines. But the material provided only limited revelations, including unreported incidents of Afghan civilian killings as well as covert operations against Taliban figures. In October 2010, WikiLeaks published a batch of nearly 400,000 documents that dated from early 2004 to Jan 2010. They were written mostly by low-ranking officers in the field cataloguing thousands of battles with insurgents and roadside bomb attacks, plus equipment failures and shootings by civilian contractors. The documents did not alter the basic outlines of how the war was fought. A month later, WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of State Department documents that revealed a hidden world of backstage international diplomacy. They divulged candid comments from world leaders and detailed occasional U.S. pressure tactics aimed at hot spots in Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.","Hacker Adrian Lamo told U.S. military what Manning was allegedly doing .
