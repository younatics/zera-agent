"It has all come together in a few days for Danny Welbeck. At the start of last week, he was unwanted by Louis van Gaal and well down the pecking order as a centre forward for Manchester United. A few days later, by which time he had moved to Arsenal for £16million and completed an excellent 20 minutes as a substitute with England, the outlook suddenly seemed considerably brighter. With Olivier Giroud injured and Alexis Sanchez just as likely to play wide, he has every chance of starting down the middle against Manchester City next Saturday. And Daniel Sturridge’s injury means a similar scenario is unfolding for Monday night in England’s Euro 2016 qualifier, where he is likely to start up front with former United team-mate Wayne Rooney. Frontman: Danny Welbeck leads the way during an England training session . The fact he has diligently performed as a wide-left midfielder probably counted against him in the past, in that he has scored only every three games when he has started in the league. But in his mind Welbeck is a centre-forward. ‘I prefer to play there, yeah,’ he said. ‘It’s up to the manager, I don’t pick the team. I can’t say I want to play here or there.’ The fact that he was answering the question sat next to the England manager is an indication of his self-confidence. For Welbeck, 24, this does seem to be a watershed moment. Certainly for his club, and perhaps for his country, he will get his wish to carry the goal-scoring burden. As such, perhaps he can take encouragement from Sturridge, the man whose place he takes on Monday. At Manchester City and Chelsea, Sturridge looked to be a wide player who could fill in as a centre-forward. Only when Brendan Rodgers started playing him consistently in the central role at Liverpool did he add the prolific goalscoring. Welbeck can only hope the same proves to be the case at Arsenal. All change: Outlook suddenly seems considerably brighter for Welbeck . He said: ‘We’ll see when I get my opportunity to do that. I’ve never had the opportunity to get a run of games as a No 9 but I have faith in my ability. If I get the opportunity to do what I know I can do, then things might change. But until then I’ll work hard wherever I play.’ The stats back him up. When he has started as a centre forward for United, his goal average is 0.43 per game as opposed to 0.30. There has always been a feeling that much of Welbeck’s best football has been in an England shirt, though he does not agree. ‘Maybe when I have been away with England and been a bit further up the pitch, it has been better for me,’ he said. ‘But I wouldn’t say typically I’ve played better for England.’ Now he is part of a generation called on to revitalise interest in the national team, a responsibility he seems keen to embrace, well aware of the negativity surrounding England since the World Cup. Responsibility: Welbeck’s best football has been in an England shirt . ‘When we get together as a group we can clarify what we think went wrong,’ he said. ‘We can speak about where we can improve and analyse how things went. We’ll all have our opinions and talk it over. ‘There are a lot of younger players than me in the squad. It’s good to see that youngsters are being given the opportunity to play in the national side. Coming to this stage of my career, I really want to push on now and be the best I can be.’ He was an integral part of England’s best period in a dismal World Cup. In the opening 35 minutes against Italy, England looked like a team who might take on the world, with Welbeck linking superbly with Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. Threat: Welbeck is likely to link up with Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney . ‘I don’t think we got bullied or obliterated at the World Cup. The results didn’t go our way and it was very disappointing for us as a nation. The players really felt it. After the Uruguay game in the dressing-room it’s one of those moments you will remember and keep with you. ‘I have had plenty of those moments in my career and it has only driven me on to do better things. When we lost the league on the last day of the season [at Sunderland in 2012] with Man United and the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] told us never to forget that moment. The next season we won the league and it’s something that is always in you, that you know what that feeling is like and you don’t want to feel it again.’ The first chance to remedy that disappointment comes in Basel. And Welbeck can expect to be central to the manager’s plans.","Daniel Sturridge's injury means Danny Welbeck could start upfront against Switzerland on Monday .

"Mario Balotelli has already made an impact at Liverpool. He has never been accused of lacking audacity, and one of the first questions he asked on entering the dressing room on Monday was: 'Who takes the penalities?' Balotteli has a formidable record from the spot, not having missed one in 26 attempts for club and country until last September. 'He's brilliant at them — and he knows it,' said manager Brendan Rodgers. 'But Steven Gerrard's the penalty taker. Simple.' Scroll down for videos... On the spot: Mario Balotelli has already asked about penalty responsibilities at Liverpool . No pressure: Former AC Milan striker has only missed one spot kick from 26 attempts . Rodgers is smiling but knows he has taken on the most exacting challenge of his managerial career. We will get the first glimpse of how their relationship is working out when Balotelli makes his return to the Premier League at Tottenham. Rodgers might have got Luis Suarez playing, even after he said he wanted to leave, but successfully channelling the talent of Balotelli would mark him out as an extraordinary man manager. Having worked for years as a youth team coach, Rodgers is relishing the prospect. 'I was excited by it,' he said. 'That was the reason why he was here. I've always had it all my life, with young kids, working with children that were given no hope, to see them flourish. Going to Chelsea, working with inner city kids who needed a chance. People write them off in life, in social life. That was my background all my life.' 'Simple': Brendan Rodgers (L) has told Mario Balotelli that Steven Gerrard (R) takes penalties for Reds . And in football's distorted economics, Milan's decision to sell a player of Balotelli's talent for £16 million represents the ultimate write-off. Rodgers said: 'I see Blackburn holding out for £15m for Jordan Rhodes, who's a terrific young talent. But you look at the market and Mario's an absolute steal at £16m in terms of talent. 'But it's about the package and that's where I have to do my work to make sure we can maximise that talent. 'People have asked me: ''Can he play with Daniel Sturridge?'' He'll play where he's asked to play. It was the same with Suarez. He'll play wherever the team needs. If they need to play two central, they'll do that. If one needs to play wide, they'll do that. If not, one will be on the bench. Fun loving: The former Manchester City forward has already endeared himself to his Liverpool teammates . 'He's a good kid. But you can make young players feel they're more than they are and the ego grows with that. No. You're a talented player, 24 years of age. Come in every day and work your socks off. And that's what he's done. You should have seen him in training this week — doing extras, working on things, practising free kicks, his touch, penalties. Even in the rain. Mr Versatile: Mario Balotelli could be deployed in tandem with Daniel Sturridge or as a lone striker . 'He's got a winning mentality. He came to England and won the FA Cup in his first season at Man City and the league in his second season. He's scored goals at the highest level, both for club and country. And when you see him work on the training field … that's been the big thing. Take away all the background noise, all the stuff that surrounds him. Keep it simple. When you do that the players see his qualities on the training field — which are clear.' Same again? Liverpool face Tottenham after putting nine goals past them in two games last season . But even Rodgers acknowledges that Balotelli is far from ordinary. 'He's got wonderful charisma on the field,' said the Liverpool manager. 'Just his presence. He has beautiful feet, a lovely touch on the ball, great skill, power, pace, a real aerial threat. Once he picks up the elements of this team and how he needs to work to be in this team, then you've got a player who is a genuine world-class talent.' On Sunday we will find out how that individuality squares with the Liverpool team ethic. However it turns out, it will certainly be compelling.

"Daley Blind will join Manchester United for £14million as Louis van Gaal makes his final moves to improve a desperately poor Manchester United side, who were held to a 0-0 draw at Burnley on Saturday and have yet to win this season. The Ajax left-sided defender will have a medical in Manchester with personal terms and the fee between the clubs agreed. Van Gaal has now spent £160 million this summer — with no immediate improvement in the team — almost as much as the club have spent in total over the previous five years. Blind, the son of former Ajax captain Danny, was a key player in Holland’s run to the World Cup semi-finals under Van Gaal and understands the back-three system with which the team are struggling.

Van Gaal, who also managed the player’s father at Ajax, said: ‘Daley will come to Manchester to have his medical and maybe we will have a new player.’ With the transfer deadline on Monday, United appear to have cooled in their pursuit of Sporting Lisbon’s £20m-rated midfielder William Carvalho, for whom Arsenal are ready to bid again. United are expecting to move players out in the next 48 hours. Tottenham are ready to push United to sell Danny Welbeck for £12m but have been told that United are loathe to help out a likely rival for Champions League qualification. Everton and Aston Villa are interested in signing Tom Cleverley, though with only one year left on his deal, the player may prefer a loan. Shinji Kagawa is likely to make an £8m move to Borussia Dortmund but Van Gaal insists: ‘We have to wait and to see because the players are deciding, not the manager.’ Problems: Manchester United are confident that paperwork issues over Marcos Rojo's signing will be resolved . Exit? Tottenham are pursuing a £12m deal for England striker Danny Welbeck . Leaving: Shinji Kagawa is set to complete a return to Borussia Dortmund and leave Manchester United . He claimed that the problems over paperwork with £15m signing Marcos Rojo, 24, would be resolved during the international break. The player has a permit but also needs a visa and the Home Office has insisted Rojo must be interviewed by the Madrid consulate because of an altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010. He was never prosecuted but the case was reopened in May. Rojo does not have a criminal record but it is likely that embassy officials are checking the details before processing the visa.

"Arsenal have made a dramatic last-minute bid to sign Loic Remy in an attempt to scupper Chelsea’s move for the QPR striker. Chelsea are close to agreeing terms with Remy after meeting the Frenchman’s £8m release clause - but on Saturday night Arsenal contacted QPR to confirm that they too would pay £8m and will now attempt to persuade the player to join them. Arsene Wenger will have a natural advantage as a compatriot of the player and Remy, 27, has spent much of the summer holding out for a move to The Emirates and was pictured at games there at the end of last season.

However, Chelsea did make their move first, having launched their bid on Friday after Fernando Torres agreed to join AC Milan on a two-year loan. If Chelsea do miss out on Remy it will prove a major blow as Jose Mourinho has insisted the club need three strikers following Torres’ exit. Chelsea’s first-choice replacement for Torres was Roma striker Mattia Destro, but they have been put off by the Serie A club’s £20m valuation. Remy would be guaranteed more first-team football at Arsenal, with Olivier Giroud out with injury until Christmas and Arsenal lacking any other experienced centre forward other than new signing Alexis Sanchez, who has played more regularly as a wide player in recent years. If Wenger can persuade Remy to join Arsenal it will not only fill a gap in the Arsenal squad but also represent a significant disruption of Chelsea’s transfer plans.

"Roy Hodgson tried to persuade Frank Lampard to change his mind about international retirement when the New York City midfielder joined Manchester City on loan - but says he understands why the midfielder decided to quit after 106 caps. England face Norway at Wembley on Wednesday in their first game since their worst-ever World Cup campaign and next Monday are away to Switzerland in their first Euro 2016 qualifier. Which is why England manager Hodgson asked Lampard to play on in a midfield which has also lost Steven Gerrard. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Frank Lampard on what it means to play for England .

Hodgson said: ‘I spoke a lot with Steven Gerrard and Frank during the World Cup, especially with Frank to find out what he was doing. He actually confided with me at a fairly early opportunity that he was planning to go to New York and to start a new life over there. I immediately discussed how that will affect his England future, so when he then came back to Manchester City to do the period of time there, I immediately contacted him again and asked him: “What are you thinking?” ‘And really what he did was what Steven did and said: “Look I don’t want to turn my back on it. I’ve enjoyed it and I’ve enjoyed the work that we’re doing. But there are issues that I have to consider and there are things for me to weigh up so I need a bit more time. I don’t want to say no now, forget me, because if I can marry the things going on in my head I’d like to carry on.” ‘It wasn’t a shock but, as with Steven, there was hope.’ Nevertheless, Hodgson hopes that the likes of Jack Wilshere can now step up in midfield. He said: ‘It’s been very encouraging for me to see Jack playing pain free and without any fitness issues and even more encouraging to see him playing well as I thought he did for Arsenal against Besiktas. ‘I thought he was very, very good in the centre of midfield and that of course was encouraging because it leads you to hope and believe he could do the same thing in an England shirt.’ Beginnings: Lampard on his England debut - against Belgium at the Stadium of Light in October 1999 .

"Frank Lampard is in the frame for a surprise place in the England squad despite not having played this season. Roy Hodgson will name his England squad this week and is seriously considering the former Chelsea star because of an injury crisis in his midfield. Lampard is likely to be joined by Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph or Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse, both inexperienced players.

Teenager: James Ward-Prowse may become the latest Southampton player to progress to the full England squad . With a Euro 2016 qualifier to play in Switzerland on September 8, the England manager now faces a tough decision about whether to stick with his policy of opting for youth, or to ensure there is some experience in the squad. Such is his shortage in midfield, with his captain Steven Gerrard retired and Ross Barkley, Michael Carrick and Adam Lallana injured and Tom Cleverley yet to play for Manchester United, Hodgson may turn to Lampard, even though he too has yet to play for his new club Manchester City. Hodgson was at Aston Villa against Newcastle, meaning Delph could be an option in central midfield for this week’s squad, while his assistant Ray Lewington was at St Mary’s Stadium checking on Ward-Prowse and West Brom striker Saido Berahino. Retired: Steven Gerrard quit international football after the World Cup . Injured: Adam Lallana has been ruled out through injury . Hodgson had previously indicated he would turn to Lampard only in emergencies but he may be forced to do so given his lack of midfield options. For the Football Association, the friendly against Norway on September 3 looks to be an increasingly hard sell, with only 15,000 tickets sold and, on the back of the most disappointing World Cup performance, the attendance is likely to be a record low for an international match at the new Wembley.

"Jose Mourinho insists that he will be able to keep his second choice keeper happy at Chelsea even though Paris St Germain are ready to move for Petr Cech this week in anticipation of the Chelsea keeper being dropped for the opening match of the club’s season at Burnley. Mourinho will only reveal his starting line-up on Sunday in training but Mourinho pressed the club to bring Courtois back from his three-year loan spell at Atletico and the Belgian is expected to start at Turf Moor tomorrow. Paris St Germain want to bring Cech and Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, to the club and if a permanent transfer cannot be agreed they would be prepared to take the player on loan, as it would help them in meeting UEFA’s Financial Fair Play restrictions. Dropped: Petr Cech is expected to be dropped for Chelsea's match against Burnley . PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure. PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them as they bid to win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No.1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu. But Mourinho is insistent that he can keep both Courtois and Cech happy and plans to play his second-choice keeper in occasional Premier League and Champions League games to keep him motivated. Mourinho said: ‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club. We can. We are economically stable. . We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers?  I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager. Preference: Jose Mourinho said having a strong goalkeeper is the most essential part of the team . Decisions: Chjelsea have arguably the two best keepers in the league in Cech and Thibaut Courtois . ‘There are teams without a good goalkeeper and that’s a big problem and that’s a problem I don’t want to have. In the team, if you ask me: “Tell me the position, the first position where you want to be strong.” I tell you: “Goalkeeper.” Lollichon would be likely to move with Cech, having worked with him since he played with Rennes in 2002-04 but Mourinho’s assistant manager, Silvino Louro, is also a goalkeeping coach and could fill the gap. Cech, like Didier Drogba, is likely to have a long-term role at the club when his contract runs out in 2016 but that would still be available to him if he spent time out on-loan for the next two years.

"Arsene Wenger has challenged Jack Wilshere to step up and to assume responsibility as a senior player this season saying that the Arsenal midfielder can no longer be considered a young starlet. Wenger believes that Wilshere has been held back by his ankle injury in the past and now that is no longer a worry, he should deliver consistently throughout the season. But the pictures of Wilshere smoking on his recent break in Las Vegas also led to a pre-season meeting with Wenger and reprimands, with the midfielder since apologising for his behaviour. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere: It is totally unacceptable for me to smoke . Progress: Arsene Wenger believes Jack Wilshere (left) must assume responsibility as a senior player . And Wenger sees this as a crucial season for Wilshere, who only played a fringe role in England’s World Cup, coming on as a sub against Italy and starting the dead rubber match against Costa Rica. Wenger said: ‘He’s 22 and with the experience he has I don’t consider him anymore as a guy who is just starting the game. I consider him as a player. He has the experience. For him the problem until now was medical. I think he’s over it now. It’s the first time I’ve seen him not miss a session since the start of the preparations. It’s an important year for Jack: very important. Wilshere is in danger of missing out of Arsenal’s first eleven with Araon Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil all likely to be ahead of him with Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini favoured for more defensive roles but Wenger says that he has the ability to match the progress Ramsey made last season, when the Welshman transformed himself into being Arsenal’s most important player. Setback: Wenger believes that Wilshere has been held back by his ankle injury in the past . ‘I wish that he does that because if the two work together at that level we have a very strong midfield. He was until now a doubt a little bit through injuries. At top-level you need to be consistent with your presence. 'You can play six, seven, eight games and rest one or two but you have to play six, seven on the trot. I think he will be capable of doing it. He prepares well. He has no ankle problem anymore. It could be his year.’ Wilshere could start the Community Shield against Manchester City today with Ozil not returning to the club until Monday after winning the World Cup with Germany, though Wenger may yet prefer Tomas Rosicky. In and out: Wilshere was on the fringes during England's World Cup campaign . Back in the day: Wenger admits that Wilshere can no longer rely on his talented youngster tag . And former Arsenal captain Tony Adamas has also challenged Wilshere to prove himself this season. ‘He must show more hunger and professionalism,’ said Adams. ‘He’s in danger of not fulfilling his potential and his career could be over in the blink of an eye. ‘If push came to shove, for a cup final or a big match, Arsene would pick Ozil ahead of Jack. He should have taken it as a personal insult that Arsenal went out and signed Ozil when they already had the same talent at their disposal in him.’ Paul Scholes also criticised Wilshere last season saying that he had not improved in five years.","Arsene Wenger believes Jack Wilshere must step up as a senior player .

"There is no hiding from the impact that Luis Suarez made at Liverpool. Richard Scudamore, banging the Premier League drum last week, suggested his departure would not hurt the organisation of which he is chief executive. But at Liverpool, even three bites down the line, they view things rather differently. ‘He was a wonderful talent and a wonderful player,’ said Brendan Rodgers. ‘I’m sure most of the Premier League will miss him.’ For Rodgers, last season was the fairytale without the happy ending. No one in the modern era of the Premier League has risen from seventh to second without a huge cash injection from a benefactor. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez at Barcelona and classic Eric Cantona 'devil' advert . Farewell: Luis Suarez waves goodbye to Liverpool fans after his final match at Anfield last season . So close: Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard consoles Suarez after the Reds slip up in title race at Crystal Palace . The fact that Liverpool came within a whisker of winning the title, something most people assumed would have been beyond them for years, made the achievement all the more laudable. Now though, as they take on Southampton at Anfield on Sunday, they must do it all again and this time without one of the world’s great players. Rodgers must strike a balance: being appreciative of what Suarez did for the club while not letting the new group of players obsess on his departure. ‘We gave him everything in support,’ said Rodgers. The Liverpool manager was watching England v Costa Rica when news came through of the latest biting incident of his star player, though by then the wheels were already in motion from Suarez’s side for the move to Barcelona. ‘Luis was a great servant for us in the period he was here. We propelled him from a player some people had never heard of when he came into a world-class player. In the last two seasons in particular his game has been phenomenal. As a club, a city and as supporters we couldn’t have done any more. It was time for both to part and we will continue to grow and get stronger. Happy times: Suarez celebrates his second goal against Norwich during Liverpool's 3-2 win last year . In sync: Suarez had a positive effect on those around him at Anfield, including strike partner Daniel Sturridge . ‘He would get a great reception [if he came back]. Every time he stepped on to the pitch he gave his life to the team. I can never forget his training. You talk about top players helping develop the younger players and I see the attitude of some of our younger players because they’ve worked with the likes of Luis and Steven Gerrard, who give 150 per cent every single day. That was Luis Suarez.’ It puts you in mind of Eric Cantona, another iconic player who left English football prematurely but whose influence continued at Manchester United in David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary and Phil Neville, all of whom cite the Frenchman’s attitude to training as a key influence in their careers. Perhaps Suarez can do the same for Liverpool. ‘Yes, I think he will do,’ said Rodgers. ‘Look at players who were close to him, like young [Philippe] Coutinho, and I know he’s learned from him. He wants to be out training every day. Never misses a day, tries to be better every day, looks after himself. I know Luis was a big influence on him.’ Similar impacts: Brendan Rodgers says he hopes Suarez's ability will inspire Liverpool's current crop, just like Eric Cantona did when he joined Manchester United and then left the club prematurely . Mercurial talent: Cantona strides a challenge from Leeds defender Richard Jobson during his time at United . Role model: Cantona's approach to training inspired a generation of players at Old Trafford including Beckham . There are others who can pick up the mantle. Liverpool, who completed the signing of Sevilla’s £12million defender Alberto Moreno yesterday, have spent about £100m on eight players this summer — three of them from Southampton, making today something of an old boys’ reunion. Rodgers though dismisses the obvious comparison with Tottenham last season, who sold Gareth Bale and signed a similar number of replacements, unsuccessfully. ‘It’s totally different,’ he said. ‘We’ve gone into the Champions League for the first time since 2009. We had a terrific season but the depth of our squad was frighteningly shallow. So we needed to improve the quality but the net spend is very small. It was part of the vision and strategy of the club in terms of what we were trying to do. ‘It’s not as if we’re bringing them straight into the team. We’ve still got our core. It’s not a new team, it’s an evolving team. It’s a totally different scenario. We are clear in our identity of how we play and how we work. ‘We’ve done some great work over the past year in terms of planning for this moment. We knew that this was a big summer for us and if you look at the age group of the players, this will probably be the biggest window that we may have for a few seasons. But we knew that we needed it — it was too late to do it in January.’ After the World Cup, there is a theory that players from less-exalted football countries have to keep working harder for longer to make the grade and Rodgers agrees. ‘We don’t have that here. You’re part of the most brilliant league in the world, the most competitive league in the world.’ He added: ‘We want to be winners, we know that we’re on the way to challenging, which is the most important thing for us.’","Premier League chief executive said Suarez's move would not hurt league .

"Mauricio Pochettino is hoping to bring in new signings before Spurs open their Premier League campaign at West Ham next weekend with the club closing in on a £2.75 million deal for Seattle Sounders right back DeAndre Yedlin. Pochettino denied a deal had been completed for Yedlin but asked about potential signings next week said: ‘In football it’s possible and we will wait to see.’ Yedlin, 21, came on as a substitute in three appearances in the World Cup for the USA, and looks likely to make the move to London but Pochettino will have to wait a little longer to see if Spurs can also bring holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, with Southampton insisting that the Frenchman won’t be sold. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tottenham target DeAndre Yedlin throws first pitch at Mariners . Transfer target: Spurs are close to signing Seattle Sounders defender DeAndre Yedlin for £2.75million . Impressive: £30m man Erik Lamela looks to be in much better form under Mauricio Pochettino than last year . Pochettino at least had some encouragement on Saturday evening as Spurs recorded a comfortable victory over Champions League qualifiers Schalke – though he will have been alarmed by the manner in which Spurs almost let the Bundesliga side back into the game late on. Tottenham looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw left back Ben Davies get his first run out at White Hart Lane and a good debut from Eric Dier, as well encouraging displays from Emanuel Adebayor, Andros Townsend, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela. Dier, born in Essex, raised in Portugal and signed from Sporting last week, looked comfortable at centre half while Adebayor, who missed the pre-season US tour due to malaria, looked back to near full fitness. ‘It was a good performance and not just Eric but the whole team, said Pochettino. ‘Emmanuel is getting stronger every day after it was impossible for him to come on the US tour, but he’s getting better now.’ Opening goal: Emmanuel Adebayor puts Spurs ahead with a left-foot strike in the first half against Schalke . On the scoresheet: Spanish striker Roberto Soldado doubled Spurs' leader in the second half . With Jan Vertonghen, Michael Dawson, Paulinho and possibly Etienne Capoue to come back into this team and with Kyle Walker recovering from injury, Pochettino hasn’t quite shown his full hand as yet. And though Spurs moved the ball well enough, Pochettino was a constant presence on the touchline, cajoling his team and urging them to calm down in possession. ‘It’s hard work to translate your philosophy and put it into practice in 25 days but I’m very pleased with the players,’ he said. Soldado and Adebayor both established credentials for starting at West Ham next week by getting on the score-sheet – but Erik Lamela’s first-half display was the most intriguing. Pochettino does seem to be coaxing better performances from his compatriot, who barely registered last season after his £30m move from Roma. The Argentine looked sharp, bright and ready to impress in the first half, before being one of a number of half-time substitutions. More to do: Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino watches on during the win, but wants to make signings this week . Lamela was involved in the opening goal’s build up, sweeping the ball to Aaron Lennon, who in turn moved it on to Lewis Holtby. The former Schalke player drove in a cross and Emmanuel Adebayor controlled and finished well on 29 minutes. Then Townsend, a second-half substitute, unleashed an excellent strike on 68 minutes which Schalke keeper Ralf Fahrmann did well to push away. First to react though was Soldado, diving forward to send a looping header back over goalkeeper for 2-0. However, Tottenham’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when Dennis Aogo found room down the left to cross for former Spurs man Kevin-Prince Boateng, who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes. Hugo Lloris then got a rare touch on 83 minutes, being forced to dive to his right to touch away Donis Avdijaj’s strike.","USA full-back could sign for £2.75million in coming week .

"Mauricio Pochettino has overcome his first hurdle toward becoming a successful Tottenham manager; he has Ossie Ardiles’ blessing. ‘I spoke with Ossie after I signed,’ said Pochettino. ‘And I met with Ricardo Villa at the last game I played at White Hart Lane with Southampton. Ossie told me it was a good decision joining Spurs. He said: “Well done”. He’s happy. ‘Ossie is in love with Tottenham and he’s an idol here. All he told me about Tottenham was great, unbelievable. And now I can invite him to a barbecue at my house to spend time with him.’ Boost: Mauricio Pochettino (above) claims he has the blessing of Argentine legend Ossie Ardiles . Pochettino and Ardiles certainly would not be short of conversation. Both Argentinian, both have played for the national team and, now, both have managed Tottenham. Of course, their international playing careers took somewhat different paths. Pochettino was just six when Ardiles helped Argentina to World Cup glory in 1978 in Buenos Aires. ‘I watched the game on a black and white TV. It was unbelievable,’ said Pochettino, whose Argentina career was not quite so illustrious. His 20 caps are best remembered on these shores for his clumsy challenge on Michael Owen during the World Cup 2002 group stages that led to David Beckham’s penalty in England’s 1-0 win. However, Pochettino hopes he can go on to emulate and even surpass Ardiles’ legendary status at Tottenham. Helping Spurs break back into the top four would be the best start to his Spurs career and a 2-1 win over Schalke in their final pre-season game will give them confidence. But the 42-year-old insists his job security does not hinge on qualification for the Champions League. Good decision: Former Tottenham star Ardiles has told Pochettino that he made the right choice . ‘I don’t have any specific targets,,’ said Pochettino. ‘Yes, I’m confident I will be given time by the chairman. We need time to decide and make the right decisions. ‘Tottenham is a big club, you always need to win every game. But at the moment we need to develop our philosophy, our style. And at the same moment, you need to provide the club and the players with a new philosophy or new style. ‘It’s true our style is playing attacking football, pressing high and giving our fans enjoyment of the game. But then you need to get results. We need to play to win and, in our style and our philosophy, to keep the ball and play forward and not to change anything whether you play Real Madrid [or not].’ Winners: Tottenham defeated Schalke 2-1 in a pre-season friendly at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Pochettino is confident that his excellent spell at Southampton will leave him in a better position to make a success of his latest role, starting at West Ham on Saturday. He said: ‘Adapting is always difficult. And when you take a job in the Premier League, all clubs have a difficult situation. All players who arrived from a different league — when they don’t speak the same language, it’s difficult to adapt. When I stayed in Spain, I said, “The English league, it’s OK. Learning: The new Spurs boss is confident his spell at Southampton will has left him in a good position . 'It’s competitive”. But, when you arrive, you say, “Ooh, it’s hard — it’s very hard”. And, after, you realise that it’s the most competitive league. I stayed in France and in Spain. It’s not the same. Here, it’s hard. ‘I had an unbelievable year and a half at Southampton. I enjoyed it a lot. I hope I enjoy it here too.’ In the groove: Emmanuel Adebayor was on the score sheet for Spurs on Saturday afternoon .","Mauricio Pochettino reveals Ossie Ardiles has given him the seal of approval as Spurs boss .

Nevertheless, he says joining compatriot Mauricio Pochettino’s White Hart Lane revolution was a chance he couldn’t turn down. ‘I was there for eight years and I was an idol for the fans there,’ said Fazio. ‘I was only going to leave for a good option.

"The blood and gore of the Syrian war zone has not stopped one rebel’s striking, photogenic appearance becoming an online sensation. If anything, the nonchalant stride and sculpted physique of this Syrian freedom fighter seems even more astonishing considering the worsening conflict raging around him and across the country.

War zone: The photo, taken by Khalil Hamra near Idlib in Syria on June 15 has taken on new meaning with fan online focusing on the rebel's appearance rather than his surroundings . How does he do it?

"Rio Ferdinand faces an uncertain . future after Sir Alex Ferguson promised to take action against the . Manchester United defender for refusing to wear a Kick It Out . T-shirt. The . 33-year-old is known to be unhappy at a perceived lack of activity from . the anti-racism organisation, but his manager had promised that all his . players would wear the T-shirts before Saturday’s 4-2 win over Stoke City at . Old Trafford. ‘It’s . embarrassing for me,’ said irate Ferguson. ‘It had the support of the . PFA, and every player in the country should have adhered to that from . the PFA’s request. We’re all wearing the badges and he goes and he lets us down.’ The irate manager added: ‘We’ll deal with it, don’t worry.' In the red: Rio Ferdinand did not wear the Kick It Out t-shirt before Manchester United played Stoke . Ferdinand's boycott came in the wake of widespread player protests on Friday as many reacted to . the FA’s apparently lenient punishment of John Terry for his . abuse of his brother, Anton Ferdinand, last year. The defender was the . sole player in the Manchester United squad not to wear the T-shirt over . his tracksuit top as he warmed up alongside Wayne Rooney before their . home match with Stoke. Ferdinand, . who is out of contract at the end of this season, may now face . disciplinary action. He is not the first player to feel Ferguson’s wrath . during his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford. David . Beckham famously caught a boot in the face from the angry Scot after . United lost at home to Arsenal in the FA Cup and was sold to Real . Madrid four months later. Ruud van Nistelrooy was also shown the door after . he displeased Ferguson following a training ground row with Cristiano . Ronaldo. Irate: Alex Ferguson has said he will 'deal' with Ferdinand's defiance . And Roy . Keane’s days at Old Trafford came to an end in 2005 after the club had . to pull an interview with MUTV, in which he criticised United’s younger . players following a 4-1 thrashing at Middlesbrough. Ferdinand, . now in his 10th year at United, appeared to have mended his . relationship with Ferguson after the manager’s decision to hand the club . captaincy to Nemanja Vidic in 2010. The . 33-year-old is vitally important to Ferguson at the moment with Vidic . out of the team with an injury until the New Year and central defenders Chris Smalling and . Phil Jones slowly making their way back to fitness. Such . is his need for Ferdinand to remain fit that Ferguson urged the . defender to retire from international football in his programme notes on . Saturday to prolong his career at United. The controversial defender is also not the only one to have shunned the Kick It Out campaign. In an apparent act of solidarity, the entire Swansea and Wigan squads . also did not wear the t-shirts. But in direct contrast to Ferguson's views, Swansea manager Michael Laudrup said that wearing the T-shirt should . be an individual choice for players. ‘The issue isn’t a football one, it’s social,’ said . Laudrup. ‘You can’t tell players, “You have to do it”. ‘This is the opinion of the players . [not wearing the shirts]. You have to ask them, not me. There are things . you have to leave to each person.’ Manchester City’s England defender Joleon Lescott also refused to wear one. He has not worn . a Kick It Out T-shirt since 2007 after Newcastle’s Emre Belozoglu . escaped punishment at an FA inquiry for allegedly racially abusing . Everton’s Joseph Yobo during a game in December 2006. Lescott, an Everton player at the . time, provided written evidence but the charge against Turkey midfielder . Emre was not proven. Lescott was joined in his protest by clubmate . Micah Richards. We're in: Anderson and Wayne Rooney (right) wore the anti-racism t-shirts during the warm-up . Protest: Ferdinand had a regular Manchester United training top on before the Stoke match . Seeing red: Ferdinand's refusal to wear the t-shirt has angered manager Alex Ferguson . The decision of Stoke’s Trinidad . striker Kenwyne Jones to join the protest was supported by his manager . Tony Pulis, who said it was a tribute to Britain’s democracy that . players had the right to choose whether they wore the T-shirt. ‘People in this country have the . right to say Yes or No. In a lot of countries you haven’t the right. You . can do what you want here. You have the chance to stand up and say you . don’t want to do it. ‘This is a great country. It is multi-cultural. It is the best country in the world. They might have a gripe. ‘I’ve never — and no club I’ve . managed — have ever worried about anything like that. Black, white, . Catholic, Protestant, you treat people as human beings. There is good . and bad in religion and colour. You have to be straight down the middle . and treat everyone the same.’ Not on: Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott (centre) had no intention of wearing the t-shirt . Standing his ground: Jason Roberts did not wear the yellow t-shirt at Anfield . The disquiet over Kick It Out is set . to continue, with Everton players Victor Anichebe and Sylvain . Distin insisting they will refuse to wear the T-shirts at QPR. Their . stance may be backed by other team-mates. Anichebe, a devout Christian, said: . ‘Personally, I don’t think I will wear it. In fact, I know I won’t. I . don’t want to be some poster boy for kicking racism out of football . because I don’t even want to talk about situations that have happened. ‘Are we really kicking racism out? That’s the thing. I still believe in the same thing. Kick racism out of . everything, not just football. Kick it out of everything — society. We . are all fighting the same thing, whether you wear a T-shirt or not.’ Kick It Out chairman Lord Herman . Ouseley insisted it was ‘ridiculous’ for players not to wear T-shirts. ‘It’s ridiculous to say that by not wearing a T-shirt or by not . supporting Kick It Out you are actually going to change things,’ he . said.

Sportsmail can exclusively reveal that the top eight clubs from the U21 Premier League — including Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea — and eight including Celtic from other countries will make up the 16-team tournament.

Liverpool, who finished runners-up in last season’s Under 21 development league, have not taken up the opportunity, giving West Ham, who finished ninth, the chance to step in. The competition will run parallel to the revamped domestic Under 21 league. That now carries the added interest of promotion and relegation and will see both Sky Sports and BT Sport televise 10 matches live. The organisers are hopeful matches will attract good crowds and it is expected clubs will field their best young players just below first-team level. Schalke academy director Oliver Ruhnert helped produce four of Germany’s World Cup winning squad and is one of Europe’s most respected authorities on youth football. He jumped at the chance to enter his Under 21 side. ‘This is a fantastic new initiative and the Premier League have been very good in setting it up,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘You need to expose your players to different types of football and different countries in front of foreign crowds.’ Opportunity: It will provide a chance for England's best youngsters to test themselves in Europe . Triumph: Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker celebrates the winner in the final against Manchester United in May . Teams will be allowed to field three players over the age of 21. The format comprises four groups of four with the winners and runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals. All knockout games will be played over two legs and it is hoped the clubs’ main stadiums will be used for matches. The competition is designed to expose prospects to foreign opposition and take them away from the staid, behind-closed-doors environment of domestic youth football which has been criticised in recent years. There will, however, be no commercial opportunities during the inaugural season of the Premier League's new European cup and they are keen for it to be seen as a development opportunity; no prize money will be awarded to the winners, for example. Meanwhile, the name of the competition is yet to be decided, as is the venue for the final.","Premier League is set to unveil new European cup competition this season .

"It is a tragic postscript to her death, penned by a teenage Peaches Geldof frightened she would overdose on heroin just like her mother. Aged only 19, sitting in troubled singer Pete Doherty’s Camden  flat – a notorious drug den frequented by a string of celebrities – she wrote nine simple words: ‘I solemnly swear I am not going  to die.’ In the end, it was a promise she could never keep. Scroll down for videos . Peaches' haunting words have emerged in a newly published diary by notorious drug-taker Pete Doherty . Chillingly, the Kindle version includes a photograph of a page in his diary showing Peaches' name and mobile  phone number written in her own blood with a syringe . An inquest heard last week that 25-year-old Peaches died of a drugs overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother, Paula Yates. Worse still, her 11-month-old son was said to have been alone with her body for up to 17 hours. As many as 80 syringes, stashes of heroin and burned spoons were found in the young mother’s £1 million country home in Kent, the inquest heard. Peaches’ haunting words have emerged in a newly published diary by notorious drug-taker Doherty.  The book, From Albion To Shangri-la, charts the musician’s life from 2008 to 2013, and includes more than 200 pages of his drug-induced writings. Chillingly, the Kindle version includes a photograph of a page in his diary showing Peaches’ name and mobile  phone number written in her own blood with a syringe. Publishers were unable to confirm whether it was written by Doherty or Peaches herself, although the musician has previously exhibited paintings drawn in his own blood. The diary revelation offers a dark insight into Peaches’ life and her early spiralling drug addiction. The entry was penned in 2008, before she married and had children. Tragic: Peaches with her young sons Phaedra, left, and Astala . She was already publicly battling with addiction after reportedly overdosing on a night out. Above Peaches’ promise in the diary, Doherty wrote: ‘Conditions of doing as she would do with her “pleasuring” ting a ting a written oath not to die.’ According to publishers, this is apparently a coded reference to her fears about taking heroin. Nina Antonia, the author who edited the . book, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If you look at Peter’s reference to . Peaches – it is written in Peter  “speak” – “Conditions of doing as  she . would with her pleasuring ting a ting” translates to “if you are going . to continue using drugs please can  you make a promise to be careful?”. Hence her response, “I solemnly swear not to…” The book, From Albion To Shangri-la, charts the musician's life from 2008 to 2013, and includes more than 200 pages of his drug-induced writings . ‘In his own way, he is asking her to be cautious, but at the same time he couldn’t act like a drug counsellor or he would have been hypocritical. You can’t damn him for attempting to reach out to a friend.’ The diary is littered with references to other celebrity friends, including Liam Gallagher’s ex-girlfriend – and the mother of Doherty’s own son – Lisa Moorish, and has an entry written by the late singer Amy Winehouse. ‘Peter is in the habit of leaving his journals open for friends and visitors to add their own entries,’ said Nina. The publishers, Thin Man Press, rejected suggestions that by including the picture of Peaches’ blood-scrawled name and number, and her promise not to die, it was glamorising drug-taking. Susan de Muth, managing editor of the publishing house, said: ‘It does the opposite. Nina Antonia worked part-time in the substance misuse field for almost a decade so she understands the turbulent journey from addiction to recovery. ‘Some make it, some don’t, others struggle for years before finally breaking free. Peter has been very brave in writing about the toll that drugs have taken on him.’ Nina added: ‘I’m not in a position to speak for Peter, only about the work that I edited. But I do know Peter was both shocked and saddened by Peaches’ death and the terrible correlation and synchronicity of events. ‘Addiction is one long, drawn out scream for help. ‘The addict can be given all the love in the world if they are fortunate, but until they are able to come to terms with their own inner pain, they will continue to self-medicate.’ When asked if Peaches’ words should have been removed to avoid offence to the Geldof family, her husband and children, Nina replied: ‘Who am I to censor Peter’s work? That would be creative vandalism.’ When The Mail on Sunday contacted Doherty’s agent about Peaches’ diary entry, he refused to comment, other than to say ‘it was a very small part of a very big book’. Family tragedy: Peaches posted this photograph of her and her mother Paula Yates hours before her death . Peaches was found dead in her home in April by her  23-year-old husband, musician  Thomas Cohen. Returning from a weekend away, he found her slumped on a bed, her lifeless body covered in needle marks. The couple’s son, Phaedra, who she had been looking after, was also in the house. Next to the mother-of-two’s body was a sweet box containing a used syringe, with a pair of knotted tights, apparently used as a tourniquet, the inquest heard. Mr Cohen told the hearing that  the young mother, who had been battling to stay clean from drugs, had relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. After his daughter's death, Peaches' father, musician and anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof, released a statement saying the family was 'beyond pain'. Peaches is pictured in 2012 . Supplies found in the house by police were 61 per cent pure, more than twice the level of purity of commonly traded street heroin. Tragically, just a few hours before her death, Peaches had posted a  picture of herself and her mother  on Instagram, with the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ The TV presenter died of a heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. After his daughter’s death, Peaches’ father, musician and anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof, released a statement saying the family was ‘beyond pain’. ‘She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us,’ it read. ‘How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable? ‘We loved her and will cherish her forever. How sad that sentence is.’ Peaches’ entry in Doherty’s new diaries comes as the rock star father-of-two forges a new life for himself in Paris. Earlier this month the singer visited London to take part in a book-signing. On a Facebook page set up to promote the book, fans’ praise comes from as far away as Australia and Brazil. He has also recently reformed with his old band, The Libertines, playing in front of a sell-out 60,000 crowd at London’s Hyde Park  earlier this month. In September, the band will  start its first tour of mainland Europe since 2004, playing dates in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin and Dusseldorf. As Doherty rebuilds his life after years of drug abuse and a very  public on-off romance with model Kate Moss, Peaches’ family is left  still coming to terms with her sudden death. Seeing her poignant words published in Doherty’s book will surely bring those emotions flooding back.

"The world's tallest Ferris wheel is under construction in Las Vegas which will tower more than 100 feet over the London Eye. The High Roller is expected to be open to thrill-seekers with a head for heights next year and it is already beginning to take shape. Towering high over many of the big hotel complexes around it, the wheel, when completed will stand at 550 feet. The London Eye, which commands spectacular views over the English capital, is 443 feet tall. World record: The Las Vegas High Roller will be the tallest Ferris wheel in the world when it opens next year . Currently Singapore's Flyer holds the record for the highest Ferris wheel, but when it opens, High Roller will stand 9 feet taller, according to the Las Vegas Times. Similar to London Eye, the High roller will have numerous cabins from which visitors can slowly watch the city unfold beneath them during a 30minute ride, making one revolution. Each pod will be able to hold up to 40 guests, the news service said and tickets are expected to be around $30 to $35 - comparable to London's ride which charges around £19 for adults and £10 for children. Towering: The vast structure is already taking place and towers over nearby hotel and casino complexes . Opening: The giant Ferris wheel is not scheduled to be operating until early 2014, after safety checks have been completed . The enormous wheel forms part of a new development in the Sin City, known as the Linq. Planned to be opened in time for Christmas, an old-fashioned looking pedestrianised zone will run between the Quad and Flamingo resorts and will feature an outpost of Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Construction: When completed, the High Roller will tower 107 feet taller than the London Eye which stands at 443 Feet . The enormous wheel forms part of a new development in the Sin City, known as the Linq . Parts of the retail and entertainment complex will be open in time for the busy winter shopping season, as per the plans.

"A Lake Tahoe resort once owned by Frank Sinatra and frequented by his Rat Pack buddies is about to undergo a major makeover. The Cal Neva hotel-casino that straddles the California-Nevada line will close for more than a year beginning Monday to allow for the multimillion-dollar project. The 219-room, 10-story hotel and 6,000-square-foot casino will be upgraded in an effort to revive the struggling property, said Robert Radovan, co-owner of Criswell-Radovan. His Napa Valley, Calif.-based development company acquired the Cal Neva in April. Scroll down for video... Infamous: The Cal Neva Resort in Crystal Bay, Nevada was once owned by Frank Sinatra and new owners hope to restore it for its former glory . ‘Our goal is to bring it back to its former glory and to make it what it was like in Sinatra's day,’ Radovan told The Associated Press. ‘It has such great soul and character, and it's needed this redo for many decades.’ The property has fallen on hard times because of the double-whammy of the recession and competition from Las Vegas and Indian casinos. Its casino was forced to shut down in 2010 due to declining business. During its heyday from 1960 to 1963, the Cal Neva was owned by Sinatra and became one of the most famous resorts in the country. It drew fellow Rat Packers Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford, and stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio and Juliet Prowse. Monroe spent her final weekend at the Cal Neva before she died of a drug overdose in Los Angeles in August 1962. Five small cabins, including the one where she stayed that year, also will be renovated, Radovan said. The other cabins were used by Sinatra and friends. The way it was: The Cal Nev is one of Nevada's oldest casinos and saw its heyday from 1960 to 1963 when it was owned by Sinatra and hosted luminaries like Marylin Monroe, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and Joe DiMaggio . Last days: In this 1959 photo, Monroe and Sinatra chat with an unnamed man at the Cal Neva lodge. Monroe would go on to spend her last weekend at Cal Neva before dying of an overdose in 1962 . Historic: A 1937 brochure for the once exclusive lodge, which first opened that year after being rebuilt atop the previous lodge that was claimed by fire . Sinatra himself renovated the Cal Neva, adding the celebrity showroom and a helicopter pad on the roof. He used tunnels to shuffle mobsters and celebrities beneath the resort so they wouldn't be seen by the general public. The tunnels were built in the late 1920s so liquor could be smuggled in during Prohibition. The showroom will be improved with modernized equipment, painting and new carpets, Radovan said, and the tunnels will be preserved. Public tours of the cabins and tunnels will resume after the project is completed. Bigger plans are in store for the showroom. ‘The acoustics in that place are amazing. The modernized equipment will allow for high-end concerts,’ Radovan said, adding the room where Sinatra, Martin and Davis once performed will continue to be named after Sinatra. Owners hope to make the hotel a 4-plus-star resort instead of a 1-star by upgrading rooms with modern amenities, larger bathrooms and bigger windows offering Lake Tahoe views, he said. Plans call for the redesigned casino to reopen with blackjack and other table games. Radovan declined to provide a cost estimate for the project, but acknowledged it'll cost a ‘pretty penny.’ ‘There will be an elegant, clean, post-modern feel to it after we're done,’ he said. ‘You don't want to lose the history of the Frank Sinatra era and eras before it. But you have to ... bring it back to where it's a modernized version of what it was in the heyday.’ Owners hope to reopen the Cal Neva on Dec. 12, 2014, which would have been Sinatra's 99th birthday. He died in 1999. Sinatra's gambling license was stripped in 1963 by Nevada gambling regulators after Chicago mobster Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises. The Cal Neva is one of Nevada's first legal casinos. The present resort was built in 1937, when a fire destroyed the original lodge that had opened in 1926. Struggling: The 219-room, 10-story hotel and 6,000-square-foot casino will be upgraded in an effort to revive the struggling property that once hosted Hollywood's biggest stars .","The Cal Neva resort at Lake Tahoe is one of Nevada's first casinos .

"A new website has been launched to allow university students to meet for casual sex and its designer claims it is being dominated by female Oxford students. Tom Thurlow's 'shagatuni.com' encourages members to send each other saucy messages and meet up for no-strings-attached liaisons. It allows users to post a Facebook-style profile which explicitly advertises what they are looking for in a sexual partner. Website: 'Shag at Uni' has been set up by internet entrepreneur Tom Thurlow who says hundreds of women from Oxford University have joined . Mr Thurlow, who became well known after setting up a successful second-hand book business at 13, now claims the biggest uptake so far appears to have been from young women studying at Oxford University. He says statistics show a whopping 722 woman from Oxford signed up since the site launched in October. But Oxford’s biter rivals Cambridge University prove to be the most prudish - with the lowest amount of members in the whole country. 'The site is aimed at 18-30s university students, college students and people who may be friends of students. We have seen a real boost from the Oxford students,' he said. 'I am not surprised. When I tour the country filming MTV Freshers the Oxford students are always the most wild. 'They are always uptight in the day but by night they were always the craziest. It doesn’t surprise me they have the highest proportion of women looking for sex.' The seedy site advertises itself as a space for students to have sex without 'the strings attached with dating'. Design: Users like these ones post a profile, similar to Facebook, which explicitly advertises what they are looking for in a no-strings-attached partner . It boasts 26,933 members with 18,400 men and 8,533 women signing up for membership since it went live two months ago. Sex-crazed students aged 18-30 can create revealing profiles supplying potential suitors with descriptions of themselves and their sexual preferences. Some of the academic members even include naked self portraits and explicit details of where and how they like to have sex. One of Oxford’s academic elite described as 'voluptuous Sandra', 19, describes her interests as role playing, home-made adult movies and goes into detail about her favourite sex acts. Anyone can join the site and users do not need a university email address or tie to a university institution to enter the site. Entrepreneur: Tom Thurlow who previously hit the headlines with his second hand book business at aged 13 . Mr Thurlow, who has never studied at University, said: 'At uni it is all night parties, partying on a Monday, Wednesday never mind the weekends. 'People don’t go to university anymore to learn, they just want to have a good time - and part of that is having lots of sex. 'I think the reason the site is so popular is that students don’t want commitment and they just want a casual lifestyle. 'The site is what it is, people hunting for sex and they can approach it however they want through the site. 'We offer all our members advice for meet-ups expressing how important it is to do the meet and greet in a public place. 'It is important that our online members are safe.' Membership is a one off £5 for men and free for women giving users the chance to message each other, “wink” at each other and arrange to meet. The National Union of Students said today that people should consider their sexual health if getting involved. #University students sexual practice is entirely a personal choice. The main consideration for the NUS is of course ""safety first"" and safe sex information is available from most Students Unions,' a spokesman said.","Shagatuni.com already has more than 700 female members from Oxford but in contrast rival Cambridge has the fewest .

"Internet celebrity Curtis Lepore, best known from the video-sharing site Vine, has been charged with raping his former girlfriend and fellow online star Jessi Smiles while she was sleeping. TMZ reported Thursday that Lepore was arrested in October and released on $100,000 bail. On Tuesday, the rape suspect entered a not guilty plea in a Los Angeles court. The celebrity gossip site reported that the alleged sexual assault took place in late August while Smiles, of Florida, was visiting her then-boyfriend Lepore in Los Angeles. Scroll down for videos . Bad romance: Vine star Curtis Lepore (left) was arrested last October and charged with raping his former girlfriend and fellow online celebrity Jessi Smiles (right) over the summer . Love gone awry: TMZ reported that the incident happened while Smiles was visiting Lepore in Los Angeles just a few weeks into their relationship . During her stay, the couple who had met on Vine just weeks earlier called it quits, TMZ said. Smiles spent a few more days in L.A. filming a video for the popular social media forum, but suffered a concussion during shooting. Sources told the site that Lepore allegedly offered his former paramour his help while she was recovering from her injury. According to the alleged victim, one day Curtis came over to visit her while she was sleeping, and that is when he allegedly raped her. MailOnline does not usually name victims of sexual abuse, but Smiles, whose real name is Jessica Vazquez, gave TMZ the go-ahead to publicly identify her. Both Lepore and Smiles have addressed the incident on their respective Twitter and Vine accounts. Serious allegations: According to reports, Smiles was recovering from a concussion when Lepore came over and allegedly raped her as she slept . Rise to stardom: Lepore became web celebrity by creating hundreds of quirky and silly 6-second videos and uploading them on Vine . The day after the alleged incident, the blonde beauty wrote to her followers: ’be careful of who you trust. Always be cautious for your safety. Be strong and don't let your guard down...’ On Thursday, Lepore offered a response to TMZ’s report about the rape allegations, tweeting: 'There are 2 sides to every story. When the time is right I'll have something to say. For now, don't rush to judge.' He further expanded on the subject in a 6-second Vine video, telling his fans: ‘Things aren’t always what they seem. I am not allowed to talk about what’s going on right now. In the meantime, don’t rush to judge. There are two sides to every story. When the time is right, I will have something to say.’ Lepore, a native a Syracuse, New York, who had previously sang in the hard-core band GHOSTxSHIP, rose to Internet stardom by creating hundreds of quirky and silly 6-second videos and uploading them on Vine, Syracuse.com reported. The content-sharing mobile app owned by Twitter was first introduced a year ago, drawing millions of members worldwide. Response: Lepore released a video statement on his Vine page, reminding the public that each story has two sides and asking people to avoid rushing to judgment . Lepore has emerged as one of the biggest stars on the increasingly popular site, boasting 3.4million followers. Smiles has made a name for herself on the social media platform by posting short clips showing her dancing, playing guitar or performing brief self-deprecating skits. She has 2.7million followers. The two did not know each other before joining Vine. Smiles and Lepore exchanged flirtatious videos last summer before deciding to meet in person in New York City in early August 2013. The emerging web stars turned their first face-to-face date into a Vine meetup, inviting other users to join them in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park. Music man: Lepore was previously a vocalist in a Central New York band before his rise to Vine stardom . Love at first click: Lepore and Smiles first met on Vine last summer, exchanging flirtatious 6-second videos . Sealed with a kiss: The couple met for the first time in New York City in early August, exchanging their first kiss in front of hundreds of cheering Vine users who came out to witness their encounter . Celebrity breakup: The young couple called it quits just weeks after their romantic first date, leaving their fans baffled and disappointed . A video from the event shows the happy couple exchanging a passionate first kiss in front of hundreds of ecstatic fans to mark the start of their romance. But the relationship was not to last. Just weeks after the romantic encounter in the sun-drenched Manhattan park, Vine’s first celebrity couple abruptly split up, leaving their followers to wonder what had gone wrong. Hollywood Life reported that between late October and early November, the typically bubbly Miss Smiles sent out a series of unusually dark and unsettling tweets. One of the messages read: 'I don't feel like living on this planet today. Goodbye.'","TMZ reported Curtis Lepore was arrested in October for allegedly raping fellow Vine star Jessi Smiles in late August in Los Angeles .

"Malaysia has banned an Ultraman comic book because it uses the word 'Allah' to describe the Japanese action hero. The Home Ministry said in a statement today that the Malay-edition of 'Ultraman: The Ultra Power' contained elements that can undermine public security and societal morals. It said 'Ultraman is idolized by many children' and equating the lead character, Ultraman King, with Allah would especially 'confuse Muslim children and damage their faith.' God of heroes: Ultraman is a fictional Japanese superhero who fights monsters and first appeared on television in the 1960s. A line in the book said Ultraman 'is considered and respected as Allah, or the Elder, to all ultra heroes' Allah, the Arabic word for God, is commonly used in the Malay language to refer to God. The government says Allah should be exclusively reserved for Muslims because of concerns its use by others would confuse Muslims and tempt them to convert. Malay Muslims account for about 60 percent of Malaysia's 30 million people, while Christians makeup about 9 percent of the country's population. The ministry said Allah is holy for Muslims and warned that such irresponsible use of the word can provoke the community and threaten public safety. Diverse: Malay Muslims account for about 60 per cent of Malaysia's 30 million people, while Christians makeup about 9 per cent of the country's population. (pictured: Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur) Ultraman is a fictional Japanese superhero who fights monsters and first appeared on television in the 1960s. A line in the book said Ultraman 'is considered and respected as Allah, or the Elder, to all ultra heroes.' 'The Ultraman character itself is not banned and only this edition is prohibited,' the ministry said. Anyone caught distributing the book could be jailed three years, it warned. The government's stand over the word Allah has sparked a controversy in this multi-racial Southeast Asian country, where many Malay-speaking Christians commonly use Allah to refer to God. Religious tensions have been high in the past five years after the Catholic church went to court to seek the right to use Allah in its weekly newspaper. A lower court last year ruled in favor of the government, which the Catholic church has appealed to the country's highest court. The Federal Court said Wednesday it will decide at a later date whether to hear the case.","Created in 60s, Ultraman is a Japanese superhero who fights monsters .

"It was the single most deadly day on the world's highest peak - 16 Sherpa guides were killed on Mount Everest when an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall on April 18. On that morning, just before 7am, mountaineer Joby Ogwyn was lying his tent 17,598 ft up the iconic peak at Base Camp when the unnerving, but a familiar sound of 'creaking and groaning' caused him to stick his head out and what he saw will haunt him forever. 'Within a couple of seconds it looked like this big white dragon, thunderously loud, moving at probably 200 miles an hour, straight toward our Sherpa, who were carrying some of our equipment up to a higher camp.' Scroll down for videos . Power: The aftermath of the avalanche that came down Mount Everest on April 18 that claimed the lives of 16 Sherpas . Deadly: The avalanche struck at the Khumbu Icefall, a treacherous passage between Base Camp and Camp 1 riddled with crevasses and columns of ice known as seracs . Ogwyn, 39, who was preparing to climb Everest and then become the first man to leap off the 29,029-foot summit in a wing suit for the Discovery Channel, watched as blocks of ice the size of cars and houses crashed down the slopes. Out of the 16 Sherpa's who died that day, three were working for Ogwyn and instead of a triumphant piece of television, the Discovery Channel crew found themselves witness to a dramatic rescue and recovery mission in the moments that followed. Aired on Sunday night, the revised special, Everest Avalanche Tragedy, showed harrowing footage from the scene, including the heart-breaking moment rescuers discovered the leg of Sherpa, Dorjee Khatri, poking out the huge icy fall. 'I looked outside and saw the avalanche coming down,' Ogwyn recalled according to the LA Times. 'Everyone got wiped out that I could see.' Rush to help: Cameras from the Discovery production crew witness the frantic attempts to reach those affected by the avalanche . Ice blocks the size of houses: The avalanche's power is appreciated when the helpless mountaineers are seen in comparison with the displaced ice . Despite not being in the deadly path, Ogwyn knew then and there that his wing suit adventure would not happen. 'We were just doing all we could do to find our guys and get their dead bodies off the mountain,' he said. 'We were trying to reach our guys by radio, but we couldn't get anyone on the radio,' an emotional Ogwyn recalled to the LA Times. 'Within an hour we knew they were dead. They'd found some pieces of equipment that had literally gotten blown off the guys. Boots and backpacks.' At Base Camp, Ogwyn and the Discovery Channel production crew were around a half-mile from the avalanche and they instantly tried to contact his Sherpa guide team. When they received no response, they immediately feared the worst. Emotional: Joby Ogwyn watched the avalanche from his tent as it began to tumble down the slopes of Mount Everest on April 18 . Recovery: Joby Ogwyn said that it dawned on everyone very quickly that this would not be a rescue mission . The powerful and emotional Discovery special revealed the moment that one survivor was found buried waist deep, battered and bloody from ice as heavy as blocks of concrete. Others were simply entombed in the ice. 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' Ogwyn said to zap2it.com. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Ogwyn rushed towards the disaster zone and because of his peak physical fitness was able to make the climb in only one hour - for others it would have taken much longer. 'I knew this was going to be bad,' he said, admitting he knew this was a recovery mission, not a rescue. In tears during the Discovery special, Ogwyn explained how he saw a helicopter airlift the tragic dead away from the scene wrapped in sleeping bags or tents. Harrowing: The leg of Dorjee Khatri is visible in this tragic grab from Discovery's Everest Avalanche Tragedy which aired on Sunday evening . So sad: Bodies were airlifted away from the disaster zone wrapped in sleeping bags or tents . 'I sat there and watched the whole thing,' he said to Zap2It.com. 'They found body after body.' There were three Sherpas working for Ogwyn Discovery and Peacock Productions - Dorjee Khatri, Dorjee Sherpa and Phur Temba Sherpa —  but the mountaineer knew all 16. Respecting their reputation as the world's greatest climbers, Ogwyn specially requested those three to help carry the heavy filming equipment. 'I knew they would appreciate what I was trying to do,' he said. During his two decades climbing the world's tallest peaks, Ogwyn had witnessed many avalanches, but nothing like this. On Everest, everything is bigger and when a glacier breaks, 'it buries people like concrete buries the,.' 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' said Ogwyn. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Confirmation: The documentary from Discovery showed how the disaster unfolded in real time and how the production team who were there for a wing suit record attempt quickly found themselves organizing a recovery mission . During the course of the Discovery special, the build up to the moment of the avalanche was replayed, including interviews with Ogwyn, expedition leader Garrett Madison and additional members of the expedition and production teams. 'It's heartbreaking,' said a still-shaken Ogwyn. 'I've been climbing in the Himalayas for the past 15 years and forged a friendship with a lot of these guys. I'm shell-shocked by this. Everyone is.' The network also announced they are to donate to the American Himalayan Foundation Sherpa Family Fund, which helps the families of the deceased. Ogwyn is still reeling from the accident and told Reuters that the, 'Hardest job in the world to go rescue your dead buddies off that mountain and that’s exactly what everybody came together to do that that day. Highest peak on Earth: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable . Khumbu Icefall: More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Everest's summit since it was first climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. The route they took along the South Col was the one hit by the avalanche . Star of the show: The Discovery Channel live jump was going to be done by Joby Ogwyn, an experienced wingsuiter, and the special was announced in February . 'So it’s a really powerful story and it needs to be told. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to watch it. My heart’s broken and I’ll never, ever get over it.' However, while his attempt to jump off Everest in his specially designed wing suit has been postponed, he is now focusing on helping the families of the dead Sherpas. 'I think what people don't realize is how much the Sherpas enjoy their jobs,' he said. 'They are far from slaves.' 'My goal went from climbing and jumping off the mountain to raising money for the families,' Ogwyn said. He wants those willing to donate money to visit The Sherpa Family Fund, where 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the victims families. 'We were at Mt. Everest to make history, but instead we were there as eyewitnesses to history,' said Eileen O'Neill, Group President, Discovery, Science and Velocity Networks. Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . No hope of survival: Rescuers on Mount Everest found the body of a 13th Nepalese guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak . Indeed, in the aftermath of the disaster, the Sherpas have refused to climb, citing poor conditions and a lack of respect from the Nepal Government, who make millions each year from climbing permits. Conversely, when a Sherpa dies their family receives $400. 'I think it's their right to,' said Ogwyn of the Sherpas' strike. 'It's very fresh in their minds... But life goes on. It's going to be pretty hard for a lot of guys to make a living if they don't want to work, including myself. 'I don't want to find something else to do and I think a lot of Sherpas in that region take a lot of pride in what they do. 'Everybody, Western people and Sherpa, needed to take some time to let this sink in and go away a little bit before we start planning the next season on Everest.' Nepalese mountain rescue workers lifting an injured climber after an avalanche came down on Mt. Everest. Authorities called off the rescue operation for survivors after 13 Nepali climbing guides were killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest, as bad weather closed in . Final resting place: Group of family members of the  Nepalese mountaineer carry the body of Ang Kaji Sherpa, who died on Mt. Everest Avalanche upon its arrival   at Sherpa Monastry in Kathmandu . On Wednesday, family members, mountaineers and government officials gathered in Nepal's capital Wednesday for a memorial service for the 16 Nepalese Sherpa guides killed in avalanche on Mount Everest. They offered flower garlands and lit candles and incense in front of the photographs of the 16 Sherpa guides who died in the April 18 avalanche. The 13th day after death is the customary end of mourning and the day when Nepalis generally hold memorials. 'We are still disappointed at the government, which has done little for the family members. The help they have given is a joke, like giving money to a beggar. The state should take care of the families of the dead,' said Pasang Doma, who lost her brother in the avalanche. While 13 bodies have been recovered, the three others are buried under heavy snow and ice. Most of the expedition teams have left the mountain while the rest are packing their bags and gear in the base camp. The avalanche was the deadliest disaster on the world's highest mountain. It was triggered when a massive piece of glacier sheared away from the mountain along a treacherous section of constantly shifting ice and crevasses known as the Khumbu Icefall, marked by overhanging ice as big as office buildings.","On April 18, Mount Everest witnessed its single most deadly day when 16 Sherpas died in a huge avalanche .

"Jenson Button has revealed he held an 'interesting and encouraging' conversation with Ron Dennis about the future direction of McLaren at the weekend. Button's personal future has been in the spotlight of late as McLaren Group chairman and CEO Dennis has yet to make a decision with regard to a driver line-up for next year. McLaren have been linked with moves to Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, whilst Dennis even suggested over the weekend he was keeping a close eye on the situation at Mercedes and the battle between Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. Meeting: Jenson Button, pictured with Ron Dennis in 2011, held positive discussions with the McLaren chief . Positive talks: Button is happy to have discussed his future with McLaren chief Dennis . With Button out of contract at the end of this year, it means the 34-year-old is in limbo, although Dennis has promised a decision will be made by the final grand prix in Abu Dhabi in late November. Promisingly for Button, he has confirmed he 'spent a lot of time with Ron' over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend. Button said: 'Forgetting the driver situation with Kevin (Magnussen) and myself, it was good to talk about the future of the team, the direction it is going and how it is performing. 'It was all interesting and encouraging, which comes on the back of the last couple of races in particular which have been good in terms of atmosphere within the team. 'That's not just with Ron and the drivers, but the rest of the management and the direction the team is going and the improvements being made. There's a nice feel about the place at the moment. 'Last year was tough, the start of this year was tough, but now there is more direction in terms of understanding the future of the team. 'That's in terms of the people within it, the design of the car, who is in charge, so for me and everyone within the team, it gives us a lot more confidence in the future here.' With Dennis opening up to Button in such a way, it would appear to point to the veteran being retained. Fully committed: Button is happy to stay at McLaren as he is enjoying his time with Dennis' team . Dennis did make clear at the weekend he did not know yet who would be in the car in 2015, so for now Button is just sitting tight and driving his heart out. 'I am not scared and I have no fears of not being on the grid next year,' added Button. 'But I want to drive, this is what I love, especially these last few races because even though they have not been the results I wanted, I have loved giving it my all. 'I am here enjoying myself, trying to get the best out of myself and the car, and I feel I have done a good job, so I am happy with that.

"Nico Rosberg has claimed that he drove off the track to avoid sustaining tyre damage in Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix amid conspiracy theorists believing the race was fixed by Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton claimed his first win since July to narrow the gap to Rosberg in this most intense of title battles. But his cause was aided when his team-mate Rosberg missed the chicane at Turn One  which allowed Hamilton to pass. It was claimed by fans on social media that the German, who had made a similar error earlier in the race, performed the faux pas on purpose to compensate for his collision with Hamilton at the previous race in Belgium.

Straight on: Rosberg's error on lap 29 allowed team-mate Hamilton to cruise to victory in Monza . Sir Jackie Stewart, a three-time world champion, and whose number of 27 race wins Hamilton surpassed with his Monza triumph, joined the sport’s fans in questioning Rosberg’s ‘gaffe’. He said: ‘I thought, “hello, what’s going on here?”’ He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’ But speaking from Ibiza in the video blog after Sunday’s race, Rosberg, 22 points ahead of Hamilton in the championship, claimed he ran off the circuit under pressure from his team-mate. ‘I just messed up,’ said Rosberg. ‘Lewis was quick and I had to step up my game a little bit and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and I messed up. ‘I could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock up, so the safer way, and the best way, and the only way was to go straight on so at least I would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres.’ Key moment: Rosberg took to the escape road allowing Hamilton to pass his Mercedes team-mate . Rivals: Hamilton narrowed the gap to Rosberg with six races of the season remaining . Off road: The German driver was fined a six-figure sum after his crash with Hamilton in Belgium . Mercedes dismissed the notion that they had asked Rosberg to move aside for Hamilton as punishment for the German's collision with his rival in Spa. Indeed  they posted a satirical tweet accompanied with a picture of flying pigs (below) on Monday morning. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, who was seen smiling in the immediate aftermath of the incident on lap 29, laughed off claims Rosberg was under orders to throw the race in Monza. 'Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea,’ he said. 'The race at Monza was unlike many others I've seen with Nico because he rarely makes mistakes, but he made two in the same place,' said Wolff. 'There was lots of pressure on Nico because Lewis was so quick in qualifying, and you could see that again in the race. 'Mentally he is very strong, and if you want to be a world champion you have to go through lows and highs, and he's had many of them. 'We saw after what happened at Silverstone (retirement with a gearbox problem) he came back, so I guess he has the mental strength to recover from what happened in Italy.'

"Lewis Hamilton is hoping his Italian Grand Prix victory has provided him with a launchpad to again reel in Nico Rosberg - but is wary of Mercedes’ technical gremlins returning to haunt him. Hamilton put behind him the furore of his feud with Rosberg two weeks previously in Belgium to take a much-needed chequered flag at Monza on Sunday. With six races remaining and 175 points up for grabs, Hamilton now trails Rosberg by 22 points, which may appear a slender margin but he knows there can be no room for error or further issues. Already this season Hamilton has suffered from a cylinder failure in the opening race in Australia, brake failures in Canada and Germany and a fuel leak that caused a fire in Hungary.

Champagne showers: Hamilton has to make up 22 points in six races - so more of this wouldn't go amiss . Even in Italy it was not plain sailing as he sat out most of second practice with an electrical issue, and then off the line his launch was hampered by another technical problem, whilst Rosberg has had gearbox issues at Silverstone and in final practice on Saturday. 'I’d like to think this win is a platform, but I have no idea what’s going to happen forwards from here,' said Hamilton. 'Over the weekend I had quite a few problems, missed almost a whole session in P2, then in qualifying in Q2 the car wouldn’t start again, but fortunately it did. 'As for the start sequence (at the beginning of the race), it could have been a lot worse. That was the best it could ever be considering I didn’t have the launch.' Dark side: But Hamilton has had a number of technical problems this season and fears they will continue . Rare smile: After his feud with Rosberg Hamilton would have been delighted to see of his team-mate at Monza . VIDEO Hamilton returns to winning ways . Asked as to whether the power balance had again shifted in the wake of his win, Hamilton replied: 'Potentially, maybe. Time will tell. 'But these problems just keep popping up. Paddy (Lowe, executive technical director) said ""It’s just so unlucky, with all the engines it just keeps happening to yours"". 'Hopefully we’ll rectify them. Right now, I’m just looking forward, head down, and I see no reason why I can’t be as fast moving forwards.' Rosberg’s double mistake into the first chicane, the second of which came when he was being pressured by Hamilton and cost him the win, seemed to suggest he could be starting to crack under the strain of the title fight. Unlucky: Paddy Lowe told Hamilton that his engine is picking up more problems than any other . Moving forwards: Hamilton sees no reason why he cannot keep up the speed that brought victory in Italy . It has offered up further hope to Hamilton, although Rosberg is still in pole position given he has a lead to defend. 'You can be relaxed when you’ve a cushion like that,' added Hamilton. 'He’s still got 20-odd points hasn’t he? Jeez, if I had that and even if things didn’t go well, that’s all right. That’s probably where he is (in his head). 'Of course, it’s not easy for anyone to be under pressure, and especially when I’m pressuring someone. Speedster: Hamilton wants to put pressure on Rosberg - and did his words constitute mind games?

'Even for me, it’s hard when you have Fernando (Alonso) pressuring you, or (Sebastian) Vettel. That’s just the way it is.

"Patients are being put in danger because of a desperate shortage of senior doctors, a report warns today. It reveals that the hospitals with the highest death rates are located in areas of the country with the fewest consultants. Concerns have previously been raised that there are too few consultants working at nights and weekends with critically ill patients left in the hands of junior doctors. High risk: Medway Hospital  in Kent, one of the 12 NHS trusts with the highest death rates in the UK, has one senior consultant per 8,000 patients . Now doctors have admitted their own care is ‘unsafe’ because in some cases, a single doctor is being forced to look after 30 seriously ill patients at a time. The state of hospital care has been under scrutiny since a report last month into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly, warned that it could be happening elsewhere. There has been growing concern that patients are dying needlessly in other hospitals due to neglect and poor treatment. The Royal College of Physicians today warns that doctors may not realise patients are becoming critically ill because they don’t get round to checking up on them. One unnamed doctor told the college: ‘I had 30 patients to review. It was a ridiculous number. I was unsafe… I can put my hands up. ‘I think that’s because of the work. I think medicine is unsafe at the moment.’ Tragic scandal: A tribute wall made by family members and loved ones in memory of some of the 1,200 patients who may have died needlessly at Stafford Hospital . Care scrutiny: The scandal at the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust has led to inquiries into further trusts in the UK . In its report, the college says the 12 NHS trusts with the highest death rates are all in areas with the lowest numbers of consultants. They include Medway in Kent, University Hospitals Birmingham and Walsall Hospitals, which each have an average of one consultant for 8,000 people. But those trusts with the lowest rates – such as Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and Imperial College Healthcare, both in London – have one consultant for 5,000 people. Under fire: NHS chief Sir David Nicholson will be questioned by MPs tomorrow . The report warns that the numbers of . senior doctors – consultants and registrars – has not kept pace with the . surge in patients coming to hospital, many of whom are elderly. It also points out that there are more women doctors on wards who will only work part-time when they start a family. Over the last six years the proportion of consultants working part-time has increased from 12 per cent to 18 per cent. The report says this is due to the increase in women doctors – a third work part-time compared with 6 per cent of men. Dr Andrew Goddard, a consultant at the Royal Derby Hospital and director of the college’s medical workforce unit, said: ‘Having 30 patients to review in one night is a huge workload. You’re having to make decisions about very sick people. You wouldn’t want to be number 29 on that list. ‘The danger is that if you are low down on that list of jobs and you then become unwell quickly, that isn’t picked up. ‘Patient safety is potentially at risk. There’s a clear association between hospital mortality and the number of senior doctors that are around.’ Since the report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, the head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson has faced continued calls to resign. Tomorrow he will come under further pressure when he is grilled by MPs.","The 12 NHS trusts with highest death rates have least consultants .

"After a successful race weekend in Italy Lewis Hamilton is looking to have a big week in the gym as he prepares for the World Championship run-in. With six races to go Hamilton trails his teammate Nico Rosberg by 22 points in the drivers standings, having narrowed the gap with a win in Monza on Sunday.

"Twitter, inevitably, fired the conspiracy that the Italian Grand Prix was fixed for Lewis Hamilton to win. So it was there that Mercedes scotched the idea. They posted: ‘BREAKING NEWS: Dramatic news in the skies over Brackley as #NR6 hands #Italian GP victory to #F1 WDC rival #LH44.’ They illustrated the tweet with a picture of three pigs flying above rural Northamptonshire. It was a neat satirical touch and supported the prevailing view of paddock observers that Rosberg merely made a mistake at the first chicane, ran off the track and unwittingly allowed team-mate Hamilton to take the lead. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg: I simply messed up at Monza . Off track: Nico Rosberg took to the escape road at Turn One under pressure from team-mate Lewis Hamilton . Straight on: Rosberg's error on lap 29 allowed team-mate Hamilton to cruise to victory in Monza . Charlie Whiting, the highly respected race director, has seen every bit of pit-lane chicanery during more than 40 years in the sport, but he almost choked on his orange juice in the airport lounge as he caught up with the media coverage before flying back from Monza. A conspiracy? ‘Spare me!’ he said. ‘No, we didn’t give the conspiracy theory a moment’s thought at the time. This sort of speculation might be good for people to talk about, but if Mercedes had wanted to fix the result they wouldn’t have done it like that. They would have found a more subtle way to do it. ‘A few drivers had problems there in practice, including Nico. I really don’t think there is anything in it.’ The most obvious argument against the theory is that Rosberg would surely never have followed any instruction to let Hamilton pass. He is hell-bent on winning the world title in what he perceives as his career-defining season. Had Mercedes ordered him to give way to make up for his part in the infamous crash with Hamilton in Spa, it is unimaginable that he would have done anything other than flatly refuse to do so. Speaking from Ibiza in his post-race blog, Rosberg, who leads Hamilton by 22 points at the top of the championship, said: ‘Lewis was quick and I had to step up my game and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and I messed up. ‘I could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock-up, so the safer way, and the best way, and the only way was to go straight on. At least I would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres.’ Monza marked the traditional end of the European season, though the Russian Grand Prix makes its debut in Sochi next month. With six races remaining, Hamilton is exuding a more positive mental state. Can the momentum keep swinging his way after Rosberg’s purple patch? ‘Monza was a big positive and a step up the massive staircase I have to face,’ said Hamilton. ‘Time will tell how the psychological battle will go.’ Key moment: Rosberg took to the escape road allowing Hamilton to pass his Mercedes team-mate .

"New Inter Milan striker Dani Osvaldo is looking to prove himself again after a difficult season, which culminated in the Italy international missing out on the World Cup. Osvaldo was presented at Inter on Thursday, a day after signing on loan from Southampton in a deal which saw Algeria midfielder Saphir Taider move the other way. 'It's an honor to be at a club like Inter,' Osvaldo said. 'I'm very happy and I can't wait for the season to start. When a club like Inter calls, I don't think any player has any doubt whatsoever. New boy: Dani Osvaldo shows off his Inter Milan shirt after joining the club on loan from Southampton . 'Last year was a particular one. I have a lot of desire to return to my level and prove myself in this shirt.' Osvaldo joined Juventus on loan in January after a troubled spell in England, where he was suspended by Southampton following a training ground clash with teammate Jose Fonte, which left the defender with a broken nose. Most of his 11 appearances for Juventus were as a substitute and he scored just one goal as his side stormed to the Serie A title. The Italy forward scored three goals for Southampton after joining from Roma in August for a club-record 15.1 million euros (then $20 million). Osvaldo netted 16 goals in 25 league matches for Roma the previous campaign. All smiles: Osvaldo is hoping to prove himself after a difficult year on and off the pitch . Room for improvement: Osvaldo scored just once after joining Serie A side Juventus on loan in January . 'I never look over my shoulder, at the past, I look to the future,' Osvaldo said. 'It was hard to adapt to English football at the beginning and then it's always hard to arrive at a team in the middle of the season. Plus I didn't play much as I had players like Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez in front of me. 'But I had a great time at Juve. I had the opportunity to win the Italian title, which had never happened to me before.' Osvaldo is one of a number of signings Inter has made this offseason, as it aims to once again be a force to be reckoned with after several disappointing seasons. 'It is useless to make judgments before the season starts,' Osvaldo said. 'It'll be on the pitch where we see whether we're a squad which can aim for the title or not.' Fresh start: Osvaldo poses with Inter's sporting director Piero Ausilio on Thursday . The 28-year-old Osvaldo was not part of Italy's World Cup squad, which had a disappointing group stage exit in Brazil. 'I don't think I wasn't called up because of the little playing time I had at Juventus,' he said. 'It's a choice I would certainly make again.' Osvaldo, who was dropped from Italy's Confederations Cup squad last year for insulting his club coach at Roma, has been involved in controversy on and off the pitch throughout his career. 'I have a particular character,' a laughing Osvaldo said. 'But so many times journalists exaggerate or invent things which aren't true.'","Osvaldo joined Inter from Southampton on loan earlier this week .

Konye, . of Canning Town, East London, denies throwing or casting a corrosive . fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure, disable or do grievous . bodily harm. She admits following Miss Oni and to being the person wearing the niqab. The case continues. Mary Konye posted a picture of horror film villain Freddy Krueger online and wrote, ‘She better not mess with me or I’ll make her face look like this’ before the attack, the court heard yesterday. The university student then posted a second picture of the disfigured character from the Nightmare On Elm Street films after the attack on Naomi Oni, it is alleged. That post carried the message ‘Who looks like Wrong Turn now?’ – a reference to a film featuring disfigured characters. She also allegedly confessed to a friend that she wanted to throw acid in Miss Oni’s face so she would know ‘how it feels’ to be unhappy with her appearance. The court heard she admired Miss Oni ‘to the point of obsession’ and was insecure about her own looks. After a row, Konye allegedly quizzed another friend, who was studying chemistry at school, whether there was any acid stored in the lab.

"A UKIP county councillor and his wife have admitted stealing nearly £25,000 through benefit fraud using a false address for two years. Cllr Peter Lagoda, 59, and his wife Maria, also 59, today dramatically changed their plea to guilty at the start of their trial. The pair had been accused of giving Fenland District Council a false address in a bid to claim extra benefits from 2008 to 2010. Confession: Cllr Peter Lagoda and his wife Maria both pleaded guilty to using a false address for two years . Lagoda had claimed he lived in South Beach, Cambridgeshire, when instead he shared a property in nearby Wisbech with his wife. It had been alleged the councillor and his wife falsely claimed £11,565 in income support, £2,346 in council tax and £10,949 in housing benefit. Despite originally pleading not guilty in April last year at Cambridge Magistrates' Court, the pair have now admitted all the charges against them. Peterborough Crown Court heard how the dishonesty had stretched for more than two years between June 2008 and November 2010. A UKIP spokesman said: 'If he has . pleaded guilty to a criminal offence, the party will revoke his . membership. He is currently suspended from the party and sitting as an . Independent.' Sentence: The couple will be sentenced together on March 28 at Peterborough Crown Court . The confession comes after Lagoda admitted he described his north African sister as a 'w*g' and German relatives as 'Mongols' whose children have 'slanty eyes'. He said: 'Yes, my cousin married Mongols and now all their little children are ever so cute and they have slanty eyes.' Lagoda had been elected to represent Wisbech South on Cambridgeshire County Council in May last year. But he was suspended from UKIP after being charged by Cambridgeshire Constabulary with the fraud. The pair will now be sentenced on March 28 at the same court.","Councillor Peter Lagoda and wife Maria, both 59, changed plea today .

"Pro-Russian separatists claimed to have found the 'black box' - which records vital flight information - of the downed passenger airliner MH17. According to Russian news agency Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Purgin of the breakaway Donestsk Republic said the box will be transferred to Moscow for examination. 'Of course, we most likely will give them to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), to Moscow. They are highly qualified experts who will be able to accurately determine the cause of the disaster, even though it is so clear,' he said. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: An armed pro-Russian separatist stands at a site of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane crash in the settlement of Grabovo in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. It is claimed the flight's black box has been recovered and will be sent to Moscow . Whoever has the black box will be able to control what information is released from on board before the crash. Black boxes are used to review information from the flight and record cockpit chatter. They allow officials to discover if the pilot was aware of any problems before the plane went down. Meanwhile, armed separatists are hindered search efforts at the crash site, the head of Ukraine's emergency services said. 'The search work is difficult because we are talking about a big radius... but also because armed terrorists who are on the spot are hampering things,' Serhiy Bochkovsky told journalists. He gave no further details. Power: It is believed a BUK missile launcher brought down the Boeing 777 . The Malaysian airliner was brought down over eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 295 people aboard and sharply raising the stakes in a conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow rebels in which Russia and the West back opposing sides. Among the dead are nine Britons and 27 Australians, according to Dutch authorities, and fears of up to 23 Americans. Any commercial aeroplane or corporate jet is required to be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder. It is these two items of separate equipment which we commonly refer to as a ‘black box.’ While they do nothing to help the plane when it is in the air, both these pieces of equipment are vitally important should the plane crash, as they help crash investigators find out what happened just before. All recorders undergo countless tests, are able to operate between -55° to +70°C and carry a minimum 25 hours of flight data. Also, to help investigators find them, a black box is not actually black at all, but bright orange. Source: National Geographic .

"A U.S. government website aimed at girls between the ages of 10 and 16 attracted attention its creators likely didn't want on Friday, as news emerged that it includes graphic information about sex acts along with advice about puberty and disease. GirlsHealth.gov was spotted - and lambasted - by CNS News, a conservative website. But the government program was launched in 2002, during President George W. Bush's first term in office, and acquired its racy content during his second term, in 2006. Historical versions of the website, kept available online at Archive.org, span nearly eight years and confirm that the graphic sexual language first appeared sometime between October 2005 and June 2006. Today's GirlsHealth.gov is updated with a modern look, including social media tools and celebrity interviews, all calculated to appeal to girls - including the very young . GirlsHealth.gov's 'About this site' page describes it as a health resource website for girls as young as age 10 . While many parents might want 10-year-old girls to know that sexual molestation is wrong, few would teach kids that young about 'mutual masturbation.' But the government-run website's glossary provides a frank definition . In language seemingly calculated to appeal to 'tween' female audiences, the government-funded website takes girls through everything from their first menstrual cycles to health issues related to homosexuality. But the frank language in its . glossary definition of anal sex - 'sex that involves putting the penis . in the anus, or butt' - is likely to shock even parents who are used to . seeing sex education programs in public schools. Definitions of 'mutual masturbation' and 'oral sex' are also included in the glossary, aimed at millions of girls who have not yet reached puberty. CONDOMS OR CRUSHES: Which is more appropriate for a fifth-grade girl? Wanda Jones (L), then-Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary for Women's Health, led the implementation of GirlsHealth.gov. Perot Systems, the computer company founded by billionaire two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot (R), won a $16 million contract extension in 2006 to continue working on that website and others . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded its first contract in 1998 to Soza and Company Ltd., a Fairfax, Virginia company tasked with building and managing a handful of health-related websites for the federal government. Perot Systems Corp., the company founded by multi-billionaire and former presidential candidate  Ross Perot, acquired Soza that same year. Perot won a $16 million contract in 2006 to continue the work - a contract that specifically mentioned GirlsHealth.gov. It was in that year that sexually explicit language first appeared on the site. In a twist worthy of Hollywood, the personal computer maker Dell Inc. acquired Perot systems in 2009, meaning that the company millions of parents trust to provide their children with computing resources is also teaching many of their fifth-graders about anal sex. Current Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius may be busy with pans to implement Obamacare: Her office didn't respond to questions about the GirlsHealth.gov website . Tommy Thompson (L) was HHS secretary throughout George W. Bush's first term in office when the website was launched. Mike Leavitt (R) took over the agency during Bush's second term, and was at the helm when the graphic information about sex acts was added . Wanda Jones, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS, was reportedly behind the development of the GirlsHealth.gov website. She entered federal government service in 1987, during the Reagan administration, as an HIV laboratory trainer and rose through the ranks, later being promoted to found the Centers for Disease Control's Office of Women's Health. 'We have nothing to sell but health,' Jones told a Voice of America interviewer in 2007. She described the content on the GirlsHealth.gov website as 'U.S. government-source information, that ... can be trusted to be based on the most credible science.' Neither Jones' office, nor that of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, responded immediately to emails seeking additional information about the age groups targeted by the website's sexually explicit material. Don't blame me - it's just another Republican trick! It's all part of my global health 'strategery' You know, I really wish I'd thought of that! One online exercise helps young girls to dispel misconceptions about sexual activity by clicking on them to reveal 'the truth.' One of those elements focuses on pregnancy prevention via the ineffective 'withdrawal' method. 'My boyfriend says he'll just pull his penis out before anything happens,' girls visiting that web page read. Clicking brings them to a screen reading, 'The truth: It takes a lot of self-control for a guy to pull out. Also, some sperm can come out before a man ejaculates (""comes"").' Digital snapshots of the website . maintained at archive.org show that in addition to descriptions of anal . and oral sex, and mutual masturbation, when the website was updated . between late 2005 and mid-2006, it acquired new information about date . rape, ejaculation, sexual intercourse and a host of  sexually transmitted . diseases. No change was made, however, to the state age-range of its target audience. The website's 2002-era feel was a cross between New Age and unicorns . Other new vocabulary, however, included sections on virginity and sexual abstinence. The Bush administration launched a major initiative in 2006 aimed at promoting abstinence-only sex education among late-teen and 20s audiences. At the same time, similar messaging began to appear on GirlsHealth.gov. Some of that language is still available on the website. 'Few people regret waiting to have sex, but many regret starting early,' one section reads. 'Read on to see why abstinence - not having sex - makes a lot of good sense.' Other sections, however, presume the very young target audience is already sexually active, even as they promote abstinence . The page containing that language, according to a notice on the website, was last updated in October 2010.

"Megyn Kelly proved once again that's she's not your typical Fox News talking head when she entered into a debate on working mothers this past Friday. An argument broke out when she hosted RedState.com editor Erick Erickson, and fellow Fox host Lou Dobbs, in response to a discussion the two men had on Dobbs' show. The initial discussion centered on a recent Pew study finding that 40 per cent of working mothers were now the breadwinners in their family. Scroll down for video . Taken to school: Fox News host Megyn Kelly called out Lou Dobbs, left, and Erick Erickson, right, after they made sexist comments about working mothers . Fury: Kelly asked Erickson 'What makes you dominant, and me submissive, and who died and made you scientist-in-chief?' Erickson found the study troubling, advocating for women to return to their original role in the family. 'When you look at biology, look at the natural world, the roles of a male and a female in society, and other animals, the male typically is the dominant role,' Erickson said 'Lou Dobbs Tonight.' 'The female, it's not antithesis, or it's not competing, it's a complementary role. We as people in a smart society have lost the ability to have complementary relationships in nuclear families, and it's tearing us apart.' Kelly, a working mother herself, had quite the bone to pick with that view during the heated segment. 'What makes you dominant, and me submissive, and who died and made you scientist-in-chief?'Kelly asked Erickson. Hitting home: The debate was especially personal for Kelly who herself juggles a full-time job with the responsibilities of being a mother of two . Erickson subsequently brings up the fact that three quarters of those surveyed in the poll agreed with his view. 'Just because you have people who agree with you doesn't mean it's not offensive,' Kelly said. Erickson wrote a follow-up piece in response to his appearance on Dobbs' show, which Kelly criticized more. Though she said she doesn't describe herself as a feminist, Kelly said she was offended by the piece nonetheless. 'I didn't like what you wrote one bit,' she said. Things got especially heated when the conversation turned to Dobbs, who blamed the high divorce rate on working mothers. 'Why are you attributing that to women in the workforce?' Kelly asked. 'Excuse me, let me just finish what I'm saying if I may, oh dominant one,' Dobbs retorted to a clearly offended Kelly. Kelly turned back to Erickson's blog post where she quoted him writing:'The truth - kids most likely will do best in households where they have a mom at home nurturing them while dad is out bringing home the bacon. Kelly goes on to name four different studies that prove the exact opposite - that children of working mothers turn out just the same as children with stay-at-home mothers. 'I mean, why are we supposed to take your word for it? Erick Erickson's science instead of all of these experts?' Zing!","Pew study shows that 40 per cent of mothers are now leading or primary breadwinners .

"Hernanes struck deep into stoppage time for Inter Milan as the hosts came from behind twice to earn a point against Napoli at the San Siro on Sunday night. The 29-year-old headed home from close range to cap a dramatic finale to the match, after Jose Callejon's goal just moments earlier  looked to have given Rafa Benitez's men all three points. It was the former Real Madrid forward who had given Napoli an unlikely lead on 79 minutes, after a defensive lapse in the home penalty area between Nemanja Vidic and Dode gifted the 27-year-old the opportunity to net his fifth goal of the season - and he took it with aplomb.

But Inter replied within just three minutes, with Fredy Guarin scoring with his first touch of the game to level the match - just a minute after coming on - with his second goal of the season. And Walter Mazzarri's men were at it again in stoppage time, as Hernanes' scored what could be a crucial goal in the former's tenure at the San Siro after a poor start to the season from his side. It was Mauro Icardi who was causing all the problems for Inter early on, having two chances on goal in quick succession, only to be thwarted by crucial blocks from the Napoli defenders. The 21-year-old, who has scored four goals in eight appearances for the Italian giants this season, has expressed his desire to extend his current deal with the club  and he again was impressive for Inter on Sunday night. The hosts would go close again on 23 minutes as Dode floated in a dangerous ball from the left with Icardi's header inches away from nestling into the far corner. In a rare attack from the visitors during the first period Marek Hamsik forced Samir Handanovic into action on 29 minutes, as Rafa Benitez' side looked to get some kind of foothold in the game. It was Inter who continued to control proceedings though, as they went agonisingly close to taking the lead 10 minutes later, when Hernanes showed great composure to chest the ball down and spin away from his marker, before his half-volley struck the post and came out into play. So on reflection Benitez's side were somewhat fortunate to have gone into the break all square after an inept attacking display.

There were signs of an instant improvement from Napoli within five minutes of the break though, with Hamsik teeing up Lorenzo Insigne, who squandered a golden opportunity to make it 1-0 as his tame effort rebounded off the post. Up the other end Vidic went close to scoring his first goal for Inter since joining from Manchester United, as he rose highest from Rodrigo Palacio's corner, but his header went just over. The game looked to be petering out for a draw before all the last-gasp action unfolded, as Callejon struck twice either side of goals from Guarin and Hernanes, with the hosts ending their two-match losing run and in turn climbing one place to ninth, while Napoli remain seventh.

"Ander Herrera believes Manchester United have the best strike force in the world, which is some claim considering what other predators are lurking out there. The Spaniard, in discussing his excitement at playing alongside Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, said: ‘I think we have maybe the best three strikers in the world here in Rooney, van Persie and Falcao.’ But can that trio compare to Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale? How does it rate against what might be a remarkable combination of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, once the latter returns from suspension? Then there’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his understudies at Paris Saint-Germain. And the mixture of elegance and killer instinct at Chelsea. The wide boys at Bayern also make a compelling case. Here, Sportsmail rules on the best forward lines in the game. MANCHESTER UNITED . Radamel Falcao celebrates after scoring his first goal for Manchester United against Everton . Wayne Rooney (left) and Robin van Persie (right) make up the Manchester United front three . Big names, but yet to live up to Herrera’s billing. All three have rightly been considered world class at one time or another but how close are they to their respective peaks? And how much is reflective of the inadequacies behind them? Van Persie, at 31, does not quite look like the same brilliant player he was in his first Old Trafford season, while Falcao has not yet hit his stride. On his day he is perhaps the most lethal finisher in the game. This trio needs more time and extra support. BARCELONA . South Americans Neymar and Lionel Messi are two of Barcelona's formidable front three . Luis Suarez is yet to play a competitive game for Barcelona following his ban for biting during the World Cup . In theory, and according to our ratings, this is the best line-up in the world. Suarez remains an unknown, owing to the ongoing uncertainty over how he will fit in with a new team and the role that he will play. He will stand alongside arguably the greatest player in history, in Messi, who has already scored six and made six in seven La Liga games. Neymar isn’t bad, either. In fact, the Brazilian’s strike-rate of a goal every 49 minutes is bettered only by Ronaldo (of players who have played more than once). It remains to be seen if the attack is worth more than the sum of its parts, but they are extremely talented parts. VIDEO Suarez ready for Real . MANCHESTER CITY . Segio Aguero scored in City's last win over Aston Villa before the international break . Samir Nasri and David Silva played a key role in Manchester City winning the title last season . Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher recently listed David Silva as one of the Premier League’s best 11 imports and rightly so. He is a master of evasion, so clever in his runs, passing and ability to find space, but he could still score more goals. Sergio Aguero is the man who makes the tangible difference and already has an excellent record this season. At 26, he is heading into the fabled peak time of his career. Samir Nasri, at 27, has played more than 250 games in English football, but is currently injured. CHELSEA . Diego Costa has made an immediate impact at Chelsea and has scored nine goals so far this season . Both Oscar (left) and Eden Hazard have played key roles in Chelsea being top of the Premier League . In Eden Hazard, Chelsea have one of the best, most dynamic dribblers in Europe. A man of small stature and questionable work rate, he scores goals and he makes them. Oscar, meanwhile, is rapidly emerging and, perhaps predictably, has drawn comparisons to Frank Lampard. The crown jewel, without dispute, is Diego Costa. He is what Chelsea so badly needed and what they so badly failed to find for a number of years – a striker worth comparing to Didier Drogba. Arsene Wenger described him this month as a ‘killer’ and his goals ratio proves the point. The best striker in the Premier League. BAYERN MUNICH . Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben have formed a good partnership for Bayern this season . Franck Ribery has only played once this season due to injury - but he still scored, against Stuttgart . Franck Ribery has played less than one full game because of injury so it is hard to know what to expect from the brilliant Frenchman, who is now 31 and has been central to Bayern Munich’s rise to the top. With Arjen Robben in the same side, it is possible to argue Bayern have the best wide players of any side. The Dutchman is perhaps the strongest candidate for the ‘third best player in the world’ candidate and has already scored three Bundesliga goals and made two more this season. Robert Lewandowski has done well since joining Bayern, scoring four league goals in three games and also making two, having notched more than 20 Bundesliga strikes in each of his past three seasons. REAL MADRID . Goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring against Athletic Bilbao earlier this month . French striler Karim Benzema and Wales forward Gareth Bale make up Real's lethal attack . In Benzema, the Madrid giants have a fine player made to look modest by comparisons with two stars. Ronaldo is the best player in the world on current form, an astonishing athlete who has already scored three hat-tricks this season. If Messi is the greatest of all time, then Ronaldo cannot be too far behind. Then there is Bale. There were suggestions in Spain this season that he does not work hard enough. Carlo Ancelotti dismissed those and has watched the £86m man score four and make three this season. He is one of the fastest men in football and at 25 is evidently getting better. PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN . Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (right) guided Paris Saint-Germain to the French title last season . PSG's Brazilian flier Lucas Moura, in action against Monaco, is  the French champions' other attacking option . Winger Lucas Moura has not lived up to the hype following his reported £44m move from Sao Paulo in 2012 – Manchester United were keen – and his struggles were demonstrated during the first game of the season when Ibrahimovic tore strips off him. Edinson Cavani has justified his own huge price tag in a more convincing manner, scoring 25 in 43 games last season having been prolific at Napoli. It goes without saying that Ibrahimovic is the star. At 33, he is still magnificent. His five goals from five games this season takes his PSG ratio in all competitions to 83 in 94 games. He belongs in a better league. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.","Ander Herrera says Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao are the best front three in world football .

"A 'wonder' paint made from graphene could banish rust forever, scientists claim. By combining it with oxygen they say they can create graphene oxide that, when applied as paint, provides an ultra-strong and non-corrosive coating. And the breakthrough could apparently revolutionise the medical, nuclear and even transport industries. Scientists at Manchester University say Graphene can be combined with oxygen to create graphene oxide and then applied as paint (stock image shown). This provides an ultra-strong, non-corrosive coat to metals, bricks and more. When exposed to water vapour the paint acts as a 'molecular sieve' Graphene is a one atom thick sheet of carbon that has often been heralded as a 'miracle material'. This latest study by scientists from Manchester University created coatings for metals or even bricks that behave like graphite in terms of chemical and thermal stability. But they also become mechanically nearly as tough as graphene, the strongest material known to be in existence today. The team led by Dr Rahul Nair and Nobel laureate Sir Andre Geim demonstrated previously that multilayer films made from graphene oxide are vacuum tight under dry conditions. Graphene is the world's thinnest substance, transparent but stronger than steel - a conductive super-material made of carbon just one atom thick. There is a surge of interest in it to replace semiconductors in next-generation computers, touch screens, batteries and solar cells. Graphene was aired as a theoretical substance in 1947. But for decades, physicists thought it would be impossible to isolate, as such thin crystalline sheets were bound to be unstable. The problem was resolved in 2004 by a pair of scientists who used ordinary sticky tape to lift a layer from a piece of graphite. That layer was itself pulled apart using more tape, and the process repeated until just the thinnest of layers remained - a graphene sheet. If exposed to water or its vapour however they act as molecular sieves, allowing passage of small molecules below a certain size. The findings could also have huge implications for water purification. This contrasting property is due to the structure of graphene oxide films that consist of millions of small flakes stacked randomly on top of each other but leave nano-sized capillaries between them. Water molecules  inside these nanocapillaries and can drag small atoms and molecules along. In an article published in Nature Communications, the team showed it was possible to tightly close those nanocapillaries using simple chemical treatments, which makes graphene films even stronger mechanically as well as completely impermeable to everything: gases, liquids or strong chemicals. For example, they demonstrated that glassware or copper plates covered with graphene paint can be used as containers for strongly corrosive acids. Graphene (artist's illustration shown) is the world's thinnest substance, transparent but stronger than steel - a conductive super-material made of carbon just one atom thick. There is a surge of interest in it to replace semiconductors in next-generation computers, touch screens, batteries and solar cells . The exceptional barrier properties of graphene paint have already attracted interest from many companies who now collaborate with The University of Manchester on development of new protective and anticorrosion coatings. Dr Nair said: 'Graphene paint has a good chance to become a truly revolutionary product for industries that deal with any kind of protection either from air, weather elements or corrosive chemicals. 'Those include, for example, medical, electronics and nuclear industry or even shipbuilding, to name but the few.' Another author on the research Dr Yang Su added: 'Graphene paint can be applied to practically any material, independently of whether it's plastic, metal or even sand. 'For example, plastic films coated with graphene could be of interest for medical packaging to improve shelf life because they are less permeable to air and water vapour than conventional coatings. In addition, thin layers of graphene paint are optically transparent.'","Scientists at Manchester University say Graphene can be combined with oxygen to create graphene oxide and then applied as paint .

"Scientists in Sweden claim to have captured the sound made by a single atom and say it is a very, very high-pitched high D-Note - undetectable to the human ear. The experts, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, were investigating the relationship between sound and atoms in the hope of learning more about quantum physics. The believe manipulating sound on the quantum level could lead to new developments in computing - giving us faster and more efficient computers. Scientists in Sweden claim to have captured the sound made by a single atom and say it is a very high-pitched high D-Note (file picture) To reach their conclusion, they constructed an artificial atom 0.01 millimeters large. Just like real atoms, artificial ones can be charged up with energy which they subsequently emit in the form of a particle - usually the particle is light, but in this experiment it would be sound. The scientists started by placing the artificial atom on to a superconducting material, designed to carry sound-waves efficiently. After guiding sound along the material and bouncing it off the atom, they were able to record what came back - using a minute microphone. The researchers believe manipulating sound on the quantum level could lead to new developments in quantum computing . What they recorded was a D-note, around 20 octaves above the highest note on a piano - which is much higher than the human ear can detect. Per Delsing, the physics professor who led the experimental research group, said: 'We have opened a new door into the quantum world by talking and listening to atoms. 'Our long term goal is to harness quantum physics so that we can benefit from its laws, for example in extremely fast computers.' The study's co-author, Martin Gustafsson, added: 'According to the theory, the sound from the atom is divided into quantum particles. 'Such a particle is the weakest sound that can be detected' Sound has a short wavelength and travels 100,000 times slower than light, which means it's much easier to control. The process opens huge potential for taking control over quantum phenomena. The university's article on the study, Propagating Phonons Coupled To An Artificial Atom, can be found on their website.","Study done at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden .

"As humans, we can distinguish between different objects easily - such as dogs wearing hats, or between oranges and bananas in a bag - but for computers this has been typically much more difficult. Until now. A team of Google researchers has developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which is twice as effective than previous programs. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. A team of California-based Google researchers developed GoogLeNet, that uses an advanced classification and detection algorithm to identify object. The technology is so accurate, it can distinguish a range of object sizes, and it can also determine an object within or on an object – such as a dog wearing a hat (pictured) The software recently placed first in the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC).

A more detailed explanation is available from the Google Research Blog. This annual academic challenge was set up to test state-of-the-art technology in image understanding, both in the sense of recognising objects in images and locating where they are. Google has made the software open to other developers, to help increase its accuracy, and in the future, the technology could be used to improve Google Image searches. It could also scour YouTube videos for specific objects or shapes. The competition has three categories, including classification, classification with localisation, and detection. The classification track measures an algorithm’s ability to assign correct labels to an image. The . classification with localisation category assesses how well an . algorithm finds an object within an image, and how accurate its label . is. Finally, the detection challenge is similar, but uses stricter evaluation criteria.

Local residents took to Twitter to show the devastation following the explosion, showing shattered shop windows and broken glass on the streets. According to Hardt, pieces of the bomb spread withing a one kilometer radius, however, no further injuries have been reported. One man told Spiegel Online that all the windows had jumped out of the frame on his home and that the shock wave had dented his garage door. It is not uncommon to find undetonated bombs from World War II in Germany, however they rarely result in injuries or deaths.","Bomb from World War II detonated in Euskirchen, west Germany .

"Dogs may be known as man’s best friend, but cats have also been enjoying the company of humans for longer than previously thought. The skeleton of a cat believed to have been cared for by humans indicates that the ancient Egyptians kept felines as pets in 3,700BC. It has long been thought cats were first domesticated by the Egyptians, but a recent study found that Chinese farmers also kept them as pets as long ago as 3,300BC. The skeleton of a cat believed to have been cared for by humans indicates that the ancient Egyptians kept felines as pets in 3,700BC. DNA studies suggest that most of the 600million domestic cats today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat (pictured), which still lives in northern Africa and the Middle East . The new study suggests that the ancient Egyptians cared for domesticated cats as long ago as in 3,700BC. Until recent times it was thought that cats were first domesticated in the country around 1,950BC. Evidence of pet felines has also been found in China, indicating farmers cared for cats in 3,300BC. Archaeologists said that cats were also used as religious sacrifices in Ancient Egypt over 5,500 years ago. Cats were known as 'Mau' and were later important in Egyptian society and became a symbol of grace. Two goddesses took the form of cats - Mafdet - a lion-headed goddess of justice and execution, and Bastet - a cat representing fertility and motherhood. As a revered animal, some cats received the same mummification after death as humans and were often dedicated to Bastet. Until recently, it was thought that cats were first domesticated in ancient Egypt in around 1,950BC, but this new research sheds new light on humans’ relationship with cats. ‘It is clear that there was a close relationship with humans that predate the oldest accepted evidence for domestic cat in Egypt by almost two millennia,’ said Wim Van Neer of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, who led the study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The discovery at the crux of their study was a group burial at the cemetery of Hierakonpolis, which was once a large city predating the pyramids, Pacific Standard reported. Skeletons dating from 3,700BC included a small jungle cat, with a healed bone fracture, indicating it had ‘been tended to for several weeks prior to its sacrifice,’ according to the archaeologists. They believe the find proves that the cat was domestic – at least for the latter part of its life and measurements of the bones strengthen their case. The same cemetery also yielded another six cats, which were apparently killed as part of a religious ritual. The cats came from three or four different litters. 'It is clear that there was a close relationship with humans that predate the oldest accepted evidence for domestic cat in Egypt by almost two millennia,' said Wim Van Neer of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, who led the study . The tomb was discovered in the Kom al-Ahmar region, between Luxor and Aswan, on the site of Hierakonpolis (pictured). This city of the falcon was the dominant pre-dynastic urban centre and the capital of the Kingdom of Upper Egypt . ‘If all these animals are supposed to be taken from the wild, four different captures must be accepted. It seems unlikely that sufficient opportunities for successful capture would have occurred in a short period of time prior to the sacrifice. For that reason, it seems that at least some of the cats may have been kept in captivity prior to the burial,’ they wrote. While there is a chance that the cats were wild but lived nearby the human settlement, the researchers believe that felines still had a close connection with humans over five millennia ago. Until recent times, it was thought that cats were first domesticated in ancient Egypt in around 1,950BC. These cat mummies date from the first century AD and are associated with the goddess Bastet . It was announced in December that the bodies of cats found at a dig at a village in Shaanxi province in central China dated back 5,300 years – re-writing cats and humans’ joint history. Dr Fiona Marshall, of Washington University in St Louis said analysis including radiocarbon dating of bones suggested the cats preyed on rodents that lived on farmed millet. The team analysed eight bones from at least two cats excavated from the site. One of the cats had old bones - suggesting it had survived well into old age in the village. Another was shown to have eaten fewer animals and more millet than expected, suggesting it had been fed by the villagers. Dr Marshall, who studied the site with scientists from Chinese universities, suggested that the cats were domesticated to control the villagers’ rat problem. Our data suggests that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals, such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew, ate and stored,' she said. ‘Results of this study show that the village of Quanhucun was a source of food for the cats 5,300 years ago, and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal, or advantageous for the cats. ‘Even if these cats were not yet domesticated, our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers, and that the relationship had mutual benefits.’ DNA studies suggest that most of the estimated 600million domestic cats around the world today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat, which still lives in northern Africa and the Middle East.","Researchers from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences said a cat skeleton indicates humans cared for cats in 3,700BC .

"She's been a racehorse owner for more than 60 years, breeds Highland ponies at Balmoral and hosts a horse show at Windsor each year. And it seems the Queen's love of all things equine has proved equal to the demands of advancing age, after she was photographed trotting around the Windsor estate this morning. Perched on the back of her current mount, Fell pony Carltonlima Emma, the monarch looked on spritely form as she enjoyed the June sunshine, her trademark headscarf firmly in place. Good day for a gallop: The Queen riding her Fell pony Carltonlima Emma in Windsor Great Park this morning . Although approaching 90, the Queen continues to ride out every morning -  a longstanding habit begun when she was given Shetland mare, Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have seen a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was the Queen's mount of choice in the 50s, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. But while her penchant for riding is well known, her career as a racehorse breeder is legendary and spans more than 60 years. Beginning with the handful that she inherited on the death of her father George VI, the Queen's horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby. The Derby, which takes place on Saturday, has so far eluded the Queen, although she did have a second place finish in 1953 and managed third place in 2011. Riding: The Queen has a longstanding habit of riding out in the morning at Windsor, and is pictured here in 1961 . Celebration: The Queen celebrated her 50th birthday with a trot through the grounds at Windsor Castle . Favourite: The Queen, pictured here with Ronald Reagan, on her beloved Trooping the Colour horse, Burmese . Along with Royal Ascot, the Queen never misses a Derby meeting and will be at the race on Saturday, where she will, in keeping with tradition, congratulate the winner from the royal box. While the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958. Last year, her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - . much to the delight of the monarch. Despite her love of racing, the Queen no . longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself or, indeed, any of the more spirited breeds occupying the royal stables. Instead, much of her time is devoted to breeding docile Fell ponies, among them her current mount, Carltonlima Emma, from the royal stud at Hampton Court. The Investec Derby is part of the QIPCO British Champions Series and will be broadcast live on Saturday 7th June by Channel 4 Racing. Visit britishchampionsseries.com for more information. Feisty: Although now confined to ponies, the Queen once rode fiery breeds such as this thoroughbred in 1997 . Relaxed: The Queen's favourite ride takes her along the banks of the Thames which runs near Windsor Castle . Ancient: The stocky Fell pony has roamed British vales for more than two millennia . One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period. Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh. Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire. The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher. Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans. By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed. Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families. Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies from her Hampton Court stud.

"An epic burger weighing more than three stone is the biggest ever made in the UK, according to The Bond Hotel in Blackpool. The chefs made the colossal burger, which weighed 45lbs, from 30lbs of beef and a 21-inch-wide bun - adding 2lbs of mayo and 3.5lbs of cheese. The dish, which included 1lb of tomatoes and 1lb of lettuce, weighs the same as an average four-year-old, and is the size of a satellite dish. Fries with that? Chef Graham Atkinson pictured with the three stone burger . Meaty: Cooks at The Bond Hotel, Blackpool, made the colossal burger, weighing in at 45 pounds . The huge slab of meat was cooked for two hours and eaten by 12 customers at the hotel in South Shore. Hotel owner Graham Atkinson is now hoping the burger, which beat the previous record by 10lbs, will be classed as the biggest ever made in the UK. 'It was really good fun putting it together,' he said. 'Guests at the hotel though thought it was incredible and they never dreamed it was going to be this big. 'I'm almost certain we've smashed the last record for the biggest burger in the UK.' Mr Atkinson worked as a butcher for 22 years before moving to his family-run hotel 10 years ago. What diet?

"Pep Guardiola's Barcelona team produced the greatest football of their dominant four-year spell in world football against Chelsea – during a Champions League semi-final in which they eventually lost on aggregate. The claim comes from one of Guardiola's closest assistants and the match in question was the epic Champions League semi final in 2012, when Chelsea drew 2-2 at the Nou Camp, despite having ten men for most of the game, winning 3-2 on aggregate and progressing to the Champions League final where they beat Bayern Munch. A performance against Arsenal at The Emirates in 2010 is also high on the list of the finest moments of Barca's Guardiola, reckoned by many judges to be the one of the greatest teams of all-time after they won an extraordinary two Champions League trophies, two World Club Cups, three La Liga trophies and two Copas del Rey in Guardola's four years at the club. Chelsea beat Barcelona 3-2 on aggregate in 2012, with Fernando Torres netting a late goal to seal it . But Pep Guardiola's closest assistant believes Barcelona were playing their best football at the time . Sergio Busquets, Carles Puyol and Xavi look despondent after the game at the Nou Camp . Pep Confidential: The Inside Story is out now . But in a compliment to Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea team, Guardiola and his assistant Manel Estiarte discuss the best football played by the Barca team, debating whether the 2012 semi final with Estiarte saying the Chelsea game was the team's peak. The new book, Pep Confidential, reveals: 'Guardiola and Estiarte get involved in a debate about the best moments of Barcelona's recent golden era. For Estiarte the absolute peaks were: 'The first half against Arsenal at the Emirates [March 31, 2010. 2-2] and the first half against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final of 2012. We never played better than those two days.' 'Guardiola disagrees. 'The performance against Chelsea was fabulous but I think we played better in the final of the World Club Cup against Santos (in 2011).That was our all-time peak.' The Arsenal game in 2010 saw an exquisite Barca team go into a 2-0 lead before Arsene Wenger's side came back with two second half goals to create probably the greatest Champions League game seen at the stadium. Arsenal eventually lost the tie 6-3 on aggregate. The Chelsea semi-final saw Chelsea travel to the Nou Camp with a 1-0 lead from the first leg. But Barca, playing some extraordinary football, went into a 2-0 lead, and, with John Terry sent off shortly before half time, Chelsea seemed doomed. But Ramires scored for Chelsea and Leo Messi missed a penalty for Barca before a late goal from Fernando Torres confirmed Chelsea in the final. Roberto Di Matteo was delighted after progressing to the Champions League final, which they went on to win . Guardiola, meanwhile, believes Barca were at the peak of their powers when playing Arsenal in 2010 . Manchester City also feature in Guardiola's discussions about the best his teams have played, with last year's 3-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium considered to be the peak display by Bayern Munich last season. Ironically it is Arsenal who were also responsible for the worst ten minutes of Bayern Munich's football last season. Guardiola, who now coaches the German club and won the league and cup double last season, faced Wenger's side in the last 16 of the Champions League and eventually saw his side run at 2-0 winners at The Emirates and 3-1 on aggregate – but only after an excellent start in London by Arsenal. In the book Guardiola is quoted as saying: 'Our worst 10 minutes this season were in the Emirates. Manuel Neuer's hand saved us that day,' he reflected. 'Our best? Probably the game against City in Manchester or the first 40 minutes of the Hertha match in Berlin.'

"They are perennial Premier League title contenders, always there or thereabouts when the medals are handed out in May. But Chelsea and Manchester City have also established themselves as the pre-eminent forces in youth football, from the Under-21 standard that is one step away from the first team right down to the Under 11s just starting out. Both clubs have invested millions of pounds into their academies as they aim to create a conveyor belt of talent good enough to play for their first team and they are starting to see a return. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Manchester City and Chelsea's young stars in action . Youth football rivalry: Chelsea and Manchester City are increasingly going head-to-head at all age levels. Here, Chelsea's John Swift (right) tries to fend off City's Seko Fofana in the Under 21 Premier League semi-final . Bright young thing: Lewis Baker celebrates his winner for Chelsea as they beat Manchester United 2-1 in the final of last season's Under 21 Premier League at Old Trafford . Rising star: City's Marcos Lopes, pictured here in the UEFA Youth League match with Bayern Munich in which he scored three times in a 6-0 win, has been loaned out to Ligue 1 side Lille to gain experience . At Chelsea, owner Roman Abramovich has put in at least £100m to make the club's training facility at Cobham world class, while City will later this year open a £150m academy a stone's throw from the Etihad Stadium. A look at the various competitions in the age groups from 21 downwards show Chelsea and City are increasingly going head-to-head in the latter stages. Chelsea won the Under 21 Premier League last season by beating Manchester United 2-1 in the final at Old Trafford, but they had defeated City on penalties in the semi-final after a goalless draw. Charly Musonda and Lewis Baker, two of Chelsea's most exciting young prospects, were on target to deliver the trophy to Stamford Bridge. Indeed, Jose Mourinho said recently that if Baker and other club prodigies Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke don't go on to represent England, he will be to blame. Investment: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has spent over £100m to transform their Cobham base into a world class academy but will be hoping more players can graduate into the first team . Millions: Sheik Mansour (right) has overseen a £150m investment in City's new academy near the Etihad . Blame me! Jose Mourinho has promised to guide young talents Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke to England contention . City reached the final of the inaugural Under 21 Premier League Cup but lost out 4-3 on aggregate to Reading over two legs. They had looked good to lift the trophy after two goals from Devante Cole and another from Marcos Lopes gave them a 3-2 advantage at home but Reading won the second leg 2-0 and turned the tie around. In the first season of the Under 19 UEFA Youth League, both teams registered some impressive results as they progressed to the quarter-finals. City's 6-0 rout of Bayern Munich in the group phase sent shockwaves across the continent - there were five English names on their teamsheet, though Portuguese star Marcos Lopes stole the show with a hat-trick. Mentor: City's EDS coach Patrick Vieira with striker Devante Cole, a talented English striker who is tipped for a big future for club and country . Tipped for stardom: Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke is on the verge of breaking into the first team squad . Under 21 Premier League - Chelsea . FA Youth Cup - Chelsea . Under 16 International Tournament - Chelsea . Under 14 Premier League - Man City . Under 13 International Tournament - Chelsea . Under 11 National champions - Man City . Chelsea achieved a 100 per cent record in the group and then thrashed AC Milan 4-1, with Baker scoring a wondergoal, before they bowed out to Schalke. With the frontiers of youth football expanding beyond these shores, both City and Chelsea will be targeting European success in the season to come. This will only intensify with the introduction of a continental competition for Under 21 teams in 2014-2015 with both taking part. In the FA Youth Cup, an Under 18 competition, Chelsea stormed to their fourth final in five seasons and won their third competition in that time as they beat local rivals Fulham in a classic two-legged final. Fulham won the first leg 3-2 at Craven Cottage and led by the same scoreline at Stamford Bridge before a rousing Chelsea fightback, capped by two Solanke goals, earned them the Cup. Thrilling win: Ruben Loftus-Cheek lifts the FA Youth Cup after Chelsea beat Fulham 6-5 on aggregate in the final . While Chelsea dominated in the Cup, City came close in the Premier League at Under 18 level. After topping the Northern Section, they saw off West Ham before losing 1-0 to Everton in the final at Goodison Park. Their dominance is even more pronounced beneath Under 18 level. In the Under 16 age bracket, the Premier League stages tournaments and festivals instead of a league format in order to allow players to make the transition to full-size 11 vs 11 matches. At the last Premier League International Tournament, held back in October, Chelsea triumphed after beating Real Madrid 2-0 in the final at Warwick University. The game was notable for an audacious 40-yard free-kick by Chelsea's Mukhtar Ali that soared over the Real goalkeeper's head. Moving younger still and guess which two teams contested the final of the Premier League at Under 14 level? An eight-team finals tournament was held at the London Soccerdome and City recovered from 2-0 down to beat Chelsea and retain the crown at that age group. And it was the same story at the recent Under 13 International Tournament, also held at Warwick. The Premier League invited Porto, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven to take on the leading nine English clubs and Chelsea and City emerged from the pack to contest the final. After a 1-1 draw, Chelsea won 6-5 in a penalty shoot-out that were to sudden death. With City also the reigning champions at Under 11 level, it demonstrates that Chelsea and their Manchester rivals are taking a firm stranglehold on youth competition at all ages. The positive rewards of their academy investment are starting to filter through an age range of over 10 years from Under 21s to Under 11s and it is up to others to play catch-up. However, it will be argued that until both of these club's first teams are full of academy graduates, the investment is not reaping its full reward.","Chelsea and Manchester City are increasingly going head-to-head in youth football competitions from Under 21 standard downwards .

The 'braggie', similar to the 'selfie', is a word that has firmly wiggled its way into the popular lexicon, and is a term that's been coined to describe the humble brag pictures of people enjoying a fancy cocktail, walking in the sand or gazing at a sunset. Jenny from the sunblock: J-Lo shows off her famous golden glow and a fabulous print bikini from the beach .

"Alan Pardew is already looking ahead to January in a bid to address holes in his squad with Newcastle set to lose top scorer Papiss Cisse. The Senegal striker is almost certain to be involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off in Morocco on January 17. Cisse has scored four times in three games this season – his brace salvaged a 2-2 draw at Swansea on Saturday – and his goals have eased the pressure on Pardew, at least in the short term. Papiss Cisse's electric form is keeping his manager Alan Pardew in a job . The Senegalese striker celebrates scoring against Swansea but he will go and play for his country in January . The United boss retains the full support of owner Mike Ashley and discussions have taken place concerning ways to improve fortunes on the pitch, where they remain winless in the Premier League. Premier League goals for Newcastle: . 2011/12: 13 goals in 14 games . 2012/13: eight goals in 36 games . 2013/14: two goals in 24 games . 2014/15: four goals in three games . Top of the agenda for Pardew will be identifying targets for the winter transfer window. Sportsmail understands that a centre back with experience of the English top-flight is his number one priority, while bringing in a proven goalscorer – something they failed to do despite spending £35million in the summer – is also a must. Pardew, whose side are third from bottom, said: ‘Our focus is on the short term and to see where we are when we get to January, because we really need to be away from the bottom six or seven. ‘Otherwise, in January, we might need to do something, because we want to be in the top half.’ Pardew, though, will have to be diplomatic in negotiating a transfer strategy for the New Year given the recruitment model which is in place at the club, chief scout Graham Carr the man who still holds most sway. In the immediate future Pardew needs a win when they entertain Leicester City a week on Saturday to avoid being the first United manager to go eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season. Alan Pardew celebrates Papiss Cisse scoring Newcastle's second goal to keep them off the bottom . Four-goal striker Papiss Cisse nips in ahead of Ashley Williams to score against Swansea . Crucially, the players remain behind their boss and defender Mike Williamson says media scrutiny surrounding Pardew’s future has not been easy. ‘That is what can happen with the frenzy they can create - you end up with a bandwagon people are happy to jump on,’ he said. ‘But it is part and parcel of the game, there is no getting away from the position we are in and the results we have had, so that is the black and white of it. ‘It has been difficult, it always in when you have a bad period. But the lads are working their socks off and there is no lack of effort, we are all working hard behind the manager and trying to put things right.’ Newcastle defender Mike Williamson (right) is relieved the in-form hitman has returned to his scoring ways . Daryl Janmaat won't be heading off on international duty with Holland after picking up a hamstring injury . And Williamson admits the return to fitness – and form – of Cisse has come as a major relief. ‘Half the battle is having a guy like that who is scoring goals regularly,’ he added. ‘He has been fantastic. The attitude and work-rate he has shown when coming in every day during his recovery has been phenomenal and he is reaping the rewards of all the hours of hard work that people do not see. ‘He is proving a big lift for us with his performances and goals, he is exactly what we needed.​’ Meanwhile, defender Daryl Janmaat has been forced to withdraw from the Holland squad because of a hamstring injury but should be fit for the visit of Leicester.","Papiss Cisse has scored four times in only three appearances this season .

"Gary Ellis used five-year-old daughter he hardly sees to claim right to a family life . He has been in prison three times for drug dealing and robbery . It follows Lord Chief Justice's assertion that Human Rights Act should not always be a trump card . Alienated: Selese Whiley (left) claims Gary Ellis rarely sees their daughter despite using his 'right to family life' to help him remain in the UK . A violent Jamaican drug dealer has twice used the Humans Rights Act to avoid being deported from Britain, it emerged today. Gary Ellis, from Tottenham in north London, was allowed to stay because of his 'right to family life', despite the fact he rarely sees his five-year-old daughter or the child's mother. It is the latest in a string of cases in which criminals have used humans rights laws to escape punishment for their misdemeanors. Last week, the Lord Chief Justice cast doubt on the European Court of Human Rights, saying that when it conflicts with UK law, 'maybe Strasbourg shouldn't win'. Ellis, 23, split up with Selese Whiley in 2007 and has been in and out of prison ever since, maintaining almost no contact with their daughter Kyra. Miss Whiley, 23, told the Sunday Telegraph she had refused to give evidence to support him in court this summer. But the Home Office's appeal, which followed their second attempt to deport Ellis, was rejected by Judge Davin Gill. Miss Whiley said: 'He called me to ask me to go to court . and say that he was a good father and we were still together. But I told . him I wasn't willing to lie for him. 'He's always been in and out of jail. I don't understand how the government have let him stay.' The nonsensical human rights act just . days ago led to 88-year-old Lydia Werrett being threatened with . deportation to her native Zimbabwe, where she had received death . threats. Staying: Double rapist Rohan Winfield (left) and killer Raja Mohammed Anwar Khan avoided deportation by claiming it would be in breach of their human rights . Meanwhile, one of Robert Mugabe's . torturers has been allowed to stay here because of fears it would breach . his human rights to deport him. Ellis also claimed that threats had been made against Miss Whiley and his daughter, but she denied this had ever happened. 'He's . used us as a reason to avoid deportation,' she told the newspaper. 'He's been a bad father to Kyra and we haven't been together for four . years.' Problematic: Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May is bound by the Human Rights Act . Ellis . came to Britain from Jamaica on a visitor's visa in 2001, aged 14. He . was jailed for a year for robbery and two counts of attempted robbery in . 2004 and then received 30 months for supplying Class A drugs in in . April 2007. The Home Office . then tried to deport him, but he appealed on the basis of Article 8 of . the European Convention on Humans Rights, which enshrines the rights of . everyone to respect for private and family life. Immigration Judge Kamini Roopnarine-Davies ruled that he should . be allowed to remain in Britain - . even though the couple had separated by then, according to Miss . Whiley. He was then given . another 30 months for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs in . September 2009, after which the Home Office again tried to deport him. But . Immigration Judge Ifeyinwa Munonyedi and magistrate Andrew Richardso . found Ellis had 'established family life with his partner, . Miss Whiley, and their daughter', and that he was a 'fully integrated . member of British society'. Twisted: Philip Machemedze, one of Mugabe's torturers, has been allowed to remain in the UK under the Human Rights Act . They also found told the court that 'Kyra's well-being was best promoted by allowing . her to grow up in her own country, having a normal father-and-daughter . relationship with her father'. But . Miss Whiley told the Sunday Telegraph that Ellis - who is also known as . Steve, Trapstar Ellis and Steve Da trapper - has never contributed . money towards Kyra's upbringing. 'He wouldn't be welcome in my home,' Miss Whiley said. 'Even when I've asked him for money for Kyra he's said no because he thought I would spend it on myself. 'I think he's only ever bought her one birthday present – and . he was in prison at the time so he had to get his friend to buy it for . her. 'He always makes a point of flashing his cash so that I can see how . much money he's got – even though he won't give me any of it for Kyra.' In her ruling in the most recent appeal, Senior Immigration Judge Davin Gill . said the lower court found that Ellis had been 'put under considerable . pressure to co-operate with a drug dealer'. Judge Gill said that . he had been given no help after repeatedly telling his probation . officer about threats being made to Miss Whiley and her mother. Ellis claimed he owed a drug dealer £2,000 and had been intimidated into . committing another crime because of the debt. Miss Whiley said: 'He's got a new girlfriend . now who is pregnant so that makes it even more unlikely that he'll be . deported. 'I think it's . an outrage. He's been in jail three times now and he just keeps . reoffending so I don't understand why they can't get rid of him.' 'He thinks he's invincible. 'He's not a good person. He's always been in and out of trouble – even . when we went to secondary school together – but I hoped that when we had . a daughter together he would mend his ways. Visa trouble: Lydia Werrit, 88, faces deportation despite having a death warrant out on her head in Zimbabwe . 'Unfortunately he never did. He's never really gone out to look for a . job but that was probably because he felt that dealing drugs was easy . money. 'I don't think he'll ever mend his ways. He's been given countless opportunities but hasn't taken them.' Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said: ""This is another ludicrous case to try the patience of the public. 'The courts should not accept claims to family life without closely examining the evidence. 'It is very surprising that this claimant's story was accepted at face . value and it makes one wonder how many other similar cases there have . been.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We rigorously defended our decision to . deport this individual and we made it clear that he'd failed to provide . supporting evidence to show existing family life. Overruled: The Home Office failed in two attempts to deport Ellis, and their appeal was refused this summer . 'It's unacceptable that the Human Rights Act is being used to prevent removal of foreign criminals and immigration offenders. 'This is why we will change the immigration rules to prevent those . abuses and ensure a better balance with human rights and the wider . public interest.' Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who is campaigning to reform Article 8, said: 'This is a damning indictment of the system. 'Not only has another serious criminal defied deportation on spurious human rights grounds. On top of that, this case lays bare the institutional failings inherited from the last government. 'Lawyers milking the system, immigration officials failing to test his family links and judges overturning the public interest in deporting a convicted drug dealer and robber on the flimsiest of evidence. 'The case for fundamental reform is now overwhelming.' David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, added: 'Clearly there has been a systematic failure. We need to challenge every case fiercely on the facts, which has not happened here.'

"Arsenal will find it difficult to emulate the achievements of the 'Invincibles' side of a decade ago and win the Premier League title, according to former Gunners star Robert Pires. The Frenchman was part of the Arsenal side which went unbeaten throughout the 2003-04 campaign en route to winning the league. The current Gunners side lay sixth in the table on Sunday morning after their 2-2 draw against Hull the previous day, 11 points off the pace set by Chelsea, who remain on course to go unbeaten all season too, albeit with 30 games still to go. Abel Hernandez celebrates putting Hull City ahead at the Emirates stadium to continue Arsenal's poor form . Per Mertesacker and Mathieu Flamini were unhappy with Roger East's decision to allow Hull's first goal . When asked if Arsenal could win the Premier League title this season, Pires told Press Association Sport: 'It's very difficult. 'The current squad lacks the physical power the Invincibles team had in players like Sol Campbell, (Patrick) Vieira, Gilberto Silva and Thierry Henry. 'But in football, everything is possible. They have (the points gap) with Chelsea, but we can still win the league.' Pires, who left Arsenal in 2006, is currently playing with FC Goa in the Indian Super League - his first game with the club ended in a 2-1 defeat. However, it is a world apart from the pressures Arsene Wenger is under at the moment, as Arsenal gave away a first-half lead to Hull and then had to rely on a Danny Welbeck stoppage-time equaliser. Arsenal managed to earn themselves a point with Danny Welbeck's stoppage-time equaliser . Arsene Wenger was frustrated throughout the game, but Robert Pires says Arsenal fans should stick with him . This season promises to be an even tougher test to 2013-14, when Wenger overcame severe criticism over his big-money signings and tactics to win the FA Cup and end a nine-year trophy drought. Wenger recently celebrated 18 years with Arsenal, a testament to the club's support, and Pires wants the fans to continue doing so as well, saying: 'I understand that the fans want to win the trophy. 'But do not forget that Wenger built the Arsenal team. 'Of course, it is important to win the title. But I always believe in Wenger and in the team. Pires was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' team along with the club's record goal-scorer Thierry Henry . Pires says his side had more 'physical power' than Arsenal's current squad, who are 11 points off the pace . 'He spent a lot of money on the team because he always wanted a good team. But I think the fans should trust him and believe in him.' The faith for Wenger comes on both a footballing and a personal level for Pires, even if he does not consider himself worthy of following in Wenger's managerial footsteps just yet. 'Arsene Wenger is a very important person in my life,' World Cup winner Pires added. 'When the offer from ISL came forward I consulted with him, I explained to him the concept. He very positively said, 'Robert, go. If you are confident to play don't wait. You need to go'. The Arsenal boss is still 'a very important person in my life' says Pires, who is playing for FC Goa in the ISL . Alexis Sanchez was a bright spark for Arsenal in front of their fans, but even he showed his frustration . 'The job of a manager is very difficult. It's a tough job. At this point of time I don't think I'm ready to take up that role, maybe later sometime I might. 'Football is my passion and I can still play, so I decided to come back to playing football. 'If you have the passion, you need to play. Whether it's Arsenal or FC Goa, I am always up for a challenge.' Meanwhile, Ray Parlour echoed his former team-mates sentiment regarding Arsenal's prospects this season, claiming Arsenal are now competing for third or fourth place. 'I think Arsenal are fighting for third or fourth place,' Parlour told talkSPORT. 'You look at Manchester City and Chelsea and they're in a different league compared to Arsenal. 'They're so far above Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs. I think all these teams are fighting for two places, they're fighting for third and fourth. 'Chelsea grind out results. They're so clinical in the way they get results and Manchester City stand a great chance, particularly if (Sergio) Aguero can keep playing like that. He was fantastic (against Tottenham), absolutely different class. 'Those two teams are far apart from Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Spurs, so that's what Arsenal are left fighting for.'","Pires says current squad 'lacks the physical power' his side had .

"Saido Berahino has insisted strike partner Brown Ideye is a ‘great player’ and backed the Nigeria international to start scoring the goals his £10million price tag demands.

"U.S. military personnel are offering their services to Mexican drug cartels in exchange for payment in the form of cash and drugs. Following a former Army private's sentencing last week for carrying out a hit for the Juarez Cartel, experts are warning of the growing ties between Mexican drug cartels and U.S.-based gangs that infiltrate the military. Private Michael Apodaca's case is the latest example of a U.S. serviceman becoming involved in Mexican drug cartel activity. Infiltration: Gang members are infiltrating the Army as they seek to strengthen ties with Mexican drug cartels . Fred Burton, vice president for STRATFOR Global Intelligence, a geopolitical intelligence firm, told Fox News that some soldiers become corrupted by gangs after joining up to the Army, while others are gang members who enlist specifically for the specialized training. 'There has been a persistent gang problem in the military for the past six to eight years,' Burton said. Michael Apodaca, 22, was a private first-class stationed at Fort Bliss Army Base when he was hired by the Juarez Cartel to kill a member who had been revealed as an informant. Apodaca was paid $5,000 to shoot and kill Jose Daniel Gonzalez-Galeana. Last year, an Army sergeant and an ex-soldier were arrested in Texas after agreeing to a murder plot with men they thought were members of the Zetas cartel but were actually undercover agents. Sergeant Samuel Walker, 28, and former Lieutenant Kevin Corley, 29, who were stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, agreed to kill members of a rival gang for $50,000 and cocaine. Convicted: Former military men Michael Apodaca (left) and Kevin Corley (right) were both arrested for separate gang-related crimes . According to the case against him, Kevin Corley told the agents he could train 40 cartel members in 'room clearing, security and convoy security,' according to Business Insider. He also said he could recruit other members from his unit to the gang and steal military weapons. Murdered: Former cartel lawyer Juan Guerrero-Chapas was killed with suspiciously military-like precision earlier this year . Mexican cartels favor U.S. military personnel based along the southwest border for their ability to more easily pass back and forth across the border, as well as their weapons training and precision. Burton told Fox News that cartels value trained soldiers from the U.S., Mexico and Guatemala as sicarios - hit men. For U.S.-based gangs, joining the military is a way of strengthening ties with Mexican drug cartels to acquire drugs. In the most recent suspected case of military involvement in cartel activity, Juan Guerrero-Chapa, a former lawyer for the Gulf Cartel now living in the U.S. was gunned down. The shooting, in a Fort Worth parking lot, was carried out with the kind of precision that police suspect only someone with military training would possess. A task force including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security is investigating the killing. Gang members with training in combat and access to military weapons is a threat the FBI is monitoring. The FBI National Gang Intelligence Center had identified members of 53 gangs with members serving in or affiliated with the U.S. military as of 2011. Fort Bliss, Texas: U.S. gangs are strengthening ties along the southwest border with Mexico to increase drugs trade with cartels . For its part, the military has toughened its recruiting standards to try and prevent the infiltration of gang members among its ranks. An Army spokesperson told Fox News that anyone with gang-related tattoos is rejected for enlistment. 'A person like Michael Apodaca would not even be allowed to enlist today,' said Army Major Joe Buccino, spokesman for the Fort Bliss Army Base. 'We’re more selective than during the height of Iraq.'","Mexican drug cartels are recruiting U.S. military personnel as hit-men .

"Romany Gypsies are arranging illegal underage marriages in Britain - even offering thousands in exchange for eligible teenage girls. The traditional practice goes against the law in the UK, where the youngest one can marry is at 16, the age of sexual consent. A new documentary sees a Roma father relentlessly search for a teen bride for his 14-year-old son - even offering £3,500 for one 'popular' young girl. Scroll down for video . Shanko, the patriarch of one Roma Gypsy family, relentlessly searches for a suitable teenage bride . A reported quarter of a million Roma Gypsies now live in Britain, where some families continue to follow ancient codes. A new documentary follows two families from this growing diaspora who have recently emigrated from Hungary . and Romania to the UK. The new arrivals 'see themselves as different from the more established Gypsy and Traveller communities who have lived in Britain for generations' and refuse to adjust their behaviour to abide by . the laws of this country. They practise a conservative Gypsy code called Pachiv, which states the head of the family must always be obeyed and encourages marriage soon after hitting puberty. Filmmaker Ben Steele follows them as they try to find suitors for their youngsters for a Channel 4 documentary. The factual series, called The Gypsy Matchmaker, sees the patriarch of one family relentlessly search for a suitable teenage bride for his 14-year-old son.

Adrian, . who still attends school in Oldham, says his main priority is learning . Gypsy traditions passed down from his father in preparation for . married life. The documentary follows them as they visit an unsuspecting 15-year-old Romany girl called Esme and offer her grandmother £3,500 to secure her hand in marriage. Ben observes these deposits are indeed commonplace but weddings can also take place without money changing hands. However with other potential suitors interested in Esme, Sanko wants to ensure he 'wins her' for his son. Adrian's mother tells Ben about Esme: 'She . is a young girl. We'll train her. We won't beat her. In a few years' time she'll be a patient wife.' She has had little contact with Adrian aside from one dance at a Gypsy Ball and her grandmother, who no longer approves of early marriage customs, eventually refuses the offer. Sanko and Adrian continue to travel among a network . of Gypsy families, from Bradford to Bolton and ultimately to Hungary in . search of a girl to marry. There are complex family arrangements, . heated arguments and formal marriage proposals, including negotiations . in which the potential bride is just 13-years-old. Not good: Despite lying to the police, the girl is eventually taken into care - as are his own two daughters . In . Rotherham, patriarch Huko is responsible for a large clan, including a pregnant . 14-year-old girl living in an unlawful marriage with Huko's nephew. It's not long before the police and social services come knocking at the door with child protection concerns. Steele observes many Romany Gypsies who support and practice early marriage openly, thus breaking the law and falling into conflict with the authorities. While these families feel compelled to practice customs which are not only illegal but morally unacceptable in contemporary Britain, they do worry that authorities will take their children away.

"Click here for Grand Final match report by Martha Kelner . Sam Tomkins said he is in no doubt that impressive Wigan youngster Joe Burgess would flourish if he followed his lead and moved Down Under.

That’s the first time I thought he might be able to do something. ‘I’ve no doubt he’d be a success in the NRL, but he’s not even played a full season yet in the Super League so I can’t say when the right time to leave, or not, is.’ The 19-year-old scored the wining try for Wigan against Warrington in the semi-finals .","Wigan's Joe Burgess would be a success in the NRL, says Sam Tomkins .

"British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday is in danger of turning into a very damp squib after two more big names joined the list of absentees. Torrential rain turning the track heavy in places has convinced Kevin Ryan not to run French Derby winner The Grey Gatsby. Also out is Clive Brittain’s Coronation Stakes winner Rizeena. Unsuitable ground convinced Kevin Ryan not to run French Derby winner The Grey Gatsby . A combination of injury, end-of-season fatigue, alternative targets and unsuitable ground means Australia, Kingman, Kingston Hill, Slade Power, Sole Power plus Mukhadram and Taghrooda, whose retirements were confirmed on Monday, will also be absent. This is not what organisers dreamed when they created this end-of-season finale but it is certainly what they were warned might happen given Champions Day’s place in the calendar. The only 2014 Classic winner due to run is Richard Hannon’s 2,000 Guineas victor Night Of Thunder in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Clive Brittain’s Coronation Stakes winner Rizeena is also out of Ascot showpiece . Hannon has added Pether’s Moon to the Champion Stakes, one of seven supplementary entries now fancying their chances of grabbing a share of the £4million up for grabs. ‘The race is cutting up a bit and looks like something we should be having a go at,’ said Hannon. The testing ground will reignite calls for Ascot to look at ways of covering the course. Spokesman Nick Smith said: ‘We have had presentations from people with ideas but it isn’t straight- forward. It is a tentative but possible scenario.’","Heavy rain has convinced Kevin Ryan not to run The Grey Gatsby .

"The ‘People’s Open’ was Thomas Bjorn’s evocative description to sum up the raucous atmosphere that pervaded at Royal Liverpool in 2006. Now, on The Open’s return next week, one of the people has qualified to play. Nothing sums up the unique spot the tournament holds in our glorious summer of sport than the feelgood story of John Singleton. The 30-year-old makes his living driving a forklift truck in a resin factory some 10 minutes from Hoylake. At 4.30pm, he clocks off and makes his way down to Eastham Lodge golf club to practise. His dreams of making it as a pro have gone but there’s no trace of bitterness. ‘I was lucky to get the job I’ve got and I’m happy with what I’m doing,’ he said. Scouse proud: Local man John Singleton defied the odds to qualify for the 2014 Open . It was pregnant fiancee Lucy who persuaded him to try to qualify for The Open, with it being on the doorstep and all. Poor John took one look at the dilapidated state of his two wedges and decided there was no point turning up for qualifying at Hillside with them. So he borrowed a couple off his mate. At Hillside that blessed day there were 72 players chasing three spots. There was Matt Fitzpatrick, the gilded teenager who has just turned pro. Established European Tour men like Graeme Storm and Richard Finch. Young amateurs who do nothing else but play golf; hardened pros who make a living winning regional PGA events. Who shot the lowest score of the afternoon play? John Singleton. Who came through a nerve-wracking play-off following the scheduled 36 holes to earn his spot alongside Tiger, Rory and the rest? The  factory man. As he was driving to work last  Friday, Singleton spotted the mate who had lent him the two wedges. ‘We just looked at each other and burst out laughing at the craziness of it all,’ he said. ‘It’s every golfer’s dream to play in The Open and now it’s happening to me on my doorstep. It’s a bit overwhelming to be honest.’ To help get over the shock and awe, Singleton took a look around the course last week. At the magnificent wraparound grandstand at the 18th that is going to give this Open a carnival flavour. ‘I don’t think it’s going to hit me until I see the people in the stands,’ he said. ‘It’s just a dream come true.’ Loan star: John Singleton, 30, qualified for the tournament using a borrowed set of clubs . Singleton’s love of the game is such he . was due to have been a  volunteer marshall next week. Instead his job . inside the ropes will be the most glamorous one of all. No doubt the winner will come from the upper echelons of the game, just as it did back in 2006 when Tiger won. But it’s the John Singletons who make the event unlike any other major sporting occasion. The men who return to their day jobs but who can always say that for one week at least they rubbed shoulders with giants and played in The Open. Can I suggest those in charge of the qualifying criteria for the Ricoh Women’s British Open, which takes place at Royal Birkdale this week, have a rethink? Stephanie Meadow finished third on her pro debut at the US Open last month. Unfair: Stephani Meadows was forced to qualify for the British Open despite recent third place finishes . The brilliant 21-year-old from Northern Ireland followed that up by shooting a final-round 63 to finish third again in the Ladies European Tour’s flagship event on Sunday. One of those performances should have earned her an exemption. An equivalent performance certainly would have done so in the men’s game. Instead, she had to endure the rigours of qualifying yesterday. That’s just not right. Soothsayer: Graeme McDowell's prediction saw him win a second Alstrom Open de France . ‘What I need to do is shoot a 66 or 67 in the final round, because there’s a 76 lying in wait for any man out there.’ That was how Graeme McDowell called it on Saturday evening, after falling eight behind American Kevin Stadler at the French Open. The following day he shot 67 to Stadler’s 76 to not only defend his title successfully but display an enviable line in prophecy. Outside the usual summer staples, the highlights next year must be an Open at St Andrews and an Ashes Test match at Lord’s. And, to the considerable annoyance of the many who would like to watch both, they will clash. Clash: The 2016 Open at St Andrews will played at the same time as the Ashes Test match at Lord's . This will be the third time since 2009 this has happened but a clash with a St Andrews Open is particularly grievous. Who’s to blame?  Certainly not the Royal and Ancient, who announce the Open dates years in advance. I’m told Sky television, who hold the cricket rights, are culpable. Sky do so many good things when it comes to golf that it’s a shame they let themselves down with this harmful act towards the biggest event of all.","John Singleton has qualified to play at The Open at Royal Liverpool .

"Rarely can a more extreme hospital pass have been thrown in professional rugby union’s brief history than the one sent flying at Dai Young when he took over at Wasps three years ago. Promised the world by former owner Steve Hayes - or a new stadium and training facility at the very least -it soon dawned on Young that he had inherited rugby’s equivalent of a cut-and-shut job. Patched up, repaired but only just functioning, it took Young less than two months to realise the vision he’d been sold was in fact a nightmare as Wycombe Council unexpectedly refused planning permission for a new stadium and Wasps’ financial taps were turned off. Wasps celebrate their Premiership victory over Bath  as the club work to put the tough times behind them . Dai Young has had to deal with the move to Coventry . Within weeks, players were no longer being paid. Young himself went for three months without pay and even resorted to buying the team’s first aid tape on match-days while contributing to the cost of travel. Lesser men would have walked away. Young stood firm. ‘It was a low time,’ the 47-year-old former Wales and British Lions prop told Sportsmail this week. ‘The players knew things weren’t right but they probably didn’t know just how bad things were. When you don’t get paid for three months yourself and you’re paying for match-day tape and coach and bus journeys out of your own pocket - as well as being in a relegation fight -it’s not that easy to convince the players the club will come through it and find an owner. ‘It was hard to stick with the line that Wasps was too big to go out of business. You know all this is going on in the background but to a certain extent I had to try to mask it from the players a little. ‘I believed the club would come out of it although there were dark days towards the end when I was starting to think “this has gone on too long”. It was probably the first time in my rugby career when I felt out of control. ‘When I signed I didn’t realise the club were in such a bad state. But I’d like to put on record that I have absolutely no issues with Steve Hayes. I don’t for one minute think I was deceived. ‘But when the financial taps get turned off it’s hard. I never, ever thought about quitting but it didn’t take me long to realise I’d take on a bit of a suicide mission.’ To coincide with Wasps financial meltdown in 2011, the former Cardiff Blues boss also had to contend with a raft of injury- enforced retirements that saw Dan Ward-Smith, Steve Thompson, Joe Worsley and club captain Tom Rees unexpectedly call time on their careers. Lock Simon Shaw moved to Toulon while Riki Flutey also missed much of the season with injury. Miraculously, Young kept the club in the Aviva Premiership and over the past three seasons has nurtured an array of young talent which will surely develop into one of the country’s strongest squads with the extra investment set to flood in following the long-overdue arrival of new owner Derek Richardson. James Haskell and Goode pose at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry where Wasps will play their home games . Perhaps even more miraculously, Young never lost the dressing room. ‘People thought it was a bit of a throwaway statement for me when I said my biggest coaching achievement was keeping Wasps in the Premiership in my first season,’ said Young. ‘But we were on the point of bankruptcy and we had so many retirements.’ The announcement the club are set to move to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry following a protracted, multi-million pound purchse is still only 12 days old. But already there is a sense that even the diehard fans are beginning to accept the financial reality the club found themselves in at sharing Adams Park with Wycombe. ‘I understand the anger and frustration but we have a loyal bunch of supporters,’ said Young. ‘Once we’d explained, they were intelligent enough to accept they would rather Wasps existed in 20 years. I saw a quote “move or die” and that hit the nail on the head.’ Today, Young’s club are alive and kicking. The two-time champions travel to Dublin to face Leinster in their opening Pool 2 clash with a spring in their step following last week’s impressive Premiership win over Bath.","Dai Young has been in charge of Wasps for three years .

"Kell Brook insists he will win his first world title on Saturday night but is unsure whether he will KO American tough guy Shawn Porter ‘in the first round’ or battle his way to a decision ‘at the end of a dog-fight.’ The moment of truth is likely to arrive somewhere between those two extremes and the manner of it will probably depend upon how long Brook’s self-confidence holds up under the pressure of what he must expect to be the most exacting fight of his career. The incentive for both these young men ‘to go through hell’ is most eloquently expressed by Brook: ‘The winner will hold the keys to Fort Knox.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Shawn Porter's incredible blindfolded workout . Focused: Kell Brook is finally ready to challenge for a world title after 32 fights as a professional . All smiles: Brook travelled to America early to ensure he is fully prepared for Shawn Porter . Eyes on the prize: Brook is the underdog against Porter but fancies his chances of causing an upset . In the case of Sheffield’s successor to Prince Naseem Hamed, the biggest treasure chest awaits if he can lure Amir Khan into a battle of Britain by dangling a world championship belt in front of him. For Porter the mother-lode would be a mega-bucks fight with Mr Money himself, Floyd Mayweather Jnr, to which he would edge closer with an impressive victory over Brook. An alternative bonanza for either could come in Mexico, with Juan Manuel Marquez ready to keep a watching brief at ringside this weekend while saying: ‘If I do decide to box again I want it to be against the winner of this fight.’ All very tempting but neither Brook nor Porter would be wise to get ahead of themselves. Their duel for Porter’s IBF welterweight title comes at a watershed moment in their careers. Both are coming into their prime, Brook at 28 and Porter at 26. For the victor the only way is up. For the vanquished it will be back to the small halls. The jury is out on each of them. So much so as far as the public are concerned that in order to come to close to filling the StubHub Centre in California promoters Golden Boy are having to stack the under-card with the high-profile likes of heavyweight knock-out sensation Deontay Wilder. The balance of risk is more or less even. Champion: Porter will need to be at his best against Brook to retain his title in California . Confident: Porter knows he must see off Brook if he is to earn the right to face Floyd Mayweather . Home comforts: Porter will defend his title on American soil on Saturday night . Porter has nothing to gain from putting his growing reputation on the line against a Brit who offers a genuine threat but is barely known in the in US. He says: ‘I have always been the one under pressure on my way to the top and I know I’m again the one with most to lose.’ Brook has to surrender home advantage to get the world title shot he regards as long overdue and America is never an easy place to secure an away win. He says: ‘I have to raise my game the way Lloyd Honeyghan did to win his world title over here when everyone expected him to lose to Donald Curry,.’ And raise his game he must if he is to emulate the Ragamuffin Man’s feat of 28 years ago. Many saw it as a sign of weakness when Brook was reported to have asked his handlers if he was ready to challenge Porter, even though title bids scheduled previously had been scuppered by injuries to himself and Devon Alexander. But if he did put that question, it was valid. Brook has been fed a diet of mostly moderate opponents so while he is talented and does pack a meaty uppercut he remains untested at the highest level in his 32 wins to date. Porter, by contrast, warmed up against increasingly hotter rivals. Now his 25-fight unbeaten career has been brought nicely to the boil by a final eliminator against Julio Diaz, his successful world title challenge to Alexander and a first defence against Paulie Malignaggi – all three of whom are former two-time champions. It is that elite experience which is missing from Brook’s resume and it is less than encouraging to recall that he only just held on for a squeaky victory over American journeyman Carson Jones as he faded towards the end of their first fight. Untested? Brook's biggest win came against former world champion Viacheslav Senchenko . Down and out: Porter was in a destructive mood when he stopped Paulie Malignaggi . Brook is a couple of inches the taller but Porter, a trimmed down light-middleweight, is a compact, powerful, heavy-punching athlete with, curiously, an equally long reach. The Ohioan is also as effective at close quarters as they both can be at long range. Brook says: ‘Porter is good but was not keen to take me on and has had to do it or be stripped of the title.’ Porter says: ‘I’ve wanted this particular fight for a long time. It is the ideal fight for me to prove myself as a top boxer and fighter.’ So who wins? I would be more of a British optimist if Brook had been tempered against better opponents. He has a chance but if he is going to pull this off away from home and with nagging doubts about his stamina then perhaps he had better do so sooner, like the first round, than later, via the scorecards. Brook vs Porter is live on Sky Sports this Saturday . Once again, good luck to Frank Maloney in a new life as Ms Kellie Maloney and freely admitting: ‘There is still a lot to overcome.’ And well done to Lennox Lewis for sending his best wishes to the manager who guided him to the world heavyweight title.","Kell Brook faces IBF world welterweight champion Shawn Porter .

"Toulon coach Bernard Laporte insisted Steffon Armitage’s proposed move to Bath is finished after picking him for Sunday’s opening European tie. But while the Frenchman was adamant he would not let his highly talented back-row return to England to further his World Cup ambitions, he conceded that the club’s bosses could still do a deal behind his back. If Armitage does play against Scarlets in the European Champions Cup on Sunday, he will be cup-tied for the rest of the competition and Bath would walk away. Steffon Armitage (centre) is held back by Toulouse defenders playing for Toulon in the Top 14 last weekend . Toulon coach Bernard Laporte is adamant that Steffon Armitage will not be returning to England . Laporte said: ‘I am not exactly sure where this story about Steffon really started but for me in sporting terms it is over, finished. ‘I have spoken to Steffon and he knows the situation. He will start at No 8 for us on Sunday. That is my decision. As for what the club presidents are doing, I do not know. That is their business. My business is to make Toulon win.’ Armitage, 29, has been in talks with Bath for the past week about a deal which would allow to play in next year’s World Cup, but the West Country club are loath to pay the reported £240,000 transfer fee to release him from the last two years of his contract. With talks stalling, and the RFU apparently unwilling to upset other Aviva Premiership clubs or undermine the competition by providing financial support to Bath, Toulon on Thursday maintained a hard-line stance. The back row forward was named European player of the year as Toulon won the Heineken Cup last season . Armitage made five appearances for England while at London Irish in 2009 . Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal drives a notoriously hard bargain and could be playing a game of brinkmanship in an attempt to squeeze as much commercial capital out of the deal as possible. So, while Laporte is understandably keen to retain a player who has excelled for the defending European champions over the past two seasons, the decision may be taken out of his hands. RFU rules, introduced to dissuade English-qualified players from signing lucrative contracts in France which would weaken the Premiership, mean only players playing in England can be selected for the national side except in exceptional circumstances. And with next year’s World Cup looming, Armitage is desperate to be involved. ‘Of course, I know what the World Cup means for players,’ Laporte added. ‘If you have to go, you go. That is what I spoke with Stuart (Lancaster) about on Wednesday. I wanted to know precisely what the situation was. In fact, it is nothing to do with Stuart. The policy of the English union is exact. You have to be in England to play for the national team.’ The back row forward looks set to stay at Toulon and not play for England at next year's World Cup . Bath’s back-row injury crisis has left Carl Fearns, Francois Louw, Matt Garvey and Alafoti Fa’osiliva all sidelined, while Leroy Houston is suspended. Complicating matters further are Armitage’s expected wage demands. He is currently on a deal worth more than £300,000 at Toulon and, with Bath already close to the Premiership’s salary cap, it is unclear how they would accommodate him within budget. With this Sunday’s clash with Scarlets appearing to be D-Day for the proposed deal, it looks increasingly unlikely they need to worry about that.","Steffon Armitage looked set for move to Bath from Toulon .

"Royal Ascot is one of the most popular events in the sporting and social calendar, with an annual attendance of nearly 300,000 people. Dressing properly is part of the experience, at least it was until recent years when standards started to slip and spaghetti straps, mini skirts and - horror upon horrors - fascinators began showing up in the Royal Enclosure. In a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event the bosses at Ascot introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course, employing a fleet of well-dressed fashion police to enforce the rules. Naturally, the dress code assistants' own outfits will be under strict scrutiny and today model Amber le Bon unveiled the chic new designs that will be worn by the women policing the racegoers outfits. Amber Le Bon heads up a group modeling the outfits of Royal Ascot's 2013 Dress Code Assistants . Bosses at Ascot introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course, employing a fleet of well-dressed fashion police to enforce the rules . The silver shift dresses and matching jackets are designed by high-end High Street brand Hobbs and they adhere to the rule banning strapless or spaghetti straps, and that ladies hems must be of 'modest length'. The jacket is finished with a slim bow belt and the outfits at today's photocall were completed with nude heels and elaborate yet elegant hats that organisers hope will set the tone for the event. The specially trained team of Dress Code Assistants was first introduced in 2012. Available outside the racecourse to help . visitors with any last minute concerns over their attire the women also . manned the ticket stiles to make sure that nobody wearing the wrong . sort of clothing entered the stands without first being made over in . accordance with the new rules. The assistants will be wearing the grey outfits, designed by Hobbs, and be outside Ascot to offer advice and provide minor corrections if necessary as they did last year . Model Amber seemed to be enjoying the day, which saw photographers and crowds gather to catch the first glimpse of the Dress Code Assistant's outfits . Alongside a brochure detailing the dressing-up dos and don'ts of the sporting festival, Ascot organisers have launched a video to remind racegoers how long dresses ought to hang and what sort of top hats gentlemen should be wearing. They claim that this is is to keep the ancient tradition of the annual race alive and to make sure the atmosphere remains the same. At the heart of Royal Ascot is the . Royal Enclosure which, like the tradition of the Royal Procession, dates . back to the early 1800’s and the reign of George IV. Within this area, a . strict dress code of morning dress for men and formal day wear for . ladies applies, including no fascinators or thighs on display. Guests . in the Grandstand Admission are required to wear smart dress with gentlemen required to wear a shirt . and tie and ladies a hat or fascinator. No branded clothing or strapless outfits are allowed. And . the final admission area, the Silver Ring is the least formal enclosure . with no applicable dress code, designed for those people looking for a . more relaxed day out. The 2013 dress code guide provides example outfits for both men and women: Three piece suit by Reiss, shirt by Jaeger, shoes and tie by Boss Selection (right) Dress by Nanette Lepore, clutch by Gina, shoes by Zoe Jordan and fascinator by Philip Treacy (left) Charles Barnett, Chief Executive at . Ascot Racecourse said: ‘We were delighted with the reception of the new . dress code last year, which endorsed our decision to make such changes.

"Swansea boss Garry Monk feels his Sunderland counterpart Gus Poyet deserves huge credit for returning Ki Sung-yeung back to south Wales a more mature footballer and rounded person. Ki spent last season on loan at Sunderland after being told he was not part of former Swansea manager Michael Laudrup's plans and helped the Black Cats reach the Capital One Cup final as well as win their battle against Barclays Premier League relegation. Sunderland boss Poyet wanted to make the loan deal permanent but Monk persuaded the South Korean midfielder that his future lay in Swansea after he succeeded Laudrup and Ki has since signed a new four-year contract at the Liberty Stadium. Ki Sung-yeung made a big impact for Sunderland last season - but his future is now at Swansea . Garry Monk (left) has lauded Gus Poyet's handling of Ki during his loan spell last season . 'Gus deserves big credit, he gave him a good role in the team and highlighted what Ki had, but we knew that anyway,' Monk said ahead of Swansea's league trip to Sunderland on Saturday. 'I knew that myself after playing with him and seeing him in training and that's why I made it clear for him to stay. 'But he's matured as well as a footballer and a human being. He understands himself a bit more now of what he needs to do to get the best out of himself and what players need from him as well.' The 25-year-old has been one of Swansea's stand-out performers during their impressive start to the season and repaid Monk's hard work during the summer when he made getting Ki back on board one of his main priorities. 'I spoke to him a lot in the summer and told him he was the type of player I wanted with us,' Monk said. The South Korean midfielder was a key player as Gus Poyet and Sunderland escaped relegation . Swans' defender Neil Taylor (right) admits he was baffled Ki was allowed to go on loan to one of their relegation rivals . 'He is an important part of how I want to go with this team and he just needed to feel that and that he was wanted. 'I explained that very much to him and from that point onwards he was pretty much sold on it. 'His commitment in training every day has been great and in the games he is producing some good football.' Monk refuses to criticise his predecessor Laudrup over his decision to send Ki out on loan last season, but Swansea defender Neil Taylor admits the Welsh club's dressing room were baffled by the fact he was playing for one of their relegation rivals at the time.

"Toby Alderweireld insists Southampton must not get carried away following their 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland. The 25-year-old is currently on loan at St Mary's from Atletico Madrid and is now an integral part of the most miserly defence in English football. It was in attack where Southampton made the headlines on Saturday as they dished out a mauling to a Sunderland side who were simply blown away by the forward players on show for the hosts. Ronald Koeman's Southampton side continued their impressive run of form by crushing  Sunderland 8-0 . The Black Cats did little to help their own cause as Santiago Vergini hammered in an own goal that will live long in the memory to put Southampton on their way to their biggest ever Premier League win. Player of the month Graziano Pelle continued his impressive start to the campaign by tapping in a second before Jack Cork added a third before half-time. A second own goal from substitute Liam Bridcutt made it four, then Pelle completed a brace before Dusan Tadic, Victor Wanyama and Sadio Mane also got on the scoresheet. Sunderland were unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty at 2-0 when Fraser Forster came off his line and appeared to bring down Steven Fletcher - although referee Andre Marriner was unmoved. Steven Fletcher is closed down by Jose Fonte, Morgan Schneiderlin and Dutch defender Toby Alderweireld . The rout means Southampton hold on to third spot in the Barclays Premier League table with manager of the month Ronald Koeman continuing his impressive start to life in English football. Stoke are the next visitors to St Mary's next weekend but Alderweireld, who lifted the Primera Division title with Atletico last season, knows the players need to remain grounded as they look to build on such a memorable result. 'Of course we can be very satisfied with the result,' he said. 'The second half was much better than the first but we have to keep calm. It is only three points and next week will be tough. 'We can be happy but from tomorrow we have to be focused on Saturday because it is a big day again. It can change very quickly in the Premier League.' Alderweireld, on loan from Atletico Madrid, warned his team-mates not to get carried away with the result . The start to the season has seen Koeman and his players defy the odds after it was suggested they would struggle having lost the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers over the summer. But in players like Alderweireld, as well as Pelle and Tadic who both impressed once again on Saturday, Koeman has remodelled his squad into a side who look capable of continuing such form. Mauricio Pochettino led Saints to a best-ever eighth place Premier League finish last year before departing for Tottenham but Alderweireld feels that can be beaten this year. 'I think better than last season,' the Belgium international answered when asked what Southampton should aim for this campaign. Summer signing Dusan Tadic jumps into the arms of Italian forward Pelle after scoring his side's sixth goal . 'If we can make that step and finish in a better position that last season we can be happy. 'I knew a lot of players that Koeman brought and knew we had a good team. I signed here for a year to play good football and play with good players. Wes Brown was replaced at half-time by Bridcutt but had already seen enough to know that Sunderland were nowhere near good enough. Although the 35-year-old felt that Fletcher should have been awarded at 2-0, the former Manchester United man confessed it would not have papered over the cracks. 'We didn't manage to get the penalty and we are disappointed with that decision,' he said. Substitute Sadio Mane completes the rout by scoring his side's eighth, and final, goal of the afternoon . 'Had that been given it might have changed the game, he could have been sent off too, especially if we had put the ball in the net from it. 'It would have been 2-1 at the time. But it was not good enough today. There were not enough of us alive. To concede eight says it all really. 'There were too many of us off our game. We might have had 10 minutes, but then they got a goal, got a second goal and a third. We needed to come out and show some fight and we didn't do that. 'It has to be a one-off, you can't do that in the Premier League. You get punished like that if you do. We have to put this behind us as quickly as possible.'","Southampton crushed Sunderland 8-0 at St Mary's .

"Former England manager Terry Venables wants Premier League managers to stop dictating national selection of players and says footballers should not turn their back on international call-ups. Liverpool have been in the spotlight recently after reports suggested manager Brendan Rodgers asked England boss Roy Hodgson to rest Raheem Sterling for England's Euro 2016 qualifying fixture against Estonia last week. Rodgers denied those claims and played down any club-versus-country row, but writing in the Independent on Sunday, Venables said Hodgson should not have to consult Premier League managers when selecting players. Raheem Sterling has been at the centre of a club vs country row this week after being rested against Estonia . Former England boss Terry Venables says that international football must come above the club game . Brendan Rodgers has denied that he asked Hodgson to rest Sterling during last week's Euro 2016 qualifier . 'I am sick of Premier League managers dictating who should, or who shouldn't, play for England,' writes Venables. 'Country comes before club, end of. 'There are no conversations to be had with club managers trying to stop England picking their players. 'When I became England manager I never experienced any player saying to me: thanks for picking me boss but I don't fancy it this time, maybe next game perhaps,' wrote the 71-year-old. 'If I had, then that player would never, ever, have been part of my England squad again, no matter how important he could have been. Sterling, at just 19, has already become a key player for both Liverpool and England . The star was left out of the Estonia game aftercomplaining of tiredness following a match with San Marino . 'To be selected for England is the ultimate accolade. I was the first footballer to play for England at every level possible - schoolboy, youth, amateur, under-23 (as it was then) and full. 'Can you imagine how proud I feel today just thinking about that? Nothing would have stopped me playing in any of those games.' Venables, who guided England to the semi-finals of Euro 1996 where they were knocked out on penalties by Germany, said he never came under pressure from managers during his two-year spell in charge. Venables led England to the semi-final at Euro 96 as says club interference makes the England job impossible . 'I never tolerated a situation where managers were telling me publicly who I could, or could not, select,' the former Tottenham Hotspur manager added.

"Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Here, in the latest extract from his fascinating book, he charts the sad demise of one of the nation’s favourite footballing sons. 15-year-old Kenny Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding... then signed for Celtic! Harry's team of the Seventies . Harry's team of the Eighties . There should be an inquiry into Paul Gascoigne one day. How did it end up like this? How, when we could all see the trouble ahead, was his decline allowed to happen like a slow-motion car crash? What could we, as people in football, have done to help him? The people I would want to hear from, right at the start, are his agents, his accountants, his lawyers, all the people that made fortunes from the industry that was Paul Gascoigne. What do these people actually do to help when the money stops coming in? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp say Gazza can have a job at QPR anytime . Paul Gascoigne is a shooting star (left) in a madcap pose before becoming an international icon after Italia 90 . Gascoigne and Harry Redknapp pictured this summer  on the south coast, where the pair both live . Gascoigne was snapped in a distressing scene as he is escorted to an ambulance two months ago . 1985–1988 Newcastle United . 1988–1992 Tottenham Hotspur . 1992–1995 Lazio . 1995–1998 Rangers . 1998–2000 Middlesbrough . 2000–2002 Everton . 2002 Burnley . 2003 Gansu Tianma . 2004 Boston United . I’m sure there are one or two agents who care beyond that final payday, but a lot of them are only interested in the loot. Who is looking after Paul Gascoigne now? At one time you never saw him without an agent by his side. Now he’s out there, it seems, totally alone. In one way they are lucky that he became an alcoholic, because that way everyone blames Paul for his problems and forgets that he had a legion of experts who were supposed to look after him. Sadly, in terms of numbers and accounts, footballers just don’t know what day it is. Some footballers earn £300,000 a week, and who has the financial knowledge to deal with that? Unless the people around them are honest, they are vulnerable, an easy target. I’m not exempting myself from this; as my court case (in 2012, for tax evasion, of which he was cleared) showed, I’m near the top of any list for naivety. I just don’t think the advice is there, even now — ‘this is what to do with your money, this is how to avoid going skint’. For all the advances in other areas of the game, I still think players are left to rely solely on their agents. All young players should be familiar with Gascoigne’s story — first as an inspiration, because he was such a great footballer, but then as a warning of how quickly the fun can turn to tears. Gascoigne rides a tackle from West Ham's Paul Ince in 1987 during his breakthrough spell at Newcastle . Gascoigne leaps after his 35-yard free-kick put Spurs ahead against Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final . Teddy Sheringham pours water down Gascoigne's throat to mimic the infamous dentist's chair incident in 1996 . Lazio's supporters display banners lauding Gascoigne in 2012 after an emotional return to the Eternal City . Jimmy Five Bellies and Gazza were close pals . I’ve been lucky. I’ve always been in a position where I’ve earned really good money over the years, as a manager. Paul earned great money as a footballer — but then it was over. He was a recovering alcoholic by the time he was at Everton, and he was only 34 when he played his last game for that club. I remember crying with laughter one night with Walter Smith, who managed him at Rangers as well, telling stories about the stuff he used to get up to. Some of it was madness. He used to go out with his air rifle and would give his mate Jimmy Five Bellies £100 to use his backside as a target. He would send Jimmy up the end of the range, get him to drop his trousers and bend over, and every time he got hit on the bum he would give him £100 compensation. He hit him on the same place twice once. Walter says you could hear the screaming from the centre of Glasgow — and also Gazza laughing about it. He once played a wicked trick on Ally McCoist, who had just bought a big and expensive new car. Gazza had been fishing, so he hid a giant salmon in Ally’s motor, under the floor of the boot where the spare wheel goes, then put it all back exactly as it was. It drove Ally mad — it was the height of summer and his car stank of rotting fish. Gascoigne's time at Ibrox was never short of incident, as these adoring fans will testify following his signing . Gascoigne smirks at a streaker while playing in Nigel Winterburn's testimonial at Highbury in 1997 . Eventually, he took it back to the dealer and they found it. What he didn’t know was that Gazza had a pal who was a mechanic and he had hidden a second one in the engine somewhere it couldn’t be found. Every time Ally put his air conditioning on, he got another blast of decomposing salmon. Gazza was hyperactive, that was the problem. He couldn’t sleep. In the 1991 FA Cup, Portsmouth played Tottenham in the fifth round. Terry Venables, the Tottenham manager, was at breakfast on the day of the game when one of the players approached him, very worried. ‘Gazza couldn’t sleep,’ he said. ‘He’s been up since 3am playing squash.’ ‘Thanks,’ said Venables, ‘but who was he playing against?’ It turned out to be Paul Walsh. Terry dropped Walsh from the team, but started Gascoigne — knowing one had the metabolism to handle it, and the other would be dead on his feet. Tottenham won 2–1, and Gascoigne scored both goals. He had an energy level that was berserk — but what a footballer. Gascoigne impressed at Fratton Park, scoring twice, despite a marathon squash session the night before . Paul Walsh, Vinny Samways, Paul Allen, Gascoigne and Nayim record Tottenham's FA Cup final song . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Considering his talent, some of the moves he had at the end of his career were heartbreaking. Kettering Town, Gansu Tianma near the Gobi desert in China and Boston United. There is a history over the years of players with great talent finishing up in these career dead-ends. George Best was with Brisbane Lions and Nuneaton Borough; Jimmy Greaves played with Chelmsford City, Barnet and Woodford Town. They were not making the right decisions, not getting the right advice. When Paul was at his peak before the bad knee injury, there was no one like him. In the modern game, I’d put him alongside Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero, because he had flair that was almost South American. All the top teams are searching for that figure now, the individual who can change the game. Modern defences are so packed, defensive midfields so organised, that everyone is searching for a Gascoigne-type to unpick that lock. We all loved him, whatever his weaknesses as a person. I see Paul reasonably often because he lives near me now, and he always stops and has a chat. He’s as good as gold really. Gascoigne celebrates with a team-mate after his debut in 2003 for the Chinese B-league team Gansu Tianma . Gascoigne was manager of Conference side Kettering for an ill-fated 39-day spell in 2005 . He’s someone I would love to find a spot for somewhere, if I could. If he actually wanted to come and do it, I’d like to help, get him working with the youth team, get him back in the game again. Yet, really, shouldn’t Tottenham be prioritising that now? I can understand that clubs might not want him to coach academy kids — there could be worries about parent reaction because of his run-ins with the police — but surely there is a way of finding work for him? Would he turn up? I would hope so. The 1980s was the decade in which football was touched by tragedy. Who can forget what happened in Heysel and Hillsborough? These were terrible times. Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest team of the Eighties . On the pitch it was the last decade before the Premier League, and probably the last time there was room to fail in football. This was also the last decade when the prizes were spread around, particularly the FA Cup. Between 1978 and 1988 there were nine different winners of the FA Cup in 11 seasons; in the next 19 years, 17 of the FA Cup finals were won by four clubs (Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea) with Tottenham and Everton — who probably make up the big six — accounting for the other two. Everybody fielded their best team in the FA Cup then, too. You didn’t toss the cup off, because relegation wasn’t the death sentence it has become now. Looking at the other teams I’ve picked for this book, this is the last one that does not include a foreign player. The Premier League was coming and everything was about to change.

"The October international break is always an ideal time to take a step back and reflect on the state of the Barclays Premier League. Seven rounds of fixtures have been completed and the table is starting to settle into some kind of shape. Some players have been in scorching form while others are still searching for their rhythm. So to find out who has been on top of their game, we commissioned the EA Sports Player Performance Index (PPI) - the official player rating index of the Premier League - to pick the best XI of the season so far. The EA Sports Player Performance Index was created to settle debates about who is the most complete footballer in the Barclays Premier League. It uses six measures to generate an overall Season Index, which is then used to rank all the players. The six indices are: Winning performance (players receive more points if their side is winning), Player Performance (points are awarded for shots on target, tackles, saves etc), Appearances (points for minutes on the pitch), Goals, Assists and Clean Sheets. CLICK HERE FOR A FULL EXPLANATION . GK - Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Season Index: 86 . The Belgium No 1 has made the transition from La Liga - where he had spent the last three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid - to the Premier League look effortless. Courtois has made 14 important saves in his seven league appearances to date, helping Chelsea establish a handy early lead at the summit. Thibaut Courtois has made the transition from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea look effortless . DEF - Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea) Season Index: 116 . Regular watchers of Chelsea will appreciate that Azpilicueta deserves as many plaudits as Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard this season. An absolute bedrock at the back for the league leaders, the Spaniard has won 24 tackles, made 31 clearances and 14 interceptions in his seven appearances so far. Cesar Azpilicueta has been a rock at the back for the Barclays Premier League leaders so far this season . DEF - Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea) Season Index: 138 . The highest-rated defender on the EA Sports Index, ever-present Ivanovic has been pretty much unbeatable at the back as Chelsea soared to the top. He has shown a strong all-round game, with not only 28 clearances and 18 tackles won, but also 16 crosses and 11 dribbles forward. Ivanovic has also scored twice, against Burnley on the opening weekend and in the 6-3 win over Everton. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic muscles in to Stoke's Marko Arnautovic at Stamford Bridge . DEF - Gary Cahill (Chelsea) Season Index: 112 . Another key ingredient in Chelsea's early season success has been Cahill, who has continued his good form from last season. The England centre half, also an ever-present in the side, has cleared the ball 42 times and made eight blocks. Gary Cahill makes one of his 42 clearances in Premier League matches this season . DEF - Ryan Bertrand (Southampton) Season Index: 128 . Completing the Chelsea flavour at the back is Bertrand, currently out on loan at Southampton. The left back has been integral in the positive run of results that sees the Saints third in the standings. In line with Ronald Koeman's approach, Bertrand has been flying down the wing, attempting 29 crosses in the seven games to date. He also found the net in the 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers. Ryan Bertrand, on loan at Southampton from Chelsea, has been very impressive so far this season . MID - Eden Hazard (Chelsea) Season Index: 188 . As he showed on Sunday with that outstanding display against Arsenal, Hazard is a man for the big occasion. The Belgian has been exceptional so far this season and is the highest-rated midfielder in the EA Sports PPI. He has attempted 325 passes in his 595 minutes on the pitch so far, and 296 of these were accurate. Hazard has also contributed two assists and scored twice - against Leicester in the second match of the campaign and that penalty in the London derby last weekend. Eden Hazard is the best-rated midfielder in the Premier League during the first seven matches of the season . MID - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) Season Index: 176 . It has been a delight to see Fabregas back in the Premier League with his metronomic passing, but his creativity was the main reason Jose Mourinho moved so swiftly to secure his signature ahead of old club Arsenal in the summer. The Spanish maestro has contributed seven assists so far, more than anyone at Chelsea in the whole of last season, and has accurately completed 511 of 569 attempted. Cesc Fabregas has excelled with his passing since returning to the Premier League with Chelsea . MID - Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea City) Season Index: 168 . The Icelandic midfielder has been given a new lease of life since swapping Tottenham for Swansea over the summer and his all-round contribution has been noted in the PPI. Swansea are fifth in the table, exceeding almost all expectations, and Sigurdsson has had a hand in seven of their 10 goals. He scored on the opening day win at Old Trafford and hasn't looked back. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates his opening day winner for Swansea against Manchester United at Old Trafford . MID - Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Season Index: 172 . It may have been a disappointing start to the season for Liverpool but Raheem Sterling is one of the few in the team to be maintaining last season's standards. His direct running style is highlighted by 38 dribbles, while he has successfully completed 172 of 187 passes. Most importantly, Sterling has scored three Premier League goals and added two assists. Raheem Sterling tries to pick his way between two West Bromwich Albion players in last weekend's game . FWD - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Season Index: 166 . Champions City have been caught out a little by Chelsea's scorching start to the season but Sergio Aguero has been at the forefront of everything good they've done. The Argentine has scored five goals in the league and looked a constant menace when Manuel Pellegrini's team are on the attack. Sergio Aguero celebrates his goal for Manchester City in their 2-0 win at Aston Villa last weekend . FWD - Diego Costa (Chelsea) Season Index: 287 . It won't surprise you to learn that Costa stands head and shoulders above everyone else in the PPI. Indeed he is the only one to have surpassed the 200-point mark. Adapting to life in the Premier League with consummate ease and feeling no pressure from his £32m price tag, the Spaniard has nine goals to his credit already, propelling Chelsea to the top. Diego Costa celebrates after scoring against Arsenal on Sunday, his ninth goal for Chelsea .

"Click here to see how Scotland manged to find the net for their freak opener and all of the other stats that matter from Ibrox . Progress doesn’t need to be pretty all the time. Thanks to an untidy own goal Scotland secured vital victory from the first game for two years in which meaningful tournament qualification points were fully expected – and, mercifully, delivered. Scotland utterly bossed the 110th ranked team in the world and fully merited a more emphatic margin of success from their play that was pleasing on the eye for much of the action. But a clinical presence deserted the team, particularly Steven Naismith on his return to Ibrox, and Gordon Strachan was grateful for an inside job. The errant leg of Akaki Khubutia proved to be the scrappy lock-breaker on 28 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down for post-match comments from Strachan and Ketsbaia . Shaun Maloney (right) drives the shot from the edge of the box that led to the own goal opener for Scotland against Georgia . Scotland: Marshall; Robertson, Russell Martin, Hanley, Hutton; Maloney, Brown; Anya, Naismith (McArthur 80'), Morrison; Steven . Subs: Gordon, Chris Martin, Reynolds, Whittaker, Bannan, Greer, Burke, Darren Fletcher, Dorrans, Gilks, McArthur, May . Booked: Morrison, Naismith . Goal: Khubutia (OG) Georgia: Loria; Lobjanidze, Khubutia, Dato Kvirkvelia (Okriashvili 45'), Solomon Kvirkvelia; Daushvili, Grigalava, Kazaishvili (Chanturia 80'), Kankava, Papava (Dzaria 70'); Gelashvili . Subs: Kvaskhvadze, Tsintsadze, Ananidze, Chanturia, Migineishvili, Dvalishvili, Okriashvili, Ebralidze, Khmaladze, Dzaria, Papunashvili, Rekhviashvili . Booked: Grigalava, Daushvili . Referee: Miroslav Zelinka (Czech Republic) So, Scotland did not require a finishing touch from within the improving ranks to keep the momentum of Strachan’s regime moving towards a serious shot at reaching Euro 2016. There has been plenty of praise from racking up a six game unbeaten run, finding a way to win friendlies and vastly superior displays. This was about precious points with the pressure turned on. All three were deservedly earned in a 13th game without defeat for the national team at the home of Rangers. The cranked up expectations did not persuade Strachan to stand by the man with the greatest experience of big match demands. Darren Fletcher, with only 25 minutes of club football since his substitution in Dortmund, started on the bench as Scott Brown stepped in to skipper the side on his international return from injury. The Manchester United midfielder could not have complained. This was a typical Duracell day from Brown. He was the driving force, tempo setter and refused to accept the ball dropping into visiting possession, always scrapping successfully to win it back. That trademark work from Brown was just one aspect of Scotland’s play that ensured Georgia were kept on the back foot virtually from pillar to post. He’s no fan of pernickety UEFA procedure when points are on the line, either, as demonstrated by his brief spat with the fourth official as a jersey change took a split second or two longer than he liked. Echoes of ‘Broony, Broony’ were only ever heard at Ibrox at the Celtic end. They were all round the stadium here as the seconds – slowly, obviously - ticked down on victory and the second half nerves were wiped away. Andrew Robertson was also excellent on his return from an enforced absence and preferred to Steven Whittaker on the left. The scoring hero from Germany, Ikechi Anya, formed a three-pronged support act to Steven Fletcher with Shaun Maloney on the right flank and Naismith in behind. Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney pounces on the loose ball and puts the full forces of his right boot's laces through it . Maloney's powerful shot is saved by the right arm of Giorgi Loria (left) but bounces off the calf of Akaki Khubutia (No 6) Georgia's Saba Kvirkvelia (left) and Scotland's Steven Fletcher watch as the ball trickles over the line for 1-0 . As if in slow motion the ball crosses the line at Ibrox as Steven Fletcher (left), lurking in the goal area, begins celebrations . Scotland celebrates the goal with Maloney, although it was later confirmed to be an own goal . Scotland players crowd around Maloney after they take the lead in their Group D Euro 2016 qualifying match . All the early play was exclusively in the Georgian half and it was the 15th minute before David Marshall’s penalty box even saw the football in a visiting attack. The only imprint on the game made by sole striker Nikoloz Gelashvili was on the thigh of Alan Hutton. Gelashvili, who plays in Albania for Flamurtari, was fortunate not to see yellow for his recklessness. On the one occasion Grant Hanley lost his bearings with Gelashvili, early in the second half, the striker skied his angled effort. Indeed, Marshall could have prepped for the contest by watching Joe Hart in what amounted for action against San Marino on Thursday night. After a period of adjustment to the surprise of facing a back four, Scotland started to drag Georgians from their preferred posts midway through the first half. Corners and crosses from both sides gave Giorgi Loria woes and their disorganisation in the face of this onslaught told in the as the patience and probing produced the opening goal just before the half-hour. A handful for the Georgia defence down the left, Hull City's Andrew Robertson (right) puts pressure on Giorgi Papava (left) Scotland fans were in fine voice at Ibrox Stadium, with many donning the customary tartan as their side took on Georgia . Unsurprisingly, it was one of Robertson’s delightful deliveries that created the chaos and Loria could only force the ball out to the feet of Maloney on the edge of the area. The Wigan schemer scored a screamer in a 2-1 win in Macedonia a year ago, but this was a goal he looked reluctant to claim as his third Scotland strike. That dubious honour landed with luckless Khubutia. Loria found a touch to initially divert Maloney’s drive from goal but he pushed on to Khubutia and the ball dribbled over the line. Maloney reacted as if he’s caught the ghastly bug that now compels players not to celebrate a goal against their former employers. As relief rippled through the Ibrox stands at breaching the defensive blockade, the Tartan Army were more than happy to make up for Maloney’s low key reaction. With a confidence-boosting lead, Scotland’s play found a flow and Strachan loved what he saw. If only there was a goal at the end of the good work, he could have relaxed just a little. Fletcher’s link play had teed up Anya in Germany and his touch and hold-up class were seen to great effect. Scotland's Ikechi Anya is brought down by Georgia's Murtaz Daushvili in a spirited affair in Glasgow . Daushvili made no mistake if halting the progress of Anya was his objective with this sliding tackle . A smart exchange with Maloney smoothed Naismith’s passage through on the keeper but Loria sped out to smother the ball as the Everton attacker took a heavy touch. It wasn’t the only time that Naismith was unable to bring his scintillating early season form to the table but, as ever, his tireless work rate and determination never gave the Georgian defenders any peace. Scotland were ferocious in attacking the visitors from all angles before the break but the relentless approach failed to secure a second as a rasping Brown shot was deflected inches wide and Maloney got wayward with two hits from distance. Temuri Ketsbaia made an interval switch, introducing Tornike Okriashvili on the left in an effort to give Alan Hutton more to think about than his rampaging runs down the flank. However, Hutton robbed the substitute to scamper towards setting up a golden chance for a Scotland second on 62 minutes. He slipped Naismith in behind the last line and while the movement was ace, the right foot shot made across goal made life too easy for Loria’s considerable frame and the ex-Rangers man was denied once again by the big keeper. Anya hurdles yet another sliding from Georgia's defence, this time Solomon Kverkvella . Scotland's James Morrison has a chance to make it 2-0 with eight minutes left on the clock but Giorgi Loria is well positions to save . Scotland skipper Scott Brown embaces Shaun Maloney after they secured maximum points from their Group D clash with Georgia . Naismith’s frustrations continued. Anya and Fletcher combined, with the latter’s creative back heel into the path of Naismith setting up another sight of goal. As Loria braced himself for a test, Naismith screwed a low shot well wide. Naismith, with goals against Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, made way for James McArthur with 10 minutes remaining. Georgia’s second half set-up was built to menace more on the break. Their forays up the park fizzled out. Ibrox did gasp in horror as the ball dropped to Irakli Dzaria 16 yards out on one such counter. The substitute’s low dig was dire, five yards wide. Scotland wanted a settling second but Morrison was denied by a combination of Solomon Kverkvelia and keeper. And just to increase the nervous tension, the fourth official’s hapless fiddling with the substitute board kept the celebrations on tap as Chris Martin’s late introduction was subject to delay. The Derby man coaxed a couple of free kicks out of the Dutch referee and held up play long enough for there to be no further dramas. A win essential to establishing a foundation from which to launch a bid to beat off Poland and Republic of Ireland for an automatic qualifying slot is in the books. Now for Warsaw where a repeat of another 1-0 win from only seven months ago will do just fine.","Gordon Strachan's Scotland claimed their first win in  Euro 2016 qualifying Group D against Georgia .

"CLICK HERE to see Harry Redknapp's  team from the Eighties. Where are Gazza's friends now he needs help? I drove Kenny Dalglish to West Ham training . For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his all-time team of the Seventies. Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest team from the seventies . PHIL NEAL: MAN FOR ALL SEASONS . He is still the most decorated English footballer in history, but holds a record even more fantastic than that. Between October 23, 1976, when he played in a 1–1 draw away at Leeds United, and September 24, 1983, a 1–0 defeat at Manchester United, Neal did not miss a single Liverpool game in any competition: a run of 417 consecutive matches! Phil seemed indestructible. Phil Neal managed to not miss a single competitive game from October 1976 until September 1983 . Neal, pictured holding the European Cup in 1978 alongside Terry McDermott (left) and Kenny Dalglish (right) remains the most decorated English footballer in history . Ian Rush smiles (centre) as Neal celebrates scoring in the 1984 European Cup final against Roma . JOHN ROBERTSON: THE ROUGH DIAMOND . Bill Shankly said he could pass the ball with the accuracy of a snooker player potting the black, but John was on his way out at Nottingham Forest when Brian Clough and Peter Taylor arrived. He was the most unlikely professional footballer anyone had seen. He was overweight, smoked liked a trooper and, in Clough’s words, was living out of a chip pan. Yet Clough persevered with Robertson and won two European Cups. John Robertson was the most unlikely professional football anyone had seen, accoring to Redknapp . John Robertson, pictured with goalkeeper Peter Shilton, celebrates winning the European Cup in 1980 . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . KEVIN KEEGAN: SWEPT ALL BEFORE HIM . What a player - and what a career. Brilliant at Liverpool, brilliant in Germany with Hamburg, won the European Cup, twice European Footballer of the Year - he turned into a truly amazing player. I know he took something Bill Shankly said to heart. ‘Even if I was a roadsweeper,’ Shankly told him, ‘I’d have the cleanest street in town.’ And that was Kevin’s attitude to football. Kevin Keegan was twice named 'European Football of the Year' and was a truly amazing player, says Redknapp . Former Liverpool frontman Keegan poses with the European Cup outside his hotel in Rome back in 1984 . Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Liam Brady and Pat Jennings all made it into Redknapp's Seventies XI . The front cover of Redknapp's new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, which is released on Thursday .

"Premier League stars from the past, present and future helped Belgium secure a resounding 6-0 victory over lowly Andorra in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Brussels. In their first competitive encounter since their World Cup quarter-final loss to Argentina, Belgium struck the woodwork three times in 20 minutes, opened the scoring with a  penalty from former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne on the half-hour mark and then ripped apart Andorra's defence. Tottenham forward Nacer Chadli  doubled the lead with a half-volley and a fine lay-off from Divock Origi, who will play for Liverpool next season, for De Bruyne's second made it 3-0 at halftime.

Subs: Josep Gomez, Sonejee, Moreno, Peppe, Rodrigues, Garcia Renom. Booked: Ayala, Vieira, San Nicolas . Referee: Serhiy Boiko (Ukraine) Origi turned one defender and beat another for number four, before Dries Mertens bagged two, a header after a superb long ball from Radja Nainggolan and a shimmy and sharp shot to make it six. Before a sell-out crowd in Brussels, the hosts rested Eden Hazard in the hope that his bruised toe would be fully recovered in time for Monday's tougher qualifier against Bosnia. They did, however, field Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois just five days after he suffered a head injury in a collision with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez in the Premier League, although he barely had a touch. Belgium were to have opened their qualifying campaign with a trip to Israel, but the match scheduled in September was postponed due to the Gaza conflict. The visitors, ranked 203rd in FIFA's ranking of 208 nations, won one match and drew two in qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, but have lost every competitive match since, although were only narrowly beaten by Wales last month.

Wales took the group lead by one point over Cyprus, Israel and Belgium after holding Bosnia-Herzegovina to a 0-0 draw in Cardiff in their second game. But with its constant pressure and free-flowing moves, Belgium showed they will be the team to beat in the group. 'That was fun. A beautiful victory,' said De Bruyne after Belgium scored as many goals in one game as during the whole World Cup. 'It was a packed house, so we had better perform,' he added. The easy victory came without playmaker Eden Hazard, who was protectively kept on the bench with a stubbed toe. Another Chelsea star, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, was on the pitch for the whole game despite suffering a head injury in a collision against Arsenal last weekend. He did not have to make a save.

"Barcelona still support Catalonia's push to vote on secession from the rest of Spain despite warnings that independence will mean the club's exclusion from La Liga. Barecelona were 'one of the first institutions to declare it was in favour of the right to decide,' a statement read on Friday. Catalonia's regional government wants to hold a non-binding referendum on independence on November 9. A Spanish court has suspended the vote to rule on its legality. Pro-Catalan independence protesters gather in front of Barcelona City Hall . Barcelona's Camp Nou has been a focal point of support for Catalan independence . On Tuesday, the president of the Spanish football league, Javier Tebas, said Barcelona and the other football teams in the north-eastern region would be excluded from Spanish competitions if Catalonia became a separate state. Tebas said the country's sports law entitles only one non-Spanish territory - Andorra - to legally participate in the league or other official competitions. If Catalonia were to gain independence, the law would have to be altered to let Catalan clubs, including Espanyol and second division teams Girona and Sabadell, back in. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema said he wanted Barcelona in the league, which is historically dominated by the two rival clubs. 'We hope that Barca stays in the league,' Benzema said. 'We are two great clubs, Madrid and Barcelona. We need Barcelona in the league.' The independence movement has a vast majority of support in the region . Secessionist sentiment has surged in Catalonia in recent years during Spain's economic stagnation, and Barcelona's Nou Camp has become a focal point of the movement with pro-independence cheers a common feature during matches. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique recently attended a massive rally in Barcelona clamoring for the November 9 vote, and former coach Pep Guardiola is an independence supporter. Polls show that while most of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia support the vote, only around half favour ending centuries-old ties with the rest of Spain. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola is a known supporter of the independence movement . Gerard Pique is one of several Barcelona stars to have come out in support of independence . In April, the Spanish parliament voted down a request by Catalonia to hold the referendum, but regional lawmakers went ahead with plans and formally called the referendum last month. The Spanish government argues that such a vote would violate the Spanish Constitution's stipulation that only the national government can call referendums on sovereignty, and that all Spaniards are entitled to vote in such a ballot. Legal experts expect the court to strike down the regional Catalan law that provided the legal backing for the referendum.","Catalonia plan to hold non-binding independence referendum in November .

"Telmo Zarra, the holder of the all-time La Liga goalscoring record who sadly passed away in 2006, would have wanted Lionel Messi to surpass him, says the legend's daughter. Zarra scored 251 league goals for Athletic Bilbao between 1940 - 1955, but could soon see his record broken by the Argentine phenomenon who has netted 249 times for Barcelona. Carmen Zarra claims that her father would have loved Messi not only for his obvious talent but for the way he conducts himself on and off the pitch.

Speaking to Catalunya radio, she said: 'My father would have liked Messi to beat his record. We love Athletic in my house, but I'm sure that my father would have loved Messi, because he seems to be a very noble person both on and off the pitch. His behaviour is exemplary.' Zarra's daughter discussed comparisons between Messi and his Real Madrid nemesis Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 190 league goals himself. 'Give me Messi every day. I much prefer Messi as a player and as a person, without wanting to go into any further details. 'I don't want to say any more. I prefer how he behaves on the pitch. I see Messi playing on the pitch and I like to follow him. Cristiano Ronaldo is dangerous in front of goal, he's very strong, and he's to be feared, but in terms of who I like, I like Leo more'. Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra would have wanted Messi to beat his long standing record . Carmen Zarra has admitted she prefers the Argentine to Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo (R) Zarra went on to say that the prospect of losing the record does not sadden her family, although she would have preferred an Athletic player to break it . 'We aren't angry, not at all. The record has to be beaten one day. My dad hung up his boots in the 53-54 season,' she said, . 'Almost 60 years have passed since then. It's time for someone to beat the record. I won't lie to you though, I would have loved an Athletic player to do it'.","Telmo Zarra scored 251 league goals for Athletic Bilbao between 1940-50 .

"Roy Hodgson's England squad have flown out to Tallinn as they prepare to face Estonia on Sunday in a Euro 2016 qualifier. The squad head to Estonia hoping to maintain their 100 per cent record in qualifying Group E following the 5-0 thumping of San Marino on Thursday evening, when Jack Wilshere caught the eye with a man of the match performance. According to former England and Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour, Wilshere is wasted playing for Hodgson's side at the base of the diamond.

Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka chat away as they board the plane out to Tallinn in Estonia . The 22-year-old was deployed in the untested role of holding midfielder against Switzerland last month, earning mixed reviews as the Three Lions secured an impressive 2-0 win in Basle. Wilshere returned to the role for a portion of Thursday's 5-0 victory over San Marino, picking up the man of the match award despite failing to get on the score sheet. The Arsenal midfielder may well again be used at the base of the diamond when England continue their European Championship qualifying campaign in Estonia on Sunday, although Parlour believes he better utilised elsewhere. Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was one of five Gunners to feature for England on Thursday . Striker Danny Welbeck scored England's third goal as Hodgson's side beat San Marino 5-0 on Thursday . 'I really believe his best position is more of an advanced midfielder,' the former England international told Press Association Sport. 'His game is best when he is doing those little one-twos around the penalty box. 'He knows exactly when to give it, he holds onto it enough and he does those driving runs forwards - I think that is Jack Wilshere at his best. 'I always think you've got to be playing on a regular basis in that regular position if you're going to be playing for your country. Roy Hodgson has got to make a big decision. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere picked up the man of the match award against San Marino at Wembley . Former Gunner Ray Parlour believes Wilshere is wasted playing the holding role for England in the diamond . 'Certainly I believe Jack Wilshere's position is more advanced and Roy will have to look into the further we get into the group and obviously in two years' time in the European Championships. 'Who plays there, I don't know. It is a situation where there is a big decision as to who play there, but at the moment I'd like Jack further forwards, around that penalty box, creating chances.' Wilshere was one five Arsenal players involved against San Marino at Wembley - a match which saw teenager Calum Chambers make his full debut. The 19-year-old had very little to do in that match but his performances since making a £16million move to the Gunners has impressed fans and pundits alike. Five Arsenal players featured against San Marino on Thurday, with Oxlade-Chamberlain coming off the bench . 'He has been absolutely superb,' Parlour, speaking on behalf of England lead sponsor Vauxhall, said. 'He has been a great signing for Arsene Wenger, another good youngster in the side. 'He gives Wenger a headache as to what is his best position. It is all about learning his trade, he is still a young lad. 'It won't harm him if he plays centre-half or right-back at the moment. You learn a different sort of way to play. 'Right now I think he'll be a better right-back. He just needs a little bit in the last third and to stop the bookings.'

The former Liverpool frontman, who announced his retirement from international football last week, posed for a picture at the start of the match with his young trio decked out in 'Kuyt' shirts.

"Poland stunned World Cup winners Germany 2-0 on Saturday to earn their first ever victory over their neighbours and take control of Euro 2016 qualifying Group D. Arkadiusz Milik put them ahead with a well-timed header in the 51st minute and Sebastian Mila added another late in the game to hand the hosts a memorable victory against bitter rivals Germany after 18 previous failed attempts. Poland, who had scored once in their previous six competitive meetings and had lost 12 of 18 games against either Germany or West Germany, now go top of Group D on six points, as many as Ireland.

Referee: Pedro Proenca (Portugal) Wearing the black and red striped tops they had last worn during their 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the World Cup semi-final in July, Germany had none of their usual sharpness. The Germans, playing in the stadium where they lost 2-1 to Italy in the Euro 2012 semi-final, were made to work hard against a solid Polish backline in front of a fiery 57,000 crowd. Towering central defenders Kamil Glik and Lukasz Szukala also made sure to eliminate any aerial threat from Mats Hummels, playing his first game for Germany since the World Cup final. The visitors, missing half a dozen starters including Bastian Schweinsteiger and Marco Reus, had their best chance in the 38th minute when Mario Goetze floated a cross to the far post but winger Karim Bellarabi, on his debut, fired wired. With Poland tiring towards halftime, the Germans carved out several more good chances but neither Thomas Muller twice nor Bellarabi could find the back of the net. But the hosts stunned Germany five minutes after the restart with Milik heading in a pinpoint Lukasz Piszczek cross. As expected it turned out to be a one-sided second half with Germany attacking and the Poles waiting to hit back on the break. Germany substitute Lukas Podolski shook the crossbar with his first touch of the ball before Mila sealed Poland's win when he tapped in from a Robert Lewandowski assist in the 88th minute.

"The news of Mesut Ozil's injury has worsened Arsenal's injury crisis in midfield as they push for silverware this season. The German international has been ruled out until the start of next year with a knee injury, joining fellow midfielders Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey on the treatment table. With the Gunners' injury crisis mounting we asked Arsenal fan site Gooner Talk who Arsene Wenger should sign in January to add depth and quality to the FA Cup holders' midfield. Arsenal's depleted midfield is in desperate need of a new addition following the news that Mesut Ozil has been ruled out until early 2015. Huge amounts of pressure have been heaped on the likes of Jack Wilshere, a player who himself has found himself on the treatment table for over 20 months in the last three years. Fellow midfield stars Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky will also need to manage their own injury problems and maintain a level of consistency if the club are to mount a genuine challenge for trophies this season. But who will be Arsenal's missing piece in the jigsaw when the January transfer window reopens? Paris Saint-Germain's pass master Yohan Cabaye is the man Arsene Wenger should sign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pogba, Giroud and Cabaye try scoring from behind the goal (ARCHIVE) PSG midfielder Yohan Cabaye has been a £12million target of Arsenal's in the past . Cabaye (right) moved to the French giants in a £19million deal from Newcastle in January . The midfielder's (left) qualities would be an asset to Arsenal as they challenge for the silverware . 28-year-old Cabaye isn't a 'man mountain' or 'Vieira type' player that all the pundits suggest Arsenal need, but he does bring a mix of defensive and attacking qualities which are missing from the current squad. He was the subject of a £12million bid from Arsenal the summer before he moved to the Parc des Princes from Newcastle in January. The France international admitted his frustration earlier in the week at not being given regular game time by boss Laurent Blanc. 'Am I completely happy? To be honest, no.', admitted Cabaye. 'It is a new situation for me, but I don't complain. It is the first time I haven't played regularly for my club. Arsenal's record-signing Mesut Ozil has been ruled out injured until early 2015 . The German international (left) has a partial lateral collateral ligament tear in his left knee . Jack Wilshere (bottom left) has been blighted with injury problems since breaking through at Arsenal . 'Do I sometimes miss England? Yes. Sometimes I think about it, but I immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction.' Wenger is a known admirer of Cabaye's abilities and there are several reasons why he should consider launching a loan bid for the midfielder in January. Cabaye is a versatile, deep-lying playmaker able to orchestrate attacks from deep positions and he would be perfect player to breach opposition defences while the injured Ozil is on the sidelines. A potential loan deal would suit both clubs down to the ground and with Cabaye being cup tied in the Champions League, all of his focus would be on the Premier League, where he played 79 times in two-and-a-half seasons for Newcastle. Cabaye (right) has admitted his frustration at being overlooked for a starting place in the PSG first team . Cabaye (right) has Premier League experience already after a successful two-and-a-half years at Newcastle . The 28-year-old made 79 appearances for the Magpies where his displays made him a fan favourite . When Arsenal played Newcastle at St James' last season, Cabaye was one of the best players on the pitch, posing problems for the Gunners' defence with his accurate set-pieces and long-range efforts towards goal. And Wenger's side, who have scored just 14 times in four seasons from corners, need a player like Cabaye who can deliver pin-point passes, break up play and spread the play for forwards Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sanchez. Cabaye, who racked up two assists and six goals for Newcastle in his final six months at St James' Park, would provide much-needed tenacity, creativity and experience in an injury-plagued squad which is in desperate need of quality players.

Kris Boyd has been spared a two-match ban after the head-butting charge laid against the Rangers striker was ruled not proven. The Ibrox frontman was issued with a notice of complaint by new Scottish Football Association compliance officer Tony McGlennan after clashing with Hibernian defender Jordon Forster last month. But he has now been cleared to play after the judicial panel decided there was not enough evidence to suspend the 31-year-old during a Hampden hearing.

Tunisian Mohsni - who appeared to argue with his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at half-time - was cited for swinging an arm at Fontaine after the Hibs defender knocked the ball out of his hands as he raced back to the halfway line following Nicky Law's 55th-minute consolation strike.

"Mike Ashley's dramatic bid to oust Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace could thwart an initial £16million proposal being tabled by an alliance of potential investors including Dave King. A statement from former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham – two figureheads of the investment group – confirmed last night they have been in detailed discussions with the Ibrox board. Sportsmail believes their proposal involves an up-front investment of around £16m – close to the current market value of the club - in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue. That would see them take control of the boardroom, with further investments then staggered to move closer to the £30m-plus King has previously stated it will take to restore Rangers. Mike Ashley is flexing his muscles with regards to Rangers, and is putting investment in the club at risk . ‘We confirm that we are in discussions with the Board regarding a proposal to provide the Club with a funding package to be provided by like-minded individuals including Dave King,’ said a statement from Murray and Letham. ‘The discussions should remain private and confidential and we will provide more details in due course.’ The potential success of those talks has, however, been thrown into serious doubt by Ashley’s bid to remove Wallace and ally Philip Nash as directors. Both are perceived as being favourable towards the plan the King group are putting forward. Ashley raised his stake at Ibrox to 8.9 per cent last week and is now seeking an extraordinary general meeting at which a resolution to axe Wallace and financial expert Nash would be voted upon by shareholders. Rangers were last night assessing whether the request from the Newcastle United owner was ‘properly constituted’. Should it be deemed valid and an EGM ballot take place, the board have vowed to fight Ashley’s motion. Rangers CEO Graham Wallace (right) has been targeted by controversial billionaire Ashley . The move has been described by one source close to Ibrox as a ‘full-fronted attack’ on the only two members of the board with previous experience of running football clubs – Wallace through his time as chief financial officer at Manchester City and Nash via spells at Liverpool and Arsenal. It also provides clear evidence that Ashley will fight to have an influential say in the future of Rangers as he seeks to protect his commercial interests. His Sports Direct firm already have retail contracts in place, while he also owns – but has yet to activate – naming rights for the stadium. Ashley has amassed an estimated £4billion from his business interests and would seem to be confident of landing the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders for his proposed shake-up. Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board at Rangers, has previously spoken of his support for Ashley’s greater involvement. He carries the voting rights for a 26.15 per cent chunk of Ibrox shares. A spokesman for Easdale would only say that he was watching the latest development ‘with interest’ but the backing of his voting block would see Ashley move within 15 per cent of his target. Ashley currently owns 8.9 per cent of the Scottish club, but is interested in increasing that stake . Hedge fund Laxey Partners are the largest single shareholder at Rangers with a 16.3 per cent stake. Non-executive director Norman Crighton is their representative and approved the Stock Exchange statement which said the board was ‘united’ in its support for Wallace and Nash. However, observers will recall Laxey effectively switching sides during the boardroom battle that eventually ended in victory for the incumbents at the club’s previous AGM. This year’s AGM must take place before December 31, but Ashley’s decision not to wait for that meeting could be viewed as a bid to cut off the King group at the pass. The Londoner declined to invest in last month’s stop-gap open offer that raised £3.13m. However, he then more than doubled his stake with an £850,000 purchase from fund managers Hargreave Hale – a decision which kept his money away from a Rangers board battling another imminent crisis. The Ibrox cash reserves are expected to run dry before the end of the year. Rangers currently sit second in the Scottish Championship, six points behind Hearts . It’s understood Ashley held talks with the Rangers board about providing a loan prior to the open offer. Those discussions reportedly broke down over a demand to include trademark rights as a condition. Closing off King could, though, leave finance from Ashley as the clearest option left available to Rangers. In terms of purchasing shares, the tycoon is currently limited to a 10 per cent stake at Ibrox through an agreement struck with the SFA as part of their rules on dual ownership of clubs. There could be an application for the board of the governing body to consider raising that limit, provided it was backed by a detailed business case. Responding to the EGM demand from Ashley, the Rangers board said yesterday: ‘If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course. ‘The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A further announcement will be made shortly.’","Dave King and alliance of potential investors tabled £16million offer .

"Organisers have no intention of changing the dates of next year's African Cup of Nations even though hosts Morocco called for a postponement of the finals because of fears over the Ebola virus. But the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said on Saturday it would meet the Moroccan government next month, sending a high-powered delegation to discuss the issue in Rabat led by its president Issa Hayatou. The African Cup of Nations will go ahead next year say tournament organisers despite Ebola virus fears . The host nation's government made a shock announcement on Friday, saying it wanted the 16-team tournament from January 17-February 8 postponed following a report by its health ministry into the possible spread of the virus.

"Former Chelsea boss Ruud Gullit has revealed that the feud between Robin van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has resurfaced, and it's damaging Holland's squad. The Dutch legend claimed the pair's relationship has been strained ever since the 2010 World Cup, and said old problems came to the surface in Holland's recent 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Kazakhstan.

'There has been irritation between them since the 2010 World Cup in South Africa,' Gullit told The Mirror. 'It was simmering at Euro 2012 and it all exploded. The problems have far from disappeared. 'Huntelaar was mouthing off again against Kazakhstan and his old confrontation with Van Persie surfaced straight back up.'

"Before the match, Ally McCoist denied his position was bombproof and it required a spectacular missile from Lewis Macleod to stop yet more flak being aimed in the direction of the Rangers manager. Macleod’s overhead strike — as good as you’ll see in any league all season — arrived early and, despite a high quota of chances at both ends, was enough to see the Ibrox club maintain their six-point distance from Championship leaders Hearts. Defeat last Monday night had brought McCoist’s position into question and, had Livingston displayed the same assurance in front of goal as Hibernian, the fortitude of the Rangers boss’s tenure may indeed have been put to the test. Lewis Macleod's stunning overhead kick was enough to secure a Rangers win at the Energy Assets Arena . Lewis Macleod (left) celebrates his goal with Rangers team-mate Nicky Clark . Rangers' Macleod pumps the air after his match-winning goal against Livingston in the Championship .

Subs not used: Robertson, Praprotnik, Grant, Burchill . Booked: Mullen 63, Glen 67 . Rangers: Simonsen, Foster, Zaliukas (McGregor 45), McCulloch, Wallace, Aird (Templeton 73), Law, Black, Macleod, Clark, Boyd (Daly 65) Subs not used: Smith, Faure, Shiels, Robinson . Goal: Macleod 8 . Booked: Wallace 7, Macleod 60, . Referee: Stephen Finnie . Attendance: 5,924 . Equally, the mysterious boardroom machinations at Ibrox might prove a continued source of security for the manager. Last week’s headline news saw Mike Ashley increase his holding to 8.9 per cent but the Newcastle United owner made his investment outwith the recent open share offer, thus denying the club working capital — and quite possibly the cash reserves that would be required to fulfil severance obligations, should they be required. For now, McCoist continues to plod on and, if Rangers lack the momentum that keeps Hearts rolling on at the top, they just about recovered their balance to edge out a Livingston team that left the field with their share of regret at missed chances. Rangers’ starting line-up featured five changes; those who survived Monday’s 3-1 defeat could consider themselves fortunate. Bilel Mohsni was the one obligatory change, courtesy of a retrospective two-match ban offered by the SFA after he hit out at Hibs defender Liam Fontaine. A bandaged Livingston captain Jason Talbot challenges Rangers' Kris Boyd . Rangers manager Ally McCoist looks on during the Scottish Championship match at the Energy Assets Arena . Darren McGregor, Steven Smith, Arnold Peralta and Dean Shiels were all dropped with Macleod, Richard Foster, Fraser Aird, Nicky Clark and Mohsni’s replacement Marius Zaliukas given the chance to impress. One theory attached to Rangers’ ascent through the divisions is that it has occurred without the need for any real tactical masterplan from McCoist and his staff. It’s certainly true that you cannot coach the sort of natural ability utilised by Macleod. A heart complaint limited the exciting midfielder’s involvement during the team’s League One campaign but this was a strike to set everyone’s pulses racing. Rangers goalscorer Lewis Macleod battles with Livingston's Michael McKenna . Livingston's Craig Sives is checked by the referee after receiving a heavy blow to the face . Credit in the first instance to Aird, who pressed Livingston midfielder Keaghan Jacobs deep into his own territory where he conceded possession. As the home team attempted to clear their lines and restore a high defensive line from the throw, Ian Black returned the ball high towards the back post. Everyone else had raced out but Macleod, having checked he was onside at the point of delivery, remained in situ and adjusted his feet for the most acrobatic of finishes — an overhead volley that would have graced any occasion. Had Livingston displayed even half of Macleod’s conviction they might have taken something from the match. Danny Mullen had squandered a chance to draw first blood when he lost composure with a clear sight on goal and scooped his shot high. Former Hearts player Gary Glen was also weak with a first-time effort although he couldn’t have been warmed up, having been forced into action as a replacement for Craig Sives after the tall defender had been stretchered off after taking a Nicky Law shot full in the face. Having started as the better team, the home side were penned in towards half-time and Sives’s block was not the only last-gasp intervention — skipper Jason Talbot twice denied Kris Boyd and Kyle Jacobs stretched to thwart Aird in the act of shooting. Kris Boyd (left) battles with Livingston's Kyle Jacobs during the match . Rangers manager Ally McCoist (second right) and assistant Ian Durrant (right) applaud the goal . The case of Boyd gets curiouser by the week. Having scored 22 goals for Premiership side Kilmarnock last season, he was expected to blitz the Championship but has laboured and remains goalless after eight starts. One moment just after the break summed up his season to date. As Foster drove towards the byeline the striker made his trademark move to the penalty spot and prepared for the cut-back. When it duly arrived, he missed the ball completely with his once deadly right boot. Eventually, McCoist’s patience gave way and so did Boyd, for Jon Daly. Rangers still had enough chances to wrap up the game before enduring a nervy close. Lee McCulloch had a shot pushed over by Darren Jamieson and Clark blasted over after being provided with an open goal chance by Lee Wallace. By the end it was Livingston asking the more serious questions. Jordan White came close with a low drive but it was Kyle Jacobs who caused panic among the Rangers support. First he drove a long-range effort into the side-netting and then climbed to head an effort that required Black to knock off the line. Livingston protested furiously that the ball had crossed the line. McCoist simply breathed a sigh of relief.","Rangers were well-beaten by Hibernian on Monday and Ally McCoist's side came into the game under considerable pressure from fans .

"Luckless Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara has suffered a new setback in his attempt to return from a knee injury that had kept him out since March. The 23-year-old has partially torn ligaments in his right knee - the one he initially injured  - in training and requires surgery to rectify the problem. 'What can I say?

"Neil Lennon accused fourth official Amy Fearn of being ‘a bit pedantic’ after his first management experience in English football ended with a rare win for Bolton and a red card. The Northern Irishman was sent to the stands for leaving his technical area in the 83rd minute of the 1-0 win at Birmingham. Lennon had already been warned by Fearn for racing down the touchline after Matt Mills’ first-half winner and was later dismissed by referee Mark Haywood when he tried to select a penalty taker following Darren Randolph’s late foul on Craig Davies.

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila has declared himself to be ‘calm’ about the contractual situations of his squad ahead of the January transfer window. Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that new Bolton Wanderers boss Neil Lennon plans to raid his former club for Kris Commons in the New Year. The midfielder’s deal expires at the end of this season and the 31-year-old has not always been a first-pick under Deila. Celtic boss Ronny Deila is confident of keeping the likes of Virgil van Dijk at the club . But although talks between the player and the club have not yet led to him signing an extension, Deila remains certain that Celtic will hold onto their best player and emerge from the next window stronger than they enter it. ‘We have good control in everything we do. I am calm about that,’ Deila stated. ‘As I said, it is football, you never know what might happen, or what kind of bid will come in for your players. ‘It is too early to say what will happen in January. We are thinking more about what we are going to do and how we are going to make our team stronger. Every window is going to be important if we want consistency and to be always improving.

"Rangers boss Ally McCoist praised his players after Saturday's triumph over Livingston ensured they have now gone two calendar years without an away league defeat. The Ibrox outfit have romped to both the Third Division and League One titles since being thrown out of the Scottish Premiership. And their record on the road has been a vital factor in that, with 32 wins and just four draws at Montrose, Stirling, Dunfermline Athletic and Alloa. Rangers manager Ally McCoist saw his side extend their unbeaten away spell to two years on Saturday . The Light Blues were last beaten on their travels in a league fixture on October 6, 2012 when they fell to a shock 1-0 reverse at Stirling Albion in the Third Division. Rangers rounded off their second year of flawless away results after Lewis Macleod's stunning overhead winner handed them a 1-0 win at the Energy Assets Arena. McCoist - relieved to see his side back to winning ways after Monday's humiliating home defeat to Hibernian - told the official Rangers website: 'It's an outstanding record and I'm delighted with that. Looking at the fact we've won 32 of the 36 games, it says a lot for the players we've got in our dressing room.

The defender suffered a knee problem and was able to play on until half-time before he was replaced by Darren McGregor. The former Hearts centre-back has been selected in the Lithuanian squad for the games against Estonia and Slovenia after helping his country beat San Marino in its opening match. McCoist added: 'It's difficult to gauge and we'll take a look at him again in the morning but I'd be doubtful he'll be playing in midweek. 'It looks a sore one and he's sitting there strapped up with an ice pack on it. We'll be better placed to know where we are tomorrow.'","Rangers beat Livingston 1-0 with goal from Lewis Macleod .

"As the Steffon Armitage transfer saga played out this week, another English No 7 was conducting business in his own rough, tough, meticulous manner that could yet see him oust national captain Chris Robshaw ahead of the World Cup. Will Fraser still doesn't possess a full England cap. A cruel run of injuries has prevented the Watford-born 24-year-old from showcasing his skills on the highest stage, where most believe he belongs. But he is fit again and as desperate to play for his country as at any stage in his injury-chequered five-year professional career. Will Fraser of Saracens receives the Aviva Man of the Match award after the victory over Harlequins . Chris Robshaw is hoping to keep hold of his England shirt in spite of competition for his position . 'There's a massive desire to play for England,' Fraser said at Saracens' training ground ahead of Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont Auvergne. 'I want to play for England and that's the be all and end all.' While Armitage has attracted headlines this week for his bid to satisfy the RFU's strict selection criteria — which only permits players playing in England to be selected for the national side — by attempting to sign for Bath from Toulon, it is Fraser who could yet make a late run on Stuart Lancaster's Elite Player Squad. Whether or not he makes the cut when the squad is announced on Wednesday, Fraser is certain of one thing: he has no intention of turning his back on club or country before his international appetite is sated. 'If I was told if I went abroad I would never play for England I wouldn't go — unless there was no chance of me being picked then maybe I'd consider it,' he said. 'But if I knew I still had a chance to play then I'd stay. 100 per cent.' Will Fraser of Saracens loses his footing challenging for the ball with Ryan Shortland of Newcastle Falcons . Will Fraser says, unlike Steffon Armitage, he would not move to France if it would harm his England prospects . Music to Lancaster's ears, no doubt. The England coach is a known admirer and called Fraser into his Loughborough training camp this summer despite another injury-hit year which saw him miss his club's ultimately unfulfilling climax to the season with a complicated ankle fracture. Fraser showed precisely why with a performance against his England rival Robshaw at the start of the season described by Saracens director Mark McCall as 'high, high class' as the men in black humbled Harlequins 39-0. Saturday's clash — a repeat of last season's semi-final which saw Sarries crush Clermont 46-6 — is another chance for Fraser to impress Lancaster ahead of Wednesday's EPS announcement. 'If I don't make the EPS squad then I'll just keep plodding along. I know more than most how quickly things can change,' Fraser said. That last comment is as much a reference to his youngest brother Henry — paralysed from the neck down since 2009 following a diving accident — as it is to his own relatively trivial injury issues. Henry will be watching proudly on Saturday and big brother added: 'I grew up 10 minutes down the road and whatever happens this will always be my club.' England coach Stuart Lancaster will name his latest international squad next Wednesday .","Saracens back row has seen international ambitions hampered by injury .

"There's a lot of talk about England’s midfield diamond but Roy Hodgson could have played any formation and still beaten San Marino and Estonia. England have not been properly tested since the World Cup but there were positive signs. Jack Wilshere had a good game and I was impressed with his range of passing. Jack’s not a natural defensive midfielder, but Roy can’t go and buy one — at the moment Jack’s the best man for that role. Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph also covered well. They are both selfless midfielders and recognised that whenever Wilshere went forward, they had to cover for him. Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere takes a shot at the Estonia goal on Sunday evening . Roy Hodgson could have safely played any formation against San Marino and England would have still won . This graphic from Tuesday's Daily Mail shows how Hodgson could go about ordering his England formation . That all leaves whoever is playing at the tip of the diamond — Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling or Ross Barkley when he’s back — freedom to roam. The only worry I have is that against better teams we could be outnumbered. At times with Wilshere, Delph and Henderson rotating, they left some gaps. Against 10-man Estonia that’s not a problem but against a good side the ball can change hands quickly and all of a sudden they spring on you. England are still learning but the good news is that Hodgson now has so many midfield options. The diamond has been fine so far and it allows you to play two up front. It’s in vogue but it’s not the only way to play — just look at Chelsea and Manchester City. Jordan Henderson had to cover for Wilshere whenever the attacking England midfielder moved forward . Fabian Delph also did well for England in the midfield engine room and covered Wilshere well on Sunday . If England stay as they are, I would keep the same midfield that started against Estonia with Barkley challenging for the attacking role when he returns. Alternatively, we could get more midfield numbers by playing a three, but that changes the dynamic of the strikers — is Roy bold enough to leave out Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck or even his captain, Wayne Rooney? Both systems leave some talented players on the bench but it’s good to see England now have a real range of attacking options. Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp feels England's midfield looked an ideal fit and it should remain unchanged .","Jack Wilshere played for 90 minutes against Estonia on Sunday evening .

"Brown Panther turned Sunday's Irish St Leger into a procession courtesy of an astute ride from Richard Kingscote, handing owner Michael Owen and trainer Tom Dascombe their first ever Group One winner in the process. Kingscote was at his sharpest tactically aboard the six-year-old, narrowly beaten in the prestigious staying event two years ago, as he allowed his charge to track runaway pacesetter Eye Of The Storm, a move which saw the two front-runners establish a 10-length lead turning for home. Once Eye Of The Storm cracked in the straight, Kingscote sauntered past aboard the admirable stayer and merely needed to keep his mount up to his work to score by six-and-a-half lengths from favourite Leading Light, who snatched second from Encke in a bunch finish for the places. A delighted Kingscote was thrilled to have repaid the faith shown to him by connections. Brown Panther comfortably won the Irish St Leger after being directed by jockey Richard Kingscote .

He said: 'I've been riding for Tom (Dascombe) for a good few years and he's been very supportive of me for a good while so I am delighted to ride a high-profile winner for him. 'The plan was to get our lad in behind a couple of rivals and get him to drop his head, but he jumped very well and they went a nice gallop so I was pleased where I was. 'We know our lad doesn't stop when he gets to the front so I wasn't worried about being there so far out.

"Bacteria that eats radioactive waste has been discovered in the Peak District - and could now be used to help 'eat away' at nuclear waste. Scientists at the University of Manchester say they have found 'extremophile' bacteria that can survive the harsh conditions of underground radioactive waste disposal sites. The findings, published in the ISME (Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology) journal, say the tiny waste-eating single-cell organisms could help with Britain's growing problem of nuclear waste disposal. Scientists discovered the bacteria in contaminated soil in an old lime kiln in the Peak District, pictured . It is the first time that scientists - who discovered the bacteria in contaminated soil in an old lime kiln - have found microbes like it. Britain currently has enough waste to fill four Albert Halls and how it is disposed of is a growing problem. Huge amounts of waste will be encased in concrete before being stored in underground vaults for thousands of years. But when surface water eventually reaches the waste, it will react with the cement and become highly alkaline. This triggers chemical reactions that create isosaccharinic acid (ISA), which can react with the toxic elements which make up the radioactive component of nuclear waste. If the acid binds to radionuclides, such as uranium, then the radionuclides becomes soluble. It means it is more likely to flow out of the vaults, potentially seeping into drinking water and into the food chain. Britain currently has enough 'intermediate' waste to fill four Albert Halls and how it is disposed of is a growing problem. Pictured: A waste disposal plant (file pic) But researchers say these microbes can use the ISA as a source of food  under conditions that mimic those expected in disposal sites. For example, when there is no oxygen to help these bacteria break down the ISA, the microorganisms are able to breathe using other chemicals in the water, such as nitrate or iron. Professor Jonathan Lloyd of university's School of Earth, Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences said: 'We are very interested in these Peak District microorganisms. 'Given that they must have evolved to thrive at the highly alkaline lime-kiln site in only a few decades, it is highly likely that similar bacteria will behave in the same way and adapt to living off ISA in and around buried cement-based nuclear waste quite quickly. 'Nuclear waste will be remain buried deep underground for many thousands of years so there is plenty of time for the bacteria to become adapted. 'Our next step will be to see what impact they have on radioactive materials. We expect them to help keep radioactive materials fixed underground through their unusual dietary habits, and their ability to naturally degrade ISA.' The next step is to study the processes used to support life in the extreme conditions and to see what effect the bacteria has on radioactive waste.","University of Manchester scientists found  bacteria in soil in an old lime kiln .

"As the Premier League announced on Wednesday that they would be launching a new European U21 competition, Sportsmail runs you through the eight players at English clubs to look out for. Lewis Baker . Club: Chelsea Age: 19 Position: Midfield . He scored 17 goals for the Under 21 side last season and Jose Mourinho has taken responsibility for turning him into a future England international. Baker is a set-piece expert with an eye for goal from midfield. Lewis Baker is already training with England U21s at the age of just 19 and has impressed Jose Mourinho . Baker (right) celebrates winning the Under 21 Premier League final, as captain, with Nathan Ake . Ryan Ledson . Club: Everton Age: 17 Position: Midfield . He was captain of the England Under 17 team which triumphed at the European Championships in May - he even scored a penalty during the shootout victory against Holland in the final. Classy and composed from the middle of the park. Ryan Ledson has captained England Under 17s and is expected to make the step up in the near future . Buomesca Tue Na Bangna . Club: Fulham Age: 21 Position: Midfield . Injuries have curtailed what seemed a certain breakthrough at senior level but the pacey Portugal youth international is still tipped to make an impact at Craven Cottage. Buomesca Tue Na Bangna played in pre-season for Fulham but injuries have stalled his progress . Hamza Choudhury . Club: Leicester Age: 16 Position: Midfield . He’s a holding midfielder who boasts craft as well as graft and has already attracted admiring eyes from the upper echelons of the Premier League. His Marouane Fellaini mop makes him easy to spot. Hamza Choudhury is a holding midfielder who is pretty unmissable with his Marouane Fellaini-esque hair. Thierry Ambrose . Club: Manchester City Age: 17 Position: Striker . A French youth international who arrived from Auxerre, he scored 22 goals for City Under 18s last season and has now graduated to the Under 21s, where he continues to find the back of the net. Thierry Ambrose vies for the ball with Chelsea's Ola Aina in the Under 21 Premier League semi-final . Cameron King . Club: Norwich Age: 19 Position: Midfield . He missed last season because of injury but the Scottish youth international has returned to form this season – he scored twice as the Under 21s beat Spurs 3-1 in front of 10,000 fans this week – and has now made his senior debut in the League Cup. Cameron King has already made his senior debut and starred against Tottenham in front of 10,000 fans . Liam Agnew . Club: Sunderland Age: 19 Position: Midfield . The hometown boy likes to get forward from the middle of the pitch and was involved with Gus Poyet’s senior side over the summer, winning a squad number for the Premier League season. With a Premier League squad number under his belt, it won't be long until Liam Agnew is in the first team . Elliot Lee . Club: West Ham Age: 19 Position: Striker . The son of former England midfielder Rob, Lee has scored a bucket load of goals for West Ham’s development side and has been involved in the senior set-up, where it is hoped he will continue to push for a place on the bench this season. Prolific striker Elliot Lee has been pushing up through West Ham's youth sides and can hope for a squad spot .

"Billion dollar girl: Ekaterina Rybolovleva has bought Skorpios from the Onassis family . The daughter of a Russian billionaire has been unveiled as the buyer of the Greek island where shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy. Ekaterina Rybolovleva, daughter of business magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev, has bought Skorpios, her father's investment office confirmed today. The 24-year-old purchased the island  in the Ionian Sea, west of Greece, from Onassis' sole surviving heir, granddaughter Athina Onassis Roussel, 28, for a reported £100million. ‘Ekaterina is delighted that the . trust has negotiated this purchase,’ a representative of Rybolovlev's . family investment office said, confirming she also acquired the neighbouring island of Sparti. ‘She regards the acquisition as a long-term financial investment.’ Miss Rybolovleva's father Dmitry,  co-founder of the Russian potash producer Uralkali, has a history of snapping up trophy properties and is the owner of the AS Monaco Football Club. The . island of Skorpios was bought by Onassis in 1962, believed to have cost . just 3.5 million drachmas, the equivalent of about £10,000. Six . years later it hosted his wedding to Jacqueline Kennedy, the widow of . the late President John F Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. After . his death Skorpios passed to his daughter Christina, who died of a . heart attack aged 37 in 1988, and then to Athina, the Daily Telegraph . reports. According to . Greek press the contracts for the purchase of the private island are . being drawn up by law firms in Athens and Geneva. Farhad Vladi, whose company, Vladi . Private Islands, has hundreds of islands on its books, told the paper . that while he had not heard of the deal, it was possible Ms Onassis Roussel had decided to sell the island. He said: 'These . Russian oligarchs have billions, so it may be that one of them came . along and said ""I will give you 100 million or 200 million euros for . it"". Anything is possible.' Scroll down for video . Island trading: Athina Onassis Roussel, the 28-year-old granddaughter of Aristotle Onassis, right, has sold the Skorpios to fellow equestrian Ekaterina Rybolovleva . Sold: The Greek island where Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy has been sold 'for £100million' Jackie Onassis and Aristotle Onassis, on Skorpios, Greece in 1968. The island, off the western coast of Greece, was bought by Onassis in 1962 . Mr Vladi said he was asked by Ms Onassis Roussel to carry out an evaluation of the island eight years ago. It is believed she has little . interest in spending time on the island, or in Greece. He . said the water comes from a mountain bought by Aristotle Onassis on a . nearby island, and that anyone who bought the island would need to buy . the mountain also, which he estimated would cost upwards of 100 million . euros. The mayor of the . nearby island of . Meganisi, Efstathios Zavitsanos, said the deal was likely to be a . long-term lease since Aristotle Onassis's will stated that Skorpios . could not be sold or leave the family. ‘We have lived with the Onassis . legend and it will never fade,’ he said. ‘You see, Aristotle was close . to the local society, the fishermen and the residents. He was not just a . rich man, he was truly loved.’ Like father, like daughter: Ekaterina, 24, is the daughter of Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev who owns AS Monaco Football Club . The island hosted many parties during . the time of Aristotle Onassis, who is buried there, as is his daughter . and his son, Alexander, who died in a plane crash in 1973. It is also home to three residences, a helicopter landing pad and a boat quay. Swiss-educated Ms Onassis Roussel is the only surviving descendant of the shipping magnate. Ms Onassis Roussel was born in France, and is the only child of Christina Onassis and her fourth husband, Thierry Roussel. She is married to Brazilian Olympic show jumper, Alvaro de Miranda Neto, and lives in Sao Paulo.

"How brave is Arsene Wenger? He’s seemingly immune from the sack at Arsenal so he’s under no pressure in his job whatsoever. So when does this manager show courage in his work? Having faith in Yaya Sanogo at the start of this season? Was that brave? No, it was just bad management. So after three draws and a scrappy win, Arsenal find themselves a point ahead of Manchester United in the early table. For a manager who has no pressure of the sack, 18 years at the helm, and money to spend, Wenger better pull his finger out soon. But is he brave enough to make big decisions? Mesut Ozil has become a lazy player for Arsenal yet his place in the starting line-up seems secure . Arsene Wenger seems incapable of dropping his £42m midfielder despite his poor level of performance . Mesut Ozil rues his penalty miss in Arsenal's Champions League last 16 tie with Bayern Munich last season . Has Arsene Wenger been cruising along like a lottery winner, safe in the knowledge he doesn't have to do anything extra special to keep his job? Fourth place will do apparently. And Arsenal don’t even have to make it to the quarter-finals of the Champions League these days. Arsene Wenger has the safest job in football. He has starved a club of success to the point where the fans now believe the FA Cup is the definition of success for a big club. I guess what I’m really asking is this: has Arsene Wenger got the bottle to drop Mesut Ozil? He’s paid £42million for a skilful footballer, but one who was always keen on clocking off mid-season. Bringing him to the Premier League where there is no winter break was always risky. Mesut Ozil smiles in training ahead of Arsenal's Champions League trip to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday . Despite his lazy performances, there seems no danger of Mesut Ozil being relegated to the subs' bench as in this match at Stoke City last season . But Ozil is being carried in the Arsenal team, just as his German colleagues carried him for most of the World Cup. He picked up a winner’s medal in Brazil by default. Arsenal’s full-backs go forward, they need protection. There’s more chance of Joey Barton refusing to talk about himself than there is of Ozil tracking back. His mid-season lull now lasts from August to May, with the odd glimpse of brilliance. And in some ways I feel sorry for him. Was he ever cut out for the speed and passion of the Premier League? Signing Mesut Ozil is simple, recognising that he isn’t the player you need would have been brilliant insight. Mesut Ozil showed only occasional glimpses of his brilliance last season . Alexis Sanchez, by contrast, has been in excellent form so far this season and scored against Man City . So as Wenger has dithered about making big signings and spending money in the past, now he is becoming a specialist in dithering over team selection. Ozil seems undroppable, even when his contribution to the Arsenal team cause is minimal. I suspect it’s because Arsene Wenger refuses to see what the rest of us can all see (nothing new there then!). While Ozil strolls around, Alexis Sanchez puts a shift in – with more quality than the German as well. The contrast between the two is breathtaking. Meantime others watch from the bench wondering why they are being left out in favour of a talented but lazy footballer. It’s because Wenger spent a fortune on him, and he hasn’t got the balls to drop him.","Mesut Ozil produces lazy performances on a regular basis for Arsenal .

"This weekend I’ve been watching four midfielders from what might be considered 'unfashionable' clubs, who are currently not involved in Roy Hodgson’s squad. Three of them would not look out of place in England’s diamond right now, the other is miles away from that level of football. First up, Tom Huddlestone. Anchoring that England midfield, I can see the Hull City midfielder fitting in nicely. He’s not the toughest tackler, and he’s not the quickest, but his reading of the game suggests he could anticipate the play so well he wouldn’t need to rely on speed or last-gasp challenges. Tom Huddlestone (left), Mark Noble (centre) and Ashley Westwood (right) deserve an England call-up . Lee Cattermole (right) of Sunderland is not good enough on the ball to be considered for an England call-up . England manager Roy Hodgson should look at some midfielders from 'unfashionable' clubs for his squad . One significant aspect of his game is his ability to ping a pass 40 or 50 yards to a lone striker to relieve any pressure. He can do that with accuracy and that is something England haven’t always had. I’ve always had concerns about Huddlestone’s lack of mobility. His former team-mate Danny Murphy pointed out to me that neither Andrea Pirlo nor Xabi Alonso are renowned for their running, and in England’s qualification group we won’t need to do a huge amount of defending so why not have a look at what Tom Huddlestone can do? We have been crying out for years for footballers with technical ability - Huddlestone has it in abundance. He could challenge Jack Wilshere for that place in the starting line-up in my opinion. What might count against him, though, is his last appearance for England. Roy Hodgson called him up for the friendly in Sweden two years ago. Along with Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross, Huddlestone came on with the team 2-1 up and 16 minutes remaining; England lost 4-2. That will have stuck in the manager’s mind. Tom Huddlestone (left) could challenge Jack Wilshere (right) for a place at the base of England's diamond . Hull City midfielder Huddlestone (right) is technically brilliant and can direct long-distance paces perfectly . Xabi Alonso (left) and Andrea Pirlo (right) do not have much pace but have thrived on the international scene . Another name is West Ham United's Mark Noble. He was the England Under 21 captain, leading them to the final of the European Championships in 2009. He hasn’t had a look in since then at international level and at the age of 27 time is running out. I don’t see him at the base of a diamond for England, but I do see him as one of the two in the middle. He is industrious and has more recently started to add consistent quality to his distribution of the ball. Noble can also take a penalty - very few Englishmen can confidently say that. Indeed he once scored twice from the spot in an epic shoot-out against Holland for the U21s. Like Huddlestone, I’ve had my reservations about Noble for England, but I now think he’s good enough. However I doubt he would be first choice when all of Roy’s options are fit. Mark Noble could easily play as one of the middle two for England in Roy Hodgson's diamond formation . The midfielder has captained England's Under 21s but is now 27 and has not had a full international cap . West Ham United's Noble (left) is industrious and can take a penalty, which not many English players can . I’ve been an admirer of Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood for a long time and I definitely see him as an option at the base of a diamond for England. His ability from set-pieces is one of his main strengths, but he has so much more. He can read the game, his defensive work off the ball isn’t always obvious on TV but is a stand-out feature when you watch him live, and he keeps things simple. He gets the ball, and gives it to a team-mate - keeping possession is his main objective, and once again that is something England haven’t always been good at. I’m amazed a player so good on the ball has not had any international recognition at any level. He admits he bases his style on what Michael Carrick has been doing for Manchester United for many successful years. I just hope that Westwood doesn’t suffer the same fate at international level where Carrick was shamefully ignored during his peak years. Aston Villa's Ashley Westwood is good on the ball and can play at the base of England's diamond formation . Westwood (left) has similar qualities to Manchester United's Michael Carrick (right) during his prime . Huddlestone, Noble and Westwood - YES. But Lee Cattermole? No, not for me. I was at The Stadium of Light on Saturday, Cattermole made a crucial error for Sunderland before Spurs’ second goal, but that wasn’t the main reason I would have misgivings about him at England level. Cattermole went lunging into challenges, getting very tight to opponents, and being very physical with them. There was nothing subtle in his approach. This sometimes gets him into trouble in the Premier League, as is well documented. His reputation goes before him but that reputation has been well and truly earned. Lee Cattermole is not good enough on the ball for England and should not be given a call-up by Hodgson . Sunderland's Cattermole (left) is extremely physical and this makes him a yellow card waiting to happen . At international level, with referees more likely to buy the claims of players going to ground easily under a physical challenge, Lee Cattermole is a yellow card waiting to happen. And when on a yellow, can he be trusted not to get another? It’s too big a risk for Hodgson to take in my view. On top of that Cattermole’s quality on the ball is not exceptional, and certainly inferior to a lot of others challenging for the same position at the base of an England midfield diamond. Roy Hodgson certainly took note when I labelled Jack Colback the 'Ginger Pirlo; in this column before his recent call-up. Huddlestone, Noble and Westwood will be hoping the England boss is reading this too. I’m confident he will be. Jack Colback was labelled the 'Ginger Pirlo' in this column and Roy Hodgson gave him an England call-up .","Four midfielders from 'unfashionable' clubs, three deserve England chance .
Hull City's Tom Huddlestone could anchor Roy Hodgson's diamond .

"Superstar quarterback Peyton Manning is done in Indianapolis. The four-time NFL MVP was released by his team today after a 14-year run that also included one Super Bowl title. Manning, 35, and Colts owner Jim Irsay appeared together today during a press conference to make the announcement. Emotional: Peyton Manning struggled to hold back his tears as he announced that he was being released by the Indianapolis Colts, where he spent 14 seasons as quarterback . Both men paused frequently, fighting tears and their voices shaking, when they appeared together at a news conference at the Colts' team complex. Fighting back tears, the veteran . quarterback told reporters: 'I haven't thought yet about where I'll . play, but I have thought a lot of where I've been'. He forever will be thought of in Indianapolis as No. 18, the quarterback who led the Colts to an NFL championship in 2006. 'It'll always be a Colt,' Manning said. 'That'll never change.' He'll be remembered, too, for his record four MVP awards, his 50,000 yards passing and his 200 consecutive starts. Most of all, Manning will be the guy in the horseshoe helmet who turned around a franchise and transformed a basketball-loving city into a football hotbed that hosted the Super Bowl a month ago. Manning is coming off a series of operations to his neck and missed all of last season in which the Colts struggled and could only muster two wins. Indianapolis needed to cut him this week to avoid paying him a $28million bonus. The Colts are widely expected to begin moving on by taking Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft. Injury: Manning's 14-year career with the Colts has come to an end after undergoing three neck operations and missing the entire 2011 season . The relationship between the two has . been increasingly strained in recent months, with public statements from . Irsay suggesting Manning’s separation from the team had caused . tensions. In February, . Sports Illustrated reported that Manning had actually undergone a fourth . unreported surgery and questions about his health have dogged him . throughout his rehabilitation. Although . his doctors announced that he is cleared to resume his career, no . timetable was made public for his return and reports about a lack of arm . strength have proliferated. Despite those concerns, several NFL teams have shown interest in him, including the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins and New York Jets. Emotional farewell: Manning and Colts owner Jim Irsay (right) appeared together today to make the stunning announcement . Champion: Manning forever will be remembered in Indianapolis as No. 18, the quarterback who led the Colts to a Super Bowl victory in 2006 . Free . agency begins March 13, but Manning is now free to sign with another NFL team now that the Colts have formally released him. Sources . said Manning expects to have significant dialogue with interested teams . before he makes a decision on where to resume his career and is will . likely work out for a few select teams once he analyzes his top choices. The parting between Manning . and the franchise that drafted him with No. 1 overall selection in the . 1998 NFL Draft comes shortly before the Colts' March 8 deadline to . exercise an option in the quarterback's contract to keep him. Picking . up the option would keep Manning playing with a horseshoe on his helmet . through 2015 and include a hefty option bonus payment of $28million. Still got it?

Overall, 63.8 per cent of adults in England are overweight or obese. North East (68% are overweight or obese) North West 66% . West Midlands 65.7% . East Midlands 65.6% . Yorkshire and the Humber 65.4% . East of England 65.1% . South East 63.1% . South West 62.7% . London 57.3% . Chasing . Copeland for the title of the worst area are Doncaster, on 74.4 per . cent, and East Lindsey in Lincolnshire, on 73.8 per cent. After . Cumbria, the fattest counties are North Yorkshire and Staffordshire, . both on 67.9 per cent. The fattest region is the North-East, where 68 . per cent are overweight or obese, followed by the West Midlands at 65.7 . per cent. The slimmest . English residents live in the wealthy London borough of Kensington and . Chelsea, where only 45.9 per cent are overweight or obese. The London . boroughs of Tower Hamlets (47.2 per cent) and Richmond upon Thames (47.6 . per cent) are close behind. Obesity . is measured using the body mass index (BMI) score which is calculated . by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres . squared. Anything under 25 is fine. BMI of 25 to 29.9 is classified as . overweight and clinical obesity is defined as 30 or greater. Obesity crisis: Copeland in Cumbria (pictured) is the fattest local authority area in England, alarming new figures have revealed . Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The figure of 64 per cent . for the country is bad enough but when figures rise to around 80 per . cent for some local areas one has to believe that the problem may be . insurmountable. The projection that 50 per cent of the country could be . obese before 2050 could unfortunately come to pass unless really radical . steps are taken now by central government to tackle the problem.’ Joseph . Clift, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Put simply, too many . people weigh too much. This should be a catalyst for action at a local . and national level.’ Obesity . costs the NHS £5.1billion a year, according to the National Audit . Office. The total cost to the economy of being overweight or obese has . been put at some £16billion in 2007, rising to £50billion a year by 2050 . if left unchecked. Back in . Cumbria, Copeland Borough Council’s Gillian Troughton said: ‘We . recognise that obesity is a national problem, and one which affects . Copeland. ‘One big example . of how we are tackling it is that we are investing in protecting our . leisure facilities at a time of Government cuts, and continuing to offer . those in receipt of benefits discounted access to the range of . facilities we provide, which will soon include a new gym facility.’","New data reveals how the obesity crisis affects different areas of the country .

"The Football Association should show its teeth and call up any players wanted by Gareth Southgate at next summer’s Under-21 European Championships, according to Leicester manager Nigel Pearson. The question has been raised about whether Premier League clubs would let players such as Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley travel to the Czech Republic to boost the squad. But Pearson, who was Under-21 assistant manager during 2007 and has Liam Moore under his guidance at Leicester, believes the FA could simply apply FIFA rules obligating players to appear for their country. Leicester  manager Nigel Pearson (above) demands The FA back Gareth Southagte . Raheem Sterling (right) is eligible to represent England Under-21s at the European Championships next year . ‘I don't think there is a debate. We have it completely the wrong way round,’ he said. ‘The question that needs to be asked is whether the Football Association invokes the rule it could do. Every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant. ‘That stems from the fact the Football Association don't have the clout other federations have. Clubs basically run football in this country. There has been a shift in power. ‘Ultimately it's whether our federation are able to invoke the clause that's there.

"Plaintiff: Patrick McMahon, pictured, is suing the donor network for sacking him because he spoke out . New York hospitals are routinely 'harvesting' organs from patients before they're even dead, an explosive lawsuit is claiming. The suit accuses transplant non-profit The New York Organ Donor Network of bullying doctors into declaring patients brain dead when they are still alive. Plaintiff, Patrick McMahon, 50, reckons one in five patients is showing signs of brain activity when surgeons declare them dead and start hacking out their body parts. 'They're playing God,' said McMahon, a former transplant coordinator who claims he was fired just four months into the role for speaking out about the practice. He said that the donor network makes 'millions and millions' from selling the organs they obtain to hospitals and to insurance companies for transplants. 'Hearts, lungs, kidneys, joints, bones, skin graphs, intestines, valves, eyes -- it's all big money,' he said. The Air Force Combat veteran and former nurse added that financially strained hospitals are easily influenced to declare a patient brain dead because they're keen to free up bed space. The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday, cites a 19-year-old car crash victim who was still struggling to breathe and showing signs of brain activity when doctors gave the green light for his organs to be harvested. Network officials including director Michael Goldstein allegedly bullied Nassau University Medical Center staff into declaring the teen dead, stating during a conference call: 'This kid is dead, you got that?' But McMahon said he believed the 19-year-old could have recovered. CEO: The network's CEO and president, Helen Irving, pictured, is mentioned in the lawsuit . Bully: Network dirctor Michael Goldstein, pictured, is accused of saying 'this kid is dead, you got that?' The . lawsuit cites three other examples of patients who were still clinging . to life when doctors gave a 'note' - an official declaration by a . hospital that a patient is brain dead, which, as well as consent from . next of kin, is required before a transplant can take place. The suit claims that a man was admitted to Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, a month later, again showing brain activity. It claims McMahon protested but was . blown off by hospital and donor network staff, and the man was declared . brain dead and his organs harvested. In . November 2011, a woman admitted to Staten Island University Hospital . after a drug overdose was declared brain dead and her organs were about . to be harvested when McMahon noticed that she was being given 'a . paralyzing anesthetic' because her body was still jerking. 'She was having brain function when . they were cutting into her on the table,' McMahon told MailOnline. 'He . had given her a paralyser and there's no reason to give someone who is . dead a paralyser.' He said he confronted the person who gave it to her and he was speechless. Lawsuit: The suit claims a 19-year-old car crash victim was still alive when doctors at Nassau University Medical Center, pictured, declared him brain dead . 'Finally he said he was told to do it because while they were cutting her chest open she was moving her chest around. And a paralyser only paralyses you, it does nothing for the pain,' he said. McMahon added that surgeons 'took everything' with regards to body parts. 'They took her eyes, her joints. She was right there when I was having the conversation. They were inserting the plastic bones where the real ones had been.' According to the lawsuit, when McMahon probed further on the disturbing case another network employee told hospital staff he was 'an untrained troublemaker with a history of raising frivolous issues and questions.' 'I had a reputation for raising a red flag,' he said. McMahon has accused the donor network . of having a 'quota' system and hiring 'coaches' to teach staff how to . be more persuasive in convincing family members to give consent to organ . donation. He said 'counselling' staff are like sales teams who are pressured to meet targets and threatened with the loss of their jobs if they fall short. 'If you don't meet the quotas then you'll get fired - that's a fact. I saw it happen,' he said. 'You're not there for grief . counselling, you're there to get organs. It's all about sales -- and . that's pretty much a direct quote from the organisation. Counsellors are . required to get a 30 per cent consent rate from families.' Lawsuit: The New York Organ Donor Network has been accused of bullying hospitals into declaring patients brain dead when they're still alive so organs can be harvested (stock photo) McMahon added that staff members who collect the most organs throughout the year qualify for a Christmas bonus. 'If counselors do well by getting a lot of organs they are given a bonus in December,' he said. The veteran - who worked at the donor network between July and November last year - said there are about 30-40 staff who are out in the field, going to hospitals and trying to get signatures and donations. He said other workers concentrate on managing the candidates or the patients who are brain dead. McMahon claims that on November 4, he told the network's CEO and president, Helen Irving, that 'one in five patients declared brain dead show signs of brain activity at the time the Note is issued.' But the suit says, she replied: 'This is how things are done.' He told MailOnline the next day he was sacked. 'My job was to make sure people were doing things right and when I spoke up I got punished,' he said. 'It was disgusting to me. There was such complacency and a lack of concern. They say 'these organs save people' but what if that person was alive. I witnessed the fact they were alive.' The network could not be reached by MailOnline for comment but spokesman Julia Rivera told The New York Post that McMahon’s claims of a quota system were 'ridiculous. There are no quotas.'","The New York Organ Donor Network accused of bullying doctors into declaring patients brain dead when they are still alive so they can strip them of their organs .

"World No 1 golfer Rory McIlroy is set to be personally dragged into his multi-million pound lawsuit with management agents Horizon Sports for the first time. Although European Ryder Cup team talisman McIIroy has been in dispute with Horizon since April 2013, he has been kept at arm’s length from the legal battle to extricate him from a representative contract running until the end of 2017, by his lawyers. However, the mediation between the two sides — which the Dublin judge has ordered to take place within 28 days after a preliminary hearing — would require Mcllroy, as the plaintiff, to be there in person for negotiations. Rory McIlroy is set to be personally dragged into his multi-million pound lawsuit with  Horizon Sports . The next step is likely to be an application for a mediation time extension as McIlroy’s involvement in the Ryder Cup and next week’s Dunhill Links championship allows little opportunity for talks to be staged. But with the Dublin High Court trial date set for next February, it would suit both sides for a settlement to be agreed. McIlroy, despite being such an assured 25-year-old, would hate being cross-examined by a leading QC. Horizon chief Conor Ridge would not want to subject his other big golf client Graeme McDowell to such an experience, either. If it does go to court, McIlroy could be faced with a bill for as much as £40million. Di Dougherty, who didn’t have the best of times as host of the opening ceremony at Celtic Manor, has nevertheless kept the role at Gleneagles. And although Di no longer presents golf on Sky, her husband Nick is a pundit on Sky’s Ryder Cup highlights programmes while fighting to resurrect his playing career. Tom Watson, 65-year-old US captain, does not like questions about his age or his Ryder Cup credentials . VIDEO Watson not worried by lack of action . Ryder Cup organisers’ guests at Gleneagles include Premier League chief executive Richard Sdudamore who was also invited to Medinah in 2012. And certainly — with the next PL TV tender looming — Sky’s main rights competitors BT Sport will be reassured Scudamore is not enjoying Sky’s hospitality at a tournament where they are omnipresent from overlord Barney Francis downwards. Scudamore says he will be declaring the trip on the PL entertainment register. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been feted at Gleneagles as a motivational speaker to Paul McGinley’s side — but his sworn enemy JP McManus is on the European Tour VIP invite guest list. Tom Watson, 65-year-old US captain, does not like questions about his age or being reminded that he hasn’t been present at a Ryder Cup for 21 years. When asked yesterday whether that was a disadvantage, Watson’s cold answer was just ‘No’ before adding: ‘Because I’ve played four times and I’ve been captain once. That’s experience.’ However, rival Paul McGinley calls his inside involvement in the most recent tournaments a ‘massive learning curve.’ Kevin Pietersen failed to mention Jaguar's cancelled sponsorship of the England  team was partly due to him . England cricket outcast Kevin Pietersen has been tweeting more about golf than cricket, especially about playing at Wentworth. Certainly, KP would find becoming a member at European Tour headquarters Wentworth rather easier than at nearby Sunningdale, where arch-foe Andrew Strauss plays his golf. However, Pietersen did tweet yesterday that Jaguar were ending their England cricket sponsorship — as revealed last summer by Sports Agenda. But KP didn’t say that one of the reasons why the endorsement ended was his refusal to drive a Jaguar when on international duty. The battle for Ryder Cup prominence between warring watch brands Rolex and Omega is complicated by Rolex–backed Europe’s top player Rory McIlroy being a leading ambassador for Omega. They are official timekeepers for the US team. The size of McIlroy’s Omega contract, which includes a heavy advertising campaign on American TV, ensures he will be wearing their watch when off the course at Gleneagles. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond might have lost the referendum vote, but he is credited by the European Tour hierarchy with doing more than anyone to bring the Ryder Cup to Scotland. A Scottish Government reception at Stirling Castle on Saturday is likely to turn into a tribute night for the departing First Minister.

"The fall-out from the World Cup has seen Roy Hodgson plus his England players and tracksuit assistants split up from the rest of the FA travelling party on away trips to remain focused. As a result, the FA had to book two hotels in Tallinn before Sunday night’s European qualifier against Estonia to ensure administrative staff are in a separate hotel from Hodgson’s squad — even when staying for only one night. This new two-hotel policy, which was also used in Basle ahead of the first qualifier against Switzerland, resulted from a number of internal debriefs following the debacle in Brazil. England manager Roy Hodgson plus his players and tracksuit assistants stay separate from the rest . They have been split up from the rest of the FA travelling party on away trips to remain focused on their task . Hodgson felt there were too many FA personnel and associated staff around the players during the World Cup, particularly at meal times and on match days — not surprising when the FA party for the tournament climbed to over 80. The FA, who take far fewer to an away qualifier, are not the only ones with this strategy. World champions Germany are said to have split their delegation — which is even bigger than England’s — between four hotels in Brazil. However, I’m sure Hodgson, Gary Neville and Co will be delighted to know that the best accommodation in Tallinn — the grand Presidential Suite in the Radisson Blu Hotel where George W Bush stayed and big enough for a team meeting — was allocated by the discerning travel company to your Sports Agenda columnist. Hodgson felt there were too many FA personnel and associated staff around the players during the World Cup . World champions Germany reportedly split their delegation  between four hotels in Brazil to remain focussed . Former Chelsea footballer Paul Elliott joining the FA Council as the new representative for the Inclusion Advisory Board — the first black footballer on the council — is a big step in the right direction for the FA’s anti-discrimination efforts. But the FA must try to make England’s travelling support membership more diverse. It was very noticeable in Tallinn that the fans following England were almost all white. Paul Elliott became the first black footballer to join the FA Council and was the first to receive a CBE too . The FA have yet to decide on their base in France for Euro 2016, but the priority is that the hotel and training base should be on the same complex or very close together. The trouble in Brazil wasn’t just the hour-plus journey between the two, but the huge difficulty of a second visit later in the day without a police escort. England arrive at their hotel in Belo Horizonte during the summer's 2014 World Cup tournament in Brazil . The trouble wasn’t just the hour-plus journey in Brazil but the difficulty of a second visit without a police escort . England fans in Tallinn on Sunday again voiced their considerable upset at the FA switching the double value of points/caps from supporters attending away games to home Wembley matches, with filling the national stadium the main concern of the FA. This thinking makes it all the more unlikely the FA will take England on the road — with the governing body aware that taking the odd unattractive fixture elsewhere might be viewed as condescending. England fans in Tallinn voiced opinions at the FA switching the double value of points/caps from away to home . Roy Keane has been brutally honest in his book, but legend in Ireland has it there was a lot more to his flare-up with Jon Walters at Ipswich after he was dropped and stripped of the captaincy when agitating for a move to Stoke than a bit of ‘effing and blinding and pushing and shoving’. Walters, it’s alleged, told Keane he knew where he lived and was coming to get him. Keane promptly wrote something down and thrust the piece of paper at Walters. It was his home address. Jon Walters (right, playing for Ipswich) allegedly told Roy Keane (left) he knew where he lived and was coming . Once Star India and Star Middle East had agreed a global deal of over £1.5billion for eight years of the ICC World Cup, Twenty20 and Champions Trophy tournaments from 2015, Sky Sports were always going to beat off rivals BT for the UK rights with Rupert Murdoch being a part-owner of the Star group. BT, who would have gained the rights if the ICC had gone for the territory-by-territory option, will now have to wait until 2019 to compete against Sky for England Test cricket. Sky, who will pay Star around £150m, have been intent on closing doors on BT’s entry into other sports since the blockbuster loss to them of the Champions League. Meanwhile BT plan to present some of next season’s Champions League matches from newspaper offices around Europe to tap into the knowledge of football journalists. The planned initiative demonstrates that despite the rise of social media, old-fashioned print journalism is still the best-informed medium.

"Parts of Britain are to be treated to a rare display of the Northern Lights on Friday evening. The colourful bands of shimmering light are usually only seen in the northerly reaches of Scandinavia, Canada and remote parts of Russia. But tonight the display, known as the aurora borealis, is forecast to be on show in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . Parts of Britain are to be treated to a rare display of the Northern Lights on Friday evening (file picture) The prospect of celestial fireworks in such southerly locations is down to huge explosions on the surface of the Sun. A solar blast last night hurled vast clouds of magnetically charged particles towards Earth – and another explosion is forecast this evening. Known as coronal mass ejections, they can produce many colours, with green, pink, red, blue and yellow all possible. The combined effect of two explosions increases the chance of a display. As they whip towards the Earth, the particles crash into other particles, accelerating and energising them. And when they enter our atmosphere they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the air, which when charged, create the shimmering light that we know as the Aurora Borealis. Often the particles are deflected by the earth’s magnetic field, so the best places to witness it are close to the poles where the field is weakest. Normally, the earth’s magnetic field funnels the high-energy particles – and so the display - towards the North Pole. The display, known as the aurora borealis, is forecast to be on show in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland (file picture) But just occasionally, the sun’s emissions are so violent and so on target, that most of Britain, as far south as East Anglia, gets a ringside seat. Different colours are created depending on the energy of the incoming particles – and the type of atom they hit in the atmosphere. For instance, a red glow, which usually occurs high in the sky, is created by lower energy particles interacting with oxygen. Green lights are caused by slightly more energetic particles, while a purple hue involves nitrogen. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘To view the Northern Lights you are best finding a dark place away from street lights. ‘You will need a cloud-free sky and although there will be some cloud and localised fog patches around this Friday night there should also be some clear skies too. ‘So there is a chance of catching a glimpse of the lights. Your best chance of sighting the aurora will be around midnight.’","Britain to be treated to rare display of the Northern Lights on Friday evening .

"The Portugal Masters has been reduced to 54 holes after heavy rain caused lengthy delays in Vilamoura on Friday with only six players, including leader Alexander Levy, completing their second rounds. Some players came into the day yet to complete their opening rounds after a downpour ended play early on Thursday, and the start of the second round was also delayed in the morning due to more rain. When players did get out on course, it was Frenchman Levy who made the biggest impression, playing his first 10 holes in six under par to move one shot clear of Nicolas Colsaerts at the top of the leaderboard before the rain came again. Alexander Levy of France smiles on the 8th green during round two of the Portugal Masters, as the Frenchman leads following a disruptive day in Vilamoura . Spectators wait in waterproof clothing as play is suspended due to heavy rain at the Portugal Masters . Play eventually got back under way at 5.45pm but it was clear that almost half the field would be unable to even start their second rounds and the decision was made to reduce the tournament to 54 holes shortly after. Once back out on the course, Levy picked up where he left off - registering four more birdies to card a 61 and finish the day on 18 under, three shots clear of Colsaerts who would have to return to complete the last two holes of his second round on Saturday morning. Before the stoppage Levy, who started on the back nine, had flown out of the blocks with a birdie before hitting three more in a row from the 13th to the 15th - his pitch mark on 13 being within a foot of the pin. He picked up another on 17 before chipping in on the first but Colsaerts, who held a three-shot overnight lead after just missing out on a 59 on Thursday, had kept pace with him with birdies at 12 and 15 before the rain returned. Levy was not fazed by the long break and his one-shot lead soon became three as he birdied the second while Colsaerts, who had also started on the back nine, dropped a shot on the first. Levy recorded further birdies on five, six and nine to complete his sparkling round but former Ryder Cup player Colsaerts is made of stern stuff and picked up shots on four, five and seven to stay in touch. The truncated nature of the tournament means that Levy will not now play again until Sunday but the 24-year-old is glad for the rest after a marathon day. 'I will go to the gym, work a little bit and rest in my room tomorrow,' he said. Katie Aiken watches her husband Thomas during the second round of the Portugal Masters .

"The striking similarities that began with the month they were born and have marked their sporting lives now include the island Justin Rose and Adam Scott call home. While Rose has moved into contention to win The Open, his wife Kate has been putting the finishing touches to their move from Orlando to the Bahamas, about a stone’s throw from where Scott and his new bride live. And so the pair will share a private jet to tournaments as well as walk the fairways together. They will try to coax one another into making the next five years a period where they leave a mark as indelible as the one Sir Nick Faldo and Greg Norman left before them. Close connections: Adam Scott and Justin Rose are now neighbours on the same island in the Bahamas . Rivalry: Rose and Scott were born a fortnight apart and are now world No 3 and No 1 respectively . Now entrenched in the world’s top three, they have become so good there are inevitably going to be a number of tournaments over the next five years where they will face off - and there might even be one on Sunday. Rose shot a useful 70 in the capricious breezes to move to two under, with Scott edging a stroke nearer the lead after finishing birdie-birdie for a 73. ‘Lunch will certainly taste a lot nicer now,’ said the Queenslander. To this point, Scott has been like the over-achieving big brother, always getting to landmarks about a year ahead of Rose, who is a fortnight younger (Scott was 34 on Wednesday while Rose will reach that age at the end of the month). Both have won European Tour events, PGA Tour events, World Golf Championship events and a major apiece - but it was Scott who got there first each time. Given the eerie parallels, it seems almost inevitable Rose will follow in Scott’s footsteps and become world No 1 at some point. If he wins the Claret Jug, it will happen here. In contention: Scott and Rose are three-under and two-under at The Open behind Rory McIlroy's 12-under . ‘I’m pleased with that round. It was very difficult out there and I couldn’t have asked for more,’ said Rose. The pair must have chuckled to themselves when they saw the draw. As if they don’t spend enough time in each other’s company. It was fascinating watching their strategies over the first 36 holes. Who’s going to win the most majors? I asked that question of Graeme McDowell not long ago and, typically, he gave it some thought. ‘About 15 months ago, I’d have said Adam without a moment’s hesitation,’ said G-Mac, eventually. ‘Now? That’s a very close call. How will Adam cope when the ban on long putters begins in 2016? I’d say Adam will win four majors and Justin three, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the other way round.’ Benchmark: Australian Scott is top of the world rankings now, but could be dethroned as soon as Sunday . Good fortune plays its part and both were unlucky to get the wrong end of the draw over the first two days, given they came here in the form of their lives. A three-under-par 36-hole total is about the worst Scott could have recorded, given how well he struck the ball. Predictably, Rose suffered a letdown in his first round since claiming his second win in a row at the Scottish Open last week. The important thing was a 72 didn’t take him out of it. So they began Friday morning, fully aware this was a day for patience. On the first three holes, Scott was never out of the middle of the fairway, had a wedge in his hand for two of his three approach shots - and walked to the fourth tee two over par. Satisfied: England's Rose said he was 'pleased' with his second round in tough conditions . Rose’s round was a classic case in point. He was one over after eight, with nothing happening on the greens. Then he chipped in for a birdie at the ninth and an eagle three at the 10th. How well they putt over the next five years will largely determine their legacy. Their ball- striking is unquestioned, as is their ambition. But neither hole prodigious amounts of putts. Scott gave himself so many chances but invariably the chance passed with a grimace on his lips rather than a smile. Rose never holed a putt all day. But both are in contention, with Scott one stride ahead of Rose going into the weekend. The story of their lives, you might say.","Scott and Rose were partnered for their opening two rounds at The Open .

"IBF world welterweight title bout set for August 9 in New York . Brook has signed contract to fight Porter at the Brooklyn Centre . Floyd Mayweather Jnr remains No 1 in Jeff Powell's pound-for-pound Top 10 list . There are sighs of relief on both sides of the Atlantic at the announcement that Kell Brook has signed the contract to challenge Shawn Porter for the world welterweight title. More than a month after the initial announcement of the fight, Brook’s Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has finally been able to take to Twitter to confirm the British end of the deal. Hearn, perhaps with an element of tongue in cheek, also remarked that Porter will be stripped of his IBF belt if he does not now sign to meet his mandatory challenger from Sheffield. Up for it: Kell Brook has a signed a deal to fight Shawn Porter for the IBF welterweight title on August 9 . The reaction from Kenny Porter, the champion’s trainer and father, is one of guarded optimism. During the delay Porter Snr had questioned Brook’s willingness to go through with fighting his big-punching son. He cited Brook withdrawing twice from scheduled world title bouts against Devon Alexander, from whom Porter won the IBF title in one of Brook’s injury enforced absences. Alexander had also pulled out of one championship meeting with Brook when injured himself. The American camp still seems concerned whether Brook will show up at the Brooklyn Centre in New York on the proposed date of August 9. However, with the fight barely six weeks away Porter is already deep into training. Done deal: Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn posted this picture with Shawn Porter after striking the agreement for him to fight Brook in Brooklyn . Warning: Hearn has said Porter (L) risks being stripped of his IBF title if he refuses to face mandatory challenger Brook . But so is Brook and it is  inconceivable that at the age of 28 and with 32 wins on his unbeaten record he will miss out again on a world title shot. This is his big chance. He also knows that if he is ever to lure Amir Khan into a big-money domestic fight he needs to bring a world title to the negotiating table. Khan has stirred the pot by saying: ‘I keep hearing from some close to Kell that he is not sure if he is ready for Porter.’ But Brook says: ‘I know this will be a tough fight but while Porter is strong I believe I have the better skills.’ Porter’s father retorts: ‘Shawn is bigger, stronger and faster and we’re going to find out how much punishment Brook can take.’ Special one: Brook, pictured landing a hard-hitting uppercut on Alvaro Robles, needs to win if he is to set up a huge domestic bout with Amir Khan . After de-throning Alexander, Porter was given a one-fight exemption from his mandatory obligation to Brook and stopped Paulie Malignaggi in four rounds. His promoters, Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy company, do have other big fights in the pipe-line for Porter but the IBF are insisting that he goes through with defending against Brook. It does now look as if the fight will happen, with Porter sounding confident. Or are he and his father relying on Brook pulling out? 1)    Floyd Mayweather (unchanged) Number one: Floyd Mayweather, pictured last week at a party in Miami, heads Jeff Powell's top 10 pound-for-pound list . 2)    Manny Pacquiao (unchanged)3)    Wladimir Klitschko (unchanged)4)    Guillermo Rigondeaux (unchanged)5)    Andre Ward (unchanged) Second best: Manny Pacquiao is ranked at No 2 in Jeff Powell's list, while Britain's Carl Froch (R) is in at No 7 . 6)    Juan Manuel Marquez (unchanged)7)    Carl Froch (unchanged)8)    Miguel Cotto (unchanged)9)    Tim Bradley (unchanged)10)   Adonis Stevenson (unchanged)","IBF world welterweight title bout set for August 9 in New York .

"Ryder Cup winner Lee Westwood has criticised the United States team for airing 'dirty laundry in public' after their defeat at Gleneagles last month. In the immediate wake of Europe's 16 1/2 to 11 1/2 victory, American veteran Phil Mickelson openly criticised the captaincy of Tom Watson, sat a few feet away from him, at the post-tournament press conference. That has led to a fortnight of apologies, inquests and soul-searching about what can be done to end the European dominance of the event. The USA team were convincingly beaten by Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup . 'I think it's a little bit disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public,' said Westwood, back on American soil playing in the PGA Tour's Frys.com Open in California this week. 'It's very difficult to pin-point in a team environment whose fault it specifically is. 'It's a combination of a lot of different things. Maybe Tom got a few things wrong. Maybe the US team just didn't quite play well enough in general. You know, if the other team plays well, you're going to lose. 'I'm just pleased that I don't have to sort it all out because I don't like to see people's great reputations being brought down by something that shouldn't really happen in public. USA captain Tom Watson (right) has taken full responsibility for any mistakes made in the Ryder Cup defeat . 'It should all be done behind closed doors and sorted out there, and the analysis should start there, really, and not be done in the press, in the media.' Westwood was part of the team which lost at Valhalla in 2008 and while there were a number of issues with Nick Faldo's captaincy then no-one in the European team broke ranks with their frustrations. 'I think there were a lot of people disappointed in '08 but we tried to come together and basically not say anything in public,' added Westwood at his pre-tournament press conference. 'Whenever you lose you're going to be disappointed and you're going to think things could have been done better. Phil Mickelson, speaking in a press conference after Europe has secured victory at Gleneagles, claimed American captain Tom Watson had 'strayed from a winning formula' and compared his unfavourably to 2008 leader Paul Azinger. He said: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did. 'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their 'pod', when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together. 'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well. 'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well. 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.' Asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to Watson, he replied: 'I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best.' Phil Mickelson was clear and specific in his criticism of American Ryder Cup captain Watson . Mickelson (centre) looks despondent after Europe collect the Ryder Cup trophy instead of USA . 'It's just a case of managing it and handling it and improving it for the next time professionally. 'Certainly for the future Ryder Cups the Europeans will remember how it's all been handled. 'The European team will remember the fall-out from this one. It can't do anything but build confidence for the European team going into the next one that it's been handled so publicly this time. 'I guess we'll see how easy it is to get the US team rattled by putting a bit of pressure on them. I don't think anything good can come of all this (for the Americans).' In response to all of the recent discussion about our Ryder Cup loss, I would like to make a few comments. First, I take complete and full responsibility for my communication, and I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup. My intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be honest.Secondly, the guys gave everything.They played their hearts out. I was proud to get to know each and every one of them. I know they are all going to win tournaments, be on future Ryder Cup teams and have wonderful careers. Our team certainly showed guts when it took it to the other team early in Sunday's singles matches. We were indeed tied with them as the scoreboard turned wonderfully ""red"". Our players started fast as I had asked them to in my comments the night before. I asked them to really concentrate on holes 2-5, as the Europeans had won too many early battles on these particular holes. But in the end, the facts are that the other team played better. My hat's off and congratulations to them. As for Phil's comments, I completely understand his reaction in the moment. Earlier this week I had an open and candid conversation with him and it ended with a better understanding of each other's perspectives. Phil's heart and intentions for our team's success have always been in the right place. Phil is a great player, has great passion and I admire what he's done for golf. The bottom line is this. I was their captain. In hindsight whatever mistakes that were made were mine. And I take complete and full responsibility for them. I want to say again to the players, their families, the PGA and our country how proud and honored I was to captain this talented group of golfers, and how privileged I was to spend the past two years working this labor of my love for the Ryder Cup. Matt Kuchar, a member of the losing team at Gleneagles, said he had avoided everything to do with defeat since returning home. 'I played the Ryder Cup and then haven't turned on the TV since I was home. I've watched some football games and some baseball games, but I don't look online to see anything,' he said. 'Phil answered a question. It didn't seem like it was at all a shot at Tom Watson to me. 'Phil was asked the last time the US won they had a pod system under Paul Azinger, 'Why do you think they went away from the system, did you prefer the system?' and Phil said 'Yeah'. 'With that I guess it opened up a can of worms but you've got to remember Phil being asked a second question, and he said 'Listen, don't take it that way. This is not a shot at Tom', so I'm sure it's blown out of proportion.' Lee Westwood took to Twitter to show off his lift home after celebrating winning the 2014 Ryder Cup .

"Steffon Armitage’s shock move from Toulon to Bath was in danger of collapsing on Tuesday night amid a club versus country stand-off over the payment of a transfer fee. The 29-year-old flanker had appeared to be on the verge of a sensational and immediate return to the Aviva Premiership in order to push for a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Bath attempted to hurriedly finalise a season-long deal. However, after the initial European deadline for registering players passed at noon, the West Country club’s head coach Mike Ford suggested that the deal was close to being ‘dead in the water’. Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage had been linked with a shock move to Bath but he will not return to England . Bath coach Mike Ford (right) says Armitage (left, pictured playing for England in 2010) will not be signed by the West Country club if he features for French side Toulon in Europe this weekend as is expected . If Armitage plays for Toulon against Montpellier in the opening round of the new Champions Cup on Sunday, he will be cup-tied and unavailable to represent Bath in European matches, at which point their pursuit of the openside will end. For now, it is thought that talks are on-going, but the sticking point appears to be the payment of a £300,000 fee to Toulon. There are striking similarities between this case and that of Sam Burgess in the build-up to confirmation of his cross-code move to Bath earlier this year. Sportsmail understands that the England management have privately welcomed the notion of Armitage returning to play in this country, which would mean he is once again eligible for Test selection . Dialogue has taken place between the men running the national set-up and their counterparts at Bath. The club are believed to be seeking financial input from the RFU on the basis that England stand to benefit from having renewed access to Armitage. However, as was the situation with the deal for Burgess, the union are adamant that they cannot have any direct involvement. Ford claimed in an interview that ‘the RFU were trying to do the deal’, while initial reports in France suggested that officials from the union had made contact with Toulon about a potential release agreement. But a source at Twickenham was adamant that the union’s chief executive Ian Ritchie has merely been kept informed about developments by his opposite number at Bath, Bruce Craig, adding: ‘We haven’t talked to Toulon.’ England coach Stuart Lancaster refuses to pick overseas-based players because of RFU policy . Armitage played in the Premiership for London Irish before upping sticks and moving to France with Toulon . The RFU are well aware that any financial contribution would be seized upon by Bath’s Premiership rivals as favouritism and would undermine the integrity of the league. Ritchie is said to be absolutely adamant that a line cannot be crossed, even if it leads to long-term benefits for England. So, despite the apparent will on all sides for the transfer to go through, it had reached an impasse on Tuesday night. Armitage’s hopes of forcing his way back into World Cup contention and adding to his tally of five Test caps were hanging by a thread. He had recently considered using a loophole in the eligibility criteria to switch Test allegiance to France, but he has had an abrupt change of heart. Bath are pursuing Armitage as a replacement for their injured Springbok flanker, Francois Louw, but Ford said: ‘We haven’t signed him. We tried to and we have the ability to do so with our injury dispensation. ‘We’ve been looking around for a while and our owner, Bruce, thought of Steffon. We tried to make it happen and it was very, very close. Steff was excited to come here but it’s just not been done. ‘I understand there were financial reasons. It’s unfortunate, because we were so close to signing a great player, who could have helped club and country. ‘The RFU were trying to do the deal and Bruce has been dealing with that. From my point of view, if he plays for Toulon in the Champions Cup this weekend then I would be stupid to sign him because then he can’t play for us in Europe. If that happens then it’s dead in the water.’ Asked if that appeared likely, Ford added: ‘At this moment in time, yeah.’ Armitage, playing for England, moves past the tackle of New Zealand winger Hosea Gear  in 2010 . The Toulon flanker (centre) is expected to play in Europe this weekend, meaning he will not move to Bath . Bath have emerged as title contenders in the early stages of this season — playing a daring brand of rugby based on predominantly English talent. Ford believes Armitage, the current European Player of the Year, could fit into his side well, as well as the England squad, and lamented the fact that he might not have the chance to do so. He would have been a fantastic signing for Bath,’ Ford told Sky Sports News. ‘I spoke to Steff myself and over the weekend. He just wanted to come and play for Bath and have a shot at the World Cup, so I feel sorry for him that it’s not happened. 'What he’s done in the last few years has been brilliant and he is a world-class player. I think it would have been great for England as well, with a World Cup around the corner, for Stuart Lancaster to be able to pick a player of that potential.’ Early reports in France claimed that Saracens were also interested in signing Armitage, but that was flatly denied by their director of rugby Mark McCall. He said: ‘We weren’t involved and we won’t be involved. We are very happy with the back-row resources we have here.’ If there is to be another twist in this tale and a deal is eventually done, Armitage — a specialist openside poacher — could soon be a prime challenger for Chris Robshaw’s Test place, but the England captain appeared to relish the personal competition. ‘I played against Steffon quite a bit in schoolboy rugby so we crossed paths quite a bit and had quite a few good battles,’ he said. ‘He is a cracking player and if you look at what he has won in the last few previous years, it is pretty special.’ He has won countless personal awards and team prizes with Toulon, but what Armitage really craves is a shot at World Cup selection. It appears to be a fading fantasy. Armitage, the 2013-14 European player of the year, playing for Toulon in Heineken Cup final against Saracens .

"Steffon Armitage may be poised to make a shock return to English rugby in time to push for World Cup selection, if his French club, Toulon, agree to release him. The 29-year-old flanker has recently been investigating the possibility of switching Test allegiance to France, as he has been unavailable for England selection while based across the Channel. But it is understood that he has had a change of heart and Bath have made urgent enquiries about signing him with immediate effect. Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been linked with a shock move to Bath . Age: 29 . Position: Flanker . Height: 5ft 9in Weight: 16st 3lb . Clubs . Saracens (2004-06) London Irish (2006-11) Toulon (2011-) International career . England Saxons . England (five caps, 2009-2011) A loan move is not an option, so any sudden transfer would have to be permanent; a situation complicated by the fact that Armitage is in the first year of a lucrative three-year deal with Toulon, on an annual salary of around £320,000. In theory, Bath - who will be without their injured Springbok flanker Francois Louw until December - would need to pay a 'hefty fee' to secure the services of the European Player of the Year. Sportsmail has been told that there is a 50-50 chance of a move being approved in the next 24 hours, but the final decision rests with Toulon head coach, Bernard Laporte. Injuries to two of his other back-rowers, Juan Smith and Mamuka Gorgodze, on Sunday seemingly reduced the likelihood of Armitage being authorised to leave, but there remains a significant chance it could happen. England coach Stuart Lancaster refuses to pick overseas-based players because of RFU policy . On Monday night, Laporte told the BBC: ‘The season has begun, we have to move quickly if he wants to change. He has a contract, but if the England coach says if he plays for Bath or Saracens, then he will play in the World Cup, I think he has to play for these clubs.’ However, the mention of Saracens appears to be a red herring. While the north London club were linked to Armitage in initial French reports, Sportsmail has learned that they have 'no interest' in bringing him to Allianz Park. Last year's Aviva Premiership and Heineken Cup finalists already have two high-class opensides in Will Fraser and Jacques Burger. The first reports in France also suggested that Toulon had been approached by the RFU about the possibility of releasing Armitage from his contract, but union sources have insisted that this is not true.

England's coaches are monitoring the situation and would welcome the prospect of a pedigree breakdown poacher putting added pressure on their established captain and first-choice No 7, Chris Robshaw. Armitage won five caps for England in 2009 and 2010, but his sensational form amid Toulon’s squad of Galacticos has led to repeated calls for the national coaches to recall him, despite the RFU’s stance against the selection of players based overseas. In theory, if Bath were to sign Armitage by tomorrow, he could make his debut in their opening match in the new European Champions Cup - at Glasgow on Saturday. His arrival would surely come too late to earn a late call-up to England's squad for the autumn Tests, but strong form in the coming months would force him into contention for the Six Nations early next year.","Toulon coach Bernard Laporte has hinted that a move could happen .

"Sam Burgess is still at least six weeks away from kick-starting his Bath career, according to head coach Mike Ford. Burgess' arrival in Bath could now be delayed by a month, after the England rugby league international's successful surgery to repair a shattered cheekbone and eye socket. The 25-year-old suffered the nasty injury in the opening exchange of South Sydney Rabbitohs' first NRL Grand Final victory in 43 years. Sam Burgess fractured his cheekbone and eye socket playing for the South Sydney Rabbitohs last week . The former England rugby league star played almost the whole match despite picking up the injury early on . Burgess played through the pain in his last rugby league clash before joining Bath, to lead South Sydney to 30-6 victory over the Canterbury Bulldogs. Bath told Burgess to take as long as he needs recuperating in Sydney after surgery, but now Ford expects him to arrive in the west country in the next month. ""He's had the operation and we're now figuring out a time for him to come over,"" said Ford, after Bath's 29-22 Aviva Premiership defeat at Wasps. ""So it will be two to four weeks for his arrival, and yes probably six weeks roughly for a playing return."" Bath head coach Mike Ford says the code-switching Burgess will not play for his team for at least six weeks . Bath lost to Wasps 29-22 on Sunday, as they await Burgess' arrival, and will welcome his addition . Bath's big-money capture Burgess was aiming to arrive in the city on October 15 on order to get acclimatised period to rugby union. The line-breaking talent is still viewed as a wildcard option for England's Rugby World Cup 2015 bid, with head coach Stuart Lancaster keeping tabs on his progress. Bath will aim to throw Burgess into initial action in the centres, with England viewing his game-breaking talents as best suited to midfield too. Bath boss Ford wants to employ Burgess in the back-row in the long-run however, and his conversion to union continues to attract many observers with vested interests. Bath are adamant they will not rush Burgess' conversion, but Ford already admitting his cheekbone injury could prove a blessing in disguise.

"Stuart Lancaster will watch on anxiously this week as England’s stars enter an eight-week passage of the season which players’ union chiefs argue will be more physically and emotionally demanding than the World Cup itself. Tom Croft’s latest bout of knee surgery is the more recent blow and, with the European Champions Cup (EPC) kicking off on Friday, when Harlequins face Castres, and with Saracens, Sale, Northampton, Leicester and Wasps all in action on back-to-back weekends ahead of a four-Test international series against the All Blacks and co, Lancaster faces an anxious fortnight. Leicester and England flanker Croft, 28, had surgery on Thursday to remove a screw in his knee and is the ninth potential member of Lancaster’s Elite Player Squad for the November QBE internationals to be ruled out through injury. Tom Croft has had surgery on his knee and could be the ninth player to be sidelined from England's squad . England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be watching nervously as stars enter an intense eight-week period . With a further two EPC matches following clashes with New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia, there is growing concern demands on members of England’s Elite Player Squad — to be announced on October 22 — are too great. ‘The way the game is evolving, it is only getting more physical and more intense, more competitive, more running, more everything,’ said England and Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero, before he suffered a shoulder injury that meant another lengthy spell on the sidelines. ‘The number of games we play is definitely something that could be looked at, especially those guys who you want to go and play however many internationals a year. ‘You have to be careful what you say as well as a player. You sign the deals in the Premiership to play the amount of games you play. But going forward, bigger picture, long term, there is definitely room to at least look at that topic.’ Alex Corbisiero (R) has suffered a shoulder injury after complaining the game is getting too physical .

The Rugby Players’ Association, the body charged with representing the player’s interests, will not play a direct part but chief executive Damian Hopley has been given assurances that player’s concerns will be heeded. ‘It’s a treadmill that we put players on, especially at the top end,’ said Hopley. ‘The players who are the best in their field at club and international level are expected to deliver week in, week out. Having said that, the support these players get now has never been better and clubs would be mad to burn out key people. Do I think there is a crisis? No. Overall we are in a healthy place as a sport. But as a union we believe four weeks should be a minimum rest period for all players between seasons. Former England internationals James Simpson-Daniel and Andrew Sheridan (R) have been forced to retire . ‘We’re all excited about the new European fixtures and what they will deliver. But you need to look at having two European games followed by four autumn internationals — three against the best teams in the world — then two at the other end of it. It’s probably more demanding than a World Cup in terms of pressure put on players.’ With multi-million TV revenues central to the sport’s survival, it is almost impossible to see a future where less rugby is played. But there are clearly consequences as a result of the ‘bigger, stronger, faster’ culture. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday last season, in conjunction with the RPA, found that 28 professional players retired through injury during the season; an increase of almost 80 per cent over five years. It is unclear if that figure will be reduced this year but early signs are not promising. Former England internationals James Simpson-Daniel (ankle) and Andrew Sheridan (shoulder) have been forced to retire prematurely this season through injury. Wales international Jamie Roberts has said that he expects to suffer from arthritis by the time he reaches 40 . Last week, Wales international Jamie Roberts admitted he is ‘ready for arthritis when I’m 40’ as a result of the collisions he has experienced playing rugby. The WRU recently signed a deal with the Welsh regions which will see dual-contracted players limited to only 16 non-international matches a season. Many believe a similar deal should be struck in England. ‘We simply have no idea what sort of physical condition these players are going to be in in 10, 15, 20 years’ time,’ said Dr Barry O’Driscoll, who retired from the International Rugby Board’s medical advisory panel in 2011 in protest at the way rugby treated concussion. ‘We are seeing significant health issues with my generation [from the Seventies] of players which are clearly linked to playing rugby but we were not playing the same game the boys are playing today. You simply cannot compare the ferocious level of physicality we see week-in-week-out in the professional game.’ Harlequins boss Conor O’Shea, who received heavy criticism last season for giving his England players one week off following the Six Nations, but its widely viewed as one of the most progressive directors of rugby, said: ‘The game is more physical than I can ever remember. The issue of rest periods needs to be addressed.’","Stuart Lancaster will be sweating on fitness of England's stars ahead of international series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa & Australia .

"Bae Sang-Moon will enter the final day of the Frys.com Open with a four-shot lead after an excellent seven-under-par 65 in his third round in California. The South Korean made a sensational start to his round with five consecutive birdies from the second and although he dropped a couple of shots on the seventh and 13th, he went birdie-par-eagle-birdie on his final four holes. 'Four-shot lead makes me a little comfortable for Sunday, but I don't think about a win,' Sang-Moon said on the PGA Tour website. Bae Sang-Moon hits off from the third fairway of the Silverado Resort during the third round of Frys.com open . Bae, whose only victory on the PGA Tour came last May at the HP Byron Nelson Championship, held his nerve in the closing stages to hole a couple of clutch putts. A magnificent 15-footer on the last took him to 16-under for the tournament, which gives him a comfortable cushion over nearest challenger Zachary Blair. The American, who only earned his Tour card three weeks ago, has given himself an outside chance of reeling in Bae after his 69, which featured five birdies and two bogeys. 'It's been a pretty crazy four or five months, but it's been great,' Blair said. Sang-Moon follows his drive from the fourth tee during the third round of the competition in California . Overnight leader Martin Laird from Scotland fell back among a number of players five shots adrift of Bae following a disappointing 71 on Saturday. The 31-year-old Glaswegian has taken seven weeks off the Tour and looked to be back with a bang after two 67s in his opening two rounds but he was in patchy form in his third round. American trio Matt Kuchar, Brooks Koepka and Scott Langley are also on 11-under while compatriot Hunter Mahan, South Africa's Retief Goosen, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama  and Sweden's David Lingmerth are a shot further back.","Bae Sang-Moon has a four-shot lead going into the final day of the Frys.com Open in California .

"Doctors could be misdiagnosing up to a third of suspected cases of ME. Professor Julia Newton said many of those thought to be suffering from chronic fatigue are in fact suffering from postural tachycardia syndrome or PoTS. Unlike ME, this condition can be treated with a variety of medications and doctors suggest lifestyle changes can help as well. Suspected errors: Experts believe doctors could be misdiagnosing up to a third of suspected cases of ME . ME, which affects around 250,000 people in the UK, has long proved difficult for doctors to diagnose. In the absence of a reliable clinical test, they often rely on detecting symptoms such as tiredness, mood swings and memory problems. But Professor Newton, from Newcastle University’s institute for ageing and health, said around 80,000 ME sufferers may have PoTS. Around 110,000 people are thought to be affected by PoTS, which involves an abnormality in the nervous system. Also difficult to diagnose, it can be treated with a range of medication including beta blockers. ‘I would think that around one third of people with chronic fatigue syndrome, if they were properly tested, would have PoTs,’ Professor Newton told the Telegraph. Last year former EastEnders actress and Love Actually star Martine McCutcheon spoke about the seven years of her life she has lost to the illness . ‘PoTS is an abnormal response of the nervous system, but it is a spectrum, so some people will feel dizzy on standing, while others will actually black out. It affects the part of the nervous system that is actually outside our control.’ Her team studied 52 PoTS sufferers from an NHS clinic, who were diagnosed between 2009 and 2012, and 84 people from the PoTS UK charity. They found that young, well-educated females were the most likely to suffer from the syndrome. As with ME, scientists and doctors have struggled to find a definitive cause  of PoTS, but Professor Newton believes it is caused by hormonal changes or a virus. ME, which stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis, is slightly more common in women than men. Those severely affected are often bedbound due to their extreme fatigue, with scientists and doctors long puzzled by the disorder’s cause. It was once thought of as a disorder of the mind, referred to as the ‘yuppie flu’ by some sceptics. Other experts have claimed it is caused by a virus or is genetic in origin. Because it is so difficult to diagnose, doctors usually classify it  as sudden tiredness lasting  more than six months that is not explained by another illness, exercise or hard work. Previous studies have suggested that three quarters of ME sufferers have lost their job because of the condition and 2 per cent cannot leave their homes. Sonya Chowdhury, chief executive of the charity Action for ME, told the Mail last night: ‘The findings are really interesting. We know that misdiagnosis is a big issue and are aware of the association with PoTS. ‘GPs and other healthcare professionals regularly tell us about the difficulty in they have in diagnosing ME and the need for much more research into and education about the nature of ME.’ As there is no cure for ME, patients are given treatments including painkillers for muscle ache and behavioural therapy and exercise therapy. They are often advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, sugar and sweeteners in case they make their symptoms worse. Last year former EastEnders actress and Love Actually star Martine McCutcheon, 38, told about the seven years of her life she has lost to the illness.","ME affects around 250,000 people in the UK and is difficult to diagnose .

"Rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients . Rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients. Money is being been spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and even larger morgue fridges as a result of the obesity epidemic. Hospitals spent an estimated £5.5million over the past three years, according to the Daily Telegraph which used Freedom of Information information from two thirds of NHS trusts. The figure will prompt concern about the cost of dealing with the UK’s obesity epidemic, with campaigners describing the increasing financial burden on the health service as ‘unsustainable’. Around a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese – the second highest rate in Europe - and a further 40 per cent are overweight. But the financial burden on the NHS is likely to deepen in the future as obesity rates continue to soar. Information provided by hospital trusts across England and Wales revealed that bosses have ordered corridors to be widened and operating theatre doors reinforced to cope with heavier patients. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn forked out £30,000 on a storage fridge for the dead bodies of obese patients. At Yeovil District Hospital NHS Trust, a bariatric body cooling system that cools the bodies of obese patients who cannot fit in mortuary fridges was purchased for £15,000. Overall, the figures reveal the NHS spent £2million on bariatric equipment and adjustments in the last year, while around £1.68 million was spent the previous year. The NHS already spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses. Attempts to deal with the problem have led to unusual clinical decisions, with the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recently advising doctors to refer obese patients to Weigh Watchers classes. The National Obesity Forum’s Tam Fry said that costs are likely to continue rising. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn spent £30,000 on a fridge for dead bodies which were obese . He told the newspaper: ‘We are not seeing the end of the obesity problem and people are getting fatter. ‘It has got to such a point that so much now has to be widened and strengthened. That runs to beds, hoists, wheelchairs and operating tables. And it also includes ambulances, morgues and crematoriums.’ Mr Fry added: ‘I think these costs will continue to increase. The problem is what we saw as “big” 20 years ago is now normal.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra, a director of Action on Sugar, said: ‘Inaction is not an option. I think diets should be made part of health policy.‘We need to tackle the root cause, the food environment - otherwise we will be crippled by the cost.’ A spokesman for NHS England said that it did not comment on the spending choices of individual trusts and clinical commissioning groups.","Money spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and larger morgue fridges .

"Women now represent 5.7 per cent of trade workers while the numbers of migrant workers fell to 4.6 per cent from 8 per cent (file photo) A record number of trade workers including builders, plumbers and plasterers are now women, new research reveals. The rise in female workers – dubbed ‘white-van women’ - to almost 6 per cent of the industry is said to have resulted from a rise in women turning to DIY to improve their homes. The surge is also put down to employers seeking tradespeople who are reliable and good with customer service – which many believe women are better at. These figures have been accompanied by a drop in the number of foreign migrants working as builders and tradesmen, which has virtually halved in the past four years, according to a study of 10,000 in the industry. Women now represent 5.7 per cent of trade workers, according to the research by IronmongeryDirect, while the numbers of migrant workers fell to 4.6 per cent from 8 per cent. ‘Despite the UK moving out of the recession and the economy showing signs of growth, the UK appears less of an attractive prospect to migrant workers looking to find work, with numbers falling dramatically,’ said Wayne Lysaght-Mason, of Ironmongery Direct. ‘It’s also interesting to see that women now represent a significant, if still small, proportion of the sector. The emergence of white-van women could be a major trend as the economy continues to grow.’ He added: ‘We’re seeing more employers actively seeking to employ females. More women are working as interior designers like Gabrielle Blackman (pictured left with Dominic Littlewood) for the programme Beware Cowboy Builders . The rise in female workers to almost 6 per cent of the industry is said to have resulted from a rise in women turning to DIY to improve their homes and inspired by TV programmes with presenters like Melinda Messenger . ‘Attitudes in this workplace are changing, and there is a rise in women enrolling on trade courses and getting jobs in the industry. ‘It’s an attractive career route for many, and for which women are just as suited as men.’ This growth is reflected in the launch of Women in Trade magazine at the end of last year - the first tradeswomen-focused magazine in the UK. Janet Kirlew, its editor in chief, said: ‘The most common comments from these women who started their own business in a trade were that they believed that they can make a huge difference, even though the UK labour market is still very segregated.’ Sue Wimpenny, managing director of The Lady Builder, is one of the new breed of women who are changing the face of the industry . She added: ‘One of the most common reasons why they set up their business was due to their own frustration and difficulty in finding competent and reliable tradespeople with good customer service. They recognised a gap in the market.’ In 2012 DIY store B&Q revealed they experienced a five-fold increase in the female take-up of their workshops across the country. More than 3,200 enrolled in classes to learn skills such as plastering, wall tiling, changing taps and hanging wallpaper in July 2012 compared to 592 at the previous year. This dramatic increase was said to be the beginning of a growing trend that shows no signs of slowing down. Some women have been made redundant from careers as diverse as banking to events managing or have previously been stay at home mothers who have gone on to set up their own companies. Jeremy Brett, the director of the Consumer Protection Association, said he has also noticed a change in the industry. ‘We have been operating in the building and home-improvement industry for over 20 years and there has been a quantum shift,’ he said. ‘Wind back 20 years and it was very rare to see woman working in the building trade, but we are seeing a change.’ He added: ‘It’s also changing at a management level - we’re seeing more woman taking roles as CEOs and directors. The perception is still that it is a male profession, but I don’t know how long that will be the reality for.’ A spokesman for the Guild of Master Craftsmen also commented: ‘We have many female members in a variety of trades including bricklaying, decorating, plumbing, landscape gardening and interior design.’ UK Trades Training, based in South Shields, for instance had just one woman turning up for a tiling course in 2004. It now gets around 30 a year enrolling in training for trades including tiling, plastering, bathroom installation and kitchen fitting.","Women now represent 5.7 per cent of .

"Kate Robertson was on the other side of the world when she received a mysterious message from her fiancé asking her to call. Expecting the good news that Mike Brandon had landed a job, Miss Robertson felt her future disappear when he uttered the words ‘I think I’ve got leukaemia’. But given only 60 days to find a life-saving stem cell donor, Miss Robertson found herself racing home with one thought – to save her husband-to-be’s life and their dream wedding. Match: Kate Robinson's campaign has found a donor for Mr Brandon who was told her husband had leukaemia . An ecstatic Miss Robertson, 31, was yesterday told that a match had finally been secured after she launched a desperate nationwide campaign to find a donor. And her ‘inspirational’ quest could now save thousands of other lives after the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan revealed that the couple’s story had prompted a surge in donors coming forward. The charity said that Miss Robertson’s online drive had led to a 650 per cent increase in the number of people joining the bone marrow register. Miss Robertson said last night: ‘It’s been an incredibly difficult time so the relief we’re feeling is overwhelming. ‘We know we have a rocky road ahead as a transplant is a serious procedure, but knowing there is a good match for Mike is a fantastic boost that we desperately needed.’ Mr Brandon, 29, will undergo the operation in June and is currently in Bristol Royal Infirmary undergoing an intense course of chemotherapy. The zoology graduate proposed to Miss Robertson while walking across Porlock Bay in Exmoor . The zoology graduate proposed to Miss Robertson while walking across Porlock Bay in Exmoor only three weeks before she was due to go on a six-month backpacking trip of South Asia. Shortly after she left he started to experience night sweats and fatigue and was delivered the shock diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in March. Doctors told Mr Brandon that his condition was so severe that he only had until the start of July – when his chemotherapy ends – to find a donor. Miss Robertson described the revelation as the ‘the worst day of her life’, adding: ‘I was completely shocked when he told me. My only plan was to get home.’ Luckily, she returned her fiancé’s call only a day before going on a three-week trek in Nepal where she would have been out of contact. Mr Brandon was initially told that there was a 60 per cent chance one of his three brothers would provide a positive match. When none of the brothers were deemed suitable, the couple contacted Anthony Nolan and soon took their race against time to the internet where it grabbed attention across the world. Miss Robertson, a physiotherapist who lives in Bristol, described the response to her campaign as ‘astounding’. ‘Knowing that there is so much support out there and to be able to visibly see the results of what we are trying to achieve has lifted everyone’s spirits,’ she said. ‘Both Mike and I have loved reading through the posts and messages that have been coming through.’ Behind Miss Robertson’s vigorous drive to find a donor for her husband is a poignant tale of previous personal tragedy. Her father developed a blood clot in his leg in 2005 and collapsed and died in front of her mother and sister. A few weeks later her grandmother died, with her grandfather dying of a broken heart eight days after the tragedy. When her mother’s best friend Simon moved in to the family home to provide support, they were delivered another blow when he suffered a brain haemorrhage and died within two months. ...‘Even at the outset we wanted to help . make sure that there will be matching donors for other people going . through the same agonising wait - other people’s brothers and sisters, . sons and daughters, mums and dads, and lifelong partners’ Kate Robertson . After meeting her future partner in 2009, Miss Robertson found fulfilment in life once again and her determination to act as his ‘rock’ has been driven by this love. As well as remaining determined to support her husband-to-be throughout his illness, Miss Robertson said it was always her intention to help others. She said: ‘The campaign was never just about finding a donor for Mike. ‘Even at the outset we wanted to help make sure that there will be matching donors for other people going through the same agonising wait - other people’s brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, mums and dads, and lifelong partners.’ Although reluctant to think beyond the operation, the couple have already got plans in place for the future. A job as an ecology assistant is being held for Mr Brandon, whose family is from Somerset, and their wedding reception is due to be held in the Roberston family’s garden next summer. Speaking about the wedding, Miss Robertson said: ‘Pre-diagnosis he didn’t get too excited about wedding plans anyway, you know what boys are like. ‘I’ve told him that until we get past the transplant, we don’t have to mention it.’ She is also running the #shake4mike campaign, encouraging people to post pictures of themselves online ‘shaking their faces at leukaemia’ and urging them to join the register. The couple’s Facebook page has already attracted more than 2,000 members, while Miss Robertson was also invited to sing up donors before Tottenham Hotspur’s last game of the season. Anthony Nolan said that more than 7,000 people applied to the register online between May 4 and 12, compared to 939 people during the same period in 2013. The charity’s Ann O’Leary said: ‘We are absolutely delighted that a matching donor has been found for Mike. ‘His story inspired thousands of people to sign up as donors, any one of whom could go on to save the life of someone like Mike in years to come.’","Kate Robertson had to find a donor for fiance Mike Brandon, 29 .

"A JP Morgan executive leapt to his death from the bank’s European headquarters in London after using bolt cutters to break out on to the roof, an inquest heard. Gabriel Magee fell 500ft to his death as horrified workers arrived at the building in Canary Wharf. A day earlier the ‘brilliant’ IT executive had written ‘jump’ on his computer. Gabriel's father Bill Magee (left) accused JP Morgan of 'murder by omission' after the inquest. In court, Lucy Pinches (right) said her ex-boyfriend was fascinated by parallel universes and a couple who had a suicide pact . Poplar Coroner's Court heard Mr Magee had . a 'dark side' and was repeatedly captured on CCTV trying to get onto . the roof of the tower block in the weeks before his death. After . the breakdown of a long-term relationship, Mr Magee had developed an . obsession with a bizarre suicide pact involving two students. In the months leading up to his death he had tried to access the 33-storey building’s roof on several occasions. Security . bosses at the bank  said it had been discovered  that he had been on a . number of reconnaissance missions to the bank’s upper floors. Following . his death, investigators also unearthed notes on his computer . expressing self-hatred and reminding himself to ‘try to jump off the . building’. Mr Magee’s father . accused the bank of ‘negligence’ and ‘murder by omission’ last night, . suggesting that ‘something more sinister’ was behind his son’s death. CCTV footage showed Mr Magee, who had worked at the bank for 10 years, climbing on to the roof on the night of January 27. Before he jumped he sent his girlfriend . Veronica Strande several text messages while he sat drinking tequila on . the roof of the building, the inquest heard. His . ex-girlfriend Lucy Pinches said today Mr Magee had an obsession with . the concept of parallel universes and a suicide pact of two U.S. students. 'There was a story of a double suicide in the States where two students had killed themselves, she said. 'It . was to do with quantum physics and suicide, the two students were . linked up to lethal injections which were operated by lottery numbers. 'So the only universe they would wake up in would be the one they both won the lottery in. 'That . was something Gabe thought about a lot and had the mental capacity to . think about it a lot, with the equations and the physics.' Tragedy: IT executive Gabriel Magee was found dead at the end of January after jumping from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, and landing on a surrounding roof . The . couple had split up in late 2012 after an on-off four-year . relationship, which began to break down after his behaviour became more . and more unusual. She . continued: 'He was a very unique person, he was incredibly intelligent, . he had a brilliant mind, he was very kind and affectionate, he was . creative, he had a sense of adventure, he liked trying new things. 'But he did have a darker side to him that I found was always there. 'I always felt he suffered from some kind of depression and at various stages it was worse, some times it was better, but he had a darkness that was linked to his creativity.' Mr Magee leapt from the top floor of the tower at around 8am on January 28 and had fallen 24 floors onto a ninth storey roof, which surrounds the base of the bank's European Headquarters. A therapist who treated Mr Magee over ten months in 2012 said she had no reason to suspect that he was at high risk of committing suicide. However security logs from his key card and CCTV footage showed him carrying out reconnaissance to get onto the roof of the building in the months before he jumped. JP Morgan investigator Jonathan . Shatford told the court that he was also seen on external cameras . standing outside the building looking at the roof. Access to the top floor of the holding . is limited to an alarmed fire exit and an access hatch with a padlock, . which had been removed when police arrived on the scene. Tragedy: Mr Magee's girlfriend Veronica Strande, pictured with his father Bill Magee, received several text messages before he killed himself . On . two occasions Mr Magee was seen climbing a steel step ladder into the . hatch, after attempting to swipe out of the fire exit with his staff ID . card. He was last seen on . CCTV at 20.11 moving around on top of the roof. When police and Mr . Shatford went to investigate they found a pair of bolt cutters, a mobile . phone and tablet beside an empty bottle of tequila. Mr Magee, known as 'Gabe' to friends, had lived in the UK since 2007. He . had spent nearly a decade at the firm, where he specialised in . cutting-edge software that makes huge profits by predicting patterns in . the market. However a . colleague told his inquest that his job was 'low-stress' and had seemed . 'extremely happy' in the days before his death. Manager Andrew Harling said that Mr Magee had acted 'out of character' on three occasions in the year before his suicide. Close friend and colleague Mark Gibbons was given the grim task of gathering Mr Magee's belongings together. He said: 'As part of the process of getting his personal effects together we spent quite a long time going through his desk. Family: Mr Magee's sister Daniela was also at the inquest where a verdict of suicide was recorded . 'There was nothing on there . particularly untoward about suicide or the building itself. There was a . map of Canary Wharf, but there was nothing to indicate that he had . actively done any reconnaissance on the building to find an area.' But Mr Gibbons said his friend was having 'some very unusual thoughts and confided with me about them. 'He thought Lucy was maybe a witch.' Mr Magee's father, Bill, had travelled to the UK with sister, Gabriela, to hear details of the time leading to his death. According . to his current girlfriend Veronica Strande Mr Magee had emailed her the . evening before his death saying he was 'running late'. She told the inquest he had never talked about taking his own life. She . said: 'On the Sunday before it happened we had hours of conversation . about our future and what we wanted. I know that he was very happy with . his work arrangements. 'He . had just made his citizenship application and we had spoken about where . we wanted to live together. With British citizenship we could go an move . to somewhere in Europe. 'There . was nothing mentioned about being upset with anything. He was looking . forward to the future, what we wanted, what we wanted to see, what we . wanted to do and what we wanted to achieve.' Recording . death by suicide Senior Coroner Mary Hassell said that Mr Magee's . battle with psychological illness would have led to struggle at work, . rather than work stress being a driver behind the death. Gabriel's father Bill Magee refused to accept the suicide verdict, accusing JP Morgan of 'murder by omission'. He demanded to know why JP Morgan security staff did not stop his son accessing the roof. Speaking outside the court, he said: 'Why wasn't he stopped? 'The . security features in place - cameras and entry alarms - should have . alerted security and they should have taken responsibility for keeping . any JP Morgan employee from accessing the roof of the JP Morgan . building. 'This negligence on the part of JP Morgan cost my son his life. That negligence killed my son.' The . inquest heard that Mr Magee accessed security the top floors of the . building via a fire escape, according to his security pass logs. However, his movements were not analysed because his pass allowed him into those areas from his office on the ninth floor. Checks . of the pass and CCTV after his death showed he made several visits to . the top level of the building, once in November 2013 and once in . January, days before he died. Mr Magee, speaking after the inquest, said: 'I don't want to accept that [verdict]. 'He . drank enough tequila that whenever he fell he may have been looking to . say ""have I got the guts to do this"" and fell. He could have fallen.' In shock: A JP Morgan worker looks out of his window as Mr Magee's body was recovered in January, but it emerged today he had made several attempts to get on the roof before his death . Roof death:  Workers at Canary Wharf said hundreds were looking at the man's body from their windows . He added: 'Gabriel, our son, was crushed by that fall, as were the hearts of his brother and sisters and his mother and I.' In the inquest Mr Magee asked Jonathan Shatford, JP Morgan's head of investigations, how his son had been able to access the roof. Mr Shatford replied that their security was focused on preventing unauthorised people getting in rather than people breaking out. Mr Shatford said: 'JP Morgan is not a prison, it is a place of work.' He said Gabriel Magee had cut open a lock on a hatch on the fire escape, which was next to an alarmed door which would have alerted security if he had tried to open it. Bolt cutters and the broken lock were found on the roof. In her summing up, Mrs Hassell agreed with Mr Shatford, and concluded Gabriel Magee had carried out a 'considered act'. She added: 'JP Morgan have of course a duty of care to their employees and a duty to keep them as safe as possible. 'But there has to be a balance that is struck between the safety of employees and... not imprisoning the employees. 'If there had been a fire and any escape route had been blocked we would be here asking why that was.' A spokesman for JP Morgan said: 'Our heartfelt condolences go out to Gabriel’s family and friends. We are focused on supporting our colleagues and those close to him on this very difficult day.'","'Brilliant' Gabriel Magee had repeatedly tried to get on Canary Wharf roof .

"Tragic: Ben Cowburn, 18,was found dead in December 2010 . A popular TV comedian dedicated a performance to a teenage boy who had killed himself just months after allegedly being ‘groomed’ by the star. An inquest has heard the gay comedian ‘took advantage’ of Ben Cowburn after introducing the fashion student to his ‘hedonistic lifestyle’, involving parties fuelled by alcohol and drugs. But despite the serious nature of the accusations against the comedian, he was referred to simply as ‘Mr X’ during the inquest after the coroner backed an informal agreement to protect his name. An MP criticised the decision last night and said the public should be concerned if there are ‘deals being done behind closed doors preventing basic facts coming into the public domain’. The inquest heard that the teenager was showered with gifts and promised a job by the celebrity, but spiralled into depression after falling out with the star, who left him feeling ‘belittled and humiliated’. When their relationship ended Ben, 18, was left feeling ‘dirty and used’ and was admitted to a mental health hospital, where he killed himself. Months after the teenager’s death, the comedian posted an affectionate message on the internet in which he named Ben and dedicated a show to him. Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon made the decision to protect the star’s identity after talks with lawyers representing the NHS and the Cowburn family. They decided that it would be unfair to name the star as he had not been questioned, cautioned or arrested by the police, despite them being aware of the allegations. He was not asked to give evidence to the inquest. Criticising the move, Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Nobody should be going down the legal route to prevent the disclosure of basic facts around a court hearing. ‘The public need to know that key evidence and key facts are not being kept from them.’ The inquest last week heard how the older man had crept into bed beside Ben after a late-night party, later engaging in a sex act. At another party the teenager was persuaded to strip by a group of men and groped before a partygoer intervened. In a statement to the inquest, Ben’s twin sister Sophia said that the family had ‘concerns’ about him being ‘groomed by Mr X’. Scotland Yard was made aware of allegations that Ben ‘may have been the victim of a serious sexual assault’. But after interviewing nurses involved in his care, the Met decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’. Bereaved: Sharon and Steve Cowburn, Ben's parents, are pictured arriving at the inquest a week ago . The talented student first met the star in a pub after he moved to London from his family home in Truro, Cornwall, to study at the Fashion Retail Academy, founded by billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green. When David Cameron visited the college in 2010, Ben asked him a question and in his first year he was chosen to attend a lunch with Sir Philip. The comedian was unavailable for comment yesterday. The inquest continues today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","TV comedian allegedly 'took advantage' of 18-year-old Ben Cowburn .

"Living alongside Emma Thompson and Imelda Staunton on one of the smartest streets in London, Susanne Willumsen might have thought she couldn’t go too far wrong by sprucing up her home. But when she smoothed away the pebble dash on the front of the house, neighbourly relations quickly turned rocky.

Some neighbours have come forward to support her, saying the original pebble dash facade looked ‘cheap’ and it was a shame her ‘transformation’ would be lost. But in their letter to the council, the residents’ association claimed the work was a ‘severe violation’ that ‘jarred’ with the character of the exclusive street in West Hampstead, north London, where house prices average £3million. Miss Thompson and her mother Phyllida Law live on the road, as does Miss Staunton and her husband, Downton Abbey star Jim Carter. And Miss Law has even lent her support to Ms Willumsen, saying: ‘I’d rather they replaced the pebble dash than dug out one of those awful basement holes and added extra floors underneath.’ The bizarre row began after Ms Willumsen employed builders to refurbish her home and they removed the pebble dash. The West End Green conservation area advisory committee – which has some members living on the street – complained to Camden Council and she was sent an enforcement notice. The council said that the work had been carried out in a conservation area without the required planning permission, ‘causing harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene’. Ms Willumsen’s application for . retrospective permission was dismissed and she was given three months to . reverse the work. In appeal documents, she said she had canvassed the . opinion of her neighbours who were unopposed to the new facade. She . said it was her belief that the ‘unfortunate situation’ was caused by a . ‘somewhat personal challenge’. But the conservation body said a . ‘significant number’ of neighbours were ‘unhappy that the finish is out . of keeping with the rest of the street’. Exclusive: The house is in West Hampstead, where the average price of a home is £3million . Neighbours: The street is also home to the actresses Imelda Staunton and Oscar-winner Emma Thompson . An anonymous letter written by a member of the group said that the ‘unique mix of Edwardian and Victorian architectural features’ in the area was ‘being eroded through unsympathetic, and in many cases, forbidden alterations’. Rejecting Ms Willumsen’s appeal, planning inspector David Rose said the white finish was ‘stark and bland’ and removing pebble dash would ‘result in the loss of local character and distinctiveness’. But Norwegian Ms Willumsen told the Daily Mail her neighbours were disappointed that she had lost the battle with the council. She said: ‘I didn’t specifically ask for [the pebble dash] to be removed. The builders said they did it to all of the houses [in the area] and said it had never been an issue. Unfortunately, in my road, it is an issue. ‘Anyone walking along the street would see that not all the houses are pebble dashed. ‘I’ve accepted my fate. I just think the rules should be clearer for  residents about what can and  can’t be done. It’s such a shame because the builders have created such a beautiful finish and now I have to ask them to put the pebble dashing up.’","Susanne Willumsen, 45, lives in same London street as Emma Thompson .

"A foreign nurse who force-fed her baby to death cannot be deported because it would breach her right to a family life. The Ghanaian woman won her fight to stay in Britain under controversial human rights laws. And even though the 33-year-old was named in the widely-reported court case that saw her jailed for causing the baby’s death, she has now been granted anonymity. The woman, who can only be referred to as GHA has been granted lifetime anonymity as well as leave to remain in the UK unconditionally (picture posed by model) Having served her three-year sentence, she has been free since April last year to look after her three surviving children. Last night one MP said the situation was ‘perverse’ and called the immigration tribunal’s ruling ‘warped’. Home Secretary Theresa May has made repeated attempts to remove the woman, who can be referred to only as GHA. The case will again raise questions about the use of the European Convention on Human Rights to protect criminals. The Home Office said the ruling was ‘disappointing’. The nurse, who came to the UK on a student visa in 2000, used a small milk jug to tip baby rice African corn porridge and chicken soup into her child’s mouth. GHA’s legal victory – using Article 8 of the European Convention – means that she has been allowed to remain in the UK unconditionally with her family and been granted lifetime anonymity. Home Secretary Theresa May made several attempts to deport the woman, who can only be referred to as GHA, before today's ruling which was described as 'perverse' by a Conservative back bencher . Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP who has called for the reining-in of human rights laws, said: ‘Many people will look at this case, a mother jailed for force-feeding her baby and feel it reflects the warped nature of our human rights laws today. ‘The argument is that she is being separated from her kids but not only was she separated from them in prison but there were also care proceedings brought against her. 'The children have also spent periods of time in Ghana so the arguments for not deporting her fall away. It shows how the judges have expanded and shifted the goalposts from human rights in a way that is pretty arbitrary and perverse. ‘It does not reflect anything written into the ECHR and certainly not anything Parliament has agreed to. ‘Article 8 is being used by convicted, jailed criminals to stay in this country. This isn’t the only case. I actually think the article can be a threat to family life, in particular vulnerable children and partners.’ He said that almost 90 per cent of successful deportation appeals are using Article 8 – up to 400 cases a year: ‘Article 8 is the single biggest problem for deporting a serious foreign criminal and this is something that has only really developed in the last seven years. What will it be like in another seven? It could be almost impossible to deport someone.’ Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said that the use of human rights law to protect the nurse was ‘crazy’. He added: ‘The ECHR was never intended to protect people who carry out terrible crimes from being sent back to their own country.’ The three-year sentence handed to GHA at the trial in 2011 meant that under Home Office rules she could be considered for automatic deportation. But attempts to deport her following her release from prison were rejected after she appealed and won her case at a lower immigration tribunal in February. When Mrs May launched an appeal to overturn the decision at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber last month, the earlier decision was upheld. A social services report deemed her children were under ‘no significant risk of harm’ and described the family as a ‘close, committed unit with strong cultural and religious beliefs’. Her partner was granted custody of the three children following care proceedings in 2010 and the family has lived in a three-bed London home since GHA’s release. During her trial it emerged that GHA, who had already applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK when her child died, had paid ‘little attention’ to social services who had been involved with the family. The Home Office said it was seeking to appeal against the tribunal’s decision. It added: ‘Through the recently passed Immigration Act, we are making it easier to remove people from the UK and harder for individuals to prolong their stay with spurious appeals, by cutting the number of appeal rights from 17 to four. ‘It will also ensure that judges deal with Article 8 claims in the right way — making clear the right to a family life is not regarded as absolute and unqualified.’","Ghanian nurse secures right to live in Britain despite killing her baby .

"Sir Richard Thompson attacked government plans to cut the NHS budget - saying it is  already 'under-doctored, under-nursed and under-funded' Overworked doctors are looking after up to 70 elderly patients during a single shift making it 'impossible' to provide adequate care, one of the UK’s top doctors has claimed. Sir Richard Thompson, head of the Royal College of Physicians, said that patient safety is being put at risk because doctors are so stressed and over stretched. He complained that some doctors can only spend five minutes investigating each patient’s symptoms - far below the recommended 15 minutes. Launching a strongly worded attack on the Government for cutting the NHS budget, he said that doctors 'miss things' as they are working under constant 'strain and stress'. The 73-year-old, whose college represents the vast majority of the UK’s 30,000 doctors working in hospitals, becomes the latest senior doctor to bemoan cutbacks to the health service. Criticising promises made by the Prime Minister to defend the NHS budget, Sir Richard said: ‘In spite of what weasly words people at the top say, money’s been taken out of the NHS.’ He said that ‘billions’ more needs to be invested in the NHS every year for it to operate effectively, calling for all political parties to devise additional funding strategies. Sir Richard also criticised Jeremy Hunt for 'slagging off the whole of the NHS', claiming the Health Secretary dwells on poor care over the good treatment received by patients. He added: ‘The NHS is under-doctored, under-nursed, under-bedded and under-funded. There are too few doctors to do the increasingly large job to a high standard, and safely, and compassionately.’ Guidelines suggest that doctors should treat a maximum of 20 patients during a single shift to ensure that they receive adequate levels of care. But Sir Richard said some medical professionals are having to attend to 70 people on one shift, including many elderly patients suffering from a range of medical problems - or what medics call 'multiply morbid.' He said this results in doctors running around ‘like a scalded cat’ during a typical seven-hour shift, with safety most concerning at weekends and on night shifts. ‘You try standing on your feet for seven . hours trying to be on the ball, thinking of the various complications, . being nice to patients, for seven hours. It’s absolutely destructive. Sir Richard said doctors are having to tend to up to 70 medically challenging patients every shift. Guidelines suggest doctors should treat a maximum of 20 patients (library image) ‘Not everyone has 70, but most people are looking after well over 20,’ he said in an interview with The Guardian. Sir Richard’s comments were backed by other leading doctors representing healthcare professionals. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Doctors are working harder than ever before as all NHS services come under enormous pressure from a combination of rising workload, falling resources and staff shortages in key specialities.’ He added: ‘Four years of pay cuts had left NHS staff feeling devalued and under attack.’ A Department of health spokesman said: ‘Patient safety and care is a priority for the government and it is right that we have high expectations for our NHS. 'While the NHS is one of the safest, most efficient healthcare systems in the world we should never shy away from trying to improve standards for patients.’","Sir Richard Thompson attacked Government plans to cut NHS budget .

"The Queen of Sweden has boycotted the prestigious Polar Music Prize awards ceremony due to the criminal past of one of the winners, U.S. rock legend Chuck Berry. The 87-year-old rock pioneer was found guilty of human trafficking involving a 14-year-old girl in 1960, whom he was also accused of having a sexual relationship with. Queen Silvia and her youngest daughter, Princess Madeleine of Sweden, both refused to attend the ceremony with the rest of the royal family, citing Berry’s conviction. Royal refusal: Queen Silvia and her daughter Princess Madeleine of Sweden refused to attend the Polar Music Prize awards ceremony due to winner Chuck Berry's trafficking conviction . Conviction: Legendary US rocker Chuck Berry, pictured in 2007, was found guilty of 'transporting an underage female across state lines for immoral purposes' in 1960 . The Polar Music Prize is Sweden's most prestigious award for musicians, founded by the late ABBA manager Stig Anderson. Winners Berry and American opera director Peter Sellars were announced in May this year and were honoured and awarded £87,000 (1million Swedish Kroner) at the prize ceremony on Tuesday. Although King Carl XVI Gustaf and the Crown Princess Victoria both attended the ceremony, the Queen and Princess Madeleine were notably absent. The Queen, the founder of children’s charity World Childhood Foundation which also employs Princess Madeleine, later explained that she had decided not to attend due to Berry’s previous conviction, and that she later went to a dinner to honour the second winner, Peter Sellars. God of rock: The 87-year-old musician was awarded the Polar Music Prize along with American opera director Peter Sellars, but could not attend the ceremony due to ill health . Unacceptable: The Queen said that as founder of children's charity World Childhood Foundation, she did not find it acceptable that she and Princess Madeleine attend a celebration of Chuck Berry . Royal decision: The Queen said her husband, King Carl XVI Gustaf and oldest daughter Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, both pictured with her husband Prince Daniel at the ceremony on Tuesday, respected her decision . Royal representation: Crown Princess Victoria  and Prince Daniel, whose daughter Princess Estelle started pre-school this week, attended the Polar Music Prize at Stockholm Concert Hall . ‘I felt that it was not ok for me to . be at the awards ceremony as there are so many people who believe in me, . in World Childhood Foundation and in the princess [Madeleine],’ Queen . Silvia told Expressen. ‘I did not do this for attention, I could not accept it,' ‘It was a family decision and the King respects my opinions and understands the situation very well.’ In . 1959, Chuck Berry was arrested under the Mann Act for ’transporting an . underage female across state lines for immoral purposes’. He . had met 14-year-old Janice Escalante in Mexico and took her to St . Louis, promising her a job as a coat-check girl at his night-club, . effectively taking her over three state lines. Second winner: U.S. theatre director Peter Sellars receives the Swedish Polar Music Prize from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at the prize ceremony . Escalante, who allegedly also worked as a prostitute, claims she had a sexual relationshiop with Berry, something which the now 87-year-old has always denied. He was convicted in March 1960, sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 (£3,011), but appealed against the conviction on the grounds that the judge had been making racist comments, using the n-word to refer to Berry throughout the trial, and had prejudiced the jury against him. After a second trial in 1961 the sentence was reduced to three years.  He served one-and-a-half years from February 1962 to October 1963. Chuck Berry did not attend the Polar Music Prize ceremony this week, citing ill health.","Rock legend Chuck Berry awarded Sweden's Polar Music Prize .

"The IRA staged an audacious attempt to assassinate Prince Philip in Australia during an official trip, a former spy has claimed. The Irish paramilitary group allegedly planted two bombs targeting the Duke of Edinburgh’s cortege as he travelled through Sydney in 1973. Both devices were located minutes before the royal visitor was due to pass, prompting an immediate security operation to allay the threat. Targeted: The Duke of Edinburgh pictured in November 1973 a few months after the IRA allegedly plotted to kill him with two bombs while he was on a state visit to Australia . Scene: One of the devices was found in a bin and another was located in a locker at Central Station (above), the largest station in Australia, which Prince Philip planned to visit . The plot unfolded when the Duke was on a two-day visit to Australia and the terrorist organisation was escalating its campaign of violence against Britain. One of the devices was found in a bin and another was located in a locker at Central Station, the largest station in Australia, which Prince Philip planned to visit. Members of the Royal Family were regarded as key targets for the IRA, who subsequently murdered the Queen’s cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, blowing up his boat off the Irish coast in 1979. Details of the assassination attempt have been revealed in a book by Australian journalist and former spy, Warner Russell. He claims that two further ‘decoy’ devices were also discovered opposite a government building that Prince Philip was due to open. There has been no official confirmation of his claims. Prince Philip - then aged 51 - was in the country to open an RAF memorial in Canberra. Scene: One of the devices was found in a bin and another was located in a locker at Central Station (above), the largest station in Australia, which Prince Philip planned to visit . Gratitude: Warner Russell, who alerted security to the plot, said he was later thanked for his 'sense of duty and service' by the Queen at a reception in Sydney years after the alleged attack . Mr Russell, 75, who was then working on the news desk of a newspaper, claims to have received a phone call 24 hours previously warning of the impending attack. According to the ex-spy, the anonymous caller said: ‘We are going to get that Greek b*****d, the Duke. He is a dead man.’ After informing an intelligence contact about the call, he was informed the threat was ‘credible’ and probably involved the IRA. Mr Russell also claims that the Australian government ordered a so-called ‘D-notice’ on the media, to prevent the plot being revealed to the public, although a short story later appeared in the New York Times detailing the discovery of the bombs. Recalling the day of the visit on March 15, 1973, Mr Russell said: ‘The Royal Protection team ordered the approaching vehicles and the police motorcycle escort by radio to take evasive action. ‘The crudely made explosives were secured by an army bomb disposal team and later taken to a Commonwealth forensic laboratory for examination.’ Mr Russell said he was later thanked for his ‘sense of duty and service’ by the Queen at a reception in Sydney years after the alleged attack.","Plot unfolded in 1973 as Duke of Edinburgh travelled through Sydney .

"A Rochester, New York, man has been indicted on charges of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State militant group and attempting to murder U.S. soldiers, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday. A federal grand jury in Rochester handed down a seven-count indictment against US citizen Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, following an investigation by the FBI's Rochester Joint Terrorism Task Force, a Justice Department statement said. According to court records, Elfgeeh, beginning last year, tried to help three people - two of whom were cooperating with the FBI - to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State, a Sunni militant group that has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . US Marshalls lead Mufid A. Elfgeeh, 30, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen, out of federal court following a hearing in Rochester, New York in June . 'Elfgeeh also plotted to shoot and kill members of the United States military who had returned from Iraq,' authorities said. 'As part of the plan to kill soldiers, Elfgeeh purchased two handguns equipped with firearm silencers and ammunition from a confidential source.' The FBI made the guns inoperable before the confidential source gave them to the suspect, the Justice Department statement said, adding Elfgeeh was in custody. 'With today's indictment of Mufid Elfgeeh, the government demonstrates that it will use all available tools to disrupt and defeat ISIS,' William Hochul, U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in the statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. Court documents revealed at the indictment also allege that Elfgeeh sent $600 via Western Union to a Yemeni man he wanted to join ISIS. Mufid Elfgeeh is accused of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State by helping three men who said they would travel to Syria to engage in violent jihadî alongside the group's militants, according to the Justice Department . Heavily armed: New York City police officers stand guard in Times Square on September 17, 2014 in New York City. A blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mentioned Times Square as a target for bombing . On patrol: A blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) said Times Square could be a target for bombing . President Barack Obama is seeking to build an international coalition to fight the militant group. The three charges of material support to Islamic State each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and the attempted murder charge carries up to a 20-year sentence. The suspect also faces charges for possession of firearms and silencers. Disrupting and holding accountable those who seek to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations is and shall remain a critical national security priority,"" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin. Indicted on Tuesday on terror charges: Mufid Elfgeeh, of Rochester, N.Y., is shown here in his arrest photo from May this year . Elfgeeh was arrested in May by members of the FBI's Rochester Joint Terrorism Task Force after federal authorities said he bought two handguns and two silencers as part of a plan to kill members of the U.S. armed forces returning from war, as well as Shiites in the Rochester area. The investigation included linking Elfgeeh's home computer to tweets from alias Twitter accounts expressing support for al-Qaida, violent holy war and Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, according to court papers. The FBI said it had been investigating Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen, since early last year. Information on Elfgeeh's lawyer was not immediately available. Elfgeeh's publicly appointed defense attorney has said they had seen the indictment and would be entering a plea of not guilty in court on Thursday. His support for the terror group was made public on social media, with Twitter postings boasting of his love of ISIS (also known as ISIL and the the Islamic State). Elfgeeh allegedly wrote to Twitter, 'Al Qaeda said it loud and clear: we are fighting the American invasion and their hegemony over the earth and the people.' While another message about ISIS says, (they) 'will one day rule the world with the will of Allah.' FBI informants claim that the Yemeni-born owner of Mojoe's supermarket in Rochester wanted to help arm and supply ISIS with jihadists - setting up their travel arrangements and contacts under the codename 'going to the university'. Crowded: ISIS has urged supporters to create homemade pipe bombs and set them off in popular U.S. tourist destinations like Times Square (pictured) According to CNN federal investigators are also examining whether he had plans of his own to launch terror attacks within the United States. According to the affidavit heard in court yesterday, Elfgeeh said he could kill 'five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then w will post video or another message online' in an effort to explain why he did it. 'We want ... to start shooting those who were in the Army who went to Iraq,' he said in April according to the affidavit, reported CNN. Attorney General Eric Holder said the case shows the authorities are using 'all the investigative tools at our disposal'. 'We will remain aggressive in identifying and disrupting those who seek to provide support to ISIL and other terrorist groups that are bent on inflicting harm upon Americans,' Holder said. '... We are focused on breaking up these activities on the front end, before supporters of ISIL can make good on plans to travel to the region or recruit sympathizers to this cause.' This comes as ISIS called for attacks on targets on US soil. The new threats surfaced this week, as an Upstate New York man was indicted on charges he encouraged three men to travel to Syria and fight for the extremist group. The post written on a known terrorist forum includes a list of ingredients and instructions on how to assemble a pipe bomb, with directions to set the explosives off at sites like Times Square, the Las Vegas Strip and mass-transit stations across the country.","Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, of Rochester, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Tuesday .

"A 46-year-old woman reeling from a break-up shot dead her 15-year-old son Thursday morning, set her house on fire and then turned the gun on herself in a tragic murder-suicide her daughter says was 'preventable'. The bodies of Carla Gilliland and her son Parker Gilliland-Wampler were found inside their burning home on North Red Hill Road in Ellettsville, Indiana Thursday morning. On the morning of July 10, neighbors heard the sound of gun shots before they saw the Gilliland's home become engulfed in flames. The Monroe County Coroner ruled Parker's death Friday a homicide, and his mother's death a suicide. Scroll down for video . Murder-suicide: The bodies of 15-year-old Parker Gilliland-Wampler (lef) and his mother Carla Gilliland (right) were found inside their burning home on Thursday morning. Police believe Gilliland shot dead her son before setting the house on fire and shooting herself. Overcome with sadness: In the weeks leading up to the fire, Gilliland had allegedly become depressed due to domestic issues with Parker's father . Police believe Gilliland first shot dead her son, before starting the fire and then shot herself. Monroe County Sheriff's Detective Sgt Brad Swain said the family had been dealing with some 'domestic issues' involving Gilliland and Parker's father in the weeks leading up to the incident. He also said that Gilliland had made comments about wanting to hurt herself and her son. One witness told WTHR that Gilliland was having a hard time dealing with a 'family breakup'. 'She's just been sad lately, depress. Some issues she didn't share,' a neighbor named Angel said. 'Tried to help out as much as we could. It's just a tragedy. Warning signs: Police say they were called to the home Parker shared with his mother in the weeks leading up to Thursday's tragic incident . Police were even called to the residence sometime in the past few weeks when Parker expressed concern about his mom's behavior. However, police did not seem to intervene as the boy remained under his mother's guardianship. Sgt Swain did not provide details about the call since no report was filed. 'I would caution we have legal parameters to operate by, and child protective services has parameters they have to operate by, and they are restricting sometimes,' Swain said. 'There are situations where people have family matters and worries, and they may have expectations that can’t be met by public safety and social services, because we have to follow guidelines written in our laws and in our Constitution.' But Katie Gilliland, Parker's older sister, has shot back at Sgt Swain in a Facebook post, writing that her little brother told police his mother made threats on his life and they did not act. Trapped: Parker's sister Katie Gilliland says her brother told police in the last few weeks that he feared for his life, but that they made him stay with his mother anyway . 'You talk about these parameters you have to follow. But when a teenage boy tells a [S]heriff that his mom has a gun and wants to shoot him, your [sic] telling me it's in the [C]onstitution to make him stay with her. False. Katie elaborated about her brother's 'preventable' death on a GoFundMe page that has been started to raise money for funeral costs. 'I would like everyone to know. That the system failed,' she wrote. 'It failed me. And it most certainly failed my baby brother. CPS and [Sheriff's] department were aware that [P]ark was afraid for his life to be in that house...Yet they made him go back.'

"The Lockerbie bombing was ordered by Iran and carried out by a Syrian-based terror group, an Iranian defector has claimed. Britain’s worst terror atrocity, in which 270 people died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded above the Scottish town in December 1988, has always been blamed on Libya. But a former Iranian intelligence agent – now living under a witness protection scheme in Germany – has said publicly for the first time that the attack was ordered by Iran in revenge for the accidental downing of an Iranian commercial jet by the US Navy in 1988. It is also claimed that the bomb was placed on the doomed flight at Heathrow, rather than in Malta as had been thought. Tragedy: The wreckage of Pan Am 103, the bombed airliner which exploded over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 243 passengers, 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground . It was carried out by Palestinian terrorists based in Syria, he says, and not on the orders of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The atrocity killed 243 passengers, 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie. Ex-spy Abolghassem Mesbahi claims in a documentary aired tonight on Al Jazeera that former Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini wanted to mirror the 1988 US strike on an Iranian Airbus and recruited a Syrian-based group to plan an attack. Mesbahi, who defected to Germany in the 1990s, said that the supreme leader, who died in 1989, wanted revenge. He told documentary makers from Al Jazeera: ‘Iran decided to retaliate as soon as possible. The decision was made by the whole system in Iran and confirmed by Ayatollah Khomeni. The target…was to copy exactly what happened to the Iranian Airbus. Everything exactly the same, minimum 290 people dead.’ Libyan intelligence officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, left, was convicted of the bombing, but an Iranian defector claims Ayatollah Khomeini, right, ordered the attack in revenge for a US strike on an Iranian Airbus . Evidence unearthed by the . documentary-makers includes the names of four suspects belonging to the . Syrian-based radical group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of . Palestine – General Command. The individuals were allegedly responsible for devising the plot, making the bomb and planting it. The programme suggests that the plot was hatched at a secret meeting in Malta, attended by representatives from the Libyan, Syrian and Iranian regimes. Ahmed Jibril, left, head of the PFLP-GC is named as the plot’s mastermind. He recruited Jordanian bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat, centre, but the delivery was made by Abu Talb, right, who put it on Pan Am 103 at Heathrow . Ahmed Jibril, the Syrian head of the . PFLP-GC is named as the plot’s mastermind. He recruited Hafez Dalkamoni, . a Palestinian, and Jordanian bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat. These two were arrested by German police, who discovered four bombs, months before Lockerbie. However, . it is claimed that a fifth bomb was made and used for the Lockerbie . attack. Another man, Abu Talb is named as the bomb’s alleged courier. Mesbahi’s claims raise new questions about the guilt of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, an intelligence officer serving Colonel Gaddafi, who was convicted of mass murder in 2001. It has been asserted that Gaddafi devised the attack in retaliation for the US bombing of Libya in 1986. Despite Megrahi’s conviction, many – including some families of the dead – remain unconvinced that the whole truth has been uncovered. Megrahi maintained his innocence until he died in 2012. Mourners at the funeral service in Tehran for those who died when the Iran Air passenger jet was shot down over the Gulf . On July 3, 1988 an Iranian passenger jet was shot down by an American naval warship patrolling the Persian Gulf, killing all on board. Iran Air flight 655 had been travelling from Bandar Abbas in Iran to Dubai when it was shot down by the  USS Vincennes, resulting in the deaths of 290 civilians from six countries, including 66 children. The USS Vincennes had tracked the plane electronically and warned it to . keep away. When it did not the ship fired two surface-to-air missiles at the Airbus A300 B2-203, carrying many Iranians on their way to Mecca. The attack still has the highest death toll of any aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, and any such incident in the Indian Ocean. An official inquiry carried out by the US attributed the mistake to . human error, saying that the crew had incorrectly identified the plane as a F-14 Tomcat fighter, and that the flight did not identify itself otherwise. However, the Iranian government has always disputed the American . version of events, with many claiming that the attack was purposeful, and a sign that the US can not be trusted in its dealings with the country. The black box flight recorder on board the Airbus was never found, so it is unknown whether the crew ignored the American warnings via distress frequencies, or did not hear them. Iran Air continues to use flight number IR655 on the route as a memorial to the victims (file photo) It was only in 1992 that the US officially admitted that the vessel had been in  Iranian waters after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats for operating within Iranian territory. In 1996 the US agreed to pay Iran $61.8 million in compensation for the 248 Iranians . killed, plus the cost of the aircraft and legal expenses. It had already paid a further $40 million to the other countries whose nationals were killed. To date a formal apology has not been issued by the US for the tragedy. Some believe the Lockerbie bombing, carried out six months later in December 1988, was masterminded by Iranians in revenge for the Airbus tragedy, although a Libyan man was convicted and jailed in 2001. Going against an informal convention to discontinue flight numbers associated with aviation tragedies, Iran Air continues to use flight number IR655 on the route as a memorial to the victims.","Ayatollah Khomeini wanted revenge for U.S. strike on Iranian passenger jet .

"In 2010, . the action of a friend changed Rachelle Friedman's life when an innocent . push into a pool at her bachelorette party left her a quadriplegic. Now . a wife and an advocate for people with spinal cord injuries, she is . hoping her life will be changed again by the actions of a friend — one . who has agreed to carry her first child. Rachelle, . 28, plans to become a mother with the help of Laurel Humes, a friend she . met while attending East Carolina University. Humes, 31, has agreed to . serve as a gestational surrogate for Rachelle and her husband, Chris . Chapman. Paralyzed bride: Rachelle Friedman became paralyzed from the waist down after a tragic accident at her bachelorette party more than four years ago. Pictured above at her Knightdale, North Carolina home on June 25 . Starting a family: Friedman and her husband Chris Chapman (pictured on their wedding day three years ago) now plan on having a child through a surrogate . However, not all have been supportive of Rachelle's decision to get pregnant, considering her physical handicap. When Rachelle wrote about her desire to become a mother through surrogacy on her blog on March, she received some negative feedback. 'People . will say, ""She can't be a mom; she's in a wheelchair."" That's a little . frustrating,' Rachelle said. 'No one judges a single mother or a single . father's physical ability to raise a kid, so why am I a hindrance? 'I can hold the baby. I'll be able to change diapers and feed it and comfort it and dress it,' she said. 'All . those things are going to take a little longer, but I can still do all . those things. ... I know plenty of people in wheelchairs who are parents . who are amazing parents.' Frustrating: Some have criticized Friedman's decision to become a mother through surrogacy, saying her physical handicap would impact her parenting abilities . Despite receiving some negative comments, the blog post also caught the attention of surrogate-to-be Humes, the former college friend who followed the couple's story on social media. 'When I . saw that Rachelle was looking for a surrogate, I thought, ""You know, . this is something I really want to do,""' Humes said. '... She responded . right away and said, ""Wow! That's the nicest thing anyone's ever offered . to do for me.""' Humes, . who lives in Asheville with her husband and their 2-year-old son, is . scheduled to travel to California next month for the embryo transfer. 'I . was just assuming we would have to hire someone,' said Rachelle, who . has established an account with gofundme.com to help cover expenses. 'I . think a lot of people were like, ""What about one of the bridesmaids and . the girl who did it?"" But none of those girls have ever been moms, ever been pregnant, are . just not in that mind-set, I guess. That alone didn't make me feel . comfortable. I wanted someone who had been pregnant before, who knew . what they were doing. Also, as far as the friend who was involved, I . didn't want this to start off with guilt.' For Humes, the prospect of surrogacy is exciting. 'I feel really good about it,' she said. 'They're going to be great parents, and I'm really excited to watch their family grow.' Rachelle and Chris also have not ruled out a second child. After the initial transfer, the couple plans to keep one embryo. 'In . 10 years, who knows where I'll be physically?' Rachelle asked. 'If . there's a cure in five years and I'm able to carry one, I would love to . have another one.' They are considering donating any remaining embryos to help change someone else's life. 'Having . the difficulty we're having,' Rachelle said, 'you know some couples . just struggle forever. So (for them) to have a healthy embryo, . eventually maybe I'll donate one.' Busy: In the four years since the accident, Friedman has gotten married, and published a book titled 'The Promise' Rachelle isn't letting the negativity get to her. More than four years after her tragic accident and nearly three years after her idyllic wedding, Rachelle's life is going well. In the last three months, she has secured a surrogate, traveled to California for in vitro fertilization and released a book, 'The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride and the Power of Love, Loyalty and Friendship.' That book was not part of the plan when Rachelle received her degree in recreation management in 2008. Before the accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down, she worked as a program assistant at a seniors activity center and taught aerobics and line dancing. 'I never enjoyed writing,' Rachelle said. 'I never enjoyed having to write a paper, so it was really interesting that once I had something to say (I did).' In 'The Promise,' which she wrote with former journalist and media consultant Stephanie Krikorian, Rachelle has a lot to say. The book, released in May, not only retells the events of the now-famous accident following her bachelorette party but also shares the love story that brought her there. Promises: In her book, Friedman details the night of the accident but continues to protect the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed her into the pool . Rachelle met her very first boyfriend and the man who would become her husband during her freshman year at ECU, just before Halloween in 2004. Though she and Chris are both from Virginia Beach, and they would later learn that their paths had crossed many times, they never knew one another until both were off at college, 150 miles from home. The two were best friends long before any romance blossomed. 'My love story means so much to me, and everyone wanted the friend (bridesmaids) story,' Rachelle said of the book, which originally was to be titled 'The Pact,' a reference to the fact that neither she nor her bridesmaids have ever disclosed the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed Rachelle into the pool. Friedman and Chapman are thinking about donating their remaining embryos to another couple struggling to get pregnant . '(The Pact) made it sound like we all sat around and did like some blood promise to each other or something,' she said. 'We didn't sit there beside the pool and say this out loud. ... (The Promise) was supposed to mean not just my friends but also me and Chris.' 'The Promise' does expound on the reasons behind the unspoken agreement to keep silent about the friend responsible for the push, a young woman who struggled with debilitating guilt and depression for years after the accident. In the book, the names of all the women who were by the pool the night of the accident have been altered. 'None of us has ever revealed the name of the girl who playfully pushed me that night, and none of us ever will,' Rachelle wrote. 'Protecting her has always been too important, her feelings too important, the situation too fragile and fraught with potential pain. Besides, it could have been any one of us.' As the media relentlessly pursued the woman's identity, the decision to withhold her friend's name proved, at times, to be a costly one. One magazine offered to pay Rachelle for the revelation, and she turned down an interview with Oprah Winfrey after being told the talk show host wanted the bridesmaid in question to come on the show, too. Rachelle has learned to take both the criticism and the compliments in stride. 'I appreciate the compliments, I guess,' she said. 'People were like, ""That's so amazing of you not to say anything."" ... I think I've done a lot of amazing things, but not throwing my friend to the wolves while she was depressed is not one of them.' Since the accident, Rachelle, a former lifeguard and cheerleader, has taken up wheelchair rugby and hand cycling. She has learned to surf and to drive again. She also has become a motivational speaker and an advocate for others with spinal cord injuries. Though Rachelle has had a chance to personally reach out to a fellow Knightdale resident who was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, most of the encouragement she offers has been virtual. '(People) sent letter after letter to my Facebook inbox and my email,' she wrote. '... People wanted to relate to me and wrote things like ""My son had this happen to him,"" or ""I am married to a quadriplegic."" They were trying to connect, and I quickly learned I had the strength to help them.' Fans of 'The Promise' already are asking if there will be a sequel on motherhood. Rachelle said she plans to blog about her experience and has not ruled out a second book.","Rachelle Friedman, 28, became a quadriplegic four years ago after a bridesmaid playfully pushed her into a pool at her bachelorette party .

"A 14-year-old honor student has passed away after crashing her go kart in a freak accident. Kierstin Eaddy, an experienced go kart driver, was taking part in a solo race at a Sports Car Club of America autocross event outside Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on Sunday. As she passed the finish line, she accelerated instead of slowing down and smashed into a low fence, which ripped off her helmet and brought her kart to a stop in a field next to the track.

"This is the shocking moment a police officer tried to trick a driver into admitting he had marijuana in his car during a routine traffic stop - because 'everyone who plays frisbee golf smokes weed'. Officer Aaron King was captured on video pulling over Scott Beckwith and giving him a warning about driving without any headlights in Ankeny, Iowa, earlier this month. But after spotting Mr Beckwith's frisbee golf bag on the backseat, he started to question the driver about his passion for the game, before quickly moving on to the topic of marijuana. During the interrogation, he claimed all frisbee golf players smoke weed, asked Mr Beckwith how much of the substance he had on him and told him he wanted to search his car. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Routine traffic stop: Officer Aaron King is pictured trying to trick driver Scott Beckwith into admitting he has marijuana in his car after pulling him over in Ankeny, Iowa, earlier this month for driving without headlights . Although he eventually let the motorist go, footage of the traffic stop - taken by a passenger in the car - was later uploaded to YouTube by user 'TheResistantCow'. Now, Ankeny Police Department's chief, Gary Mikulec, has apologized for the video  deeming it 'foolish' and 'not representative of the department's training or interactions with the public'. In the footage, Mr King is heard warning Mr Beckwith about driving without headlights, before asking him: 'You play frisbee golf?', to which the driver replies: 'I do, actually. I play out at Heritage (Park).' The officer then says: 'OK. I need you to answer me a question. Why is it that everybody that plays Frisbee golf smokes weed?' Mr Beckwith quickly insists: 'No, it’s not everybody' However, Mr King is not convinced, responding: 'It’s everybody, man. You can’t tell me you've never smoked weed before.' The motorist then says, 'I’m not gonna tell you one way or another', prompting the officer to laugh and exclaim: 'See, there you go. How much weed do you have in the car today?'. Interrogation: Mr King asked Mr Beckwith (pictured, left, clutching a warning letter from the officer and, right, responding to questions) how much weed he had on him, before telling him he wanted to search his car . Game: Video footage captures Mr King asking Mr Beckwith: 'Why is it that everybody that plays frisbee golf smokes weed?'. Above, Mr Beckwith had a frisbee golf bag, like this, in his car when he was pulled over . Although Mr Beckwith denies having any marijuana, the officer responds: 'You understand you’re free to go and everything but you wouldn’t have a problem with me looking through your car?' At this point, Mr Beckwith argues: 'I actually would', adding: 'Just because I have a disc golf bag doesn’t mean that every disc golfer does have weed.' Mr King then replies: 'So you have weed in the car then is what you’re saying?' The motorist answers: 'No what I'm saying is I would say I have a problem with you searching my car because you’re profiling me based on being a disc golfer.' During the interrogation, which ends with Mr King telling the motorist 'You're free to go', Mr Beckwith informs the officer that he is being recorded on video. Police headquarters: Ankeny Police Department's (pictured) chief, Gary Mikulec, has apologized for the video deeming it 'foolish' and 'not representative of the department's training or interactions with the public' However, this does not appear to faze Mr King, who replies that he is also recording audio and video footage of the traffic stop. In a statement via Facebook, Ankeny Police Department said of the video: 'The officer engages the driver in a line of questioning that is foolish and not representative of the Ankeny Police Dept.'s training or interactions with the public. 'This verbal exchange did not meet the level of professionalism expected of Ankeny police officers. 'Ankeny Police Chief Gary Mikulec respectfully apologizes for the officer's demeaning statement and assures that the video has been preserved for an internal investigation.' Speaking to KCCI News, Chief Mikulec said he was 'extremely disappointed' by the video, which was uploaded to YouTube on October 2. Apology: In a statement via Facebook (pictured), Ankeny Police Department said of the shocking video: 'This verbal exchange did not meet the level of professionalism expected of Ankeny police officers . He added that the department is yet to receive a complaint from the driver, but will be getting in touch with him to determine any discipline for Mr King. According to Professor Robert Rigg, of Drake University Law School, Mr King broke the law by trying to search a vehicle during an equipment violation stop. 'What the officer did after that was try to extend that stop into a general search of the defendant’s car, or the individual’s car. That’s not permissible anymore,' he told WHOTV.com. He added that even if Mr Beckwith had allowed Mr King to search the car and the officer had found something illegal, the evidence would likely be deemed invalid and thrown out of court. Like regular golf, frisbee golf is a game of skill and accuracy but instead of hitting small balls, players throw a frisbee-like disc at various targets around a grassy course.","Officer Aaron King was caught on video pulling over driver Scott Beckwith .

"The coffin of the 'tallest man in the world' was carried to the graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Leonid Stadnyk, who died this week aged 44, is believed to have been 8ft 5in tall but he refused to be measured by Guinness World Records officials, regarding such a request as 'humiliating'. The peasant farmer, who suddenly started growing at the age of 12 after a botched brain operation, saw his height as a 'curse', rather than good fortune. Scroll down for video . Leonid Stadnyk, the unofficial tallest man in the world, was carried to his grave on the back of an open truck . The 8ft 5in giant held a candle as an Orthodox priest, who called him a 'giant in every sense', stood over him . A gentle giant: Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had a huge growth spurt at the age of 12 after a bungled operation . Transport had always been an issue for the gentle giant, who said that 'being in a bus for me is like a normal person being driven in the boot of a car - torture'. And the same problems followed him in death, as his coffin had to be driven to the cemetery on an open truck because it did not fit into the converted minibuses normally used as hearses in Ukraine. At his funeral, conducted by an Orthodox priest in his native Zhitomyr region, he was called 'a giant in every sense'. As mourners bade their final farewell, his head lay on a drape in the colours of Ukraine, yellow and blue, his hand clasping a candle. A hero in his own war-ravaged country, once called the 'Pride of Ukraine', he was found dead on Sunday - Independence Day - from a cerebral haemorrhage following health problems. Despite the fortune he could have made by taking advantage of his size, the gentle giant always refused to be measured for record books, not wishing to be seen as a performing Goliath. Colossus: Mr Stadnyk suffered severe health problems throughout his life and died of a brain haemorrhage . Big friendly giant: The Ukrainian peasant farmer's hands (top) were more than a foot in diameter . Meanwhile his feet were a massive UK size 27, making them 18in in length. Mr Stadnyk had to give up his career as a vet as he could not find shoes in his size that could withstand freezing temperatures . Humble: The 8ft 5in man was bigger than other 'tallest men', but refused to be measured by records officials . Mr Stadnyk said he did not want to be seen as a circus freak and had no desire to be in 'this Guinness book' 'I have more important things to do getting through the survival course that is our life in Ukraine,' he once said. A peasant farmer in the Ukrainian village of Podoliantsy, Mr Stadnyk was a modest man who admitted to problems in his love life caused by his colossal frame. 'I don't want or need the fame that this would bring so I have no desire to be in this Guinness book,' he said, shaking his large head in his home, where he had to constantly stoop to avoid bumping his head on the ceiling. 'To me, my height is a curse, a punishment from God, not something to celebrate. 'What sin I have committed, I do not know. All my life I have dreamed of being just like everyone else.' Unable to independently verify his measurements, Guinness instead officially listed Bao Xishun as the world's tallest man despite being about inches shorter than the Ukrainian. A Guinness World Records spokeswoman once said: 'We have contacted Stadnyk, but he seems like a very shy guy. 'He doesn't want us around. So we have to stick to what we have.' Watch your head: The modest farmer had to stoop in most parts of his humble home in the town of Podoliantsy . While Mr Stadnyk was popular and had many friends, he saw his height as a 'curse' and lived an unhappy life . He never married and did not commit to any women as he did not want to burden them with his health problems . Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive . 'This life is for smaller people': The gentle giant, who was loved by neighbours, was never happy with his life . Mr Stadnyk said that while he was unofficially the tallest man, he still felt like 'one of the most helpless' Ironically at school in the then USSR, the gentle giant was almost the smallest boy in his class, and was nicknamed 'Titch'. Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive. At one point his giganticism left him growing at the rate of roughly a foot every three years. He wore size 27 shoes for feet that measured almost 18 inches in length. His gargantuan palms were more than a foot in diameter. Talking about life, he explained how his height prevented him following his desired career. 'I was trained as a vet and loved my work,' he said. 'But gradually I found that I couldn't get the shoes I needed in winter to protect me from the frostbite. I just couldn't keep on with this work. 'I know I'm the tallest man but at the same time I often feel one of the most helpless. This life is for smaller people.' 'My helplessness makes me angry. I don't like to be mocked.' Ironically, Mr Stadnyk (centre left) was called 'Titch' at school because he was one of the shortest in his class . As a youngster, Mr Stadnyk aspired to be a vet but had to quit because of issues related to his sheer size . Leonid Stadnyk, the 'tallest man in the world', died this week aged 44 from a cerebral haemorrhage . At home he slept on two double beds, pushed together, but had no woman to join him because he was scared to make his problems someone else's burden. He said: 'I don't want to inflict my problems on a wife. I think it would not be fair on her.' Mr Stadnyk died a bachelor. He said his dearest wish was to climb down from the tower that imprisoned him, adding: 'I know it can never happen.' His neighbours knew him as a kind a generous man, always ready to help. One, Bronyslave, said he was 'the most unselfish, diligent man, of a pure soul.' Though not in the Guinness World Records for his height, he was perhaps bigger in other ways than many whose names are included there.","Leonid Stadnyk died this week from a brain haemorrhage, aged 44 .

"Qantas flights which travel over the Iraqi airspace have been re-routed to avoid another MH17-like disaster as tensions in the Middle East intensify. The change took effect on Thursday night - two weeks after the Ukrainian tragedy - and will add up to 10 minutes to the seven-hour-long London to Dubai flight, which is scheduled for four times a day. It is understood that instead of flying over Iraq, planes will take a path further east over Iran. Qantas stopped flights over Iraqi airspace on Thursday in the wake of the MH17 disaster on July 17 . The new route is expected to add up to 10 minutes to the seven-hour-long flight . A Qantas spokesman said the airline has closely monitored flight paths over conflict zones since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago. The tragedy claimed the lives of all 298 people on board, including 38 Australians. He said Qantas flights from London to Dubai travel over Iraq at an altitude of 38,000 feet and 41,000 feet, well above the minimum altitude for commercial flights over Iraq. But the US Federal Aviation Administration had just increased the minimum altitude from 20,000 feet to 30,000 feet, prompting a review of Qantas' London-Dubai route. It is understood that instead of travelling over Iraqi, airspace planes will be travelling over Iranian airspace . The Iraqi conflict zone has been marred with attacks from militants of the Islamic State - an off-shoot of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda . 'Qantas has closely monitored the issue of flight paths over conflict zones, particularly in light of the MH17 tragedy, with safety our first priority,' the Qantas spokesman said. 'We have no new information that alters our safety assessment of flying over Iraq, especially given the altitudes we maintain over this region. 'However given the various restrictions imposed by different governments in the past 24 hours, including by the United States FAA, Qantas has temporarily rerouted its flights within the Middle East to avoid Iraqi airspace. This change will apply until further information becomes available.' The airlines' decision comes after alliance partner Emirates announced its plans to stop flying above the area 10 days after the attack, Daily Mail Australia reported on Monday.

"A woman who went to hospital with stomach pains was stunned to discover she was 35 weeks pregnant and in labour. Hannah Froud, 22, gave birth to her daughter Jessica just seven hours after doctors said her stomach cramps were actually labour pains. The financial administrator from Chaddesden, Derbyshire, first started complaining of stomach ache on February 8 but the pain continued through the weekend. On Monday, her work colleagues convinced her to visit the London Road Community Hospital in Derby. Hannah Froud, 22, went to hospital after experiencing stomach pains and was shocked to be told that she was 35 weeks pregnant and in labour . She arrived at 10am and went through a series of checks and tests before eventually being given a pregnancy test. To her utter shock, doctors told her she was in labour. A nurse called Ms Froud’s boyfriend, 26-year-old Chris Bennett, to tell him to come to the centre to see her. Mr Bennett, who works as a joiner, went to the hospital and transported Ms Froud to the Royal Derby Hospital, where she gave birth at 5pm. Ms Froud said: ‘I wasn't bothered about taking the pregnancy test. They said it was routine for women complaining of stomach ache so I just went along with it. Baby Jessica was born at 5pm, just seven hours after her mother learned she was pregnant . ‘Not long after that, they told me I was pregnant. I was completely speechless. ‘The nurse didn't tell Chris the news over the phone, but he was just as shocked as me when he did find out. I remember him having to have a sit down. ‘It was so strange - everything just happened. One minute I had stomach ache, the next I was being told I was having a baby.' So unprepared were Jessica's parents for her arrival, the hospital had to give the couple some baby clothes for her. And despite the drama of a surprise . birth, baby Jessica is perfectly healthy, according to Ms . Froud. The hospital had to give the new parents some clothes for Jessica as they were unprepared for her arrival . She said: ‘She's a lovely little girl. Her sleeping is not a problem because she only wakes up once a night and we will certainly settle for that. ‘Things don't seem to have changed that much. I just no longer have to go work and I have a baby to bring up. ‘We can't wait for her to grow up and start playing with toys. At the moment all she seems to do is sleep.’","Hannah Froud, 22, went to hospital complaining of stomach pains .

"Russell Wasendorf Jr. says he cannot forgive his father for stealing millions of dollars from his clients . Russell Wasendorf Jr., whose father was jailed for stealing $215 million from clients of the financial firm they ran together for nearly 20 years, is starting a new business. The chief operating officer of Peregrine Financial Group, which collapsed in 2012 in an embezzlement scheme orchestrated by his father, has moved to Florida from the firm's home base of Cedar Falls, Iowa. He is out of the futures business entirely and has launched an e-commerce website. In his first interview since Peregrine Financial's demise, Wasendorf Jr. said he has rejected offers to consult on futures and currency trading, his area of focus at the firm. According to records from the National Futures Association, he withdrew the last of his futures industry registrations just last week. 'I really want to just try to move on,' Wasendorf Jr. told Reuters. 'I don't have any real desire at this point to go back into that side of the business. I've been burnt awfully badly after spending 25 years of my life there.' Last July, Peregrine Financial's founder and chief executive, Russell Wasendorf Sr., botched a suicide attempt at the firm's Cedar Falls headquarters. Before snaking a hose from the tailpipe of his car into the vehicle, he left a confession of his crimes along with a note begging his 'wonderful son' for forgiveness. Wasendorf Sr. was arrested and later pleaded guilty to embezzling his clients' money, and the firm filed for bankruptcy. Wasendorf Jr. said he has not forgiven his father. 'As far as I am concerned, he died that day,' he said. Wasendorf Sr., 65, in February began serving what is expected to be a life sentence in a high-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. At the time, his pastor said he was in poor health. He has not responded to a letter from Reuters requesting an interview. Most of the firm's 24,000 customers have received back only about a third of the money they had in accounts at Peregrine Financial and are not expected to be made whole. The implosion shook investor confidence in the U.S. futures industry, already hurt by the failure of the larger MF Global less than a year earlier. Wasendorf Sr. used little more than a rented post office box, Photoshop and inkjet printers to fake bank statements and hide money from regulators for years, according to his confession and statements from federal investigators. Russell Wasendorf Sr. was arrested after an apparent suicide attempt in July last year and later admitted embezzling more than $215million . He doctored the bank statements to . show that accounts held more money than they actually did, while using . clients' money to keep the company afloat and fund a lavish lifestyle. U.S. prosecutors said at Wasendorf Sr.'s sentencing earlier this year that . the government did not anticipate filing further criminal charges . relating to Peregrine Financial. But his son is facing a civil lawsuit . that says he is partly responsible for the firm's collapse. Wasendorf . Jr., who turns 43 this month, also was president of the firm and . oversaw day-to-day operations. In the interview, he denied any knowledge . of or involvement in his father's scam. 'There's obviously plenty of reasons why he would have never told me about this, because I'd have never forgiven it,' he said, his voice cracking. That hasn't kept others from wondering. Dan Roth, who heads the National Futures Association, said last fall that the sheer volume of documents that needed to be doctored to keep up the fraud suggests the father had help. Contacted on Tuesday by Reuters, Roth said he stood by his comments and had nothing further to add. No suspected accomplice has yet surfaced. Wasendorf Jr. moved his family to Orlando, Florida, after the scandal and in April began an online service, Orange Tree Deals, aimed at giving entrepreneurs and neighbors a way to sell goods to one another, or even give them away for free. The site requires buyers and sellers to register to use the site, making it more transparent, in his view, than an anonymous marketplace like Craigslist, Wasendorf said. He hopes entrepreneurs eventually use the site as a virtual storefront, so he can charge a commission on their sales. On Wednesday, the site carried listings for products including a wine refrigerator, chandelier and penguin Halloween costume. Thirteen former Peregrine Financial customers are suing Wasendorf Jr., his father, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan Chase & Co in federal court in Chicago. The lawsuit, which seeks status as a class action on behalf of all of Peregrine Financial's former clients, accuses the father of fraud; the son of helping him; and the banks, which held money for the firm, of facilitating the entire enterprise. Thirteen former clients of Peregrine Financial Group are launching a lawuit against Russell Wasendorf Snr, his son, and the banks which held money for the firm . 'As a direct and proximate consequence of the conduct of Wasendorf and Wasendorf Jr.,' customers of Peregrine Financial, or PFG, 'have lost a significant portion of the money, securities, and property they paid and delivered to PFG,' the complaint read. The banks are fighting the lawsuit and say they did nothing wrong. The son is fighting, too, but says he does not have the money to pay for a long legal battle, let alone to make up for clients' massive losses. He said he is on the verge of bankruptcy because of the cost of defending himself. Wasendorf said he felt betrayed by his father and did not plan to visit him in jail. 'Maybe someday I'll forgive it, but not right now,' Wasendorf Jr. said. 'It caused way too much damage to my family, to myself.'","Russell Wasendorf Jr. ran Peregrine Financial Group with father for 20 years .

"This is the embarrassing moment two teenagers had to be rescued in a dinghy just yards from the river bank - after they misjudged the tide and became stranded on mudflats. The distressed pair, both 15, were forced to wait for the coastguard after landing themselves in the sticky situation on the River Medway, in Gillingham, Kent on Sunday afternoon. The friends, who had life jackets on and a two-way radio with them, had launched the rubber dinghy from the side of a sailing boat belonging to one of the boys' father. Scroll down for video .

The Medway Coastguard team and a specialist mud rescue crew were called at 3pm and soon arrived on the scene to winch the boys to safety. In the video, one rescuer was captured wading through the muddy waters to reach the hopeless pair and attach the rope. The over-the-top response also saw fire engines called out - and amused firefighters can be seen looking on and laughing as the teenagers sit helplessly in the stationary boat.

"A married Hungarian couple who toured the world raiding the homes of the frail and elderly have been jailed after targeting pensioners in their 80s and 90s in Newcastle. Husband and wife, Jozsef Forgas, 35, and Otilia Domotor, 37, had already racked up convictions for stealing from homes belonging to elderly people in Canada, Belgium and Hungary. And since moving to Newcastle earlier this year they have been responsible for ten more burglaries - each time targeting and terrifying residents in their 80s and 90s. Caught: Hungarian husband and wife thieves Jozsef Forgas (right) and Otilia Domotor (left) in their police mugshots . Their vulnerable victims included a 93-year-old and an 88-year-old. Forgas, whose many aliases include Kevin Kiss, has been jailed for four years while his wife, also known as Christina Kiss, was sentenced to 32 months, Chronicle Live reports. Judge Brian Forster, at Newcastle Crown Court, told them: 'Because of your need for money you decided to target older members of the community. 'These were mean and shocking offences.' The couple burgled ten homes in Newcastle - most belonging to old and vulnerable residents (picture posed by model) A carer of a couple aged 93 and 83, became suspicious in May when Forgas and Domotor let themselves in - and had CCTV installed while also alerting police. Less than a month later the carer arrived at the house to find Forgas and Domotor back again. Footage of the pair was circulated and the owner of their rented flat identified them, the court heard. During this time, the professional burglars targeted another home which belonged to an 88-year-old man and his 84-year-old wife. The elderly husband, who suffers from Parkinson's, had just returned from a physio session on May 28 when Forgas and Domotor turned up and let themselves into the property. Stuart Graham, prosecuting, said: 'As seems to be the modus operandi for these defendants, the male Forgas engaged in conversation with the householder while the female asked to use the toilet. 'She was in fact looking for anything that could be stolen.' The victim said in a statement to the court: 'I'm nervous and worried they may come back to burgle my property.' Forgas and Domotor both of Chapel House, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration.","Jozsef Forgas, 35, and Otilia Domotor, 37, burgled ten homes in Newcastle .

"Up to 42.5 million people across the United States are expected to hit the road today to visit family and . friends for Thanksgiving - the highest number of holiday travellers since the start of . the recession. But Thanksgiving travellers are also . at the mercy of the weather. Forecasters warned of rain and scattered . thunderstorms in much of the north east, with a mixture of snow and . freezing rain expected in upstate New York and northern New England. Mountainous areas could see four to eight inches of snow. Two forecasted storms are expected to cause havoc. Making an early start: Cars fill the highway in san Diego, California, yesterday, as the holiday season gets underway . Wet and windy: A traveller reads a newspaper at a wet LaGuardia Airport, New York, while waiting for his flight to San Francisco for Thanksgiving . Worse than usual: Los Angeles is predicting even higher volumes of traffic as usual as Americans hit the roads to spend the holiday with family memebers . The first storm, which has already caused . flash flooding across Arkansas, is forecast to move into the Southeast, . bringing severe weather on Wednesday. It will also bring rain showers and . snow showers to the North east, with two inches of rain expected in . Boston and New York and more than a foot of snow through New York, . Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The worst of the severe weather was . forecast to develop across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, . Georgia, Tennessee, even into the North and South Carolinas. The second storm moved into the North west on Tuesday evening and continuing through Thanksgiving day, bringing with it up to five inches of rain and a foot of snow to higher elevations. Flooding and strong winds are expected to be a major concern. Travel tracker AAA says that four per cent more Americans than last year will journey at least 50 miles from home, with about 90 percent of them driving. Another 8 percent plan to fly, but AAA notes that higher airfares and less available seats have forced many would-be fliers to drive instead. The remaining travelers plan to take buses, trains or other forms of transport. This is the third consecutive Thanksgiving that Americans have taken to the road in higher numbers than in the past year, the Associated Press reports. Travelling again, finally: More people will travel this year since the recession began, analysts predict . The increase in holiday travel is welcome news for an industry that has been struggling to get Americans back on the road. Memorial Day saw no increase in vacations and travel was down for both July 4th and Labor Day breaks. AAA says that Americans are willing to spend now because they want to spend time with their family. 'As consumers weigh the fear of . economic uncertainty and the desire to create lasting family memories . this holiday, more Americans are expected to choose family and friends . over frugality,' Bill Sutherland, vice president of AAA Travel Services, . said. The prices are up and weather is not offering any comfort for travellers. Thanksgiving airfares are up 20 per cent this year, and the average price of a gallon of gas has risen almost 20 per cent, according to travel tracker AAA. Rail travelers were also affected, with fares on most one-way Amtrak tickets up 2 to 5 per cent. Two forecasted storms are expected to make air travel rough across parts of the country, causing delays and cancellations at airports. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, five of country's busiest airports were already reporting delays of 15-45 minutes due to weather conditions on Tuesday. On the roads, Weather.com says that on Wednesday there will be headaches inNortheast, New England (rain, wind, wet northern New England snow), Pacific Northwest, N. Calif. (rain, mountain snow)Potential problems: Southeast coast to Florida (t-storms mainly during first half of the day.) On Thursday there will headaches at the Pacific Northwest (rain, wind, mountain snow.)There will be potential problems in California, S. Arizona and New Mexico (showers) and on Friday there will be no headaches but potential problems in Iowa to Texas (rain, t-storms late),Northern/Central Rockies (snow) and the Southwest (showers). Amtrak has yet to report problems but advises travellers to check for alerts on amtrak.com. Those . driving should expect to pay more at the pump. The average price of a . gallon of gas so far this November is $3.42, up nearly 20 per cent from . last year's $2.86, according to AAA, Wright Express and Oil Price . Information Service. That means for every 100 miles a family drives this . holiday they should expect to spend about $2.50 more on gas. Rates . for mid-range hotels are expected to increase 6 percent from last year . ago with travelers spending an average of $145 a night. Lower-priced . motels are seeing a seven per cent increase to $103. Weekend daily car rental rates will average $37, an 11 per cent drop from last year. AAA said Thanksgiving airfares are 20 per cent higher than last year with an average lowest round-trip rate of $212 for the top 40 U.S. air routes. That estimate is much higher than a four per cent increase predicted by both Orbitz and Priceline. Those companies said the average airfare was closer to $400. Airlines report quarterly airfares but don't break out prices for specific holidays. The findings are based on a survey of 1,357 people in the U.S., 543 who said they plan to travel. On this the fourth Thanksgiving since the economy sank, prices for everything from airline flights to groceries are going up, and some Americans are scaling back. Yet in many households, the occasion is too important to skimp on. Said one mother: 'I don't have much to give, but I'll be cooking, and the door will be open.' Bill Sutherland, vice president of AAA Travel Services, said: 'This is the first significant increase in any holiday travel this year. Families who had foregone travel over the last three years are likely to reverse their decisions this year, the group said, leading to the uptick in the forecast. The forecast, based on a monthly survey of 50,000 homes, said some 3.4 million - up 1.8 percent year-on-year - would fly over the Thanksgiving weekend . Thanksgiving travel took a big hit in 2008 following the financial crisis and the economic uncertainty it caused. A 16lbs turkey and all the trimmings will cost an average of $49.20 - a 13 per cent jump from last year, or about $5.73 more, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. THE WEATHER FORECAST OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY . The worst day: Wednesday, the biggest day of travel, has the worst conditions . Clearing up: Thanksgiving brightens up for much of the country . Going west: The rain makes it way to south central and north western states . No let up: The rain continues on Saturday in a broad band across central states .

"More than ten million motorists were ‘betrayed and misled’ into buying diesel cars, the president of the AA has said. Drivers who were encouraged for more than a decade to buy the cars for their fuel efficiency and environmental benefits may now be hit by new levies. Britain is being sued by the European Commission for breaching air pollution limits and diesel drivers face financial penalties. Scroll down for video . Penalties: Plans have been announced to charge diesel drivers extra in London - which could spread further . London Mayor Boris Johnson this week announced plans to charge an extra £10 for diesel cars to drive in the capital – a measure that could be copied by up to 18 other cities. But motoring groups have warned that charges would hit drivers already struggling to cope with high prices at the pumps, and could lower the resale value of diesel vehicles. 'Many will feel betrayed': AA President Edmund King . AA president Edmund King told the Daily Mail: ‘Many drivers will feel deeply betrayed and misled after being encouraged over many years to go for the dash for diesel. Now instead they are being told it’s time for the push to petrol. ‘Back in the 1990s there was a near hysteria about the dangers of carbon dioxide and yet nobody bothered to look at the bigger picture. Britain’s drivers thought they were doing the right thing and were told as much by politicians and ministers. ‘But now all of a sudden those same drivers are being told that it has serious health implications. Motorists are being made to feel guilty for something that they were actually encouraged to do.’ The shift towards diesel came in 2001 when then Chancellor Gordon Brown overhauled vehicle excise duty to charge more for cars emitting a high level of carbon dioxide.","AA president claims millions switched because of advice from politicians .

"Practicing in a pink t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ‘One Hot Drop Shot’ it’s clear to see how Eugenie Bouchard is making an impression at Wimbledon. The 20-year-old is named after a princess and is fast becoming the queen of Centre Court. She is now in with a genuine chance of winning the women’s singles as existing Wimbledon royalty are guillotined in rapid succession. Practicing in a pink t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan 'One Hot Drop Shot' it's clear to see how Eugenie Bouchard is making an impression at Wimbledon . With model good looks, the 20-year-old Canadian is named after a princess and is fast becoming the queen of Centre Court . The Canadian had expected to face her childhood heroine Maria Sharapova in the quarter finals, but the former champion suffered a surprise defeat in the fifth round following earlier upsets for top two seeds, Serena Williams and Li Na. Instead Miss Bouchard, whose namesake is Princess Eugenie, spent yesterday on the practice court  on the All England Club preparing for her match against German ninth seed for a place in the final four. And Miss Bouchard said she is relishing the chance to wow the Wimbledon crowds again in the country she considers her second home. Her parents named all their children after royalty – her twin sister is Beatrice and she has a brother called William. She said: 'Maybe it looks like my parents were royal obsessed, it makes me feel a little bit more at home in England among my fellow royals. Her parents named all their children after royalty - her twin sister is Beatrice and she has a brother called William . 'When I was young my Mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and I still keep it on my bedside table, my brother is Prince William. I think they are just nice names that they liked.' This week she performed in front of royalty as she appeared under the Centre Court roof in front of a Royal Box boasting the Duke of Kent and the Countess of Wessex. And she confesses to certain airs and graces befitting her name. 'I can be a princess. I can be moody in the morning and my fitness trainer carries my tennis bag around, ‘ she said. 'But that's so I don't get tired because I want to save all my energy for the match. ‘I can demand a few things once in a while, but I do it with love.' With her Hollywood looks and dazzling skills, even before her appearance at this year’s tournament she had attracted a worldwide fan base knows as the 'Genie Army'. At other tournaments the adoring supporters throw cuddly toys at her, although she says Wimbledon spectators are ‘too proper’ to behave that way. The Canadian had expected to face her childhood heroine Maria Sharapova in the quarter finals, but the former champion suffered a surprise defeat in the fifth round . It came following earlier upsets for top two seeds, Serena Williams (left) and Li Na . Miss Bouchard is rumoured to be in a romance with Canadian ice hockey star Alex Galchenyuk, but keeps her tennis contemporaries at a distance. She was close to British star Laura Robson, but it has cooled recently and Miss Bouchard said last month: ‘I don’t think the tour is the place to have friends.’ It is a clear sign of the single minded determination of the young woman who started playing tennis aged five in the English speaking Montreal suburb of West Mount. She said: 'Ever since I was young, whatever I did I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities. 'When I came home from school I would be the one doing my homework while my siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later. ‘I was always very determined, and to excel at this sport you have to be really disciplined and motivated. 'I asked my parents if I could play more so they put me in groups where there was more actual tennis and it went from there. ‘Nine is very young to decide what you want to do in life but that is pretty much when I decided.'

"In the locker room, it looks to be a match made in heaven. From a cosy soak together at a spa to a spot of grooming, it looks like Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov are so comfortable in each other’s company. But the Wimbledon champion will have to put his burgeoning ‘bromance’ with his Bulgarian rival to one side today, as the pair do battle for a place in the semi-finals at the All  England Club. Scroll down for video . From a cosy soak together at a spa to a spot of grooming, it looks like Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov are so comfortable in each other's company. But today, they face each other on court . Dimitrov, the 11th seed, is dating former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, who crashed out of the tournament yesterday . The larky friendship between the tennis stars was revealed in January when Dimitrov posted a picture on Twitter showing the pair in just their swimming trunks as they took a post-match bath in Melbourne. Then, during a tournament break a few months ago, Murray tried his hand at hairdressing at  a Rome salon.  Dimitrov mischievously described Murray’s coiffure skills as ‘beautiful’. Warming to the theme, Murray yesterday revealed the pair had ‘spent more time together recently’ after Dimitrov hired a new coach who is a mutual friend. The third-seeded Scot added: ‘We get on well, he’s a nice guy and has good people around him.’ But he added that their friendly rivalry off the court was ‘about to get serious’. During a tournament break a few months ago, Murray tried his hand at hairdressing at  a Rome salon.  Dimitrov mischievously described Murray's coiffure skills as 'beautiful' Another battle is likely to be played out in the stands between their  respective girlfriends. Dimitrov, the 11th seed, is dating former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, who crashed out of the tournament yesterday. The 23-year-old began going out with the world’s richest sportswoman in 2012 after breaking up with world number one Serena Williams, prompting a bitter catfight. Dimitrov, the 11th seed, is dating former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, who crashed out of the tournament yesterday . The 23-year-old began going out with the world¿s richest sportswoman in 2012 after breaking up with world number one Serena Williams, who also crashed out of her doubles match, complaining of illness . Williams gave an interview to a US . magazine in which she described Sharapova as ‘boring’ and accused . Dimitrov of having a ‘black heart’. The All England Club has rejected calls from stars including Novak Djokovic for Wimbledon to introduce play on the middle Sunday of the tournament. Djokovic spoke out after several players – including the No5 seed, Stan Wawrinka – had their schedule disrupted by rain on Saturday, meaning they only played two matches in the first week. Wimbledon is the only one of the four grand slam tournaments that has a rest day and organisers insisted it would remain that way – so that the grass courts can have a much-needed rest. The tournament referee Andrew Jarrett said: ‘The surface itself needs to recover. On Saturday night and Sunday morning, the courts get absolutely soaked, which they need in order to perform to their maximum in the second week. ‘We treat all players as fairly as we can, but it’s a busy schedule and if we get rain-affected, obviously it can’t be perfect.’ Sharapova responded by pointing out that Williams was believed to be dating her married coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. Dimitrov’s turbulent love life is a world away from Murray’s relationship with long-term girlfriend Kim Sears. Miss Sears met Murray at the US Open when she was 17 and, apart from one brief split, they have been together for almost nine years. Private school-educated Miss Sears, the daughter of tennis coach Nigel Sears, grew up in an £800,000 detached home in Barcombe, East Sussex. The 26-year-old now lives with Murray in a £5million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, where she does the laundry and shops for fruit and vegetables at the local Tesco. The English literature graduate is now an artist specialising in painting portraits of dogs. She and Murray are often seen by locals walking their terriers together. On her blog she says that her favourite things, apart from family and friends, are ‘tea, lots of chocolate biscuits, Classic FM and copious amounts of Jilly Cooper. All at once.’ Miss Sharapova has had her hands full taming the roguish Dimitrov – although he admits he is still in awe of the woman he watched win Wimbledon in 2004 when he was just 13. ‘In a way, like in many tennis fans’ shoes, she is Sharapova for me, but she is Maria when we get home,’ he said in a recent interview. Judy Murray knows a thing or two about raising a tennis star – and she says parents are letting their children down when it comes to sport. The 54-year-old said too many parents choose to let their children watch DVDs or pack them off to activity classes. The mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray added: ‘I loved all sports when I was young, I wanted my kids to enjoy sport so I was always playing actively with them, whatever they wanted to play. But it’s not every parent that does that with their kids. ‘It’s much easier to hand them a DVD or a CD or something and sit and watch that. ‘I think parents generally have less time, maybe more money and less time, so they are paying people to look after their kids.’ Mrs Murray spoke at the launch of Miss-Hits, a programme she has started with the Lawn Tennis Association to get more young girls playing the sport. She said:  ‘If you can get them at a young age,  enjoying activity and movement, before it becomes a chore as a teenager, then  they will hopefully enjoy being active for all of their lives.’","Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov getting along famously at Wimbledon .

The document lists the Oscar-winning star’s full name as George Timothy Clooney and his profession as ‘actor and director’. Miss Alamuddin, 36, is described as a barrister. The banns, which went up a fortnight ago, describe Miss Alamuddin as single. Mr Clooney’s status is listed as ‘previous marriage dissolved’. The banns also confirm that the couple will get married in Italy. The couple met at a charity event and began dating in September last year. Mr Clooney proposed to Miss Alamuddin in April, presenting her with a seven-carat diamond engagement ring. His Oxford-educated fiancee has a high-profile client list – she has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and is an advisor to former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.

"At full stretch, the tip of Kevin Anderson's racket looms 10ft high as he smashes a serve at his opponent . At full stretch, the tip of Kevin Anderson’s racket looms 10ft high as he smashes a serve at his opponent. Unfortunately for Andy Murray, he will be the man standing on the other side of the net as the ball hurtles towards him at up to 137mph today at Wimbledon. The Scot faces the 6ft8in South African on Centre Court as they battle it out for a place in the quarter finals. Anderson has already served 63 aces in this year’s competition and beat Murray heavily in the most recent of their two encounters. But if it’s any consolation for Murray, who is a considerable 6ft3in, his opponent’s mother insists he is a ‘gentle giant’. In his spare time the softly-spoken university graduate enjoys reading and learning to play the guitar. He is married to his college sweetheart, Kelsey, who has been supporting him at Wimbledon. And Anderson, 28, has already admitted to suffering from nerves in this year’s tournament – although not on the court. Instead they came as he returned to the changing rooms after his third round victory and he bumped into comedian Ricky Gervais, who was at Wimbledon to watch Murray. Anderson said afterwards: ‘I’m one of his biggest fans. 'My hand started sweating. 'It’s just funny, when you’re not used to something it’s amazing what you get nervous about.’ Yesterday it was Murray’s turn to be starstruck after he trained with Gervais, star of sitcom The Office, who is the Scot’s favourite comedian too. Murray said: ‘When I went over to Spain when I was 15, I watched an episode of The Office almost every single night I was there. I could basically remember it word for word when I was over there training.’ Murray previously played world number 18 Anderson twice, winning easily at the 2010 Australian Open before losing heavily in the Montreal Masters the following year. The pair have also practised together in Miami where the Scot trains. Anderson said: ‘It will be a great experience for me. 'It’s why I play this game, to play greats, and at such a big tournament. 'I don’t need to go on too much about how he is as a tennis player. He’s one of the best.’ For his part, Murray, 27, said he is relishing the clash and doesn’t plan to change his tactics for the match. He said: ‘The only thing that’s different is my return, because he’s obviously serving different angles at different heights, so the ball’s bouncing up much higher. 'I enjoy pressure. I like feeling nervous. I’m not scared of that feeling. I felt like I played my best tennis when I’ve been under pressure.’ But Murray arguably has the upper hand going into the match. He has spent just five hours on court over three matches during the first week of Wimbledon, while Anderson has played for seven hours. He is never anything but tough on court. But yesterday Andy Murray showed his playful side as he posed for a selfie with his two young cousins. The defending champion chatted and laughed with 11-year-old twins Cora and Ailsa Erskine at the All England Club during ‘Middle Sunday’ – the tournament’s only day of no play. Say cheese: A smiling Andy Murray and his young cousins Cora and Ailsa . Andy Murray (left) accompanied by his affectionate cousin Cora Erskine (right) leaves the Aorangi Park . The Scot, 27, grinned cheerily as he larked about with the children of his mother Judy’s brother Niall Erskine, at one point affectionately hugging the two girls. Roy Erskine, Murray’s grandfather, said the twins would be in London to watch Murray’s progress all week, adding: ‘They are very fond of their cousin.’","Scot faces the 6ft8in South African Kevin Anderson on Centre Court .

"Caroline Wozniacki said underwear checks by Wimbledon officials were 'creepy' Caroline Wozniacki yesterday branded the underwear checks by Wimbledon officials as ‘creepy.’ The ex-fiancée of Rory McIlroy hit out after players claimed enforcing the all-white dress code risked compromising their dignity. Some have been forced to go bra-less because of the stricter rule, while others have protested that white knickers under a white dress creates a see-through effect when they sweat. Ms Wozniacki admits she wears white underwear at Wimbledon but said: ‘I don’t think anyone is showing off their underwear [but] getting it checked would be pretty creepy.’ The All England Club introduced tighter guidelines this year after concerns that sponsors were weaving more colour into kit. Under the tougher regulations, every article of clothing needs to be white - leaving no room for misinterpretation. Czech player Barbora Zahlavova Strycova said: ‘We’re playing in white so we should wear white underwear but it’s weird officials coming and checking. I think it’s strange.’ Former champion Pat Cash said  this week that some women players had been ordered back to change their bras and tops because of a slight colour on them, and without suitable sports bras  to hand they had to go without them. Swiss player Belinda Bencic, who won her second round match yesterday, supported the clampdown. ‘I have always tried to wear white underpants,’ she said. ‘White at Wimbledon is a nice tradition, so I think it is really nice to do that.’ Maria Sharapova was able to wear orange underwear last year but now the all-white rule leaves no room for interpretation .","Rory McIlroy's ex hit out after players said strict code compromised dignity .

"Prize-money hungry players are ‘creating havoc’ by repeatedly challenging umpires and line judges, a Wimbledon grandee claimed yesterday. Alan Little, who has run the Wimbledon library for 37-years, said players were better behaved in previous generations when the financial incentives for winning were far less. ‘Generally they were sportsmen [in the past] – they were doing it for pleasure, although that didn’t mean to say they didn’t try. Self-confessed 'hothead' Fabio Fognini was ordered to pay £16,000 following an outburst during his first-round match against U.S player Alex Kuznetsov . ‘I think generally players are pretty behaved here', he told the Telegraph. ‘[But] you get the odd one. 'The money is obviously the temptation because they need to win. In the old days, people just relaxed and played. It has all tensed up now. They’ve got to win. ‘Years ago, the players would normally accept what the umpire said – not always, but generally. ‘It was in or out. I’m not saying they never disputed it, but not to the point where they would create havoc.’ The winners of this year’s singles competition will pocket £1,760,000 and even first round losers picket up £27,000. Fognini of Italy complains about a decision to the match official during his Gentlemen's Singles second round match against Tim Puetz of Germany . When tennis turned professional in 1968, the champion won just £2,000 - the equivalent of £30,000 today. Last week an Italian tennis player was yesterday hit with the largest ever Wimbledon fine- after telling an umpire he had too much gel in his hair. Self-confessed ‘hothead’ Fabio Fognini was ordered to pay £16,000 following an outburst during his first-round match against U.S player Alex Kuznetsov. He told ground supervisor Wayne McKewen - in Italian - that he wanted to break his racquet on his head, after he was warned about throwing it. Italian witnesses alleged he then told umpire James Keothavong: ‘When you get up in the morning, all you think about is putting gel in your hair’.","Wimbledon expert Alan Little has run the library for 37-years .

"Rolf Harris’s conviction was jeopardised by his secret arrest and draconian threats to newspapers from lawyers citing the Leveson Inquiry. The legal bullying meant the Press did not name the paedophile predator until four months after he was first quizzed by detectives. When the news blackout ended, a flood of other victims went to the police to back up the first woman’s claims. Scroll down for video . The legal bullying meant the Press did not name the paedophile predator until four months after he was first quizzed by detectives . Prosecutors and child abuse charities say this publicity was vital in proving the case against Harris. Open justice campaigners say the case shows that suppressing suspects’ names – even after arrest – can help protect criminals. Detectives interviewed Harris in November 2012 but refused to confirm rumours that they had done so. Police forces would usually confirm or deny a suspect had been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists. Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court, with his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi (right), after being found guilty of 12 sex charges involving four women . But following the Leveson Inquiry, which included a raft of proposals to rein in the freedom of the Press, there have been growing concerns that police and other officials have been able to withhold key information from the public. Newspapers continued to hold off from naming Harris even after he was quizzed by officers for a second time in March 2013. In his report, Lord Justice Leveson wrote that except in exceptional circumstances the names of those who are arrested should not be released to the press or the public . His lawyers used the Leveson Report, which recommended anonymity in the event of arrests, to intimidate the press into silence. But newspapers finally did publish his name the following month and more than a dozen victims came forward, nine of whom testified at his trial. Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC told the trial this evidence was crucial in proving the case against Harris by demonstrating his ‘persistent pattern of sexual offending’. The prosecutor’s comments fly in the face of claims by the law firm Harbottle and Lewis, which acted for Harris. It told one newspaper after he had been interviewed under caution: ‘There is no public interest in publishing such content as is entirely self evident following the publication of the Leveson Report.’ The firm’s senior media lawyer, Gerrard Tyrrell, who has acted for Prince William, Prince Harry and the Middletons, also warned The Mail on Sunday it could face ‘highly damaging’ legal consequences if it published the fact that Harris had been quizzed by detectives. Liz Mullinar, founder of child abuse charity Heal for Life, said: ‘Not naming suspects in cases like this is a disgrace. It means nobody else can come forward. It is protecting the perpetrators not the victims.’ Philip Davies, a Conservative MP on the Commons culture committee, said: ‘The Rolf Harris case is another prime example of why it is so important to have an open system of justice where people are informed about who’s been arrested or charged. ‘Maintaining any secrecy over arrests or charges only benefits criminals who could use it to get away with their crimes.’ In his report, Lord Justice Leveson wrote: ‘I think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or the public.’ But the decision of Harris’s lawyers to cite this as proof there was no public interest in naming him after his arrest was condemned from all sides. The Harbottle and Lewis letter was described in a Times editorial as ‘an ill-disguised threat deployed chiefly to protect a celebrity’s privacy’.","When the news blackout ended, a flood of other victims went to the police .

"Andy Murray powered through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon yesterday – but he wasn’t always the centre of attention. Many spectators found themselves distracted by the sartorial choices of Ilie Nastase and Sir Cliff Richard. Nastase, the 67-year-old Romanian former world number one, was described as looking like a South American dictator from the 1970s as he arrived in the royal box in a blue military-style jacket and dark glasses. Military parade: Former 1970s tennis ace Ilie Nastase arrived in the Royal Box of Centre Court wearing a strange blue military-style outfit and dark glasses . 'Bucharest Buffoon': Mr Nastase is believed to have been wearing his authentic Romanian military uniform to Wimbledon on Monday . As dashing as ever: In his heyday, the four-times married tennis star was reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women . During his volatile playing career the . man nicknamed ‘the Bucharest Buffoon’ was officially a Romanian army . officer and was employed by the ministry of defence under his country’s . communist regime. Communism was overthrown in 1989 and Nastase later said his military rank had been merely honorary. In . 2008, he was named retired major-general by Romanian presidential . decree, and he is believed to have been proudly wearing his formal . uniform at Wimbledon yesterday. Twice . a Wimbledon losing finalist in the Seventies, Nastase was known as much . for his on-court histrionics as his playing ability. Sir Cliff the Sartorial: Sir Cliff Richard turned heads in a garish blue striped suit with a mismatching tie . Making an effort: Despite the obvious fashion faux-pas, the 73-year-old crooner at least managed to match his shoes and sunglasses to his suit . Leading man: Andy Murray celebrates his win against South African Kevin Anderson in three straight sets . His career was overshadowed by fines, disqualifications and suspensions caused by his frequent temper tantrums. But he remained well liked off court . and, with his dashing good looks, the four-times married star was . reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women. Since the age of nine, British number two Laura Robson and Canadian player Eugenie Bouchard (pictured above) have toured the world together, becoming firm friends in the process. And yesterday Miss Bouchard managed to reach Wimbledon’s quarter-finals – but while her career is flourishing, her friendship with 20-year-old Miss Robson appears to have floundered. Asked on Twitter who her best friend in tennis was yesterday, Miss Robson – who had to miss the tournament because of a wrist injury – made no reference to her former confidante, saying: ‘I am friends with most of the Americans and Australians.’ And at the French Open last month, Miss Bouchard, 20, declared: ‘My best friend on tour? I don’t have one. I don’t think the tour is the place to have friends.’ The player could be modelling herself on her childhood heroine, Maria Sharapova, who likes to distance herself from her rivals. However Miss Robson seems to be more than happy to socialise with her fellow players, heading to London’s hottest restaurant Chiltern Firehouse with Caroline Wozniacki last Friday. Also catching the eye yesterday was . Sir Cliff Richard in a garish striped blue suit and clashing tie, teamed . with a red rose in his buttonhole and tinted blue sunglasses. But even more startling was the Wimbledon Championships pass clasped in the 73-year-old singer’s hand. His ID badge included a passport photograph which appeared to be at least 20 years out of date and showed him with a shorter, cropped hair style and almost completely wrinkle-free. Sir Cliff signed autographs for tennis fans as he walked through the grounds before taking his seat on Centre Court beside Sir Trevor McDonald. The pair watched Eugenie Bouchard’s victory over Alize Cornet before staying to watch Andy Murray beat South African Kevin Anderson, 28. Murray, 27, beat his giant 6ft 8in opponent in three straight sets last night. The victory by the reigning Wimbledon champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for Murray, as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2. After the match, Murray admitted it ‘got a bit tense’ on the court because the number 20 seed was ‘playing very well at the end and making it very tough for me’. But he said the huge support from the crowd had given him a ‘big lift’ and made the game very hard for his opponent. Murray, who is fifth in the world, was watched on court by his coach Amelie Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray as well as his girlfriend Kim Sears. Before the match, Murray’s tennis player brother Jamie suggested we might not have another champion like Murray for a century because of a lack of promotion of tennis in Britain. He said his brother is ‘not going to be around for ever’, adding: ‘Who knows when the next top British guy is going to be? That could be 50 years, 100 years, no one knows.’ Jamie, who is competing in both the men’s and mixed doubles this year, said successful players in Britain were still a product of luck rather than as a result of receiving the ‘right opportunities’.","Ilie Nastase turned up at Wimbledon in his Romanian army uniform .

"Andy Murray’s name was engraved on the Wimbledon trophy last year by a 76-year-old man who had driven 850 miles across Europe. Roman Zoltowski makes the annual odyssey from his home in Poland in his 52-year-old open-top MG sports car to perform his cherished role at the Championships. He will be back again this year to engrave the men’s and ladies' trophies for the 35th successive year. Engraver: Roman Zoltowski makes an annual odyssey from his home in Poland to perform his cherished role at the Wimbledon Championships . Mr Zoltowski said: ‘A 76-year-old man driving from Poland in his 52-year-old car to do the engraving – it’s quite surreal isn’t it?’ ‘I sit in the engraving room, under the Royal Box just off Centre Court, with the television so I can watch the game. ‘The trophy is presented to players on court. When it comes back, covered in sweat and kisses, I engrave it and return it ready for interviews with the champion.’ Married father Mr Zoltowski started the job in 1979 while living in Wimbledon, south-west London, and working for Halfhide, the jewellers who supply the trophies and silverware to the All England Club. He has continued the job even after returning to his native Poland in 1995. Mr Zoltowski cannot fly because the small, sharp chisels he uses are considered offensive weapons by airlines. Winner: Andy Murray of Britain poses with the trophy after defeating Novak Djokovic of Serbia during the men's singles final match at the All England Lawn Tennis Championships in Wimbledon last July . So instead he packs them into his car – together with anglepoise lamps, dusters, silver cleaning fluid, tapes and magnifying glasses - and sets off in the middle weekend of the championship to make his trans-Europe trek to be in SW19 in time for the finals.

He also fills up with provisions including sandwiches, cheese, liver, sausages and energy drinks for the 18 hour journey which takes him through Germany, Holland and Belgium, stopping off with friends on route. His job has become harder in the last four years after the All England Club decided to include Christian names rather than initials on the trophy. He added: ‘Sunday is stressful. You learn to switch off. You don’t talk. But the weekend is the highlight of my year. I'm not ready to retire and wear slippers yet.

Mr Zoltowski and his family fled to Britain in 1947 after their home was seized by the Communists and turned into a collective farm. They had earlier been sent to Siberia by the invading Russians, where his father is believed to have been shot by what is now the KGB. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Mr Zoltowski and his siblings bought back their old family home and returned to Poland.","Roman Zoltowski, 76, started the job in 1979 while living in Wimbledon .

"Britain’s last hope in the women’s singles crashed out yesterday despite wearing her ‘lucky’ dress. Heather Watson lost in three sets after a battling performance against world No 7 Angelique Kerber. Watson appeared in the same high-waisted Lululemon dress she had worn for her first round victory, after asking on Twitter: ‘Yay or Nay for my Wimbledon dress?’ Lucky dress... but not enough: Heather Watson, 22, crashed out of Wimbledon leaving just Andy Murray . Despite some complaints that it didn’t do justice to her figure, most posts were supportive and she wore it again as she took to Centre Court yesterday afternoon. But it could not stop the 22-year-old British number one from losing to German Miss Kerber, leaving Andy Murray the sole singles survivor. Dejected: Heather Watson after her defeat . Afterwards she hinted she will not wear the dress next time she plays. Miss Watson’s defeat came after a top coach claimed that British tennis players are too spoilt to succeed and unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices. Belgian Julien Hoferlin coached Briton Dan Evans, 24, who lost in the first round of both the singles and men’s doubles but  still pocketed £31,000 in prize money. ‘He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices for his sport,’ Hoferlin said. 'He doesn’t understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it’s just a brief interlude in his life.’ Miss Watson said Hoferlin ‘had a point’ and fellow Briton Naomi Broady, 24, has admitted that losing her Lawn Tennis Association funding and having to pay her own way had ‘definitely made me hungrier’ to win. Miss Broady, who was stripped of her LTA funding after she posed for a risqé photograph at the age of 17, said: ‘If I don’t win, I don’t have any money.’ Mr Hoferlin, who is due to return to Belgium, told Belgian radio station RTBF: ‘The transition between the juniors and the seniors seems to be very, very bad. ‘There’s not an exceptional ""tennis culture"" at club level and the players are too spoilt.’ Goran Ivanisevic, the retired Croatian player who is the only person to win the men’s singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, also expressed concerns over Britain’s poor performance this year, saying: ‘I have always been shocked by what Britain produce. ‘For a country like this, with the expectation, you need top 10s, top fives, world number ones. ‘You need somebody who is winning Wimbledon, attracting the crowd. Unfortunately men’s and women’s tennis has not produced.’ Match: Angelique Kerber of Germany (left) beat Britain's Heather Watson (right) in three sets on Centre Court . Mr Hoferlin is not the first Belgian to accuse British players of being spoilt. Former world number one Kim Clijsters said in 2010 that British youngsters lacked the hunger to succeed because they were ruined with first-class facilities. She said: ‘We didn’t grow up with the . facilities that you guys have. And I think maybe [British] kids are a . little bit too spoiled too soon with what you have. Judy Murray (pictured) said foreign coaches were critical of British junior players . ‘I don’t know if it’s necessary at such a young age to spoil kids or to treat them like they’re it, you know. ‘If you don’t have it, it makes you work harder to achieve it. And I think that’s where I think sometimes you have to be a little bit careful.’ Andy Murray’s mother Judy, a senior coach in the women’s game, has previously said that young British tennis players had a reputation on the international tennis circuit for being ‘lazy, ill-disciplined and lacking fight on court’. Mrs Murray said in 2008 that many foreign coaches for junior players believed British teenagers were over-indulged by the Lawn Tennis Association, which makes more than £30million a year profits from Wimbledon. She said: ‘It’s often said that British juniors are lazy, ill-disciplined and lack fight on court. ‘You always hear foreign coaches and players talking about all the money spent on British juniors. ‘They say: ""There are the British, so much money, no decent players."" They ask about the money, and where all our players are. ‘There is definitely an element of jealousy in what the foreign coaches say, but the fact is that money can’t buy you success.’ The LTA has a £60million annual income, including £30million from Wimbledon and almost £3million from Sport England. An LTA spokesman said: ‘In recent years we have changed the way we support our players with the introduction of a tournament bonus scheme which puts the onus on the players to earn their funding. ‘Our new Director of Player Development Bob Brett has already talked about his ‘no compromise’ approach to high performance and he will no doubt have a big impact on the culture of our sport when he starts in September.’","The 22-year-old British number one battles Angelique Kerber of Germany .

"Humble: Andy Murray with his grandmother . He has always described himself as boring – and his diet is clearly no exception. Andy Murray has revealed that during Wimbledon he survives on a rotation of three simple evening meals and smoothies and mushed banana on bagel for breakfast. All the dishes are prepared by his long-term girlfriend, Kim Sears, at their £5m home in Oxshott, Surrey, where she is also said to the laundry and grocery shopping at Tesco. Writing on is BBC blog, Murray explained: ‘You might not be surprised to hear that I don’t order a pizza when I get in. My dinner options are kept simple during Wimbledon. ‘I have either salmon with rice, roast chicken with vegetables and potatoes, or steak with salad. My girlfriend Kim will cook and I know each night that it will be one of those three. ‘I had salmon on Tuesday night, so I knew that on Wednesday it would be one of the other two. ‘My guess was steak.’ Luckily, Murray said he can be a little more ‘creative’ with breakfast. He said: ‘I usually have a smoothie, and on Tuesday morning it involved strawberry yoghurt, raspberries, apple juice - a bunch of stuff - and then I had an apple and a peach. ‘I also had a bagel with banana. I’ve been asked a lot of questions about all sorts of things during my career, and I think I’ve said somewhere in the past that I don’t like bananas. ‘Well, I can update you - if I mush it up and put it on a bagel, it’s fine! I guess it must be the consistency.’ Murray said on the nights before a match he drinks a litre of a sports drink to ‘pre-hydrate’ and after matches he usually has a protein shake. He added: ‘It is supposed to be chocolate but, to be honest, it doesn’t taste great!’ In the past Murray’s diet has been a little more interesting. Scroll down for video . Athlete: In the past Murray has eaten up to 50 portions of sushi in one sitting to support his 6ft 3in frame . This is the recipe for Andy Murray’s breakfast smoothie. Simply pour the ingredients into a blender and whizz. One pot of strawberry yoghurt . One packet of raspberries . Half a glass of apple juice . Juice of two oranges . Handful of blueberries . Last year it included up to 50 portions of sushi in one sitting to build up his imposing 6ft 3in, 13½ stone frame. At Wimbledon he has been known to put sushi in an ice cooler so he can have it brought to him at the end of a late game. And his grandmother said this week that  to she had sent down some of her home made shortbread for him to eat after matches. While at home this week, Murray said he had been enjoying watching the World Cup during the but finds the 11 o’clock kick offs for some of the matches too late for him. Asked by a fan on Twitter in April to describe himself in one word, Murray replied ‘boring.’ But Murray’s mother, Judy, said this his son benefitted from a simple domestic life during Wimbledon. She said: ‘He certainly seems to be very relaxed. He can stay at home during Wimbledon and he has his girlfriend and his dogs there. ‘He can go back to his house and his own bed. The dogs are a great distraction for him.’","Instead of a turbo-charged diet Andy Murray eats salmon, chicken or steak .

"After divorcing her husband three years ago, Pauline Potter - already a whopping 46stone - piled on so much extra weight she became the heaviest woman in the world, weighing in at 50stone (700lb). But for ex-husband Alex (a svelte 11stone), it only made her even more irresistible. When he saw she had clinched the Guinness World Record for her enormous size, Mr Potter rushed to move back in with his former partner in Sacramento, California. Their big day: Pauline and Alex Potter were married in 2003 (above) when she weighed 43stone. After getting divorced five years later, she piled on even more pounds, reaching over 50stone . Sensual: The couple got back together after Alex saw she had become the heaviest woman in the world. Today, Mrs Potter (seen here in a recent picture) cannot walk or wash herself, but the pair say their sex life is amazing . Mrs Potter, whose weight at its peak has now reached 52 stone, told The Sun: 'Most women think losing weight is the way to get their ex's attention - but for me it was just the opposite. 'Becoming the world's heaviest woman is what made him fall in love with me all over again and we're now working on getting our relationship back on track.' The 47-year-old is now so big she cannot get around - but she is still dynamite in bed, her ex-husband told the newspaper. 'She can't walk, dress herself or even go to the toilet on her own - but I'm desperate to be her lover and caretaker again,' he said. 'I miss our sex life. Pauline could be 70st and we'd still have sex every single day because it's that good. Super-sized: The 52st woman eats a whopping 10,000 calories every day and said she contacted the Guinness Book of Records to 'humiliate' herself into getting fit . 'Within the first day of being back together, we had sex six times in 24 hours. 'Even though one of Pauline's legs weighs more than I do, we're able to position her body to make sex enjoyable for both of us.' The couple rekindled their romance on holiday in Los Angeles, according to the newspaper, but he admitted that their love was not without its obstacles. 'It's really dangerous for us to have sex because at any moment the bed could collapse and one of us could be seriously injured or even killed from the impact,' said the 46-year-old. Comfort food: Overweight Mrs Potter and her son Dillon stock up on snacks . Mrs Potter admitted her ex-husband had to do most of the work in bed, but added: 'It helps that I did gymnastics until I was 12 so I'm very limber.' The couple first married in 2003, when Mrs Potter and her son Dillon, 19, moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to live with Mr Potter and his son Sherman, now 21. But Mrs Potter said her relationship with Sherman was poor from the start, and in 2008 she filed for divorce and moved back to Sacramento. It was then that the devastated woman began stuffing her face with Big Macs, milkshakes, biscuits and cake. She was soon consuming 10,000 calories a day, according to The Sun, where the recommended allowance for a woman is 2,000.

'The turning point was when I had to ask Dillon to help me to get dressed,' said Mrs Potter, who gets $850 (£540) a month in benefits. 'I now need him to pull everything up because I can't reach behind myself. 'It also takes me an hour to shower because I have to reach my hose under each and every fat fold. It's exhausting.' Eventually, Mrs Potter decided she had to take action before she killed herself, and contacted the Guinness Book of Records .

"Wimbledon stars are in uproar over their undies – after stricter enforcement of the all-white dress code forced some to go bra-less. Others have protested that making them wear white knickers under a white dress creates a see-through effect when they perspire. Tighter guidelines were introduced after concerns that sponsors were taking liberties with the dress code and sneaking more colour into players’ outfits in a bid to promote their brand.

It means every article of clothing needs to be white – leaving no room for misinterpretation. But reigning ladies champion Marion Bartoli, who is not competing this year after retiring from the sport, said women players were up in arms over the new rules, which risked compromising their dignity. And former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash . claimed his trademark black-and-white check bandana would be banned . today, adding that the guidelines were ridiculous and had gone too far, . in an attempt to return to tradition. The new rules – the strictest in . tennis – state ‘white does not include off-white or cream’ and that a . single trim of colour around a neckline, cuff and sleeve can be no wider . than one centimetre.

Centre Court  tickets for tomorrow, . when Andy Murray is  due to play, were  priced at £1,800 . Even caps, headbands, bandanas, wristbands and socks must be white, apart from the one-centimetre strip of colour. Cash revealed that some of the men were upset over the rules as well, saying: ‘One of the players was called into the referees’ office because he had blue underwear that showed through when he got sweaty, so he was told not to wear dark underwear. ‘Some of the girls have been told to go back and change their bras and tops because they had slight colour on them. 'I believe some of the girls didn’t have suitable sports bras and had to go without them. It has absolutely gone ridiculous.’ Britain’s Naomi Broady wore no bra when she was defeated by Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday, although it is not clear if this was because it did not meet the rules. Earlier this week, Venus Williams led a dress code rebellion by threatening to wear bold animal print underwear beneath her tennis whites. Miss Williams, 34, admitted on Twitter that she planned to test the rules and also posted a photo of bright pink and orange tie-dyed sports bras. Was she affected?

Self-confessed ‘hothead’ Fabio Fognini, 27, was ordered to pay £16,000 following an outburst during his first round match. He told ground supervisor Wayne McKewen in Italian that he wanted to break his racket on his head, after he was warned about throwing it. He then said to umpire James Keothavong: ‘When you get up in the morning, all you think about is putting gel in your hair.’ The fines will be docked from the £71,000 the World No 15 is guaranteed for reaching the third round. Tennis fans criticised a ‘cringeworthy’ BBC interview with Andy Murray which was carried out by a dog puppet. The two-minute chat with Children’s BBC character Hacker T Dog was aired during the highlights programme with John Inverdale on BBC2 on Wednesday night.

"Andy Murray stormed through to the last 16 of Wimbledon last night – but then moaned that his family had snubbed him in victory. After his straight sets victory over Roberto Bautista Agut on Centre Court, he complained that they had opted to watch his elder brother Jamie who was playing a doubles match at the same time. Apparently joking, he said: ‘It’s a shame.

"A top coach has claimed that British tennis players are too spoilt to succeed and unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices. Julien Hoferlin of Belgium spoke out hours before Heather Watson tumbled out of Wimbledon in the second round, leaving Andy Murray as the sole British representative left in the tournament. The coach trained 24-year-old Briton Dan Evans, who lost in the first round of both the singles and men’s doubles at the championships but still pocketed £31,000 in prize money. Scroll down for video . 'Bad transition': Belgian tennis coach Julien Hoferlin (right) claimed that British players are too spoilt to succeed and unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices . Mr Hoferlin said: ‘He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices... He doesn’t understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it’s just a brief interlude in his life.’ Watson said Hoferlin ‘had a point’ and fellow Briton Naomi Broady, 24, has admitted losing her Lawn Tennis Association funding and having to pay her own way had ‘definitely made me hungrier’ to win. Miss Broady, who was stripped of her LTA funding after she posed for a risqé photograph at the age of 17, said: ‘If I don’t win, I don’t have any money.’ Mr Hoferlin, who is due to return to Belgium, told Belgian radio station RTBF on Wednesday: ‘The transition between the juniors and the seniors seems to be very, very bad. ‘There’s not an exceptional ""tennis culture"" at club level and the players are too spoilt.’ Following the comments from Mr Hoferlin, Evans wrote on Twitter: 'Just like to say thanks to Julien Hoferlin for all his efforts - coaching me three times helped me a lot and most of all a true friend!' When another Twitter user named Nadine Travis suggested that she detected 'a small amount of sarcasm' in this comment, Evans replied to her: 'Not one bit! He is one of the good ones around!' Goran Ivanisevic, the retired Croatian player who is the only person to win the men’s singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, also expressed concerns over Britain’s poor performance this year. Dejected: Heather Watson tumbled out of Wimbledon in the second round yesterday, losing 6-2 5-7 6-1 . Stripped of her funding: Briton Naomi Broady, 24, has admitted that losing her Lawn Tennis Association funding and having to pay her own way had 'definitely made me hungrier' to win . He said: ‘I have always been shocked by what Britain produce. For a country like this, with the expectation, you need top 10s, top fives, world number ones. ‘You need somebody who is winning Wimbledon, attracting the crowd. Unfortunately men’s and women’s tennis has not produced.’ Following Watson’s 6-2 5-7 6-1 loss to Germany's world number seven Kerber on Centre Court yesterday, she said of Mr Hoferlin’s comments: ‘I understand where he's coming from. 'He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices for his sport. He doesn’t understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it’s just a brief interlude in his life' Julien Hoferlin on Dan Evans . ‘I see it with some players more than others. You know, we are a strong, rich federation, so I can see that people would say that whether we're doing well or not. ‘You can see that with those rich federations. I see his point. I see some players not working week-in, week-out, kind of choosing when they want to work. ‘Not just the players, but I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it. Nothing is said if they just don't want to play that week or don't want to give it. ‘I don't think it's all the players, I think it's the coaches too.’ Guernsey native Watson has battled back into the world's top 60 after a wretched 2013 entirely blighted by glandular fever. The 22-year-old underlined her fighting spirit in shrugging off a sloppy 26-minute spell that handed Kerber the first set to force a decider. 'He makes no sacrifices': Mr Hoferlin coach trained 24-year-old Briton Dan Evans, who lost in the first round of both the singles and men's doubles but still pocketed £31,000 in prize money . Hard worker: Watson said Mr Hoferlin's comments were not fair for the likes of Katy Dunne (pictured), 19, who is the current world number 380 and British number eight . Watson admitted she has watched current British players ease through training regimes. ‘If a player wants to make it, it's all up to them,’ she said. ‘I do see where he's coming from with some players; with others, I do feel they give a lot of the hard work. 'See some players not working week-in, week-out, kind of choosing when they want to work. Not just the players, but I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it' Heather Watson . ‘For example, I see Katy Dunne. I did an off-season training camp with her, and every single day she worked hard and pushed. Then I've done it with others and I saw a very different story.’ Dunne, 19, is the current world number 380 and British number eight. Ross Hutchins, back in the doubles fold after beating cancer, admitted British tennis suffers chronic underachievement, but refused to endorse Mr Hoferlin's ‘spoilt’ claim. ‘Apart from Andy (Murray), our players could be higher ranked,’ said Hutchins, who lost out to Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero in the doubles with Colin Fleming. ‘The resources and the juniors we have, we would hope to have more progression from the age of 17 to 20 and onwards.

'Shocked': Goran Ivanisevic, the retired Croatian player who is the only person to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, also expressed concerns over Britain's poor performance this year . ‘As of spoilt, I don't really know. Julien would have a pretty good estimation of that considering he was . right in the mix of it. I think we get given a lot, I think we're . appreciative of it.’ Mr Hoferlin is not the first Belgian to accuse British players of being spoilt. Former . world number one Kim Clijsters said in 2010 that British youngsters . lacked the hunger to succeed because they were ruined with first-class . facilities. 'I have always been shocked by what Britain produce. For a country like this, with the expectation, you need top 10s, top fives, world number ones' Goran Ivanisevic . She said: ‘We . didn’t grow up with the facilities that you guys have. And I think maybe . [British] kids are a little bit too spoiled too soon with what you . have. ‘I don’t know if it’s necessary at such a young age to spoil kids or to treat them like they’re it, you know. ‘If you don’t have it, it makes you work harder to achieve it. And I think that’s where I think sometimes you have to be a little bit careful.’ Andy Murray’s mother Judy, a senior coach in the women’s game, has previously said that young British tennis players had a reputation on the international tennis circuit for being ‘lazy, ill-disciplined and lacking fight on court’.

Mrs Murray said in 2008 that many foreign coaches for junior players believed British teenagers were over-indulged by the LTA, which makes more than £30million a year profits from Wimbledon. She said: ‘It’s often said that British juniors are lazy, ill-disciplined and lack fight on court. You always hear foreign coaches and players talking about all the money spent on British juniors. 'The resources and the juniors we have, we would hope to have more progression from the age of 17 to 20 and onwards' Ross Hutchins . ‘They say: ""There are the British, so much money, no decent players."" They ask about the money, and where all our players are. ‘There is definitely an element of jealousy in what the foreign coaches say, but the fact is that money can’t buy you success.’ The LTA has a £60million annual income, including £30million from Wimbledon and almost £3million from Sport England. An LTA spokesman said: ‘In recent years we have changed the way we support our players with the introduction of a tournament bonus scheme which puts the onus on the players to earn their funding. ‘Our new Director of Player Development Bob Brett has already talked about his ""no compromise"" approach to high performance and he will no doubt have a big impact on the culture of our sport when he starts in September.’","Belgian Julien Hoferlin speaks out as Heather Watson exits Wimbledon .

"Trendsetter: Pat Cash in 1987 scaling the roof of the Centre Court commentary box to celebrate with family . It has become one of Wimbledon’s more enduring images – champions scaling the roof of the Centre Court commentary box to celebrate with their watching family. But now health and safety concerns have put paid to what began as an impromptu celebration of success. All England Club officials have this year fitted a gate so instead of clambering on to the narrow ash felt roof and into the stands, players can walk up steps to the competitors’ box. The move is expected to end to the practice started by Pat Cash in 1987 and followed by many subsequent champions including Andy Murray after his victory last year. Disgruntled fans quickly nicknamed the new addition to Centre Court ‘killjoy gate’ and ‘party-pooper gate’. And Cash himself seemed disappointed, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ‘That’s really taking the challenge out of it. If they’re fit enough to win Wimbledon, I think they should climb up or have some other sort of challenge. It’s way too easy now.’ After his victorious match point in last year’s final, an emotional Murray clambered through the stands at the All England Club to embrace  two rows of Team Murray, including then coach Ivan Lendl. Ironically, Cash started the tradition after defeating then world number one Lendl. He has previously said that he ‘knew it’d be a first in pretty much any sport’ but his rebellious nature spurred him on. He added: ‘I don’t think anybody knew what was going on as I ran over into the crowd … I got to the edge of the commentary box and I was worried that it might go crashing through – it was just a little booth with no proper roof … It held, thankfully. ‘I gave everyone in the team area a hug – Princess Diana and the royals were in the box next door, but I quickly decided against continuing my climb.’ British tennis star Andy Murray also climbed to see his family when he won the Wimbledon title last year . It became a Wimbledon tradition that has been followed by many other champions at other Grand Slam events. However, not all have rushed to the stands. Seven times winner Roger Federer has always shunned the tradition because he believes it is unfair to leave the runner-up alone on the court. Serbian player Novak Djokovic, who celebrated his first Wimbledon title in 2011 by eating the grass, said climbing up to the players’ box was an important tradition. He said: ‘I can’t say it’s wrong for the players to go straight to their box after they win the match because I understand the need to share this beautiful moment and victory with your closest ones.’ Other names proposed for the gate on Twitter included ‘Jobsworth Gate’ and ‘Health and Safety Gets Out of Hand Gate’. Though one suggested the more poetic ‘The Gate Of Hugs’. A Wimbledon spokesman said: ‘It’s just to make it easier for them. It’s safe. It was installed in time for this year’s Championships to make it easier for players to access their team.’","Officials fitted a gate so players have to walk up steps to competitors' box .

"Two days ago she was lifted up in the air in a gesture of triumph after her aunt won her first ever match at the Wimbledon Championships. But slumped over the railings with her hand clasped over her mouth, five-year-old Lola Rose looked distraught last night as she watched Naomi Broady crash out in the second round. Tennis fans had been championing for Miss Broady, 24, after it emerged she had funded her own career since being dropped by the Lawn Tennis Association over a risqué photograph when she was 17. Feeling the strain: Slumped over the railings with her hand clasped over her mouth, five-year-old Lola Rose looked distraught last night as she watched her aunt Naomi Broady crash out in the second round . But last night the player was defeated after a hard-fought match against her doppelganger, Danish Caroline Wozniacki. Afterwards, the humble player, who is 163rd in the world, said she apologised to her opponent, who is 16th, ‘for not giving her a very good match for her next round’. Miss Broady has had no coach, physiotherapist or nutritionist since she was stripped of her funding by the LTA in 2007 when she posted a photograph of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively in front of a condom machine on a night out. Celebration: Two days ago Lola Rose was lifted up in the air after her aunt won her first ever match at the Wimbledon Championships . After her victory on Monday, she said it was ‘really satisfying’ to know she had done it on her own and only had herself to thank. She also spoke about her young niece watching in the stands, whom she had hugged and kissed after her win, saying: ‘She just turned five. ‘We are very close  she let me give her kisses today. ‘Normally she wipes them off.  But I was allowed to give them today.’ Miss Broady and Miss Wozniacki, 23, looked near-identical on the court yesterday with matching long blonde plaits, white sun visors and gold necklaces. The similar outfits caused confusion for some tennis fans, with one tweeting: ‘It really is a shame that Wozniacki and Broady look exactly the same in the wide shots.’ Both women smiled on court when fans screamed ‘I love you Naomi’, followed by ‘we love you too Caroline’, during a quiet moment in the match. Wozniacki split from her fiancée Rory McIlroy last month just days after they had sent out their wedding invitations after the golfer got cold feet. Miss Broady paid tribute to her opponent last night, saying: ‘She’s very sweet, such a nice girl inside and out.  She’s been through a rough time recently, and I’m super happy for her to go through the next round.  Even if she had to beat me. ‘Damn her.’ Naomi Broady last night claimed a last-minute change of court had effected her composure during the match she to Caroline Wozniacki. She said: ‘It was a bit of a rush that we were moved on to Court One. ‘We weren’t sure if we had been moved to Centre or One, and then it was sort of, ‘Oh, you’re going to be on One literally now. ‘So I was only really half ready to get ready in five minutes to go on court. ‘I was a little bit uncomposed at the start of the match, if that’s a word.So there was lots of errors on court today.'

After months of preparation, there will no doubt be sore losers aplenty at Wimbledon.

He also reached the third round of the French Open last year, when he was ranked number 24, and the final of the Serbian Open in 2012. Both tournaments are played on his favourite surface, clay. But this season he has lost all three of his grass-court singles matches. And he was dealt another blow  yesterday when he was beaten in the men’s doubles with partner Tomasz Bednarek against Aleksandr Nedovyesov and Dmitry Tursunov.","Brit Naomi Broady, 24, lost to Danish doppelganger Caroline Wozniaki .

"Sing when you are winning: Heather Watson became the third Briton to make it to the next round of Wimbledon . Heather Watson raised her racket in triumph yesterday as she became the third Briton to make it through to the next round of Wimbledon. The 22-year-old rising star, who has only just recovered from glandular fever, won in straight sets over Croatian Ajla Tomljanovic. The British number one, who went out in the first round last year, won the hearts of the home crowd after a confident win on Court Three at the All England Club. Miss Watson made it to the second . round despite suffering from such crippling nerves that she developed . insomnia and could not eat beforehand. Thanking . the supporters afterwards, she said: From the beginning when I walked . onto the court and they said my name, the crowd was very positive and . behind me the whole way. ‘I really enjoyed playing here today and on that court.  I do like that court a lot.’ Miss Watson’s win is good news for her parents, who have banned from attending her matches in case it is unlucky. But . she has now agreed to put her superstitions aside if she makes it to . the second week, saying: ‘We made a deal. If I get to the second week . then they’re coming. ‘It’s absolutely possible, but I’m . just focused on playing as best I can now. And when the draw does come . out I’ll only be looking as far as that match.’ The . Guernsey player, who jumped ahead of Laura Robson in the world rankings . last month when she reached the second round of the French Open, said: . ‘I was a bit nervous going on to court. ‘I struggle to eat before I go on, and actually my jaw was locking and I couldn’t even bite through my banana. ‘But it was good. Once I got on court, I got moving. I got into it.’ Miss . Watson has previously spoken out about her trouble with insomnia during . Grand Slams, and yesterday revealed that Wimbledon has been no . exception. She said: ‘I . didn’t sleep that great last night. I woke up at 4am, I woke up and I . was ready to go. But, that’s becoming normal.  It doesn’t matter.’ Alright then mum: Superstitious Miss Watson has agreed to lift the ban on her parents attending her matches if she makes it to the second week . Fair play: Miss Watson shakes hands with Croatia's Ajla Tomljanovic after winning their women's singles first round match on day two of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships . Watson, Andy Murray, 27, and Naomi Broady, 24, are now the only Britons left in the competition. Laura Robson, who made it the fourth round of Wimbledon last year, has been forced to miss the event this year due to a wrist injury. Yesterday, Miss Watson paid tribute to her friend Miss Broady, who triumphed on Monday despite being was stripped of her funding as a teenager when she posted a photo of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively next to a condom machine. Miss Watson, who is 60th in the world, while Miss Broady is 163rd. said: ‘I’m very close with Naomi, she was probably the first tennis player I did know, and our families are very close. ‘I was so happy when I saw she won, she so deserves it.’ Meanwhile there was disappointment for Samantha Murray who was thrashed in straight sets by former Wimbledon Champion Maria Sharapova. But she took heart from the fact she managed to ace the recent French Open winner several times. Miss Murray, 26, from Cheshire, was a British wildcard entry and is 238th in the world, compared to number five seed Sharapova. New man? Recently single Caroline Wozniacki . Only weeks after being unceremoniously dumped by her fiance Rory McIlroy, Caroline Wozniacki is enjoying a flirtation with Spanish player Feliciano Lopez. Golfer McIlroy, 25, announced last month they had split up after he realised he was not ready for marriage – just days after sending out their wedding invitations. But Danish player Wozniacki, 23, giggled and blushed when asked about fellow player Lopez yesterday, describing him as ‘a great guy’. The press conference followed her victory against Israeli Shahar Peer in the first round of the Wimbledon Championships. Asked about Lopez’s presence at all of her recent matches, Wozniacki laughed: ‘You noticed that, huh? Yeah, I noticed he was on the sidelines in Eastbourne. He’s a great guy. This is awkward.’ But she added that she is quite happy being single for the moment, saying: ‘To be honest, I’ll just see what happens.’ The 32-year-old Lopez was once dubbed ‘Deliciano’ by Andy Murray’s mother Judy, who tweeted: ‘Ooh Deliciano… looking good out there. As always.’ The luxury Scottish hotel owned by Andy Murray has removed references to hunting from its website after pressure from animal rights campaigners. The Wimbledon champion bought Cromlix, near his home town of Dunblane, last year. Campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to him complaining that the hotel promoted hunting as a possible activity for guests. Its letter said: ‘The idea of hunting cats and dogs ... would rightly make most of us sick, and yet the animals listed on the website, alongside the best times of year to kill them, have exactly the same capacity to feel pain and suffer.’ A spokesman for Murray said references to hunting were removed from the website this month and the activity was never offered on the hotel’s grounds. Peta praised Murray last year when it emerged the hotel menu would not include foie gras.","Heather Watson third Brit to make it to the next round of Wimbledon .

"England's most encouraging performance against Italy came from the fearless 19-year-old Raheem Sterling. But success was not always certain for a man whose teacher once warned: ‘You’ll either end up playing for England, or in prison.’ A surprise inclusion in Saturday’s line-up, the Liverpool winger was instrumental throughout. Scroll down for video... Troubled past: Raheem Sterling, 19, went from a North London housing estate to being England's rising star . His transfer value is now thought to have reached some £30million, while his club is expected to more than double his £30,000-a-week wages to £70,000 when he returns from Brazil. Such dizzying figures are a world away from his troubled youth on one of London’s toughest housing estates. Sterling moved to St Raphael’s, in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, from Jamaica at the age of five with his mother Nadine and three siblings. He was removed from mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems. One teacher warned him: ‘If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be in prison or playing for England.’ As prophesised, Sterling made his England debut as a 17-year-old, two years after signing for Liverpool. Fearless: England's most encouraging performance against Italy came from the 19-year-old Sterling (right) However, off the field he had already . earned a reputation as a bad boy, fathering a daughter from a brief . relationship at the age of 16. Last year he was cleared of attacking . 19-year-old model Shana Ann Rose Halliday after she declined to give . evidence against him. He had already had a common assault charge against him dismissed after a witness failed to turn up to court. Team sheet: Raheem Sterling is expected to more than double his wages when he returns from Brazil . Miss Halliday admitted starting the . row with Sterling that led to him being charged. ‘We had a heated . argument because I had seen a text on his phone and asked who it was . [from],’ she said. ‘We were pushing and shoving, both of us, and I . started it because I was trying to get his phone.’ As with most players, Sterling’s body is covered with tattoos. One piece of body art pays tribute to his mother, who has now moved from London to Liverpool to support his career. The script on his bicep reads: ‘Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me, through all the pain and suffering.’ During a recent interview, he jokingly described her as his personal ‘Jose Mourinho’, in reference to the outspoken Chelsea manager. Sterling told the BBC: ‘She’s a big part of my life ... she tries to have too much of a say sometimes. I try to listen to her, because most of what she says is right. ‘She’ll certainly tell me when I’m not doing something right. At other times she’ll say I’m not listening to her. There’s been a few clashes with her.’ Sterling did not escape trouble during the build-up to the World Cup, receiving a red card for a reckless challenge in a friendly against Ecuador. Crucially, he kept his head in the heat of Manaus on Saturday night – and could yet guide England to the next round.","The 19-year-old footballer grew up on an estate in Brent, north London .

"There was a standing ovation for her son as he arrived on Centre Court as the first British man to defend a Wimbledon singles title for 77 years. But up in the stands yesterday, Andy Murray’s mother Judy was getting ready to become the star of the show herself. Mrs Murray is said to be in the ‘advanced stage’ of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing. Murray is said to be in the 'advanced stage' of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing . The 54-year-old is a big fan of the BBC programme and often posts saucy comments about its male performers on her Twitter account. A source said: ‘The final line-up is due to be announced in four weeks’ time and Judy is a long way down in talks to appear on it.’ Her friend and former British tennis number one Andrew Castle, who appeared on Strictly in 2008, has described Mrs Murray as  a ‘Strictly nut’ who would jump at the chance of appearing on  the programme. But he fears her 27-year-old son will be left squirming with embarrassment at his mother’s antics on screen and would be better off watching the show ‘through his fingers’. Mrs Murray was vocal about her admiration for the male dancers on the programme  last year after watching the Strictly Confidential stage  spin-off in Glasgow. She posed for a picture with topless Russian star Artem Chigvintsev and posted it on Twitter with the comment: ‘Check this girls. Strictly Confidential but … life may well be complete now.’ Judy Murray posing with Russian dancer Artem Chigvintsev, as he was stripped to the waist . A year earlier, she also posted cringe-inducing commentary about the celebrity performers at Strictly Come Dancing’s Live UK Tour at the SECC in Glasgow. Former footballer Robbie Savage and Olympic swimmer Mark Foster received most of the attention, with Mrs Murray writing on Twitter: ‘I’ll need a lie down after this. Ooooh Rob. You have perfected the pelvic thrust.’ Then, when Foster took the stage, she posted: ‘Mark Foster says he will dance his Speedos if he wins Strictly tonight. Ooh er. Get voting.’ Her son was also left aghast  in 2011 when Mrs Murray  posted a series of tweets praising the good looks of his Spanish Wimbledon opponent  Feliciano Lopez. In a rare outburst, Murray declared: ‘I think it’s about  time that she stopped that  nonsense. It’s making me throw up. It’s disgusting.’ If his mother does appear in this autumn’s Strictly, she will have to fit it around her duties as captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup Team. Mrs Murray trained Andy and his older brother Jamie – now a successful doubles player – on public courts in their home town of Dunblane. Mrs Murray entertains fans by playing with a rubber chicken at Wimbledon yesterday . She is credited with passing on her competitive spirit to her sons, and is often seen in the crowd fist-pumping and making faces during big points. Mrs Murray – who once received vile hate mail accusing her of being a pushy parent – was greeted by embraces from friends and adoring fans alike as she watched her son sail into second round yesterday in a straight sets win over Belgian David Goffin. And if she had felt any parental anxiety ahead of the clash, she hid it well, laughing and joking with fans queuing outside Centre Court. Dressed casually in a loose-fitting lemon jumper and patterned black and yellow trousers, Mrs Murray was seen attempting to rally with a spectator – playing with purple novelty tennis racquets and a rubber chicken instead of a ball. She was joined by her son’s girlfriend Kim Sears and  his new coach Amélie Mauresmo to watch him defeat Goffin, 23, who is ranked 105 in the world. Prior to the match, Judy tweeted a photograph of Mauresmo and Murray in matching T-shirts and nicknamed the duo ‘Murresmo’. Last week she told of her ‘survivor’s guilt’ over the Dunblane massacre in 1996, when 16 children and a teacher were killed at the school attended by her sons. Mrs Murray, who is divorced from her children’s father Willie, said she still becomes emotional when she revisits the town to talk about ‘everything that Andy and Jamie have achieved’.","Judy Murray in talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing .

"Holland struggled to a 3-1 victory over 10-man Kazakhstan in a European Championship qualifier on Friday. Defender Renat Abdulin gave 127th-ranked Kazakhstan a shock lead at the Amsterdam Arena with a powerful 17th-minute header from a poorly-defended corner and the Netherlands had an anxious wait until the 62nd minute when substitute Klaas Jan Huntelaar leveled. A deflected 82nd-minute shot by Ibrahim Afellay, who started his first international in nearly two years, put the Dutch ahead before Robin van Persie's penalty in the last minute of injury time secured the three points and coach Guus Hiddink's first win in three matches since taking over from Louis van Gaal after the World Cup.

In other Group A matches, the Czech Republic beat Turkey 2-1 in Istanbul and Iceland won 3-0 in Latvia to give both teams their second straight qualification victories and keep them at the top of the group. Umut Bulut gave Turkey the lead in the eighth minute, but defender Tomas Sivok levelled seven minutes later when he headed in a corner. Borek Dockal gave the Czechs victory with a neat finish just before the hour mark.

The Dutch win took the Netherlands to third spot in Group A. Hiddink's team takes on Iceland on Monday in Reykjavik, Kazakhstan hosts the Czech Republic and Turkey travels to Latvia.

The Schalke striker could have leveled only two minutes after coming on if Van Persie had passed to him unmarked in front of goal, but the Dutch captain instead flashed a shot across goal from a tight angle, prompting an angry response from Huntelaar. 'In that position, I had every right to shoot, so I thought the reaction was a bit over the top,' Van Persie said. Huntelaar grabbed the equalizer anyway when he headed in an Afellay cross. Two minutes later, the match turned when Baurzhan Dzholchiyev was sent off for a tackle from behind on Afellay, depleting the defensive wall the Kazakhs had erected in front of their goal.

Van Persie, who had repeatedly threatened Mokin's goal as the Dutch laid siege to the Kazakh goal, finally got on the score sheet thanks to an 89th-minute penalty. 'We can be satisfied,' Hiddink said. 'In the first half we put them under pressure and it is an unwritten law that if you don't score then you will score in the last 20 minutes.'

"Many a fan enjoys watching the tennis while sipping tea poured from a Thermos flask. But now terrorism fears have ended even this most innocent of Wimbledon activities. Security guards are confiscating flasks during compulsory bag searches at the entrance gates. Tea-less at tennis: Wimbledon fans have been forced to leave their tea at the gate after a new ban on Thermos flasks has been enforced . Fans who arrived unaware of the crackdown were forced to leave their flasks at left luggage areas in the car parks – for a £5 fee. Simply handing the flask to security and returning later to pick it up is not an option as the flask will be thrown away. Spectators called the ban outrageous, particularly because cups of tea and coffee on sale inside the club cost £3. One G4S guard told an irate woman made to surrender her flask that the ban was being enforced because of last year’s atrocity at the Boston Marathon, where a pressure cooker in a rucksack was used as an explosive that killed three and injured 176. Safety measure: Thermos flasks have been banned in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings . There are fears that thermos flasks - or vacuum flasks – could also be turned into bombs if packed with explosives. At one entrance to Wimbledon yesterday, security staff had confiscated a dozen flasks by midday. A guard said that while the ban was introduced last year, security had been briefed to rigorously enforce it at this year’s championships. As well as the risk of terrorism, there were also concerns that disruptive fans might lob them onto courts during play, he said. But  Caroline Fiennes, philanthropy advisor and author, said: ‘I queued on Monday, as I have in about four previous years, and I’ve always thought it rather delightful that one can take in food and drink. ‘I’ve always taken a flask of tea but this year you can’t take them in, so I had to check mine in the left luggage before security - tea and all. Disaster. ‘If you look at their hilarious leaflet about ‘the queue’, the list of banned items includes Thermos flasks, but not hard-sided bottles of water. ‘Honestly, what injury can you cause a player with a thermos that you couldn’t cause with a Sigg bottle? Of course Brits want to bring tea.’ Novelist Tim Lott wrote on Twitter: ‘Wimbledon security guards confiscated my coffee thermos. ‘I fought for my rights but they were steely eyed and relentless #thirsty #Wimbledon’ And Lara Soetekouw posted: ‘Can’t serve yourself some hot tea while watching the games? Outrageous! #Wimbledon.’ As anger grew, one local cafe helped thirsty fans by offering free cups of coffee in Wimbledon. Cafe Pod said on Twitter: ‘Thermos flasks banned from #Wimbledon. Need a pre-Tennis fix? We’ll be serving #FREE #coffee in #SW19 this fortnight!’ Spectators cannot leave thermos flasks at the gate and collect them later. Any that are left will be thrown out. However, they have the option to take them to left luggage areas near car parks around the club for a £5 charge. Tradition: Several fans have protested against the new ban, lamenting not having a hot drink while watching the tennis . Cool boxes and camping chairs are also banned but bottles of wine and spirits and up to two beers are allowed. Other items spectators are banned from bringing include bags exceeding 16’ by 12’ and items which may be interpreted as a ‘potential weapon’ including knives, large corkscrews and ‘personal protection’ sprays. Clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification intended for ‘ambush marketing’ are also forbidden, as are banners, rattles, klaxons and oversized hats. Alex Salmond flouted an additional All England Club rule which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft when he unfurled a Scottish Saltire in the Royal Box on Centre Court after Andy Murray’s historic win last year. The Scottish First Minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife’s handbag before waving around behind David Cameron’s head as he celebrated the victory. He later insisted no-one sticks to the rule banning large flags around Centre Court, and after waiting 117 years for a Scot to win the men’s singles ‘a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all’. A Wimbledon spokesman said: ‘We try to ensure that visitors know in advance our conditions of entry which are widely publicised.’ Emotional: Marion Bartoli was visibly moved on the court Tuesday . Reigning Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli wept as she stepped out on Centre Court for the first time since lifting the trophy last summer. The French tennis star, who has since been forced to retire due to a shoulder injury, became emotional after she received a standing ovation from the crowd. It was all the more poignant because she was taking part in a commemorative coin toss in honour of Elena Baltacha, a former British number one, who died of liver cancer last month aged 30. The 29-year-old wiped away tears before she performed the toss with Elle Robus-Miller, a nine-year-old pupil at The Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, in Ipswich. She later apologised for her tears, tweeting: ‘I’m sorry I got so emotional. I couldn’t hold my tears being on the Centre Court & supporting #rally4bally,’ referring to Baltacha’s charity. Last year, Miss Bartoli was the victim of sexist remarks by BBC commentator John Inverdale, who suggested she had become so successful because she was ‘never going to be a looker’. However, the pair worked together at the French Open last month and she proved she had put the comments behind her by sitting on the BBC sofa yesterday to give her verdict on her fellow players. Asked about the episode earlier in the week, she laughed and said she had a ‘very short memory’, adding: ‘Last year for me it was all about winning Wimbledon.’ In the Royal Box yesterday, there was a face-off in the moustache stakes. Sir Bruce Forsyth, seen above with Strictly co-host Tess Daly, was preened to perfection but he was eclipsed by a rather dastardly looking Hugh Jackman, who is playing Blackbeard in a new movie.","Flasks banned over fears they can be turned into bombs .

"It is the night that millions have been waiting for with excitement... and trepidation. England’s footballers play their first game of the World Cup tonight in front of a global TV audience of three billion, 20million of them in the UK. Perfect barbecue weather is forecast for much of the country ahead of the match in which Roy Hodgson’s boys will take on Italy in Brazil. Scroll down for video... Gearing up: England fans preparing for the match yesterday outside the opera house in Manaus, Brazil . Retailers are expecting a £1billion  spending bonanza from sales of TVs,  football shirts, bunting, flags, party  food and drink. But there are also fears that the tournament could lead to ugly scenes in some town centres thanks to a controversial decision to extend pub opening hours. A third of those planning to watch the game in the UK are expected to be in a pub or bar, and police and paramedics are braced for a rise in alcohol-fuelled violence. They point to a potentially toxic mix of warm weather and the fact that the Government has allowed pubs to open late to cater for the 11pm kick off. One leading medical figure, Dr Clifford Mann, said the decision ‘makes no sense’. Thousands of extra police officers are being deployed around the country as forces put on extra patrols to clamp down on drunken thuggish behaviour. Knight: Paul Farrell from Skegness arrives at the airport in Manaus - and things are heating up back home too . Preparations: Police motorbikes have also lined the streets surrounding the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus . The London Ambulance Service plans to run special ‘booze buses’ – which look similar to mini-vans – that can accommodate six drunks at a time. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it is treating tonight like a ‘mini New Year’. Licensing laws are being relaxed during England’s World Cup matches after a personal intervention from the Prime Minister, so every pub and bar is free to open late without having to apply for a special licence. Dr Mann, president of the College of . Emergency Medicine, called it an unwelcome move which was likely to lead . to violence and abusive behaviour. The flag of St George will fly over 10 Downing Street for England’s World Cup matches, in a show of support for Roy Hodgson’s team. Although the gesture is well-intentioned, Steven Gerrard and company may not welcome the prime ministerial endorsement – for they could now be struck by the Curse of Cameron. The PM, who visited the England team at their Staffordshire training base before they left for Brazil, has been blamed for jinxing Andy Murray, Tom Daley and a string of other sportsmen and women with good luck messages during his time in office. In an article in the BMJ he said: ‘The consequences of alcohol abuse are seen daily in the country’s emergency departments and manifest themselves as injuries, as well as acute and chronic illnesses. ‘This temporary relaxation of the licensing laws... sets a precedent that those with vested interests can use to encourage the exception to become the norm. ‘Those vested interests... must not be allowed to peddle the notion that sporting events are best enjoyed with alcohol.’ Retailers, however, were hoping to do even better than the last World Cup in South Africa in 2010, not least because of greater consumer confidence in the improving economy. Sales of widescreen TVs at Tesco have almost doubled ahead of the event. More than 5,000 diehard England fans have travelled to the steamy Amazonian city of Manaus for tonight’s game. They have been asked to pay between £300 and £500 a night for basic hotel rooms that would normally cost just £40. Hundreds more stayed in Rio and gathered on Copacabana beach. England’s players have been training at Manaus’s 46,000 capacity Arena da Amazonia stadium in 80F heat and 84 per cent humidity. Incredibly last night there were still finishing touches being put to a stadium that should have been completed and tested more than a year ago. Hodgson’s team are among the tournament’s underdogs. But their millions of fans back home will be praying they make it through  the group to at least the quarter-finals of the competition England have not won since the glory days of 1966.

"Andy Murray has revealed that his win at Wimbledon last year helped him pocket £8million. The player picked up £1.6million after becoming the first Briton to take the men’s single title at the championships for 77 years. It added to other prize money and lucrative sponsorship deals which have made him worth an estimated £32million over the course of his career. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray has earned £8million since lifting the Wimbledon men's singles trophy last year and is now worth £32million . Mr Murray and girlfriend Kim Sears live in a a five bedroom property with two double garages in Oxshott, Surrey, which he bought for £5m in 2009 . But with this year’s championships starting today, 27-year-old Murray has admitted he has not always been astute in his financial affairs. He said his biggest regret was buying a £135,000 Ferrari in 2009 which he sold after only six months because he felt self-conscious behind the wheel of the luxury sports car. ‘It had depreciated quite a bit when I sold it,’ he told the Sunday Times. After fast cars, his greatest extravagance was private jets, he said. He uses a company called NetJets, which enables him to buy a share of a jet that can be used for a number of hours a year for a cost of up to £3million a year. ‘Private air travel sounds extravagant, but it saves so much hassle, especially flying between tournaments.’ Murray, who has lucrative sponsorship deals with sports companies Adidas and Head and Swiss watch-maker Rado, last week signed a multi-million-pound deal with Standard Life. The Cromlix House hotel, near where the former Wimbledon champion grew up in Dunblane, which he recently bought for £2million . He owns a five-bedroom property with two double garages in Surrey, which he bought for £5million in 2009 and shares with his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears. The player also owns two apartments in Miami worth several hundred thousand pounds which he and his coaching team use when he trains in the US. And he recently bought a luxury hotel in Scotland, Cromlix, for £2million, which is close to where he grew up in Dunblane. His other big expenditure is holidays. He said: ‘Being on the road so much and training all the time, we get to go on one or two really nice holidays a year where I can switch off. It’s vital for physical and mental recovery.’ Even the Morrisons in Wimbledon got into the tennis spirit - by changing its name to Murrisons in support of Andy Murray and other British tennis hopefuls. Last year the supermarket switched its sign to read 'Murriwins' after Andy's historic victory . Murray said his long-term financial goals were to plan for life after tennis and look after his family and friends. His advice on money was to ‘not to take it for granted, so to respect it’. Meanwhile Virginia Wade has claimed she thought Murray was joking when he announced he had hired a female coach, France’s Amelie Mauresmo, 34. Miss Wade, 68, the 1977 women’s singles Wimbledon champion, said: ‘Mauresmo was a total shock, I thought they were all fooling around. I think he’s maybe trying to mess with everybody.’ In 2012 Miss Wade accused Murray of being a ‘drama queen’ when his back gave way during a match at the French Open. Asked last night if he was surprised by her comments, Murray said: ‘No. She’s done it a few times.’ Andy Murray training at Wimbledon yesterday before the defence of his title with new coach Amelie Mauresmo . Andy Murray stopped traffic as he came to the rescue of a dog running towards oncoming cars. On his way to practice at the All England Club, the Scot made an unscheduled stop to save the labradoodle and then returned it to its owner. Murray told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I was driving to practice and there was a dog running along the road. 'I parked the car and got out and tried to stop the traffic because the dog was running towards the oncoming traffic. I ran into the road, stopped the traffic and I managed to get the dog onto the back seat of my car. 'Then I drove to the place where all of the people walk their dogs, which is literally just round the corner. 'I called the number on the tag and amazingly my two dogs walk with that dog quite a lot. I met the owner and she was happy I'd picked it up. 'The dog was pretty strong, I don't think it really wanted me to grab it by the collar and put it in the car but thankfully the dog was fine and it's all good.'","Andy Murray has earned £32million over the course of his career .

"The wonderful weather means open windows, eating outdoors and - unfortunately - lots of flies, wasps and mosquitoes. So what can you do to beat the little biters? We tried six different solutions... Scroll down for video . Cruel: This high-tech swatter doesn't always kill flies but can injure them . The Executioner Bug Zapper Racket, £10.99 amazon.co.uk . A battery-operated racket that emits a static charge to 'zap' flies, mosquitoes and wasps. Simply press the button on the handle and take a swing at the annoying flying insect of your choice to kill it. Not suitable for children under eight. Pros: This racket is sturdier and gives off a more powerful charge than some I've seen. And of course, as soon as you get it out, everyone wants to have a go. CONS:  It's cruel. Although the racket zaps all manner of bugs with a satisfying sizzle, it doesn't always kill them, so you end up having to put flies out of their misery with your flip-flop. Some get stuck in the wires. Not nice. VERDICT: 1/5 . Cute but ineffective: Lovebug Electronic Mosquito Deterrent . Lovebug Electronic Mosquito Deterrent, £9.95, johnlewis.com . Designed to protect babies from mosquitoes, this cute, battery-operated, clip-on device emits a low-level tone that imitates the sound of a dragonfly's wing beat - mosquitoes' natural predators. PROS: There are no insecticides or chemicals involved. Neat and well-made. It looks good, too. CONS: We took this to a lakeside restaurant, where my 12-year-old son had been bitten badly by mosquitoes a couple of weeks ago. I clipped the Lovebug to the top of his sock...  and he was bitten again almost immediately. VERDICT: 0/5 . The waspinator: Not pretty but could keep wasps away . Waspinator, £9.50 for a set of two, qvc.com . This sinister-looking grey bag is designed to deter wasps by mimicking a real nest. The theory is that when foraging wasps see the Waspinator they will mistake it for another colony's nest and stay well clear. PROS: A cheap and natural way to deter wasps. They did seem to keep their distance with the Waspinator hanging from a garden parasol. CONS: If there is an established nest in your garden this is unlikely to work, as the resident wasps will assess the threat of the 'new' nest and realise it is not real. It's not pretty but who cares if it keeps the wasps away? VERDICT: 3/5 . Useless: Plastic bag filled with coins and water . Plastic bag filled with water and copper coins, 10p . If the thousands of online testimonies and the butchers in some of London’s poshest farmers' markets are to be believed, you can deter flies by hanging up clear, plastic bags filled with water and a few copper coins. No one seems to know how they repel flies, but most seem to agree that the refraction of light from the water and shiny coins in the bags upsets their vision and sends them packing. PROS: Cheap and cheerful, this is a fly deterrent that anyone can make. CONS: It didn't work - at all. I hung two bags of water and copper coins next to the open French doors that lead from our garden into our kitchen. I was inundated with just as many annoying flies as usual, leaving me feeling distinctly  short-changed. VERDICT: 0/5 . Small but powerful: The Prevent Scentrel candle . Prevent Scentrel, £5.99, from Robert Dyas stores . This is a small tin containing seven tiny candles and a ceramic ring infused with pyrethrin - an insect repellent extracted from chrysanthemums. The candle is placed in the centre of the ceramic ring, and when lit its heat releases the pyrethrin into the air to repel mosquitoes, flies, midges and wasps. The manufacturer claims one candle will clear an 8m x 10m space of flying insects for up to 24 hours. This will also keep bugs away if you burn it at a picnic or barbecue. PROS: Small but powerful, this almost odourless set-up is just the thing for camping, eating alfresco or keeping a hotel room mosquito-free. When I burned one during an evening meal outdoors, bugs did not bother us. CONS: As with any candle you have to be very careful where you burn it - and make sure you extinguish it afterwards. Inhaling any sort of insecticide is never going to be a good idea, so make sure it's not too close to you while it's alight and you are in an area where there is plenty of fresh air flowing through. VERDICT: 4/5 . Useful but unattractive: Adjustable Insect Repellent Block . Adjustable Insect Repellent Block, £3.79, lakeland.co.uk . This tea tree and citronella fragranced block contains permethrin, a powerful insecticide - so it's not just a repellent, as Lakeland describe it, but also promises to kill bugs, too. The block is saturated with the fragrance and the insecticide, so when opened it should keep a small room free of flies, wasps and mosquitoes for up to 60 days. PROS: The compact shape and pleasant fragrance of this product make it an ideal table companion for eating outdoors. The smell of citronella has been scientifically proven to repel mosquitoes and flies - and it did seem to drive a random fly out of my office quite quickly after I placed it on my desk. CONS: The block is pictured in a tasteful, pale green on the Lakeland website, but when it arrived it turned out to be a horrible, cheap-looking bright yellow. Insects have to come into contact with permethrin for it to kill them, so I can't see how this product - with its insect-repelling fragrance - could actually annihilate many bugs. Confusing all round.              VERDICT: 2/5 .","The Executioner Bug Zapper Racket is a battery-operated fly swatter .

"Some 40 per cent of those looking after loved ones with dementia are clinically depressed or suffer from anxiety, it has emerged. In Britain, this equates to more than a quarter of a million husbands, wives, sons and daughters. Many of those will be elderly themselves and so already struggling with other health problems. Experts say that the ‘profound effect’ that Alzheimer’s and other forms of the memory-robbing disease has on . family members who acts as carers is too often forgotten. It's not just those with Alzheimer's who suffer but many of their carers do too including  becoming depressed . Improving support should not only boost their mental health but also cut the odds of their relative being taken into a nursing home or hospital because they are unable to cope. Rebecca Wood, the chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, said: ‘Dementia doesn’t only affect those who are diagnosed with the condition: its effects are felt far and wide, not least for individuals and families who are caring for their loved ones.’ The hidden toll of dementia was revealed by researchers from University College London who crunched together the results of studies from around the world. This showed some 40 per cent of those who look after a family member with dementia to be clinically depressed or suffer from anxiety at any one time. With two-thirds of people with dementia living at home and 670,000 carers in Britain, this equates to almost 270,000 men and women. Many others are likely to have symptoms, although they won’t be severe enough for a clinical diagnosis. Millions more are touched by dementia, without taking on care responsibilities. In the UK, some 23 million people – roughly a third of the population – have a close friend or relative with dementia. UCL researcher Professor Gill Livingston said the care of a relative with dementia can . be particularly taxing because of the length of the illness and its . nature. Patients . often don’t realise they are ill and so resist help. Paranoia can lead . to the lashing out and agitation can prevent them and their family from . sleeping. Physical . help with nursing and chores is available but, surprisingly, doesn’t . seem to cut the carer’s odds of mental health problems. And . while carers are supposed to be able to see a clinical psychologist, . there are not enough to go round – and until now there has not been a . proper treatment programme. However, an inexpensive and easy-to-teach course devised at UCL could hold the solution. Professor Livingston and colleagues put 173 . carers through the eight-hour course and compared their progress to . another 90 or so who went about their lives as usual. Scientists have linked a new protein to Alzheimer's disease, different from the amyloid and tau that make up the sticky brain plaques and tangles long known to be its hallmarks . The course included advice on how to cope with their relative’s behaviour, how to talk to them and to doctors and how to make time for themselves. This could be as simple as working out how to schedule in a peaceful cup of coffee each day. Carers were encouraged to work out which parts of the START, or STrAtegies for RelaTives, programme worked for them and encouraged to continue practising them. After two years, those who did the short course were seven times less likely to be depressed than the others, the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Copenhagen heard. Quality of life increased and the programme was cost-effective. This is because the money spent on it was cancelled out by lower care home and hospital costs for loved ones. Dr Livingston now has money from the Alzheimer’s Society to train more programme leaders and hopes they will be put to work across Britain. Using recent graduates as programme leaders will get round the shortage of specialist psychologists. Dr Doug Brown, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘If results like these were found with a new drug, it would be hailed a breakthrough. ‘This programme gives us an effective way to support carers and reduce depression and anxiety, which will have the added benefit of improving life for those that they care for. ‘It is great to see research focusing on improving the well-being of dementia carers whilst other scientists search for treatments and a cure. ‘Too often people forget the profound effect dementia has on loved ones caring for someone with dementia and surrounding friends and family.’","Two-thirds of people with dementia live at home, equating to 670,000 carers in Britain .

"A whiter smile is seen as healthy, but with professional tooth-whitening treatments costing a minimum of £200, many people turn to over-the-counter products. But some DIY treatments have been shown to damage tooth enamel, burn gums and cause painful sensitivity. Here, dentist Richard Guyver, who runs practices in Emsworth, Hampshire, and Chichester, West Sussex, assesses the latest offerings; we then rated them for whitening performance and their effect on oral health. What's the best DIY teeth-whitening treatment? We put a selection to the test . Blanx White Shock toothpaste with LED . £7.49/50ml . Claims: Contains Actilux, a patented, self-cleaning ingredient that reacts with light to break down dirt and bacteria and help whiten teeth naturally. An LED light in the neck of the toothpaste tube activates the formula as it passes through it. The LED light can boost the formula if held in front of your mouth for one minute every day. Actilux reacts to daylight, too. EXPERT OPINION: Actilux is claimed to be a light-activated tooth whitener, but I cannot find any sound scientific evidence to confirm it works. This paste contains isopropyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol - alcohol has traditionally been used in oral hygiene products to give a fresh sensation, but most manufacturers are removing it because of possible links with  oral cancer. But this paste also contains fluoride and xylitol, both proven to reduce decay. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and xylitol helps prevent bacteria sticking to teeth. 3/10 . Rapid White Express Max  Effect 5 minute dissolving tooth-whitening strips . £22.99 for one week's supply (14 treatments) Claims: Whiter teeth in seven days. These ultra-thin, flexible strips start to whiten teeth and remove stains the minute they are applied to your teeth. The strip dissolves in five minutes. EXPERT OPINION: This treatment releases chlorine dioxide, a proven dental bleaching agent, which, although it will whiten teeth, is extremely acidic. In high concentrations, chlorine dioxide can strip enamel from teeth, leave them permanently discoloured and sensitive to temperature. These strips' ingredients could give you a sore mouth . It's not clear how much chlorine dioxide is released in these, but if it's very small, I question how efficient their whitening effect can be. These strips also contain citric acid, which softens enamel, leaving teeth more vulnerable to damage and decay. I'm not sure how you can use these without your lip touching them, so there's a risk the ingredients could give you a sore mouth. 1/10 . Pearl Drops Beauty Sleep . £3.49/20ml . Claims: Active oxygen boosts whiteness of your teeth. Patented Liquid Calcium technology restores and strengthens enamel. Vitamin E helps nourish and preserve healthy gums. After brushing your teeth in the evening, massage serum onto teeth and gums. EXPERT OPINION: The oxygen infused in this 'serum' is proven to remove pigmentation from teeth and is the active ingredient in most professional teeth-whitening treatments. It seeps through enamel and dentine (the hard surface of the tooth), clearing discoloration as it goes. This product has the potential to whiten teeth rather than simply remove superficial stains like most toothpastes, because of the time it stays on the teeth. Unfortunately, the active ingredient is likely to be diluted by saliva fairly quickly. This paste also has calcium and phosphate - found naturally in saliva, and which protects tooth enamel from erosion - in the Liquid Calcium, a patented ingredient, but I can't find sound evidence to prove this helps strengthen teeth. However, vitamin E is often used to help heal gums damaged by misused professional tooth-whitening products - which sometimes happens at beauty salons and whitening booths in shopping malls . The sodium fluoride in this  helps harden teeth and protect against decay. 8/10 . Dr Oliver Whitening Wands . £45/4ml . Claims: Helps gently whiten teeth using hydrogen peroxide. Allow gel to activate for up to 30 minutes and use twice daily. EXPERT OPINION: Hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen into the teeth to remove deep-seated discoloration. This whitening agent is found in professional treatments but as this is an over-the-counter product, the percentage must be 0.1 per cent or lower, compared with up to 6 per cent in a professional product. There's no real evidence hydrogen peroxide levels below 0.1 per cent are effective. Saliva will dilute the gel as it sits on the teeth. This pricey product also contains alcohol, which has a slight drying effect on the teeth, which immediately makes them look whiter, if only for a short time. 1/10 . Beverly Hills Dentist's Choice Gum and Whitening Expert . £3.49/75ml . Claims: Removes stains in one minute and helps prevent the signs and effects of gum disease. Contains a unique gum-protection system, including vitamin E to invigorate and strengthen the gums, fluoride to protect the exposed root area, and permethol to help reduce and stop bleeding gums. This toothpaste also includes panthenol, Q10 and folic acid to help promote healthy gum tissues. Restores your teeth to a natural, white colour without using harsh abrasives or bleach. EXPERT OPINION: I can't find any whitening ingredients in this formula. However, the hydrated silica and sodium bicarbonate are efficient superficial stain removers - they work by gentle abrasion. So if teeth are stained they will appear cleaner but the underlying colour will remain the same.There is some evidence that panthenol reduces the bleeding caused by gum inflammation, and vitamin E can help to heal damaged gums; Q10 also has some anecdotal but unproven support for improving gum health. That said, there's no substitute for good brushing and flossing techniques to keep gum disease at bay. But the fluoride here will harden up teeth against decay. 3/10 . Arm & Hammer Advance White Max Booster . £3.79/50ml . Claims: Give your regular toothpaste a concentrated baking soda whitening boost. Advance White Max Booster (which you add to your usual toothpaste) includes extreme levels of nature's cleaning ingredient, baking soda, and the innovative enamel surface restorer, Liquid Calcium. Together they act as a catalyst to your toothpaste and the naturally occurring minerals in saliva, restoring your enamel surface for whiter teeth. EXPERT OPINION: Bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) will remove stains - but it won't whiten them. Because baking soda is an abrasive, some experts say there's a risk of permanently damaging the white enamel and increasing sensitivity if used too often. It's advisable to avoid using anything that might wear your teeth down unnecessarily. For this reason, I'd err on the side of caution and use this once a week, rather than daily. The Liquid Calcium may be to  counteract potential damage from over-brushing, which can erode the surface of the teeth - but I've not seen any evidence to prove it does restore enamel. This also contains protective fluoride. 4/10 .

"Just ten helpings of tomatoes a week could help men reduce the risk of prostate cancer by almost a fifth, according to a study. Researchers think that protection against the illness comes from a key chemical inside the fruit known as lycopene. Tomato-based pasta sauce, tomato juice and even baked beans and the tomato puree topping on pizza were all found to have a beneficial effect. Tomatoes are rich in the compound lycopene, which has previously been linked to good prostate health . And men who doubled their intake of fruit and vegetables to the recommended five portions a day reduced their risk by nearly a quarter, say scientists. In the first study of its kind, researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge and Oxford examined the diets and lifestyles of nearly 14,000 men aged 50 to 69. They found that those who ate at least ten portions of tomatoes a week were 18 per cent less likely to develop prostate cancer compared to those who had none, or very few. One portion counted as 150g of tomatoes, half a tin of baked beans, a portion of pizza with tomato puree, tomato-based pasta sauce or a glass of tomato juice. However, the researchers urged men not to overindulge in baked beans, pizza and pasta sauce as they can contain high levels of salt. Prostate cancer is the most common form of the illness in men, with 41,700 new cases and 10,700 deaths in the UK every year. Experts suspect it may be linked to the Western diet because it is far less common in countries of the developing world. Research leader Vanessa Er, of the University of Bristol, said: ‘Our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer prevention. ‘We also found men who ate more fruits and vegetables had a reduced risk of prostate cancer. The risk reduction figure for men who ate five or more portions of fruit or vegetables, compared to those who ate less than two and a half portions, was 24 per cent.’ She urged men to rely on whole foods rather than supplements and stick to a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as staying healthy and active and maintaining ‘an ideal weight’. Portions of tomatoes can also include tomato juice and baked beans, say the researchers . However, experts said there was not enough evidence for conclusive proof that tomatoes protected against prostate cancer. Dr Iain Frame, of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution. ‘It is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another, and we still don’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer. The study says men should aim for: . * 10 or more portions of tomatoes a week . *  Between 750mg and 1,200mg of calcium a day . * Between 105mcg to 200mcg of selenium daily. ‘What we do know is that men shouldn’t rely too heavily on one type of food, such as tomatoes. ‘A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables together with regular exercise is by far the best option.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK said: 'Studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution. 'It is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another, and we still don’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer. 'What we do know is that men shouldn’t rely too heavily on one type of food, such as tomatoes. A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, together with regular exercise is by far the best option. 'Increasing awareness of the key known risk factors for prostate cancer - age, black ethnicity and family history of the disease - is also crucial if we are to reduce the number of men who lose their lives to the disease every year. 'Any man who is worried about his risk of prostate cancer should discuss his concerns with a GP.” I .","British researchers drew conclusions after analysing diets of 1,800 men .

"Why does the top of a newborn baby’s head smell so good? Can you train your baby to have healthy eating habits while still in the womb? And why do babies insist on mastering 'Dada' before 'Mama'? These were some of the questions that intrigued science journalist Linda Geddes when she became pregnant for the first time. She set out on a quest for definitive answers, which developed into an 18-month investigation into the science of pregnancy, birth and newborn babies. The result was her book Bumpology, a compendium of all things baby and bump-related... Bumpology: All your pregnancy questions answered - and yes, that includes why newborns smell nice! WHY DO NEWBORN BABIES SMELL SO GOOD? There’s something intoxicating about the milky smell of a newborn. Many mothers admit to spending hours inhaling their baby’s odour. And for good reason — several studies have shown that women can pick out the scent of their baby from other newborns just a few days after giving birth. Parents may also be able to detect a similarity between their baby’s smell and that of other close family members. We don’t know precisely where these  olfactory signals come from, but scientists think it may be the baby’s sebaceous glands — the tiny oil producers which tend to be particularly active in newborn babies, especially on the head and face. Body odour is influenced by what we eat, so breast-feeding may also contribute to that delicious new-baby smell. CAN YOUR UNBORN BABY TASTE YOUR SPICY TAKEAWAY? Many women believe eating curry in late pregnancy will bring on labour. The taste buds on a baby’s tongue begin to develop 13 to 15 weeks into pregnancy, enabling him or her to detect simple tastes such as sweet, sour and salty in the womb. Smells and flavours from a mother’s food get into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby during the third trimester, and as a foetus breathes and swallows around a litre of this a day, which then passes over smell and taste receptors in the nose and mouth, unborn babies do get a taste of what their mum is eating. Spicy: Can unborn babies really taste strong flavours like these? According to Geddes, they certainly can . CAN YOU TRAIN YOUR UNBORN BABY TO HAVE HEALTHY EATING HABITS IN LATER LIFE? It seems that the memory of tastes experienced in the womb influences the foods babies like in later life. Studies have shown that if Mum drinks a glass of carrot juice four times a week in the last trimester (or the first two months of breastfeeding) her baby will find cereal prepared with carrot juice appealing once weaned. Babies whose mothers eat a lot of fruit during pregnancy are also more likely to enjoy fruit during weaning. Trying to eat as many different flavours as possible should, therefore, expose your unborn or breastfeeding baby to different tastes and, in theory make them less prone to fussy eating. CAN A BABY DETECT ITS MOTHER'S MOOD IN THE WOMB? How a mother feels during pregnancy can certainly affect her unborn baby’s movements. In a study at Japan’s Nagasaki University, ten women in their last trimester were shown an uplifting clip from the film The Sound Of Music — in which Julie Andrews skips gaily through alpine meadows — while their baby’s movements were monitored by ultrasound. The women also watched a tear‑jerking clip from boxing film The Champ. They wore earphones, so the baby couldn’t hear the soundtrack. When the women watched the 'happy' film, their babies seemed stimulated and waved their arms. But during the sad film their movements decreased. Although the study included only a small number of women, it does at least hint that a baby can detect its mother’s mood. It’s thought this might occur because hormones, such as adrenaline, are released during times of stress or sadness and can redirect blood flow away from the uterus, which the baby picks up on. Feelgood factor: Happy films such as The Sound of Music encourage babies to move around more . Blue for babies: All babies have them to start with but eye colour changes at 10 months . WHY DO NEWBORNS HAVE BLUE EYES? Eye colour is inherited, determined by the amount of a pigment called melanin that we produce. People who don’t produce much melanin have blue or grey eyes, while those who produce lots have brown eyes. At birth, however, very little melanin is produced — regardless of genes. This is why most babies’ eyes appear blue or blue-grey. But as babies’ eyes are exposed to the light, the body’s production of melanin is ramped up. If a baby is genetically programmed to produce lots of melanin, their eye colour will begin to change as the months go by. A baby’s eye colour will usually settle down around the age of six months and is unlikely to change much after this. ARE SUMMER-BORN BABIES DIFFERENT FROM WINTER BABIES? If a baby is born in the UK between September and December, they are statistically twice as likely to become a professional football player as a baby born in the summer months. Unfortunately they are also slightly more likely to suffer from panic attacks and, if male, to become an alcoholic in adulthood. Meanwhile, if you’re ambitious for your child to become a doctor, you might aim for an April-June birthday. The effect of our birth month on our health is small, but significant enough that it can’t be dismissed. For example, babies born in the northern hemisphere in February, March and April are 5-10 per cent more likely to develop schizophrenia (one of the best-studied season-linked disorders). Different factors are likely to be at work here. Some studies have suggested that the increased risk of schizophrenia among babies born in the springtime is the result of their mother being exposed to viruses such as influenza during a critical period of pregnancy. More recently, scientists have proposed that vitamin D deficiency caused by low levels of sunlight during an autumn/winter pregnancy may be to blame, or that varying levels of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine at different times of the year may play a role. Looks matter: Babies fixate on faces that are attractive: Angelina Jolie and David Gandy are sure to be popular . DO BABIES LIKE SOME PEOPLE BETTER THAN OTHERS? Some people love babies, others can’t stand them — and little ones feel the same about us. Given a choice between photographs of two faces — one that had been rated as attractive by a group of adults and one rated unattractive — a newborn baby will choose to fixate on the more appealing face. But babies don’t just judge books by their covers. Newborns get upset if people’s facial expressions suggest they’re not responding to them. Experiments with babies as young as three hours old have shown that if their mother pulls a blank, expressionless face, the baby responds by decreasing their eye contact and showing signs of distress. This suggests that babies are born with certain expectations regarding the rules of communication — much like the rest of us. WHY DO BABIES SAY 'DADA' BEFORE 'MAMA'? Learning to speak requires the coordination of more than 70 different muscles and body parts, so it’s not until around seven or eight months of age that babies start to babble. Barbara L. Davis, of the University of Texas, travels the world trying to capture these first utterances and make sense of them using a tiny microphone attached to a bib. From China to Holland, Ecuador to the UK and beyond, she says children are extremely alike during this babbling period. Sounds such as 'b', 'd', 'm' and 'g' combined with 'ah' seem to be easiest to make, so that’s where babies start. Although many parents assume that 'Mama' and 'Dada' are among babies’ first words because these are the people who are important to them, baby babble doesn’t start taking on meaning until around ten months. Many babies do tend to say 'da' before 'ma', though, because early speech sounds tend to be produced by moving the lips, jaw and soft palate simultaneously. This is how we make 'ba' and 'da' sounds. 'Ma' requires us to move the lips and jaw but relax the soft palate — a more complex operation. Simple sounds: Babies say 'Dada' first because its easier to pronounce than the more complex 'Mama' WHY DO WE SPEAK TO BABIES IN A SILLY VOICE? We’ve all caught ourselves talking in a sing-song voice to babies, but does sounding silly really serve any purpose? The fact is, parents across the world show a common pattern when talking to babies. They raise the pitch of their voice, speak more slowly, elongate the vowels, repeat themselves and exaggerate changes in intonation. And there seems to be a good reason why. Recent research at Brown University in the U.S. showed that elongating vowel sounds when talking to toddlers enhanced their ability to recognise words. The exaggerated way we interact with babies seems to be important, too, for capturing their attention. Bumpology by Linda Geddes is published by Bantam, priced £14.99.

"The number of nurses from the European Union allowed to work in Britain has doubled in just four years, raising fears of patients being put at risk due to language issues. There are now 20,914 registered to practise in hospitals and care homes, compared with 10,244 in 2010. But EU laws mean the nursing watchdog is banned from testing their command of the English language or their medical competence before giving them a licence to work because it is deemed to threaten ‘freedom of movement’. Patients' groups are warning that an influx of nurses from Europe is threatening patient safety because EU rules do not allow hospitals to test their grasp of English before hiring them . Leading doctors have warned that the poor communication skills of some EU nurses is putting patients in danger, and say their skills are not up to the same standard of British-trained colleagues. Separately, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the regulator of standards, last night announced it was relaxing the rules on nurses from outside the EU coming to work in Britain. At present non-EU nurses must prove their English is of a high enough standard before going on a course of up to 12 months at university which includes supervised work on a ward or in a care home. The NMC is replacing the course with a single test – half of which includes an online, multiple-choice quiz – to enable hospitals to recruit more quickly. The watchdog insisted the test would be rigorous, but patient groups warned that it was a major step backwards that would put patients at risk. Over the past year many hospitals have been desperately recruiting nurses from abroad to fill understaffed wards. This was partly fuelled by a report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, in which hundreds of patients died due to poor care, that warned many hospitals had too few nurses. Latest figures from the NMC show that in 2013-14, some 5,388 nurses from the EU joined its register, up from 3,436 the previous year – and the 2,715 who joined in 2011. As it is unable to carry out its own tests on EU nurses, the NMC has urged hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries to carry out checks on individuals before employing them. But most do not. A survey in June of more than 100 senior NHS managers found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the Continent. The poll also revealed that 54 per cent of Health Service bosses planned to recruit nurses from overseas, mainly Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy. NHS Trusts have been desperately recruiting nurses from overseas in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, when hospitals were criticised for not having enough nurses . Roger Goss, from Patient Concern, said the increase in EU nurses was ‘really alarming’. He added: ‘It seems we just aren’t training enough of our own nurses. We ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas. ‘Again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers, and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare.’ On the relaxing of rules for nurses from non-EU nations, he said: ‘This is ludicrous. They are just doing whatever is expedient to fill posts. ‘However good a nurse is, if they have trained abroad they may well not be familiar with the systems here and the drugs we use. This is a major step backwards for patient safety. It’s as if the Mid Staffs scandal passed the NMC by.’ Janet Davies, an executive director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Too often, nurses are recruited from overseas to fill short-term gaps and given inadequate support to care for patients well.’ One senior NHS official, who works in the North of England, said there were concerns that the lack of checks would ‘put patients at risk’. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told the Mirror newspaper: ‘Without a period of supervision, there is absolutely no way you can tell whether they are actually capable of delivering safe care.’ Jackie Smith, chief executive of the NMC, insisted the new test for non-EU nurses was ‘internationally recognised’ and ‘rigorous’. It would ensure that they were ‘able to practise safely and effectively in the UK’, she added.","There are 20,914 nurses from EU working in hospitals and care homes here .
Rules state testing English skills would contravene 'free movement' laws .

The 19-year-old, who attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, is an amateur wrestling champion who holds a Massachusetts driving licence. The older brother Tamerlan attended Bunkerhill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing. A friend of the brothers told CNN that he had known them since 2006 and they were 'normal kids' who partied and occasionally smoked. The father of the suspects said that his son Dzhokhar is a smart and accomplished young man. Anzor Tsarnaev spoke by telephone from the Russian city of Makhachkala on Friday. Anzor Tsarnaev said: 'My son is a true angel. Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. 'He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.' Tamerlan Tsarnaev is captured moving . through the marathon crowd toward the finish line and scene of the first . blast, without his brother suspect two who had disappeared from police . view. A image later emerged of Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev calmly walking away from the scene of carnage as runners and . spectators fleeing in panic. The picture taken by Florida . businessman David Green came just hours after the FBI lodged an . appeal to identify two suspects behind the attacks that killed three and . injured over 180. According to FBI sources who have . spoken to CNN, still unreleased footage reveals that Tamerlan Tsarnaev . also stayed to watch the devastation. Hours after the images were made . public, the pair killed an MIT police officer and hurled explosives at . police in a car chase and gun battle overnight that left Tamerlan . Tsarnaev dead and Dzhokhar on the run. Tamerlan reportedly had a bomb . strapped to his chest when he was killed while he and his brother robbed . a 7-Eleven, minutes earlier. Authorities in Boston suspended all . mass transit and warned close to 1 million people in the entire city and . some of its suburbs to stay indoors as they pursued Dzhokhar, who is . believed to have explosives strapped to his body. Businesses were asked not to open. People waiting at bus and subway stops were told to go home. From . Watertown to Cambridge, police SWAT teams, sharpshooters and FBI agents . with armored vehicles surrounded various buildings as police . helicopters buzzed overhead. 'We . believe this man to be a terrorist,' said Boston Police Commissioner Ed . Davis. 'We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people.'

On his tail: Police search a neighborhood in Watertown, Massachusetts, on the hunt for fugitive Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev posted online he will 'kill everyone because we killed his brother', according to a dispatcher in Watertown. Two people have been taken into custody at the home in Cambridge where the brothers grew up but are not considered suspects. The home is surrounded by FBI and a bomb squad van is on the scene.","Martin perched on spectator fencing waiting to give his runner father a hug .

"Celebrity chef James Martin turned on the Health Secretary today and told him his new plan to improve hospital meals 'is going to do nothing'. The Saturday Kitchen presenter, a hospital food standards campaigner, also said he has tried persistently to set up meetings with Jeremy Hunt but the minister is always 'too busy'. It came as disgruntled patients sent pictures to MailOnline of hospital meals they considered 'pitiful' and 'disgusting'. Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review into hospital food, asking NHS trusts to meet specific standards and threatening fines for the worst offenders, but chef James Martin said today 'it will do nothing' Hospital canteens have been blasted for serving unhealthy options such as pie and chips and the Health Secretary says trusts will be forced to overhaul their menus . Today the Health Secretary announced new rules to ensure hospitals improve their food or face fines, and made it compulsory for trusts to serve meals that meet basic standards and ensure staff help patients to eat them. He ordered trusts to overhaul canteen food so healthier options are available rather than burgers, chips and pies and stop salt being added to vegetables. But James Martin accused Mr Hunt of not thinking through his proposals. He wrote on Twitter: 'For 5 years I've worked in hospitals all over the country and this idea is going to do nothing. 'Providing tap water is brilliant one... though that must've taken a lot of thought'. Urging Mr Hunt to meet with him he said: 'I'm here if you want me to help and will be available anytime, 7 days a wk as you're office says you're ""too busy"" all the time. 'I'm here from now until the election'. Jeremy Hunt has not responded. Jeremy Hunt has vowed to raise food standards in NHS hospitals and visited the Royal Marsden in Chelsea today to see how their meals are made . Diane Jeffrey (right, with Hunt) said: ‘Getting hospital food and drink right is critical... No hospital can afford to neglect this’ Pictures have emerged  of substandard food in hospitals, including this cheese and tomato sandwich . Yesterday the Mail published shocking photographs of hospital food sent in by patients including congealed rice pudding and soggy broccoli. Others were served chicken pie with raw pastry, mince burned on to the plate and, in one case, a half bowl of tomato soup and salad. Dieticians said the meals were either so unappetising or meagre that they hindered patients’ recovery because they would not get enough nutrients. But starting from December, a basic set of standards governing hospital food will be written in to each trust’s NHS contract. These include checking patients for malnutrition when they are admitted and ensuring they are given enough help at mealtimes by nursing staff. Trusts will also have to provide fresh fruit and offer healthy options at canteens that are low in sugar, salt and fat. From today patients will be able to see how the food was rated on the NHS choices website . Standards will be monitored by the Care Quality Commission as part of routine hospital inspections. If a trust breaches these standards they could be fined by the local GP-led Clinical Commissioning Group. From today patients will also be able to see how their local hospital has been rated for food on the NHS Choices website. Each trust has been given a score out of 100 for quality and choice and the website also states whether they provide fresh fruit and food between meals. Mr Hunt said: ‘We are making the NHS more transparent, giving patients the power to compare food and incentivising hospitals to raise their game. ‘Many hospitals are already offering excellent food. But we want to know that all patients have nourishing and appetising food to help them get well faster and stay healthy, which is why we’re introducing tough new mandatory standards for the first time ever.’ But Alex Jackson, of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, said the new measures were ‘woefully inadequate’. He pointed out the standards which hospitals were required to meet were very basic, including that they provide tap water. He said: ‘We’re left feeling that he has pulled the wool over our eyes. We want to see hospital food standards set down in legislation, similarly to school food standards. ‘But the Government still refuses to do this and has only committed to including the standards in NHS commissioning contracts, which are long documents full of clauses that without proper enforcement and monitoring can be ignored.’ Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK, which led the review of hospital food, said: ‘Getting hospital food and drink right is critical and should also be considered an important part of someone’s medical care. No hospital can afford to neglect this.’ The NHS in England receives 480 written complaints a day, with hospital doctors and surgeons among those bearing the brunt of patients’ frustrations. There were almost 175,000 complaints in 2013/14 – 3,300 a week – according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Have you been served poor food in hospital?

"Ring the changes: Bianca Jagger claimed in a police report her lost ring was worth £160,000 but now says it is worth only £15,000 . Bianca Jagger is facing a court battle after refusing to pay an £8,000 reward to a man who found her ring in the street. The former wife of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger lost the diamond and platinum ring when it fell off her finger when she was in Austria for the Salzburg music festival in 2008. Reinhard Fingler, who found the ring, claims Miss Jagger, 67, is making a ‘blatant attempt’ to cheat him out of a proper reward. Under Austrian law he would be entitled to £8,000, 5 per cent of the £160,000 that she claimed in her police report it was worth. But she now says she made a mistake about the value and is offering £800. Mr Fingler has begun a legal action to make her pay £8,000. Miss Jagger has a jeweller’s appraisal to present to a court in Salzburg next Tuesday valuing the ring at £15,000. Fingler picked the platinum, diamond and sapphire sparkler up in the street. His attorney Alexander Schuberth said: ‘This is outrageous. I find this claim both bizarre and spurious. ‘Where Jagger got the value of the ring as £160,000 seems to be a mystery as she’s never appeared in court for us to be able to ask her.’ Jagger’s claim that she did not know the value of the ring has raised eyebrows in the elite world of high-end jewellery as her daughter Jade is a gem designer. Ex: Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger And Bianca Jagger Pictured Together On Their Wedding Day In 1971 . 'It seems beyond belief that she could get the value so wrong. Her daughter makes her living designing and selling jewellery', added the lawyer. The prestigious Viennese lawfirm of Lansky, Ganzger & partners represents Miss Jagger and did not comment on the alleged lower value of the ring. Fingler, from Salzburg, initially gave the ring to his daughter thinking it was a trinket, but handed it in eight days later and claimed the reward. Mick Jagger in full swing at a show in London in 1973 and the couple's daughter, jewellery designer Jade (right) It has emerged that back in October 2008, after it was found, Miss Jagger offered to give Mr Fingler €1,000 and transfer €9,000 to Amnesty International, an arrangement he declared to be unacceptable. Judge Friedrich Gruber at the State Court Salzburg will decide next Tuesday whether Austria has the right to hear the case as Ms Jagger has her main residence in London.","Platinum, sapphire and diamond ring was found on Salzburg street in 2008 .

"Gardening, golf and package holidays are behind soaring hospital admissions for skin cancer, researchers warn. Rates have risen by around 40 per cent in just four years and almost 124,000 now need hospital treatment annually. Experts are particularly concerned about the high number of older men diagnosed too late with malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of the disease. These tumours commonly develop on their backs, appearing as moles, but many men may not notice until too late. Scroll down for video . What spending too much time getting a tan can do to your skin (File photo) Men are particularly vulnerable as they may spend more time in the garden, doing DIY outside or washing the car with their shirts off, without sun cream, researchers said. A Public Health England study shows hospital admissions for malignant melanoma increased from 11,157 to 14,475 between 2007 and 2011. Over the same period, admissions for non-malignant melanoma, which is far more common but rarely fatal, soared from 76,528 to 109,333. This is an overall rise in admissions of 41 per cent in four years. Lead researcher Professor Julia Verne said the rise was partly due to people not covering themselves up or using sun cream on package holidays, while playing golf or during time in the garden here. ‘Men are particularly vulnerable as they tend to take off their shirts and won’t bother putting on sun cream,’ she added. ‘We wonder whether the increase in older men [being admitted for melanoma] is a legacy of home exposure as well as the increase of overseas holidays … we also wonder whether they are less likely to wear sun cream … we are concerned about how quickly the rates are increasing in old men. ‘Males are more likely to get melanomas on their back and they are presenting very late. We need men to be examining their backs more. ‘We don’t know if it is because they are more vain or more stoical. We don’t want melanomas to be missed particularly if they can be treated.’ Professor Verne said non-malignant melanoma are not seen as important ‘as they don’t kill people but they do result in an enormous number of procedures for the NHS’. Men are particularly vulnerable as they tend to take off their shirts and won’t bother putting on sun cream (File photos) The study also found the NHS is spending £95.5million treating skin cancer. Sarah Williams, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Changes to where patients are treated may have added to the size of this increase in hospital treatment … but it’s worrying to see rising rates of a disease that could largely be prevented.’ She added that September sun in the UK can still be strong enough to burn, especially for sensitive skin.’ Separate figures from Public Health England show the highest number of malignant melanoma cases occur in men aged 65 to 69 – 778 in 2012. Professor John Hawk, of the World Congress on Cancers of the Skin, said: ‘Older men were brought up in an era where [people] hadn’t been indoctrinated with the knowledge that sun is bad for you. ‘But older men … spend a lot of time outdoors … Most don’t like putting sunscreen on. They can’t be bothered.’","Public Health England study shows hospital admissions for malignant melanoma increased from 11,157 to 14,475 between 2007 and 2011 .

"It's the ultimate case of 'worst house, best Street.' Possibly the saddest-looking Victorian-era home in the most picturesque part of Sydney sold under the hammer for $2.68 million, $83,000 above the reserve. Peeling paint and overgrown weeds did not deter buyers as Saturday's auction saw 10 registered bidders haggle over the waterside property on 3 James Lane, Balmain East, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney. The auction began the bidding at $1.8 million and towards the end saw the price jump in increases of $1000 as two men battled it out in front of a large crowd of at least 150 people. Spit and Polish: A neglected home on the waterfront in Sydney's Balmain East sold under the hammer for $2.68 million, $83,000 above the reserve . After 15 minutes of bidding the successful buyer ended the auction by shooting up his bidding card in a burst of frustration, The Daily Telegraph reported. Agent Lynsey Kemp at Belle Property Balmain said the buyers were local people who want to work with the heritage-listed property. 'It was well beyond everyone's expectations,' she said. 'The beneficiaries who originally owned the site were very obviously happy.' Belle Property said the property was a 'rare unpolished gem' which made for a very competitive auction. The property's two agents Lynsey Kemp and Georgia Glover describe the site as a 'blank canvas' offering 'unbelievable potential' for the 'astute and imaginative buyer'. The two-bedroom house sits on 452sq metres of absolute waterfront with panoramic views to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The dilapidated James Lane shack backs directly onto Thornton Park on Sydney Harbour . Built in 1857, the property has been held by the same family for about 40 years but has been unoccupied for the last six months. Although it has been left to crumble, the house's period features are intact, including high ceilings, stained-glass windows, a sandstone front porch and fireplace and tall wooden windows. Balmain is considered one of the most sought after suburbs in Sydney's Inner West - but a home here won't come cheap. According to RP data, medium house prices in Balmain East have risen 21.8 per cent to $1.98 million in the last year.

"An Australian man has been threatened with an 'unusual way of death' by the Islamic terrorist group who kidnapped him just over a year ago. Warren Rodwell, a 54-year-old retired soldier, was seized from his home in the Philippines in December 2011 by gunmen from the al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group Al Harakatul Al-Islamiyyah. In a harrowing video message, Mr Rodwell admits he holds 'no hope at all' of ever being released and says he has lost trust in the Australian government. Harrowing: Australian Kidnap victim Warren Rodwell is pictured surrounded by his captors at a jungle camp in the southern Philippines . A picture posted on facebook shows Mr Rodwell in a jungle camp in the southern Philippines surrounded by masked Islamic gunmen. In an internet message aimed at the Australian government, the kidnappers say Mr Rodwell, will soon be executed unless the unspecified ransom is paid immediately. Mr Rodwell was seized from his home in Mindanao in the south of the Philippines . The message reads: ‘If you have concerned (sic) with . your men, we will give you a chance to save his life before it’s too . late, as soon as possible time, otherwise he will suffer unusual way of . Death.’ Islamic terrorist groups in the southern Philippines – there are three major organisations – have either shot or beheaded captives in the past and the reference to an ‘unusual way of death’ is believed to suggested a beheading. Four other foreigners are being held for ransom in the Philippines, although the last hostage to be executed – a Peruvian American – was killed in 2001. Other hostages have died in exchanges of gunfire between terrorists and government troops. Mr Rodwell appears to have lost a considerable . amount of weight since the day he was captured from the home he shared . with his Filipina wife. In a video clip released last month a downcast Mr Rodwell said the group holding him had posted it ‘to say that I’m alive. 'I am waiting to be released…I personally hold no hope at all for being released.’ The group holding him say in their latest internet message that they operate ‘in the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate.’ Mr Rodwell holds up a copy of a Philippines newspaper as he talks to the camera . They add: ‘All praise is for Allah, . the Lord of the Universe. May Allah bestow peace and blessings upon our . Leader Muhammad, Leader of those who strive in Allah’s way and Imam of . the pious.’ Resigned: The 54-year-old former soldier said he holds 'no hope at all' of ever being released . The group also . has a message to ‘our brothers in Islam It adds: ‘We would like to make . it clear that our activities like this are not for personal interests or . just to gain money for personal use. ‘Let . it be known to everyone we are on war against the forces of shaytan . (the Devil) in the Philippines, its allies and supporters, and whatever . we gain from this war is to be used for our future operations and other . necessities.’ Australia’s Foreign Minister told the . Australian Broadcasting Corporation today that the government was . continuing to work on getting Mr Rodwell released, along with help from . the Philippines government. The Labour government has a policy of not paying ransoms but it says that families of kidnap victims are made aware of the option of engaging a private kidnap and ransom consultant. ‘If a family chooses to engage a kidnap and ransom specialist, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide the family and their representatives with as much information as possible, bearing in mind national security and privacy concerns’ says the government.","Former soldier, 54, seized from his home in the Philippines 13 months ago .

The crime unfolded in broad daylight in Ultimo, an inner city suburb of Sydney, about 5.30pm. Witnesses told how they watched the shirtless man being chased. When they caught up with police and suspect, he was lying face down in the street. Scroll down for video . Witnesses say a policewoman threw the shirtless man to the ground. A young photographer who happened on the scene was told by police to back off . Photographer Michael Thrower, 19, happened to be taking pictures in the area 'for fun' when he saw police cars speed down an alley. 'I thought there was no reason they'd be going down into the alley unless the person they were chasing was there so I followed them,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'As I came around the corner I saw a policewoman throw her arm around the shirtless man and throw him to the ground. 'When i got closer, they were handcuffing him and the man was yelling at me to ""take photos, take photos,"" so I did,' he said.

Witnesses  overheard police say the man was arrested over a suspected carjacking in the area . Mr Thrower said the police told him to back off an put the camera away . Another photographer said as many as 15 police cars were involved in the chase, which started in George Street and the subsequent arrest. A female witness who was waiting to pick up children from outside a childcare centre said it was 'pretty scary.' 'I saw a guy running across the road, shirtless and I knew that he was on the run,' she told the second photographer. 'Police just converged from every angle...on car and by foot.

"Looking for a piece of history with prime water views across Sydney Harbour? One of Birchgrove's largest heritage estates is up for the taking ... for the right price. Built in the 1860s, 'Ravenscourt' on Wharf Rd, is is one of Sydney's original waterfront homes. With its ornate gardens, 18m water frontage and spectacular views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the property  is expected to fetch about $11.5 million. 'Ravenscourt', built in the 1860s in Italianate style, is one of Birchgrove's largest waterfront properties . Enjoying 1,100 sq metres of absolute harbourfront, the three-storey home also boasts grand dining rooms, a Butler's pantry, stained glass windows, marble fireplaces, its own tidal pool and verandahs with the best views in town. 'Ravenscourt' has only had three owners in its history and,  like many homes in the area, has been kept within the one family. Property Agent Mathew Hayson says it's rare for this kind of estate to come on the market. 'You can probably count on one hand the number of properties that have come up in the last two decades', he told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are only about 200 waterfront homes and most of them have been owned for a very long time.' He says the Stannard family for example, who ran the first boat-building company  in the area in 1900s, owned all the dockyards for 'a good 100 years.' Hayson expects 'Ravenscourt' to sell in the same price range as two similar waterfront Wharf Rd properties: Number 43 Wharf Rd went for $11.5m in 2008 and number 19 for $11.1m in 2009. 'Ravenscourt' commands breathtaking views of Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge . View of Sydney Harbour from the 'Ravenscourt' gardens. Originally built for a Sydney barrister, Lucius O'Brien, the Ravenscourt estate was remodeled into the Italianate style in 1888 by Eduard Buchanon, then major of Balmain. The heritage-listed property now sits in one of the best-preserved neighbourhoods of nineteenth and early twentieth century architecture in Sydney. Wharf Rd is lined with grand Victorian and Federation homes, but for a long time, the area was a rural, working class neighbourhood. In 1912, a boat building company was established at Number 19 which soon became a large maritime engineering works, operating ferries and servicing naval craft during the second World War.

"An old housing commission terrace in Sydney's Millers Point has set a new record in the historic inner city suburb, selling for $3.95 million at a secret night-time auction. The Victorian-era five-bedroom house 'Ballara' is the fourth of 293 state-owned houses to go under the hammer in a government plan to sell off public housing and relocate 600 housing tenants. The sale price was much larger than expected. Buyers were given an estimate of $2.7 million in marketing material handed out before the auction, Property Observer reports. 11 Fort Street in Millers Point sold for $3.95 million last night, setting a new record for terraces in the suburb . Built in 1879, 'Ballara' is one of several recent heritage listings along Lower Fort Street, which runs from the Sydney harbour foreshore at Dawes Point up to Observatory Hill in the city's historic the Rocks district. With prime views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and easy access to the tourist hot-spot the Rocks, the terraces are hotly sought after by developers. The first heritage-listed home at 119 Kent Street recently went under the hammer for $1.9million. The second at 23 Lower Fort Street sold for $2.685million. The sales have delivered a windfall to the New South Wales government of more than $11million so far, with two more properties - 86 Windmill Street and 30 Argyle Place - due to be sold in the coming weeks, according to the NSW Office of Finance and Services. The old Millers Point social housing terraces command some of Sydney's best harbour views . But the State government's mass relocation of public housing residents has triggered claims of economic cleaning in the inner city area, and Thursday night's auction saw around 40 Millers Point residents turn up to voice their complaints. Barney Gardner from the Rocks Public Housing Tenants Group said the heritage of Sydney's first neighbourhood will be lost with the sales. 'They're not only selling the bricks and mortar of the area, they're selling our history and our heritage,' he told the Daily Mail. 'The thing we're really angry about is the fact that some of these properties have been vacant for so many years, some for as many as seven  years,' he said. 'The property in Kent St has been vacant for the last three years - meanwhile we have all these people sleeping rough on the streets who could have had a roof over their heads. 'I call it 'eviction by dereliction,' he said. 'We've been asking to get work done on these places for so many years and they wouldn't do it, now they're making repairs because they're going to make some money of their own.' No Surrender: A mural at Lower Fort Street protesting the NSW government's moves to sell off social housing and evict 600 residents at Millers Point . The Georgian terrace 'Tarra' sold for $2.68 million, almost double its forecast value . The Minister for Family and Community Services, Gabrielle Upton, says the sale of the Millers Point properties will return hundreds of millions of dollars to the public housing system to help the 58,000 people currently on the housing waiting list. 'This is all about reinvesting money back into the public housing system by selling properties that are very costly to maintain,' Ms Upton said. 'The age and heritage nature of the Millers Point properties mean they often cost four times as much to maintain as the average social housing property.' The government says that for every house sold in Millers Point, it can build three houses elsewhere. The old social housing terraces in Millers Point occupy prime foreshore land and are within walking distance to the historic Rocks precinct . Some of the Millers Point terraces being sold-off have been vacant for at least three years . Mr Gardner said the elevated prices being received for the properties raises suspicions. 'How can you undervalue a place by half to a million dollars? One real estate agent told me that if a place goes for 10 - 20 per cent more than it is valued at, that's buyer excitement - but if it goes for 80 - 90% more than expected? Something's wrong,' he says. A spokesperson for the NSW Office of Finance and Services, who are managing the terrace sales, says the price guide is set by the sales agents. 'They're set by market feedback, obviously there's not a lot of market detail for these kind of properties in the precinct that haven't been sold for 100 years - so the agents are going by what buyers have told them,' he told the Daily Mail. This property at 86 Windmill Street will go to auction later this month . Mr Gardner said he and at least 200 other Millers Point residents who have been issued with eviction notices will 'fight this to the end.' 'We're in a lot of talks with the opposition at the moment. Labour says they'll stop the sale if they get into government, they're formulating a housing policy and have asked for our input,' he said. 'It's hard for some of the more elderly people here, they don't have the energy, but I'll fight this to the end, it's my home.

"An online video game allowing players to become Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and 'stop the boats' has gone viral on social media. 'Stop the Boats' the game lets players try their hand at preventing refugee boats from landing on Australian shores - as a Tony Abbott head bobbing in the water. The mission? To keep as many vessels from the mainland as possible, while avoiding obstacles like politician Clive Palmer's Titanic and former One National leader Pauline Hanson 'at all costs'. The satirical game, set to Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers theme song, takes aim at the Coalition's divisive asylum seeker policy by greeting players with the teaser: . 'Oh no! Australia's refugee intake per capita is 68th in the world! Help Tony stop the boats and win over voter approval!' Gamers can also use their keyboards to 'Teleport Tony', 'Excercise humility with those $12 Billion F-35 jets, Straya'  or to help Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey  buy cigars. 'Stop the Boats' creator, Fraser Hemphill, said he was surprised to see the game received 100,000 hits within its first 36 hours online. 'It's gotten a lot bigger than I would ever have expected,' said Fraser. 'I needed to learn the language that the game's written in and I thought it would be a fun way to learn - but really, it was just a way of procrastinating for me and Facebook blew it up.' He said the game had clocked more than 1 million plays as of last night. Online gamers have called 'Stop the Boats' highly addictive, with one player saying it  'perfectly hits so-bad-it’s-good territory.' Scroll down for video . The 'Stop the Boats' online game has received xx hits on You Tube . If too many refugees make it to Australia, it's game over.  But winners who bat each boat offshore become 'the Suppository of all wisdom', a reference to a gaffe made by Mr Abbott at a Liberal Party meeting last year when he told the room: . 'No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom.' The Abbott  government's 'stop the boats' asylum seeker policy, a key pre-election pledge, has been  condemned by the Australian Greens, non-governmental organisations and the United Nations as a breach of the Refugee Convention and human rights. Gamers are challenged to avoid obstacles like politician Clive Palmer in his Titanic and to collect revenue to help Treasurer Joe Hockey buy more cigars .

"Red Rooster will repay nearly half its workforce after an audit found it had underpaid staff in 2011 and 2012. The fast food chain will hand over $645,253 to 3,140 current and former employees. The self-audit, which was instigated following complaints to the Fair Work Ombudsman from Red Rooster employees in 2011, found that all staff who's wages were investigated had been paid below award rates. According to the Ombudsman, it is the largest repayment of any company that has entered into a self-audit or Proactive Compliance Deed, a mechanism for companies to resolve pay disputes with the Fair Work Ombudsman without facing a formal investigation. It follows a similar audit last year where Dominoes Pizza made $588,000 in back payments to underpaid pizza delivery drivers. Red Rooster conducted the audit across 106 of its franchise stores, but according to the report, a 'significant proportion' of the underpayments were made at outlets operated by two franchisees in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Australian fast food chain Red Rooster will fork out $645,000 to repay 3,140 current and former employees  - almost half its workforce - after an audit found they had been paid below award rates. To date, 1,206 employees have been repaid. But payments to 1,934 others have been delayed or because 'trading conditions for some outlets have been tough,' the report states. A total of 23 Red Rooster outlets have since gone into liquidation. 'Under the terms of the Deed, the franchisees found to have underpaid workers must ensure they repay employees in full. All money must be repaid by the end of this calendar year,' a Fair Work Ombudsman spokesperson told the Daily Mail. On average, the 3,140 employees audited were underpaid about $205 each. However, individual underpayments were much larger in a number of cases. The largest amount of money recovered for any one individual was $3,035. 'Many of the young people working in Red Rooster franchises would have had little, or no previous work experience, and limited knowledge of their lawful entitlements,' said Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James. Red Rooster will fork out more than $645,000 to repay its employees, after an an audit of wages across 106 of its franchise stores found they were underpaid in 2011 and 2012 . Red Rooster employs more than 7,000 people across 360 company-owned and franchise outlets in every State and Territory (except Tasmania). In a company report, Quick Service Restaurant Holdings Pty Ltd, the Australian owner of Red Rooster, stated: 'on behalf of its Red Rooster franchisees it would like to state, for the record, that it was never their intention to underpay their employees.' A spokesperson for Quick Service Restaurant Holdings, Todd Haywood, said it wasn't until 2011 that it was brought to the company's attention that the pay rate which had been agreed with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association Union was actually below the award wage. 'It wasn't like it was something that hadn't been through the appropriate Industry processes,' he told the Daily Mail. Mr Haywood says the company has implemented processes to ensure that any agreements across its operations comply with the award rates but says it is the responsibility of individual franchisees to make those payments back to staff. 'This is difficult in some cases because a few of those stores are actually no longer operating and because it's such a casual workforce with high staff turnover, a lot of those staff may actually not be at those franchises anymore.' The Fair Work Ombudsman says it encourages any employee or former employee of Red Rooster who believes they may have been underpaid to get in touch with the Fair Work Ombudsman.","Fast food outlet will repay more than $645,000 to employees it had underpaid following audit .

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has announced Australia is ready to 'play its part' in air strikes against Islamic State Jihadists in Iraq when a formal combat request is made. At the NATO summit in Wales on Friday, Ms Bishop and Australian Defence Minister David Johnston met with leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries to discuss how to combat the 'scourge of the Islamic State', also known as ISIL. Ms Bishop called ISIL 'a direct domestic security threat to Australia' and said Australia is prepared to join a US-led coalition of 'like-minded countries' to combat the extremists and stop them expanding beyond the region. 'The countries that have expressed a willingness to tackle ISIL head on have also looked at what more can be done in terms of air strikes and Australia will respond when a formal request is made,' Ms Bishop told reporters. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced at the NATO Summit in Wales that Australia is ready to join a US-led coalition in air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq . Ms Bishop said leaders also discussed the need to work closely with the Iraqi government and to provide humanitarian relief. 'The red line is combat troops on the ground. There is no interest from any country present to commit combat troops but there is much that can be done to combat ISIL in other ways and Australia is prepared to play its part in combating ISIL because it is a direct domestic security threat to Australia,' she said. Australian Defence Force Chief Mark Binskin said the RAAF's fleet of older classic Hornet fighter bombers or its 24 Super Hornets could be deployed to operate in Iraq. But Minister David Johnston stressed Australia was yet to receive an official request for combat assistance, saying on Friday 'we are still at an extremely early stage.' 'This is a very serious matter of committing young Australians to deal with an extremely dangerous organisation,' he told reporters. 'But naturally in the face of this tantamount genocide from this organisation the Australian Defence Force (ADF) starts to be ready.' Ms Bishop declined to detail which specific countries were part of the coalition. Bishop says ISIL are a 'direct domestic security threat to Australia' and Australia will join 'like-minded countries' to tackle the extremists head on . Australian Defence Chief Mark Binskin has said the RAAF's fleet of classic Hornet fighter bombers could be deployed to Iraq if an official combat request is made . Also on the table at the NATO summit are sanctions against Russia, the conflict in Syria and Australia's involvement in support for the Afghan government going forward. Australia is expected to use the  summit to lobby other G20 nations to help block Russia from the forum. This week, Julie Bishop became the centre of a diplomatic twitter storm when Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called her a 'he' in an attack on social media. The Ministry took to Twitter to criticize Bishop's attempt to ban Russia from the G20 summit in Brisbane later this year. 'The Australian FM's idea not to invite Russia to the G20 summit is not surprising but he should not lose sight of its principles,' tweeted Russia's MFA. Australia's ambassador in Russia shot back a the ministry for confusing Ms Bishop's gender and added his own dig at Russia's controversial presence in Ukraine. 'Borders, genders – all a bit confusing right now!'  tweeted Ambassador Paul Myler.","Australia is prepared to join a coalition of 'like-minded countries' to tackle the Islamic State extremists in Iraq .

"Linda Motten has been receiving death threats for years. On a Sunday in 1984, Father's Day, she found herself caught in the crossfire of the bloodiest bikie clash in Australia's history - the infamous 'Milperra massacre.' Linda was sitting in her car outside a pub in Sydney's South-West, when screams and gunfire erupted in the parking lot, shattering her windscreen and showering her with shrapnel. Wounded, she crawled under the car and started taking photos; photos which would become crucial to police investigations and the reason behind the death threats. She was just 22 years old. This Fathers' day, September 7, marks 30 years since the bloodbath that stunned the country and left seven people dead, including a 14-year-old bystander, Leanne Walters. Scroll down for video . The battle was thought to have been sparked by tensions to do with a split between members of the notorious outlaw Comancheros Motorcycle Club, who broke away from the brotherhood to form the first Bandidos chapter in Australia. On that Father's day in 1984, a group of heavily-armed Comancheros turned up to the Viking Tavern for a motorcycle swap meet. They were met by 30 Bandidos with a back-up van of weapons close behind. Reports tell of the two sides lining up at opposite ends of the carpark and Comancheros head William “Jock” Ross waving a machete in the air before the violence erupted. The first of 200 police arrived on the scene after receiving reports that 'a man had gone berserk with a rifle' and shots had been fired. It took them more than 10 minutes to stop the bloodshed. Seven were killed, 28 were wounded and 20 hospitalised. This Fathers' day marks 30 years since the Milperra Massacre, the bloodiest bikie gang clash in Australia's history. At the time, the 'Milperra Massacre' court case was one of the largest in Australian history, with a total of 43 people charged with murder. The New South Wales Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973 was subsequently amended as a result of the violence that day. One of those killed was 14-year-old Leanne Walters, hit in the face by a stray .357 bullet while selling raffle tickets. In a special edition of Australian current affairs program 60 Minutes this Sunday night, her father Rex will talk about his 30 year heartbreak and the Father’s Day present Leanne never got to give him. The 1984 Father's day massacre between rival bikie gangs in Sydney's South-West left 7 people dead and 28 wounded . Feared bikie boss and former Comancheros leader William 'Jock' Ross, who served five years in jail for manslaughter that day, told 60 Minutes: 'I didn't have a choice, I was marked to die'. Thirty years after the event, the program promises to take viewers inside the massacre 'like never before'. It includes interviews with the detectives who stormed the car park to disarm the bikies - and will tell the story of key witness Linda Motten and the terrifying phone calls threatening she 'would be dead' because of those photos.
