"(CNN)  -- The son of a Florida couple known for adopting special-needs children was in his parents' room when they were slain in a home invasion last month, according to documents released by prosecutors. Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, is one of seven people charged with murder. A nurse who works with special-needs children interviewed the boy, who has autism and speech issues, regarding the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings. The nurse told police that the child said ""two bad men"" were wearing black masks when they knocked on the door. They woke Byrd Billings and said, ""You're going to die."" The child, whose age was not given, said one of the men counted to three ""before he shot mom and dad,"" and his father kept screaming, ""No way, no way."" Byrd Billings grabbed the back of one man's neck and struggled with him before he was shot, the child said. The boy said Melanie Billings ""got shot in her shirt."" Another child told the same nurse he was upstairs in bed and stayed in his room when he heard the knock on the door. The second boy recalled hearing ""seven booms"" and crept into the hallway. He heard Melanie Billings scream, he said, but stayed upstairs until police arrived. It was unclear from the interviews whether the men knocked on the bedroom door or the front door of the home. The Billingses were shot and killed July 9 in their Beulah, Florida, home. Seven males are charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery. An eighth suspect, a woman, faces a charge of being an accessory after the fact. The seven males, including a 16-year-old charged as an adult, pleaded not guilty to the charges last week. The children's accounts were contained in hundreds of pages of documents released this week by the state attorney's office as part of the pretrial discovery process. Also in the documents is a police interview with Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, one of the seven suspects and the man police believe was the organizer of the slayings. Two of the other suspects told authorities he was the lone gunman, according to court documents. Gonzalez told authorities in a July 22 interview that a group of car dealers did not like Byrd Billings and had gotten together to discuss the problem. Used car dealer Henry ""Cab"" Tice came to him, Gonzalez said, and told him the group wanted Billings killed, but he refused to do it. Another son of Billings told police that a man named ""Cab"" had ""double-crossed"" his father and that the son was present when the two men argued. Tice has been questioned but not charged in the slayings. He is charged, however, with one count of grand theft for allegedly writing a series of bad checks to Billings, authorities have said. Various interviews in the documents point to a close relationship between Tice and Gonzalez. Also released by prosecutors was a transcript of a police interview with Tice in which he acknowledged accepting a $20,000 loan from a man he later learned was connected with the Mexican Mafia. Tice said he was told his family could be killed if the money was not repaid. Police had previously said Tice was believed to owe the Mexican Mafia money. Contacted by CNN Tuesday, Tice refused comment. But in an interview Monday with CNN affiliate WEAR, Tice said Gonzalez's comments about him constitute an ""act of a desperate man."" ""There is nobody that I know in Pensacola that would want to see Bud Billings killed,"" Tice told WEAR, using Billings' nickname. ""There are business people in Pensacola that are upset with him, that were upset with him, but nobody that I know would want to see Bud Billings killed."" The Billingses each had two biological children and had adopted 13 children. Police have said nine of the children were home during the slayings and several were believed to have seen the gunmen. One child managed to flee the home and seek help from a neighbor. Autopsy reports also were released. They showed that the Billingses were shot multiple times. Byrd Billings also had a white zip tie on his left arm, according to the report. The eighth suspect in the case, Pamela Wiggins, was taken back into custody Monday after her bond was raised from $10,000 to $500,000. Authorities said they found a safe belonging to the Billingses in Wiggins' backyard. That safe contained prescription medications, family documents and jewelry and was taken from the home during the slayings. Family members have since confirmed that a second safe was in the home and that it contained $164,000, antique jewelry and legal documents. The second safe was not taken. The released documents also said that safe contained a sealed hard drive, a detail not previously revealed. The Billings family agreed to allow authorities access to that hard drive, according to the documents. Prosecutors believe there were dual motives in the killings: robbery and a contracted hit, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN last month. The source said prosecutors were working under the belief that most of the suspects in the case were told only that they were robbing the Billingses, but that Gonzalez and other yet-unnamed suspects also were plotting to kill the couple. The source was not sure of the alleged motive behind the slayings. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said publicly his office believes a contract hit was a possibility. The state attorney's office said last month it was focusing on the robbery, but was willing to consider other motives.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll climbed to 50 on Friday after a pair of suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests at one of Pakistan's holiest shrines, police said. More than 200 people were injured in the blasts outside the Data Darbar, a famous Sufi shrine complex. Lahore Commissioner Khusro Pervez said the remains of the bombers -- a man in his 20s and another in his late teens -- have been recovered. One of the bombs detonated in the shrine's courtyard; the other in the shrine's lower lever, according to Chaudhry Shafiq Ahmed, Lahore's senior police superintendent. The first explosion, which occurred at 10:48 p.m. Thursday, was followed five minutes later by a second blast, Geo TV reported. The CNN affiliate aired surveillance footage showing the first attacker entering through a gate holding a bag. As he passed through a metal detector, alarms went off and the man ran toward an area used for ablutions and blew himself up. Geo TV showed a second attacker entering amid the confusion a few minutes later and running upstairs carrying a bag. Then the video showed the explosion. Geo TV reported that the heads of two bombers were recovered and identified. The bombers arrived at the shrine on foot wearing 10 kilogram (22 pound) jackets that had been packed with ball bearings, it said. A witness told Geo TV that one of the bombers was wearing the traditional loose-fitting salwar kameez, a turban and slippers. ""This sickening poison of extremism will be driven out of our nation and we will not be cowed,"" said Farahnaz Ispahani, a spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari, in a text message to CNN. ""Peaceful worshippers have once again been targeted by those who want to destroy the fabric of this great country. We will not forgive or forget and we will get justice for all Pakistanis murdered in cold blood -- be they Muslim, Christian, Ahmadi or of any other faith."" Pakistan's Punjab province, of which Lahore is the capital, has been the scene of carnage in recent weeks, including a bloody attack on a hospital and another targeting Ahmadis. On Friday, angry Pakistanis, some wielding guns for revenge, took to the streets of Lahore in protest. Growing weary of bloodshed in their homeland, many are troubled by its spread from the Afghan border areas to the heartland. They are also concerned that Muslims are attacking Islamic holy sites. Sunni and Shiites do not consider the Ahmadis as a part of Islam because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. As such, they have been targeted by Islamic extremists. Friday's attack was at a revered Sufi shrine. Sufism is an ancient, mystical form of Islam that is generally more tolerant. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed alarm over the attacks and called on both the government and Muslim clerics to stand up to extremism. ""It is a matter of grave concern that despite repeated official claims of breaking the back of terrorists, they retain the ability to launch vicious terrorist attacks across the country almost at will,"" the commission said in a statement Friday. ""The assault demonstrates the potency of militant groups that the government incessantly repeats operate from sanctuaries in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan,"" the statement said. ""Equally frustrating have been clerics' stock statement that no Muslim can commit such atrocities. Instead of living in denial, the clerics need to reflect on the reasons for religious extremism in Pakistan and the possible consequences and their own contribution to the promotion of intolerance and the cult of violence."" CNN's Nasir Habib, Nic Robertson, Nazneen Akbari, Thomas Evans, Katy Byron and Journalist Fayyaz Addrees contributed to this report.","NEW: Two bombs explode at revered Sufi shrine .

"(CNN) -- RadarOnline on Wednesday released another audio recording of an explosive argument purportedly between actor Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, in which the man can be heard threatening to burn their house down. It's the fourth such recording released since Friday by the website, which has not disclosed how it obtained the audio. The recordings are taken from a phone call and capture an obscenity-laced rant by the man as he spews racial and ethnic slurs, sexual insults and death threats. The site claims the male voice is that of the 54-year-old Gibson. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the recordings. In the recording released Wednesday, the man berates the woman for apparently falling asleep before having sex with him the prior evening. ""I'll burn the g...... house up. ... How dare you?"" the man says as he demands the woman perform a sexual act. In Tuesday's recording, the man uses an ethnic slur for illegal immigrants when arguing with the woman over a Latino worker employed by the couple. On Monday, the website released a recording in which the man threatens the woman's life, saying ""I'll put you in the f......ing rose garden."" And in a recording released Friday, the man launches into a racist, sexist rant against the woman, telling her she looks ""like a f...ing b.... on heat and if you get raped by a pack of n...ers it will be your fault."" It's unclear when the recordings were captured. Grigorieva, 40, has acknowledged that the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's. CNN's efforts to obtain comment from Gibson have been unsuccessful. Mel Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, said Wednesday that the filmmaker continues to have no comment regarding the recordings. The couple have been locked in a custody dispute over their daughter. Last week, the Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation into an alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that he struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. The estranged couple are scheduled to appear in court July 20 for a status hearing on the restraining order. Grigorieva has also spoken with sheriff's deputies and has provided a statement to them in their domestic violence investigation, Jaffe told CNN Friday. The recordings ""will be part of the investigation,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said on Monday. It is not known how RadarOnline obtained the recordings. Jaffe said Friday that the site did not receive them from Grigorieva. Meanwhile, some show business personalities appeared to distance themselves from Gibson. Longtime friend and former ""Maverick"" co-star Jodie Foster and Danny Glover, Gibson's co-star in the popular ""Lethal Weapon"" film series, declined to comment on the allegations, according to the Los Angeles Times. On Friday, the William Morris Endeavor talent agency confirmed to CNN that Gibson is no longer their client. An attorney for Gibson's ex-wife, Robyn, told CNN Tuesday that she also would not be commenting on the recordings. But at least one Hollywood star was defending the embattled actor. ""I don't like what he did here, but I know Mel and I know he's not a racist,"" TV host Whoopi Goldberg said on ABC's ""The View"" Tuesday. ""You can say he's being a bonehead but I can't sit and say that he's a racist, having spent time with him in my house with my kids. I can't say it."" Gibson came under fire in 2006 when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. He issued an apology at the time, and appealed to the Jewish community to help him recover from his alcohol addiction.","The website says the male voice is that of Mel Gibson .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- ""An agonizing experience,"" wrote Roger Ebert. ""Colossal folly, the fiasco of the summer of 2010,"" said Roger Moore in the Orlando Sentinel. Merciless reviews are rolling in for M. Knight Shyamalan's latest work ""The Last Airbender,"" and if critical reaction to the film is any indication, the casting controversy that had some ""Airbender"" fans boycotting the film may be an afterthought. See Techland.com's interview with M. Knight Shyamalan. ""It wasn't what I expected,"" 22-year-old Jake Sims said on his way out from a midnight showing in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm a fan of the series; I've watched it. This just didn't do justice to the characters. It wasn't nearly as good as the series, but OK if you've never heard of 'Avatar' -- this 'Avatar,' I mean."" ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" was an animated television series that ran for three seasons starting in 2005 on the cable network Nickelodeon. The series takes place in a world of magic and mysticism where humans are separated into four racially distinct nations, each identified by their dominance of a natural element. A select few from each nation are known as ""benders,"" or people who have the ability to manipulate their nation's element. A legendary leader in this world is the Avatar, a reincarnated being who is the master of all elements. The show follows Aang, a potential avatar who is found to be the last Airbender on earth after his people, the Air Nomads, are wiped out by the Fire Nation. Aang is on a journey to master all of the elements and bring peace to the world. The show appealed to fans from a broad range of ages and interests, showcasing martial arts, action, mysticism and comedy. The show also dealt with themes like redemption, internal struggle, honor and friendship. Like many beloved entertainment franchises, fans are dedicated to ""Avatar."" Although the animated series has ended, the ""Avatar"" world is thriving. With the close of the TV series, fans began writing ""Avatar"" fan-fiction with alternate storylines and created role-playing discussion boards online. Some fans of the show said they boycotted the movie because the three lead actors are Caucasian. Blogs like ""Angry Asian Man"" and sites like Racebending.net attacked Shyamalan and the film's parent company, Paramount, for white-washing a franchise that was overtly Asian in appearance and sensitivity. ""We tried to be as careful as we could not to directly base anyone's culture on a [real world] culture because we wanted to borrow ideas,"" said head ""Avatar"" series writer Aaron Ehasz. ""The series is clearly Asian inspired with obvious Chinese influences. In the case of the water benders, they are definitely based [on] ... indigenous cultures, a la Inuits, but also indigenous people like those portrayed in the movie ""The Whale Rider."" In fact, to be culturally sensitive in the production of the animated series, Ehasz said the team had a consultant, whose ""job was to read the scripts and essentially make sure they were culturally sensitive."" In an interview with Indiemoviesonline.com Shyamalan hit back at critics, pointing a ""race-bending"" finger at them. ""I'm always surprised at the level of misunderstanding, the sensitivities that exist,"" he said. ""As an Asian-American, it bothers me when people take all of their passion and rightful indignation about the subject and then misplace it."" While Ehasz was responsible for crafting the characters millions watched, he was left out of the creative process of the film. ""I made up the middle of this movie and the ending of this movie, and I have zero credit on this movie,"" he said. Longtime fans like Robbie Park say that lack of involvement was a big mistake. ""That guy should have been with them; the movie team. There were plenty of parts of the movie where there were holes,"" he said. While some fans said they enjoyed the big effects -- like the element bending and martial arts -- some fans missed the characters that kept them watching the show. ""Aang was funny and serious and Katara was weak but strong,"" said 26-year-old Nicole Martin. ""None of that came through like it did on TV."" Dr. Caroline Ruddell, a professor of animation and cinema at St. Mary's University College, said that TV-show fan reaction to the movie will likely be an issue for its box office success. ""When things like anime or animation are exhibited or remade into live action, it's always going to be very difficult. So many of the live action versions of comic books have been panned because their fans are very hard to please,"" she said. Regardless of his involvement in the film, Ehasz said he hopes ""the characters I built come through in this movie, regardless of casting."" ""I hope this is a huge artistic success. I hope that fans who watched the show get something out of it. I hope that this is a way that the show lives on and comes stronger,"" he said.

"(Sunset) -- Check out these 10 scenic spots to swim, float and soak in the sun at the West's amazing national parks. Best for adventure: Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona . Okay, here's the catch. There's just one way to reach most Colorado River beaches in the canyon -- and that's by rafting down the river. Only then do you experience secluded beaches like Football and Owl Eye. Many people, of course, consider the 3- to 18-day trips one of the high points of their lives. As for the beach experience, the water isn't warm -- figure anywhere from 48° to 60° -- but given that Grand Canyon summer temps can rise to above 100°, it feels, says veteran outfitter Steve Hatch, ""just great."" Don't miss: Well, the river rafting. Trips are often booked up far in advance, but in this recessionary year, you should be able to slip into one now through the end of the season in midfall. Get there: All-inclusive river trips from $1,100 for four days; nps.gov/grca for a list of park-approved outfitters. --Peter Fish . Sunset's guide to the Grand Canyon . Best lazy float: Yosemite National Park, California . With El Capitan and Half Dome towering above, the Merced River beaches in Yosemite Valley sometimes get forgotten. Which is a mistake, especially in summer, when valley temps sizzle and the river water is blissfully cool. The two main beaches, Cathedral and Sentinel, are great for splashing or bobbing around in an inner tube. Don't miss: Taking on the Merced by raft. Rent a four- to six-person raft at Curry Village Recreation Center, and float 3 miles to Sentinel Beach; the $26 fee includes shuttle service back to your start. Get there: In summer, take the El Capitan Shuttle to stop E4 and walk 1/4 mile to Cathedral Beach, or get off at E5, 1/2 mile from Sentinel Beach; $20 per vehicle; nps.gov/yose or 209/372-8319 (raft rental). --Peter Fish . Sunset: 36 fun fall escapes . Best beachcombing: Olympic National Park, Washington . The easy 3-mile (one-way) hike to Shi Shi Beach, near Neah Bay, is best made at low tide, when you encounter some of the best tidepools on Earth. Against the backdrop of towering sea stacks, Pacific waves, and the occasional kayaker, peer down at neon pink and chartreuse sea anemones and bright orange seastars. Don't miss: Point of the Arches, a mind-bending array of sea stacks 1.3 miles down the beach. Get there: Neah Bay, about 160 miles northwest of Seattle, is on the Makah Indian Reservation; ask for a map when you buy your Makah Recreation Pass ($10); nps.gov/olym or 360/645-2711 (reservation info). --Matt Villano . Best desert oasis: Glen Canyon National Rec Area, Utah/Arizona . A blue mirage set in red rocks, Lake Powell -- which forms the watery heart of Glen Canyon National Rec Area -- has nearly 2,000 miles of shoreline, which means a lot of Lake Powell beaches to choose from. A few, like Lone Rock Beach, can be reached by car. But some of the best are nameless coves accessed only by boat. Good thing you can rent powerboats at three lake marinas: Antelope, Bullfrog, and Wahweap. (Houseboats are also popular, but you can't navigate into narrow coves as well.) Don't miss: A cruise to the lake's south shore and Rainbow Bridge National Monument, home to the world's largest known natural rock bridge. Get there: $15 per vehicle; nps.gov/glca or lakepowell.com (boat rental). --Peter Fish . Sunset: 10 great dog-friendly getaways . Best for surf and sun: Santa Monica Mountains National Rec Area, California . Malibu-ites know to skip the Zuma tourist zoo and come to El Matador. Officially one of three beaches that make up Robert H. Meyer Memorial State Beach -- likely to provoke a ""Huh?"" even from locals -- it's a gem tucked from sight at the foot of sandstone cliffs (and accessed by a dirt trail and stairway). Out in the waves, bodyboarders and surfers perform aerial acrobatics. On shore, scenically carved sea caves make El Matador a favorite with photographers, often seen snapping away at leggy models. Don't miss: The chance to take a photo of one of Southern California's best sunsets. Get there: 10 miles up the coast from Malibu on Pacific Coast Hwy. between Broad Beach and Decker Canyon Roads; $8 per vehicle; parks.ca.gov or 805/370-2301. --Ken McAlpine . Best for solitude (even on weekends): Point Reyes National Seashore, California . Most visitors to Point Reyes don't know about Limantour Beach. They zip out along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to crashing North Beach or to Drakes Beach, where there's a proper visitor center and cafe. Few think to turn off instead at Limantour Road, which dead-ends in deserted grassy dunes. All the better for you. Climb up and over, and you'll see a narrow finger of sand stretching 2 miles north between Drakes Bay and a mighty estuary teeming with birds. Out at the tip, harbor seals loll and bark. On the rare sunny summer day, the water is calm and swimmable. Don't miss: A walk with your pooch, welcome on-leash at the section south of the parking lot. Get there: From the Bear Valley Visitor Center, head north about 1/4 mile to Bear Valley Rd., turn left and follow it 1 1/4 miles to Limantour Rd., then turn left again and go 7 1/2 miles to the parking lot at Limantour Beach; nps.gov/pore or 415/464-5100. --Lisa Trottier . Sunset: 10 places for your life list . Best for thinking really, really big: Redwood National Park, California . To step from a redwood forest onto the wide-to-the-sky spread of Gold Bluffs Beach is an unforgettable memory. Equally memorable are the Roosevelt elk grazing in the meadows, then making their regal, antlered way through the sand. The world's tallest trees, America's largest elk -- sometimes size does matter. Officially in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, the beach is cooperatively managed by California State Parks and the surrounding Redwood National Park. Don't miss: The oasis of Fern Canyon, back from the beach, where sinuous walls, blanketed by moist green, press in on a cobbled stream. Get there: 50 miles north of Eureka and 40 miles south of Crescent City, take Davison Rd. off U.S. 101; $8 per vehicle; parks.ca.gov or 707/465-7335. --Ken McAlpine . Best ocean-view swimming hole: Haleakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii . Hawaii's national parks feature volcanoes, not beaches. And yet Maui's Haleakala National Park includes a ""beach"" of a sort -- not sand but large, warm basaltic stones; not ocean but the refreshing roar of plunging freshwater cascades. Oheo Gulch (popularly misnamed Seven Sacred Pools) lies beyond Hana town in the verdant Kipahulu district. The lower pools, right off the roadside parking lot, are superb ""swimming holes,"" but they crowd up by midday; get there before 10. Don't miss: The moderate 2-mile trek on the Pipiwai Trail to 400-foot-sheer Waimoku Falls, the most beautiful in Hawaii. Get there: 10 miles southwest of Hana on State 31; $10 per vehicle; nps.gov/hale or 808/248-7375. --Paul Wood . Best for a city stroll: Golden Gate National Rec Area, California . Knockout views. Appealing mix of people. Good coffee. Crissy Field gives you everything you love about San Francisco in one scenic package. A historic Army airfield transformed into a native plant-lined beach oasis, Crissy draws jogging moms with strollers, kitesurfers, picnickers, dog walkers, cyclists, fishermen, and 8-year-olds letting the cool bay water lap their toes. All this and the Golden Gate Bridge looming gracefully, plus lattes, baked goods, and book browsing at the Warming Hut. Don't miss: Let's Be Frank's superior grass-fed beef hot dogs from the cart just outside the Warming Hut on weekends. Get there: From downtown S.F., take Marina Blvd. to Baker St., where it turns into Mason St., then follow it west (along Crissy Field) to parking; nps.gov/goga or 415/561-3040 (Warming Hut). --Peter Fish . Best escape from reality: Channel Islands National Park, California . It takes your catamaran roughly an hour to cross the Santa Barbara Channel from the Southern California mainland to Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz Island. And during that time, the world with all its worries falls away. The pretty cobbled beach is just a launching point: From here, you can snorkel in the diverse kelp forest just off the beach or paddle a kayak farther out, past the island's dark cliffs and sea caves. Don't miss: The short hike from the beach up Smugglers Road to the high bluff and the stand of cypress pines known as Delphine's Grove, where you'll fall under the spell of a sweeping ocean view and the sound of the wind in the boughs. Get there: Island Packers boats leave from Ventura Harbor ($48 round-trip; 805/642-1393); nps.gov/chis or 805/658-5730. --Ken McAlpine .","The water along Yosemite's Merced River beaches is blissfully cool in summer .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- President Mwai Kibaki proclaimed Thursday a ""happy end"" as an overwhelming majority of Kenyans voted to adopt a new constitution that is sure to bring big change to the East African country. ""The historic journey that we began over 20 years ago is now coming to a happy end,"" Kibaki said while addressing the nation. But he tempered national euphoria by reminding Kenyans that implementing a new constitution will be a difficult task. ""The journey ahead of national renewal will not be easy,"" he said. ""There will be challenges along the way. But it is important that we look forward with renewed optimism to better days ahead."" U.S. President Barack Obama called the vote a ""step forward"" for Kenya and its people, in a statement released by the White House Thursday. He said the electoral process was ""credible"" and ""transparent,"" and that the results show Kenyans' desire for a stable and prosperous future. Obama's father grew up in a village in western Kenya. He also applauded the fact that the election came and went without the kind of violence that marred the 2007 presidential vote. Obama called the process a ""testament"" to Kenya's people. The country's new constitution would remove power from the presidency and create a more decentralized political system. The constitution would also bring in a bill of rights, allow dual citizenship for Kenyans -- sure to be popular with Kenya's large and loyal diaspora community -- and allow for land reform. Results by the Interim Independent Electoral Commission showed ""Yes"" won the referendum with 67.2 percent while  ""No"" had 30.3 percent. ""I do declare that the proposed constitution is hereby ratified,"" said Ahmed Isaack Hassan, chairman of the electoral commission. Leading opponents of Kenya's proposed constitution conceded defeat earlier Thursday. Higher Education Minister William Ruto, a leader of the ""No"" team, said despite his camp's loss, every Kenyan "" is a winner"" in the outcome. ""It is necessary to create a win-win for the country,"" Ruto said flanked by senior members of the ""No"" camp. Despite the win by the ""Yes"" team, Ruto said, the government should address the complaints of those who rejected the referendum. ""It is not only necessary, it is mandatory,"" he said. Many Kenyans were already celebrating before they heard the official results. The Daily Standard newspaper couldn't wait for the announcement. ""Yes it is!"" rang the headline in the morning paper. ""Now it's time to reunite the country behind the outcome,"" the newspaper said in an editorial. Kenyans voted against the constitution by a significant majority in the restive Rift Valley, where ""No"" politicians and Christian church leaders focused their campaigning. Churches feared the new constitution would offer abortion on demand and give Muslims special rights. ""The results do not nullify our concerns,"" said a church statement Thursday. Others applauded the peaceful vote. After the last presidential election three years ago, political violence claimed several hundred lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. ""We very much welcome reports which indicate that Kenyans were able to vote in a free, fair and peaceful atmosphere,"" said a statement from the Panel of Eminent African Personalities. ""The high voter turnout nationally reflects the strong desire of Kenya's people to help shape their country's future.""","NEW: ""Yes"" won 67.2% of the vote, while ""No"" took 30.3% .

"(CNN) -- As delivery of aid to Haiti is hampered by damaged ports and an overwhelmed airport, another conduit into the earthquake-ravaged nation -- its border with the Dominican Republic -- has become a challenging crossing itself, a United Nations situation report says. The 200 miles from the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo to the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has been backed up and can take as long as 18 hours to travel by vehicle, according to the report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), released this weekend. A CNN crew reported taking 12 hours to drive from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, though the crew left before dawn, intending to avoid peak traffic. Vehicles crossing from the Dominican Republic into Haiti included large trucks carrying supplies and vans and public buses that seemed to be local, the crew reported. Some aid trucks were followed by sport utility vehicles, likely transporting international aid personnel. Traffic is heading the other way, too, the U.N. reported. ""Hospitals in the border region [in the Dominican Republic] are overwhelmed and have begun to refer patients to hospitals in other cities,"" OCHA reported, citing the Office of the Resident Coordinator in the Dominican Republic. ""There is a shortage of specialized medical supplies, equipment, and physicians at these hospitals, and no clear inventory of what is needed,"" the report continued. ""An effective waste management system is required for the border region in order to avoid disease and contamination of rivers."" As a result, U.N. aid distribution is being shifted to a different road that goes through the Dominican border city of Jimani, instead of the main highway that leads through the Dominican city of Elias Pina. The CNN crew, which passed through Jimani, did not witness many injured Haitians crossing from there into the Dominican Republic. A giant pothole there made crossing the border there a one-car-at-a-time affair. According to a priest in Elias Pina, Haitians there were worried about their families back home. ""There are many Haitians living here in Elias Pina and many don't know anything about their families,"" the Rev. Mike Seis of the Green Bay Diocesan Mission in Elias Pina wrote in a letter recently. ""The casualties are staggering. This weekend all of the Catholic parishes in the Dominican Republic from the 11 dioceses in the country will be sending their Sunday collections to Catholic Charities of Haiti.""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- More favorable weather conditions Saturday helped firefighters in their bid to contain the roaring Crown Fire, one of several in southern California. Firefighters had the fire 82 percent contained Saturday evening, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Authorities said that they had lifted evacuation orders and most residents had returned home, while hundreds of firefighters and more than a dozen aircraft worked to extinguish the Crown Fire. ""If we can get aggressive with the air drops we'll be in good shape. And we're already doing pretty good,"" Don Kunitomi of the Los Angeles County Fire Department told CNN. The blaze has ignited 14,000 acres in the area, fire officials said. Two other fires have blackened more than 17,000 acres. Fire officials said the Crown Fire represents the biggest challenge. On Friday, about 1,370 firefighters and 250 fire engines were at the scene of the blaze, which was burning in a sparsely populated, rural area. Authorities were working to ensure the Crown Fire did not destroy power lines that provide electricity throughout the region. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has asked residents near the fire to limit their power usage, though no fire-related outages have been reported. The weather did not cooperate Friday, which turned out to be one of the hottest days this week, with humidity in the low teens. ""That's creating a little bit of a challenge, and obviously causing a bit more fire spread,"" said Matt Levesque of the L.A. County Fire Department. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the situation in southern California changed drastically as the weather shifted. ""We were very fortunate not to have fires for some time, because the air was cool and we didn't have the experience of dry weather and all of these winds and so on, but all of a sudden the fire season kicked in,"" he said Friday. ""But we are ready,"" the governor added. ""There's great coordination going on, and we have resources distributed all over the state."" The cause of the Crown Fire is under investigation. Two more wildfires engulfed the area this week: the Bull Fire, southeast of the town of Tehachapi, and the West Fire, north of Tehachapi in the Sequoia National Forest. The Bull Fire has ignited 16,460 acres and was 81 percent contained, officials said Saturday morning. It has destroyed eight homes, but no evacuations have been ordered. Meanwhile, the West Fire has destroyed 30 structures, mostly homes. Authorities have warned residents to keep their cars and house windows closed to prevent smoke inhalation. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency for Kern County, located approximately 130 miles north of Los Angeles.","NEW: So-called Crown Fire is 82 percent contained .

"(CNN) -- NATO representatives and lawmakers from alliance nations will meet in Iceland Thursday to discuss security challenges that are likely to arise as the Arctic Circle thaws. Global warming is opening up more parts of the Arctic to development and raising security concerns. The area -- one of the planet's most fragile and pristine ecosystems -- sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels. And as the melting polar ice makes the Arctic more accessible to ships, several countries are scrambling to claim jurisdiction in the area. ""The economic interests are reflected in ... competing claims by relevant stakeholders, and resumed military presence in the area,"" NATO said on its Web site. ""As it is a region of enduring strategic importance for NATO and allied security, developments in the High North require careful and ongoing examination."" The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil, 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the Arctic Circle. At the same time, Arctic water is warming so quickly that the entire region could be ice-free by 2013. Already Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are fighting to lay claim to the Arctic's icy real estate. Unlike Antarctica, which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims, there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the Arctic. So questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes are somewhat murky. According to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores. But some countries are trying to extend that zone. Russian scientists want to prove the seabed below the North Pole is part of the Eurasian continental shelf, an area called the Lomonosov Ridge. If that is the case, the region would be under Russian control. Moscow argued before a U.N. commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory. But the United Nations asked for more evidence. Danish scientists are trying to prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to Greenland, and Canadian scientists are looking for links between the ridge and Ellesmere Island, a Canadian territory. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will attend the two-day conference in Reykjavek.","NATO meeting in Iceland to discuss Arctic security challenges .

"Detroit, Michigan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking at auto plants here Friday, praised the recovery of the embattled U.S. auto industry and celebrated the tough choices he says made a comeback possible. ""Last year, many thought this industry would keep losing jobs, as it had for the better part of the past decade. Today, U.S. automakers have added more than 55,000 jobs since last June,"" said Obama, speaking at a Chrysler plant. He said both Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors Corp. have rebounded from the depths of their government-brokered bankruptcies and are back on track to grow. Later in the day, Obama toured and spoke at a GM plant, where he also made the case for why the federal government's investment in the auto industry was a wise move. At times sounding like a candidate on the campaign trial, he is working to build support for his economic policies with just a few months to go until midterm elections in November. In the 12 months before he took office, Obama said, the U.S. auto industry had lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and had seen its sales drop 40 percent. He cited estimates suggesting more than 1 million people would have lost their jobs if Chrysler and GM, two of the three big U.S. automakers, had been allowed to liquidate. Ford Motor Co. was the only one of the ""Big 3"" automakers that did not take a government bailout. At the GM plant, Obama also stressed the need to develop and manufacture green technologies that would cut the country's dependence on oil. He test drove the Chevrolet Volt, GM's electric car, which is expected to roll out later this year. ""Today, this industry is growing strong. It's creating new jobs. It's manufacturing the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward an energy independent future,"" Obama said.","NEW: President touts development of green technologies .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Some 14 million people have been affected by the torrential rains and flooding that have left more than 1,000 dead in Pakistan, a spokesman for the national disaster authority told CNN Tuesday. While 1,245 people have been confirmed killed, officials believe the number of dead may reach 1,500, said spokesman Ahmed Kamal. He said 1,334 people have been injured and 337,282 people have been rescued. More than 302,000 houses have been damaged, Kamal said, but that number might more than double by the time the flooding subsides. Most of the displaced have sought shelter in public buildings, including schools, said a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They include thousands of Afghan refugees ""who have suddenly lost their homes for the second time."" Pakistan's Meteorological Department said more heavy rains were in store in the next few days, threatening to deepen the worst natural disaster the nation has experienced in recent history. The monsoon season is only halfway over. The flooding, which started in the northwest, threatened places as far south as the port city of Karachi. Nineteen people died across the country between Sunday and Monday nights, Kamal said. The weather in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa did improve slightly Tuesday, which allowed 23 helicopters to take off for relief and rescue operations, according to a military spokesperson who did not want to be identified. Kamal said 76 helicopters and 621 boats were participating in rescue efforts. Of those affected by the flooding, 6 million to 7 million are in immediate need of food and other items, said Maurizio Giuliano, information officer for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""While not all may be in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, and the severity of their needs has not yet been fully assessed, this is a higher figure than those who were affected by the 2005 South Asia tsunami (3 million), the 2005 South Asia earthquake (3 million), or the 2010 Haiti earthquake (3 million),"" he said Monday in a statement. Though the number of fatalities was not comparable with either the tsunami or the earthquake, both of which had death tolls that exceeded 200,000, Pakistan's flooding ""is a major disaster of enormous magnitude,"" said John Holmes, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and emergency relief coordinator. Many Pakistanis are not happy with the government's response to the floods, saying it has been slow and ineffective. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari returned home Monday from an overseas trip, facing growing criticism of his actions following the massive flooding. He had been in England for talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the worst of the crisis. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said a true assessment of the loss of life and infrastructure can be determined only after the water recedes. He appealed to the international community and to Pakistanis living abroad to help. Aid agencies scrambled to help those in need. ""The assistance that we have so far provided has alleviated suffering, but relief operations need to be massively scaled up,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Pakistan. U.S. emergency relief teams continued to arrive in Peshawar to help, the U.S. State Department said. The U.S. Agency for International Development has committed $55 million in aid to international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, it said. The United States has provided more than 435,000 meals. This assistance is in addition to U.S. military efforts, which include rescue airlifts, food supplies and other deliveries provided by the Pentagon. Of the total, $20 million will be used to expand humanitarian operations farther south as the flood zone expands, Mark Ward, acting director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, told reporters Tuesday. CNN's Reza Sayah and Samson Desta and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: The displaced in Pakistan include thousands of Afghan refugees .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The scene was more reminiscent of a Hollywood production than an elaborate prank by the Punk'd-master himself. A banner with Ashton Kutcher's Twitter name, aplusk, was unfurled Wednesday over the CNN logo at CNN Center. Ashton Kutcher, along with his wife, Demi Moore, dropped by Atlanta, Georgia's CNN Center on Wednesday to fulfill his promise to ""ding-dong-ditch"" CNN founder Ted Turner's house after winning last April's race to attract 1 million followers on the micro-blogging site Twitter. With the precision of a Hollywood director, Kutcher barked into his two-way radio as his light and sound crews followed with the Twitter entourage hot on their heels and an Internet audience watching on Ustream. Moments after Kutcher yelled ""lights"" into his two-way, his crew unfurled a banner with his Twitter name, aplusk, over the CNN's neon logo on the building.  Watch how Kutcher's prank turned out » . ""You know, CNN lost. That's what happened,"" Kutcher told a tag-along crowd of more than 100 fans whom he calls ""tweeps."" ""I'm just fulfilling a promise I made ... that I'd do this thing and I'm doing it."" Kutcher had challenged CNN to the Twitter race, saying he would donate 10,000 mosquito bed nets to charity for World Malaria Day if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. Follow CNN Breaking News on Twitter . Kutcher reached the goal about 30 minutes before CNN passed the mark. Kutcher acknowledged Wednesday that he would have to improvise to prank Turner. ""Ted doesn't really have an accessible home, and Ted doesn't really have an accessible doorbell,"" he said. In an earlier prank Wednesday, Kutcher and his crew arrived at a Ted's Montana Grill restaurant, which is named after the media mogul. The group neatly stacked hundreds of boxes of Ding Dongs in front of the restaurant, then each person banged a bronze bell out front. ""Don't be shy; get involved,"" Kutcher crowed from the top of a U-Haul van filled with Hostess Ding Dongs. ""There are 800 boxes of Ding Dongs. There are approximately 9,600 Ding Dongs here,"" said the former star of MTV's ""Punk'd"" show. ""We have to deliver these to Ted.""

"(CNN) -- ""I'm angry at having presided over the first genocide of the 21st century,"" said Mukesh Kapila, a British doctor and former U.N. official. Mukesh Kapila said atrocities in Darfur could have been prevented if the world had taken action sooner. He was referring to what he considers the world's ineffective response to mass atrocities in Darfur, Sudan's western region. ""What happened in Darfur would be classified as obscene,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""It's a combination of a horror movie and a snuff movie."" Kapila was the United Nations' top official in Sudan. He took up his post as resident and humanitarian coordinator in 2003, just a few months after rebels from Darfur's African tribes attacked outposts of Sudan's government, which is led by Arabs. The government's retaliation was so harsh that a U.N. human rights monitor issued a prophetic warning. His March 2003 report said that in the ""escalating conflict,"" Sudan's government may be ""engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur."" Unfortunately, Kapila says, the report ""disappeared into a big hole"" because the world's attention was on Iraq, where a U.S.-led coalition had gone to war to topple Saddam Hussein's regime.  Watch as Kapila describes his anger at the lack of attention on Darfur » . Since 2003, according to U.N. estimates, 300,000 Darfuris have been killed in the violence or died in the ensuing disease and starvation. Another 2.5 million have been uprooted from their homes. Kapila says it didn't have to be, and the man who was his boss at the time agrees. ""The most bitter lesson of Darfur,"" said Jan Egeland, former U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, ""is that the world let a small conflict slowly but surely degenerate into a full-blown catastrophe."" As reports of atrocities mounted in late 2003 and into 2004, Kapila and Egeland saw a pattern: Sudanese forces and government-armed Arab militia members known as janjaweed (""devils on horseback"") were using scorched-earth tactics against civilians from Darfur's African tribes. They burned villages, poisoned wells and raped women and girls, according to reports from U.N. workers and aid groups. Sudan claims that its forces were only putting down an armed insurrection. ""I think the problems which have been happening in Darfur are problems which can be happening in any place of the world where there is a war,"" Sudanese Interior Minister Ibrahim Hamid said. ""There are crimes, but it's not like what has been reflected in the international media."" But that's not what Kapila was hearing. He kept getting reports of more Darfuris killed or driven from their land and Arabs talking about making Darfur ""zurka-free"" -- ""zurka"" being a derogatory term for blacks. Unlike cyclones and earthquakes, the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Darfur was man-made, so Kapila and Egeland began a crusade to get Darfur onto the U.N. Security Council's agenda. They knew from experience that getting an issue in front of the Security Council brings, as Egeland says, three things: ""attention, attention, attention."" Both Egeland and Kapila approached Western governments but came away disappointed because most diplomats were focused on resolving another conflict, in southern Sudan, which had claimed 2 million lives over 20 years. The international community did respond with an emergency relief operation for the growing number of refugees who were running for their lives. But Kapila and Egeland wanted more. They believed that Darfur was not only a humanitarian crisis but also a human rights crisis that required action from the U.N. Security Council. Out of frustration, Kapila went outside proper channels and screamed to the media. In a March 2004 interview with BBC Radio, Kapila compared the situation in Darfur to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. His comments, which Sudan called a ""heap of lies,"" were picked up by newspapers around the world. Kapila so angered the host government in Khartoum that he had to resign his post. Even after the Security Council put Darfur on the agenda, it would take three more years of resolutions and debate to authorize a large U.N. peacekeeping force. China, which has veto power on the Security Council and extensive commercial and military ties to the government of Sudan, was one of the major obstacles to taking decisive action. But as conditions in Darfur became more widely known, a grass-roots movement began to grow, putting pressure on the White House and a spotlight on the U.N. Security Council. According to Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, ""no other tragedy since 1945 has caught the imagination of so many people as Darfur has."" Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and President Bush characterized the killing in Darfur as ""genocide."" Human rights groups documented China's strong ties to Sudan. And activists, including actress Mia Farrow and other celebrities, campaigned to tag the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics as the ""genocide Olympics."" Over time and under pressure, Chinese diplomats helped persuade Sudan to accept a U.N.-led peacekeeping force with the understanding that many of the troops would come from African countries. Would earlier action by the Security Council have made a difference? ""Yes,"" Egeland said. ""We would have kept it to a medium-sized African disaster. Not this mega-disaster. It could have been stopped when it was a small emergency."" In July, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court applied for a warrant to arrest Sudan's president, Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Read the charges against Sudan's president (pdf) Sudan denies the charges and has promised to punish anyone who has attacked innocent civilians.","Mukesh Kapila was the United Nations' top official in Sudan in 2003 .

"(CNN) -- Slovakia became the first of the larger ex-communist EU members to join the European single currency on Thursday amid hope the move will provide stability in the global economic storm. The country is the 16th country to use the euro after 11 EU members launched it 10 years ago, meaning that from New Year's Day 2009, 328 million of the 500 million people in the European Union will share the single currency. After Sony postponed a planned investment in a TV production plant in Slovakia earlier this month, other firms in the country welcomed entry into the eurozone as a move that will end uncertainty after years of coping with a volatile currency. ""First of all, the euro means price stability, both in relations with our clients in the euro zone and our business relations with suppliers localized in the euro zone countries,"" Jean Mouro, CEO of PSA Peugeot Citroen in Slovakia told Reuters.com. ""In general, it will reduce costs related to swift changes of the euro-crown exchange rate, especially in the last few years when the crown had been appreciating rapidly,"" said Mouro. Businesses also said that amid global economic uncertainty the euro will also result in lower production costs, as weakening economic activity limits inflation. ""We evaluate Slovakia's transition to the common European currency solely as a positive factor,"" said Katarina Holecova, a spokeswoman for a Samsung factory in Slovakia. ""In relation to the financial crisis, euro adoption may bring a positive impact in terms of softer inflation pressures, and thus, indirectly, savings in material or wage costs."" In the past two months, the euro has soared in value against the dollar by 9 percent and against the British pound by more than 20 percent. Joaquin Almunia, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs on Wednesday hailed the currency's strength. ""The euro has become the symbol of EU identity and is protecting us against the tremendous external shocks that we have had to cope with since the summer of 2007,"" he said in a statement. ""We should be proud of that record and we safeguard the sound budgetary and macroeconomic framework that has made the euro such a success.""","Slovakia is first large ex-communist nation to join European single currency .

"Washington (CNN) -- We're getting to the point where even good news comes wrapped in bad news. Good news: Despite the terrible June job numbers (125,000 jobs lost as the Census finished its work), one sector continues to gain -- manufacturing. Factories added 9,000 workers in June, for a total of 136,000 hires since December 2009. So that's something, yes? Maybe not. Despite millions of unemployed, despite 2 million job losses in manufacturing between the end of 2007 and the end of 2009, factory employers apparently cannot find the workers they need. Here's what the New York Times reported Friday: . ""The problem, the companies say, is a mismatch between the kind of skilled workers needed and the ranks of the unemployed. ""During the recession, domestic manufacturers appear to have accelerated the long-term move toward greater automation, laying off more of their lowest-skilled workers and replacing them with cheaper labor abroad. ""Now they are looking to hire people who can operate sophisticated computerized machinery, follow complex blueprints and demonstrate higher math proficiency than was previously required of the typical assembly line worker."" It may sound like manufacturers are being too fussy. But they face a real problem. As manufacturing work gets more taxing, manufacturers are looking at a work force that is actually becoming less literate and less skilled. In 2007, ETS -- the people who run the country's standardized tests -- compiled a battery of scores of basic literacy conducted over the previous 15 years and arrived at a startling warning: On present trends, the country's average score on basic literacy tests will drop by 5 percent by 2030 as compared to 1992. That's a disturbing headline. Behind the headline is even worse news. Not everybody's scores are dropping. In fact, ETS estimates that the percentage of Americans who can read at the very highest levels will actually rise slightly by 2030 as compared to 1992 -- a special national ""thank you"" to all those parents who read to their kids at bedtime! But that small rise at the top is overbalanced by a collapse of literacy at the bottom. In 1992, 17 percent of Americans scored at the very lowest literacy level. On present trends, 27 percent of Americans will score at the very lowest level in 2030. What's driving the deterioration? An immigration policy that favors the unskilled. Immigrants to Canada and Australia typically arrive with very high skills, including English-language competence. But the United States has taken a different course. Since 2000, the United States has received some 10 million migrants, approximately half of them illegal. Migrants to the United States arrive with much less formal schooling than migrants to Canada and Australia and very poor English-language skills. More than 80 percent of Hispanic adult migrants to the United States score below what ETS deems a minimum level of literacy necessary for success in the U.S. labor market. Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine a migrant to the United States. He's hard-working, strong, energetic, determined to get ahead. He speaks almost zero English, and can barely read or write even in Spanish. He completed his last year of formal schooling at age 13 and has been working with his hands ever since. He's an impressive, even admirable human being. Maybe he reminds some Americans of their grandfather. And had he arrived in this country in 1920, there would have been many, many jobs for him to do that would have paid him a living wage, enabling him to better himself over time -- backbreaking jobs, but jobs that did not pay too much less than what a fully literate English-speaking worker could earn. During the debt-happy 2000s, that same worker might earn a living assembling houses or landscaping hotels and resorts. But with the Great Recession, the bottom has fallen out of his world. And even when the recession ends, we're not going to be building houses like we used to, or spending money on vacations either. We may hope that over time the children and grandchildren of America's immigrants of the 1990s and 2000s will do better than their parents and grandparents. For now, the indicators are not good: American-born Hispanics drop out of high school at very high rates. Over time, yes, they'll probably catch up -- by the 2060s, they'll probably be doing fine. But over the intervening half century, we are going to face a big problem. We talk a lot about retraining workers, but we don't really know how to do it very well -- particularly workers who cannot read fluently. Our schools are not doing a brilliant job training the native-born less advantaged: even now, a half-century into the civil rights era, still one-third of black Americans read at the lowest level of literacy. Just as we made bad decisions about physical capital in the 2000s -- overinvesting in houses, underinvesting in airports, roads, trains, and bridges -- so we also made fateful decisions about our human capital: accepting too many unskilled workers from Latin America, too few highly skilled workers from China and India. We have been operating a human capital policy for the world of 1910, not 2010. And now the Great Recession is exposing the true costs of this malinvestment in human capital. It has wiped away the jobs that less-skilled immigrants can do, that offered them a livelihood and a future. Who knows when or if such jobs will return? Meanwhile the immigrants fitted for success in the 21st century economy were locating in Canada and Australia. Americans do not believe in problems that cannot be quickly or easily solved. They place their faith in education and re-education. They do not like to remember that it took two and three generations for their own families to acquire the skills necessary to succeed in a technological society. They hate to imagine that their country might be less affluent, more unequal, and less globally competitive in the future because of decisions they are making now. Yet all these things are true. We cannot predict in advance which skills precisely will be needed by the U.S. economy of a decade hence. Nor should we try, for we'll certainly guess wrong. What we can know is this: Immigrants who arrive with language and math skills, with professional or graduate degrees, will adapt better to whatever the future economy throws at them. Even more important, their children are much more likely to find a secure footing in the ultratechnological economy of the mid-21st century. And by reducing the flow of very unskilled foreign workers into the United States, we will tighten labor supply in ways that will induce U.S. employers to recruit, train and retain the less-skilled native born, especially African-Americans -- the group hit hardest by the Great Recession of 2008-2010. In the short term, we need policies to fight the recession. We need monetary stimulus, a cheaper dollar, and lower taxes. But none of these policies can fix the skills mismatch that occurs when an advanced industrial economy must find work for people who cannot read very well, and whose children are not reading much better. The United States needs a human capital policy that emphasizes skilled immigration and halts unskilled immigration. It needed that policy 15 years ago, but it's not too late to start now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Some jobs remain unfilled because not enough skilled workers, manufacturers say .
David Frum: Immigration policy has created influx of unskilled labor .
He says pool of new workers more suited to needs of last century .
Frum: U.S. policy should emphasize admitting highly skilled immigrants ."
"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Two men who have been together for 34 years have become the first couple to obtain a same-sex marriage since it became legal in Argentina on July 15. Artistic representative Alejandro Vanelli and actor Ernesto Larrese were married in a civil ceremony Friday morning in Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital. They wore dark suits and striped blue ties and were surrounded by well-wishers and a throng of reporters, photographers and videographers. Larrese spoke to his partner -- but also to the nation at large. ""To all those who are afraid ... those who are homophobic ... I tell them, don't worry; this doesn't affect you,"" Larrese said. ""You have nothing to fear. Fear is the opposite of love. Any phobia can be cured with love. There is nothing love cannot cure. ""Alejandro, I love you, and I renew my vows to you for 34 more years."" They were not the first same-sex couple to be married in the nation; just the first since the federal law was enacted. Previously, Argentina did not have a nationwide law but let state and local governments decide whether to allow same-sex marriages. Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello were married in Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of Argentina, in December. They are believed to be the first same-sex couple to be married in Latin America. Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage when lawmakers in the Senate passed the bill this month after 14 hours of debate. The bill had already passed the lower chamber of Congress. It gives same-sex couples equal marriage rights, including the ability to adopt children. The law was backed by the center-left government of President Cristina Kirchner, who signed the measure into law. The majority Roman Catholic country joins a few others around the world where same-sex marriage is legal. Among them are the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. Countries in Latin America, a region strongly identified with the Catholic Church, have recently given more attention to gay rights. Mexico City's legislative assembly passed a bill last year legalizing gay marriage there. In September, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex adoption.","Argentina is the first Latin American nation to allow same-sex marriage .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City will pay  more than $7 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the estate of a man killed by police outside a Queens' nightclub in 2006 and by his two friends, who were seriously wounded, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said Tuesday. The estate of Sean Bell, who was killed in the shooting, will receive $3.25 million, Joseph Guzman receive $3 million and Trent Benefield will  get $900,000, said Kate Ahlers. ""The city regrets the  loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the  Bell family,""  Michael Cardozo,  attorney for the New York City Law Department. ""We  hope that all parties can find some measure of closure by this settlement."" Bell, Guzman and Benefield were shot after an altercation with plainclothes detectives outside the Queens nightclub where Bell's bachelor party was held on the night before his wedding. Bell died at the scene, and Guzman and Benefield were seriously wounded. Accounts of the incident varied. Undercover officers, who were investigating the club regarding prostitution allegations, said they identified themselves as police, but witnesses and the wounded men said they did not. Police said they believed at least one of the men had a gun, but no gun was found. And one of the officers said the Bell, instead of obeying his command to stop, hit him with his vehicle. The incident quickly  became a touchstone for those who believe police -- in New York and elsewhere --  have a record of excessive force, particularly against black men. Bell, 23, was  African-American, as were the two men wounded and two of the three police  officers. The officers fired 50 shots in just a few seconds. The shooting sparked  street protests, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg called it ""inexplicable"" and  ""unacceptable,"" saying ""it sounds to me like excessive force was  used."" In March 2007, three of  the police officers were indicted on multiple charges. Detectives Gescard  Isnora, Marc Cooper and Michael Oliver -- who fired his gun 31 times that  night, pausing to reload his weapon -- were acquitted of all charges in April  2008 . Justice Arthur Cooperman  of New York State Supreme Court said inconsistent testimony and other problems  ""had the effect of eviscerating the credibility"" of key prosecution witnesses,  and that some testimony ""just didn't make sense."" ""The police response with respect to each defendant was not proved to be criminal -- i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt. Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums,"" Cooperman said, according to a transcript released by his office. Citing insufficient  evidence, the Department of Justice announced in February that it would not  pursue federal civil rights charges against police officers involved. The department issued a  statement saying that after a ""careful and thorough"" review, there is not enough  evidence to prove that New York Police Department detectives ""acted willfully""  when they opened fire on Bell and his friends. In May, Rev. Al Sharpton  led a large protest in response to the Department of Justice decision. Sharpton and Bell's fiancee and  parents were among more than 200 people arrested in New York  City. Sharpton responded to  Tuesday's decision in a written statement. ""This in no way  mitigates or repairs the permanent damage done to them and the pain it has  caused them forever nor does it diminish the outrage in the community,"" Sharpton  said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti -- Horror has given way to acceptance; it can be seen on people's faces. But desperation surfaces everywhere: . In the rubble still strewn about the streets, in the steadily rising piles of garbage, in the 1,300 makeshift camps that still house so many people. Four months on, the tragedy of the massive January 12 earthquake is fresh. Relief operations thwarted widespread hunger here and so far, there have been no reports of killer disease outbreaks. But Port-au-Prince is very much running in emergency mode. Still. No humanitarian worker will argue with that sad fact. Despite the efforts and good intentions of a host of foreigners and a government that got a wake-up call, progress has been timidly slow. The future has a different meaning now for Haitians such as Edline Pierre, who worries not about where to enroll her three daughters in school but how to get them up off the floor fast enough when the rains start falling. Haiti earthquake special . She poured cement around her shack in the city's central Champs de Mars plaza. But that doesn't keep the water out or her girls safe at night. The future means getting through the night and when the sun comes back out, scrounging together a meal. On the streets, a bright spot: the sight of schoolchildren in uniforms. But only 700 of the 5,000 or so schools around the Haitian capital have opened. Some were destroyed; others are occupied by the displaced. Another welcomed sight: Hundreds of street vendors, many of whom are women, sit under a rainbow of umbrellas to sell mangoes, plantains and coconuts. Or they display a collision of goods in one basket -- shoe polish, spaghetti, shampoo, cigarettes and molasses. These are snippets of life as it was once, before that fatal day. Give us work -- not handouts . In the aftermath of what most Haitians refer to as ""the catastrophe,"" people asked for food. They patiently lined up for hours to receive a sack of rice, a quart of oil. The lines are gone, along with the massive aid drops. International agencies are wary that too much help could stymie the local economy. Now the two million Haitians living in squalid makeshift camps -- and countless others living in the homes of generous family and friends -- need jobs. They don't want handouts; they just want money so they can feed themselves. ""We are willing to work -- work hard -- for money, but we need jobs,"" said Joseph Cangas, a coordinator at a new camp in Corail. Some earn a few dollars here and there through work-for-cash programs. They clear debris off the streets or clean latrines in the camps. These are hardly high-quality jobs, but being employed anywhere will earn you envy. More than 100,000 Haitians found work this way. But that's only a sliver of the population. Almost four million people live in Port-au-Prince, a city designed for 250,000. Haitians lived in congested neighborhoods and shanties before the quake. Imagine those conditions compounded -- a family of six eating, sitting and sleeping in a space that's hardly bigger than the sofa in your den. When home is a place of last resort . To shield people from the potential danger of the rainy season, aid agencies have started building transitional homes and have relocated thousands to new camps on the city's perimeter. Almost 5,000 went to Corail, a stark place that evokes images of a military base in the Iraqi desert. Void of trees, the tropical sun beats down hard, and soaring temperatures make furnaces of the tents. It's not a place residents say they would choose. But this is where the government had access to land, so this is where people were brought to ride out the rains. Here, at least, they are not at risk of being washed away by torrents of water or in mudslides down steep, denuded hills. Corail has its own problems. It's far from the city, and it can cost a camp resident an astronomical $1.25 to take tap-taps, the colorful shared taxis, to central Port-au-Prince. No one at Corail could afford that journey. But they said they had to figure out a way to go where the jobs were. ""We help each other. We share food,"" said Cangas, the camp coordinator. ""But the situation is getting more tense. People have nothing so they resort to stealing sometimes."" He complained about the lack of services and schools at Corail. But aid agencies don't want people to get too comfortable here. Eventually, people have to try and regain their livelihoods in the neighborhoods where they were established. ""You want people to go home,"" said Mark Turner, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. ""The last resort is a place like Corail."" Turner said camp managers have been asking Haiti's homeless this question: What will it take for you to move out of a camp? The answers are varied, and the problems aren't easily resolved. Not even the safe places feel safe . All over the city, buildings are being marked green, yellow and red. Some already say: ""To demolish."" But even after an engineer has marked a home green for ""safe,"" people are reluctant to return. The United Nations estimates only 9 percent of those with green houses have gone back. What if there is another earthquake? Gerald-Emile Brun, an architect working with the government on relocation, said incentives for people to go home -- $50 and a few provisions -- are being created. But so far, nothing has been doled out. For many, Brun recognized, it's impossible to go back to the spot where their house once stood because there is no place to dispose of the rubble. In this city of renters, landlords are refusing to accept people who cannot pay the back rent for the four months they have been gone. Many of the displaced can no longer even afford the monthly amount they were paying before. And as time marches on, many landowners want to evict displaced people so the buildings can be used as intended. What if your child could not go to school because the classrooms were occupied by the homeless? What if you were homeless and had no place to shelter your children except at the neighborhood school? It's a tough call, especially for humanitarian workers who don't believe in forced evictions. But at the same time, Turner said, ""we recognize the landowners have legitimate concerns."" These are municipal issues that will have to be dealt with by the local government, Turner said. But it won't be easy. Ask Jacques Pablito Chardavoire, who helps manage a camp in front of the city's main cathedral. Chardavoire's response was simple but to the point: . Why would you leave an encampment that offers you a toilet, a shower, emergency food rations and, yes, even an outdoor movie screen when you have no place to go and no money in your pockets? He said almost 2,000 people were resettled in February from Champs de Mars to the cathedral. But within days, that many more people from elsewhere had flocked to Champ de Mars. ""Every time we move people, more come because they need services,"" he said. Much is shattered, but not hope . Haitians, who have lived through political turmoil, extreme violence and grinding poverty, will tell you the earthquake was the worst experience of their lives. Whether a new city can rise from the rubble of Port-au-Prince remains in question, though Haitians are hopeful something good must come out of an event this tragic. They have to be. They have nothing left but hope. And faith. That's why if you peek down lanes on a steamy afternoon, you'll see a gathering of people under a tent, their arms stretched skyward, their eyes closed. And you'll hear the Lord's Prayer. You'll hear it, too, every Sunday morning, before the sun gets hot, at Notre Dame, the main cathedral in Port-au-Prince. The building is shattered, but not the congregation's faith. They still come to the place where, every week, they are re-energized by their belief in Christ. Several Haitians said they feared the world's goodwill would quickly fade now that the throngs of media have left and the spotlight has turned elsewhere. Edna Dunrod was one of them. She worried she was forgotten, lying on a smelly mattress under three tattered bed sheets that serve as a roof in the Champs de Mars tent city. Last month, she gave birth to Marvins, asleep in a plastic tub under a foldable umbrella. Life with a newborn in this congested camp, she said, was unbearable. ""I want to go somewhere else,"" she said. But where, she worried. And who would help her reclaim her life?","Four months after massive quake, progress in Haiti is painfully slow .
People are afraid to return to their homes, even if they've been deemed safe .
Life in camps is difficult, but for many, it's the best option they have .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Flooding caused by monsoon rain has killed more than 400 people across Pakistan, a provincial government official said Friday. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province information minister, said the death toll is now 408 people in that province and 25 in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry, the head of the Pakistan meteorological department, told CNN the 300 mm, or 11.8 inches, of rain recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the most ever in Pakistan. Many of the victims died when floodwaters swept away hundreds of mud houses in parts of Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Tank, according to Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a provincial minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops and dozens of government buildings, local businesses and schools, Bilour said. Hussain said floodwater has cut off the Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Peshawar. There is no way to get to these areas by road, he said. Earlier Friday the head of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said flooding had killed at least 150 people and injured 90 since Wednesday. Retired Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmed said 90 people were still missing. The Pakistani Air Force is helping with rescue efforts, spokesman Tariq Yazdanie said in an interview on Pakistani TV. The recent torrential rains have broken all previous records of rainfall in the country, he said. The U.N. refugee agency dispatched the first shipment of aid for flood victims in the region Thursday, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. APP said the supplies include 585 tents, 2,700 plastic sheets, 1,760 kitchen sets and 4,000 plastic mats. At the same time, a top official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province pressed Pakistan's president for help, according to APP. The news agency said Assembly Speaker Karamatullah Khan told legislators he had asked President Asif Ali Zardari for a supply of emergency boats. Photographs from Getty Images showed flood victims struggling to cross a swollen river in the town of Nowshera. The pictures showed children being ferried across the water in overcrowded boats, and more able-bodied people helping the elderly to higher ground. Supplies from the U.N. agency will go first to the two hard-hit villages of Talli and Sultan Kot in Sibi district, APP said. The U.S.-based group Save the Children said it will distribute plastic sheeting for shelters, household supplies and hygiene kits to about 1,000 families over the next two days.

"(CNN) -- The Canadian Coast Guard finished the job of ferrying passengers Monday from a cruise ship that ran aground on an unmapped rock. Officials aboard the Clipper Adventurer reported their troubles Friday. The crew failed to dislodge the ship during high tide on Saturday. Sunday, a Coast Guard icebreaker arrived to transport the people on board to land. ""All 128 passengers were safely transported from the Coast Guard icebreaker, Amundsen, to the community of Kugluktuk"" on Monday, said Theresa Nichols, a spokeswoman with the Canadian Coast Guard. In addition to the passengers, 69 crew members also were on board, according to Nichols. Kugluktuk is a small town on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. Accommodations for the passengers have been arranged by the cruise ship company, said Nichols. The passengers are expected to fly to the Canadian city of Edmonton. The grounded vessel is stable, but rests with a slight list, according to the company that operates the cruise ship, Adventure Canada.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A building at a Georgia university was evacuated Monday morning after some Civil War relics stored there were found to be possibly dangerous, officials said. Officials at Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta called an all-clear around 1 p.m., about an hour and a half after they evacuated the school's Social Sciences Building and its surrounding area. ""Some Civil War relics stored on the third floor were noticed as being a potential hazard,"" the university said in a news release. The relics included two cannonballs that were located in a display case within a room that was accessible only with a card-key, the university said. The cannonballs had been on display in the building for about three years as part of a collection within the university's Center for the Study of the Civil War Era, the school said. They were donated by a private individual. A new administrative faculty member at the university was the person who raised concerns about the cannonballs, Kennesaw State said. A local bomb squad responded to the university and removed the relics in question, and the building was reopened.","Civil War relics at Kennesaw State University were deemed potentially hazardous .

"(CNN) -- A Mormon bishop was shot and killed in Visalia, California, on Sunday, police said. The suspected gunman was killed later in the day in a gunfight with police, Visalia California Police Chief Colleen Mestas told CNN. Bishop Clay Sannar, 42, was shot dead in an office at Visalia's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mestas said. About 20 minutes after the shooting, police got a call from the suspect, who told them where he was heading, Mestas said. Officers intercepted the suspect and a gunfight ensued, during which the suspect was killed. Church members tell police the gunman was a stranger who hadn't been seen at the church before.

"YORKTOWN, Virginia (CNN) -- It's daybreak on Sara Creek, a sleepy backwater that sits near Yorktown, Virginia, and empties into the Chesapeake. The early morning fog slowly lifts to reveal the ripples of water, the boats swaying, and a picturesque harbor. Tommy Leggett works to reduce polluted waters in Chesapeake Bay by growing oysters. Local watermen have been fishing around this area for generations. It's beginning to rain, and Tommy Leggett, a very proud and reserved waterman, combs over his white beard with his rough hands and prepares his boat, ""Chesapeake Gold,"" for what looks like a day of fishing out in the bay. ""I've been a waterman for over 20 years,"" he says. The difference now is Leggett doesn't fish anymore. He's an eco-conscious farmer and advocate who works on his sustainable oyster farm in the James River. He uses the term ""aquaculture"" to describe what he's doing here. ""It refers to the husbandry, or farming, of aquatic species."" Leggett sells the oysters he harvests to local restaurants, growing about 100,000 a year as a part-time business. He makes sure he always has a product to replace the ones that he sells. He shares his expertise with other watermen, educating them about oyster aquaculture and the importance of sustainability.  Watch Leggett's efforts to save the bay » . Leggett also sells his fresh products to the area market. ""Customers want to know if the oysters they are buying are local, which means they're fresher and taste better."" Waterman: Many foods rely on oysters . The Chesapeake Bay, which is the United States' largest estuary, covering more than 64,000 square miles and spanning across several states, has seen its fish, crab and oyster stocks dwindle, in part, because of pollution over the past several decades. ""It was once said that the oyster stock in the Chesapeake Bay could have filtered the entire volume of the bay, in a single day,"" says Leggett, who has been farming shellfish in the watershed since 1995. ""Most people don't think of oysters having come from farms, and historically they haven't. They've been harvested from the wild fishery, which is supplied by Mother Nature."" That wild fishery, which still exists today, has seen its share of setbacks. From disease to overharvesting, Leggett knows what's at stake, and he's trying to get the message out. ""Oysters filter the water, and they provide habitat for other species. There are so many food webs that depend and rely on oysters."" Not only does Leggett farm, he also works for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) as the Virginia oyster and fishery scientist. He is trying to do his part to reverse the trends of depleting oyster stocks. ""If we don't restore oysters, we're not going to restore the Bay,"" he says. He wants to make sure people understand what just one single oyster can do. ""One oyster out here in one of our bags can filter as much as 50 gallons of water a day."" By filtering the water, this important shellfish can take away deadly pollutants that eventually could deplete the crab and fish stocks, which in turn can leave fishermen without work. Millions of oyster 'moms and dads' The CBF helps to grow millions of oysters that will eventually make their way to sanctuary reefs and will not be harvested. The oysters will reproduce, and make a home for thousands of sea critters that will eventually become food for larger animals. ""Its all a giant food chain,"" Leggett explains. Leggett works alongside Jackie Harmon as the CBF's sole employees at a worksite near the Institute of Marine Science in Hayes, Virginia. iReport.com: Show us the environment near you . ""Our goal is to replenish oyster stocks,"" Harmon says, ""and by doing so, the oysters cannot only help filter water, but also help with shoreline erosion."" ""It's a sustainable way for watermen of the Chesapeake to continue their livelihood as fishermen, in a more eco-friendly way."" Harmon also maintains an oyster farm on the weekend and hopes to one day sell her oysters at local farmers' markets. Leggett puts it this way: ""All we're doing here is making moms and dads to help jump-start reefs throughout the Chesapeake."" Leggett and Harmon are optimistic. They believe current federal and state administrations are doing great things for the environment. They believe the CBF's message is being heard. However, a lot more needs to be done, Harmon says. ""People are becoming more aware and want to take care of their environment, and they want to make it a better place for future generations,"" she says. So as the land-based movement makes it apparent that buying local is the healthy way to live, seafood should be known in that same light. Leggett believes the Chesapeake Bay can produce the amount of seafood needed for the entire region and he thinks with careful oversight, the watersheds can be an abundant source for that local seafood industry again, just like it was decades ago.","NEW: Watch CNN.com Live Earth Day coverage at 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m. ET .

"(CNN) -- Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, is challenging the Justice Department's request for certain documents in its investigation of alleged civil rights violations by the sheriff's office. In a letter to the Justice Department on Friday, Arpaio's lawyer said the sheriff couldn't agree to the department's September deadline to supply all documents requested for its investigation and questioned the government's pursuit of broad access to documents, personnel and facilities in the inquiry. The letter, from sheriff's office attorney Robert Driscoll, alleged that the Justice Department's position that it is ""entitled to any document it wants, to access any facility it wishes, and to interview any witness it wants, without limitation ... is simply unreasonable."" Authorities are investigating whether Arpaio's policies and law enforcement sweeps discriminate against Hispanics. Justice Department officials met Tuesday with Arpaio and his lawyers to request additional documents in the investigation. The department formalized the request in a letter to the sheriff's lawyers Wednesday. The letter asked the sheriff's office to send confirmation Friday that it would deliver the documents by September 10. In his letter to the Justice Department on Friday, Driscoll pushed back on that deadline, saying ""we did not agree to a September 10, 2010 deadline at our meeting, and we cannot agree to one now. ""As I am sure you are aware,"" the letter continued, ""MCSO [Maricopa County Sheriff's Office] like many other state and local governmental agencies, has limited resources which cannot be deployed indiscriminately without a potentially negative impact on MCSO's ability to perform its primary functions of enforcing the law and protecting the citizens of Maricopa County."" On Saturday, a Justice Department spokesman said the department expects to receive the documents on time, despite the Friday letter. ""We're reviewing the letter,"" spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement, ""but as we have said all along, we expect the sheriff's office to provide nothing short of full compliance with the law, as every other law enforcement agency in the country has done in similar circumstances."" If it doesn't turn over the documents, the government has threatened to sue the sheriff's office ""to compel access to the requested documents, facilities and personnel,"" Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez has said. Arpaio, who has called himself ""America's toughest sheriff,"" is known for his hard-nosed opposition to illegal immigration. Detractors accuse him of discriminating against Hispanics. Supporters say the Justice Department's civil rights probe and its separate criminal investigation are politically motivated. In his Friday letter to the Justice Department, Driscoll claimed that some of the requested documents were already in the Justice Department's possession. ""I must say I was surprised at the apparent lack of command that any members of the DOJ team had over these documents,"" Driscoll wrote, referring to the Tuesday meeting. ""Indeed many of the items your team claimed to need are among those documents that the DOJ has and has had for quite some time.""

"(Mashable)  -- In a rather small survey conducted by a young psychologist, Facebook was shown to have some interesting correlations with self-esteem and narcissism in young adults. In a survey of 100 college students, young people with narcissistic personality traits were shown to exhibit Facebook activity that was distinctly more self-promotional. These people had ""About Me"" sections that referred to their intelligence and photos that were more about displaying the user's physical attractiveness than about capturing memories with friends. Narcissism is defined in the survey, by a researcher at York University in Toronto, Canada, as ""a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration and an exaggerated sense of self-importance."" For the average narcissist, Facebook ""offers a gateway for hundreds of shallow relationships and emotionally detached communication."" More importantly for this study, social networking in general allows the user a great deal of control over how he or she is presented to and perceived by peers and other users. Mashable.com: Study says social media is for narcissists . The study postulated that narcissists would show more overall Facebook activity than average users and that their activity would be more self-promotional, either descriptively or superficially. The survey's results showed ""significant positive correlations between narcissism and self-promotional content in the following areas: Main Photo, View Photos , Status Updates and Notes."" People who scored higher on the study's narcissism test also spent more time on Facebook and checked it more times each day than their less narcissistic counterparts. Mashable.com: Weekend stories you may have missed . Male narcissists were more self-promotional in their ""About Me"" descriptions, using this section as an opportunity to highlight their intelligence and wit. Female users with narcissistic tendencies tended to use images in their self-promotion, uploading content that ""include[d] revealing, flashy and adorned photos of their physical appearance."" Mashable.com: Older adults nearly double social media presence . The researcher notes that this study is intended to be a preliminary look at nonynous social networking, a fairly new field for academic scrutiny.

"Washington (CNN) -- A doctor. A cop. A little girl. A Phillies fan. They're all Muslims. And, they emphasize in a new online commercial that begins appearing this week, they're all Americans. ""I don't want to take over this country,"" the dozen-plus speakers say in the public service announcement. ""I don't support terrorism."" The online video is an effort to fight back against ""the rising tide of fear-mongering"" resulting from plans to build a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan in New York, the group behind it said. The project, called Park51, has come to be known as the ""ground zero mosque,"" although it is two blocks from the site of the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its supporters say it will include many other facilities in addition to a space for prayer.

"(CNN) -- It's sometimes said that the '00s opened with a Pearl Harbor and ended with a Great Crash. Yet this dramatic decade still lacks even a name. The Forties had big bands and a bigger war, the Sixties protests and hippies, the Seventies ""malaise."" But what do we call the decade just ending? The Double-Zeros? The late Bill Safire suggested the Naughties, ""nought"" being an old-fashioned term for ""zero"" (as in dough-nought). Whatever you call them, the years from 2000 on have been united by one great theme: This is the decade when the bills came due for neglected problems. 1) Terrorism . The most painful thought about the 9/11 attack was how easily it could have been prevented. If the state trooper who pulled over Ziad Jarrah for speeding had a way to detect a fraudulent driver's license -- if the gate agent who checked Muhammad Atta in Portland, Maine, had acted on his suspicions -- if, if, if. Through the 1990s, the United States was targeted by an escalating series of terrorist actions. Yet the country's leaders continued to treat terrorism as second or third-tier problem. President Clinton did not respond to the attack on the USS Cole in December 2000. Some suspected he feared retaliation would disrupt his Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Candidate George W. Bush promised Muslim voters that he would end the use of CIA terrorism evidence in immigration hearings. The bill for past laxity came due on September 11, 2001. And over the remainder of the decade, other bills would arrive: the bill for allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power in 1991, the bill for not responding to Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks in the 1990s. After the attack on the U.S. Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19, the Clinton administration threatened retaliation if Iran repeated the atrocity. That threat was followed by the ramping up of the Iranian nuclear program that confronts the world today. 2) Health care . The private marketplace had developed a promising, cost-efficient means of delivering healthcare: the health maintenance organization. Thanks to the spread of HMOs, health care costs grew more slowly in the 1990s than any decade since World War II. Because health care costs are paid out of employee wages, slowing those costs boosted worker pay. Thanks in large part to the slowdown of health cost inflation, worker incomes grew faster in the 1990s than in any decade since the 1960s. But the HMOs had their faults and kinks. Instead of defending and improving the HMO system, demagogic state and federal politicians waged war on HMOs, imposing strict mandates on them that forced up their costs. And they persuaded employers to revert to more traditional and expensive fee-for-service medicine. The main result: Costs exploded upward again in the 2000s. The average cost of a health policy for a family of four doubled between 2000 and 2006, from about $6,000 to about $13,000. A secondary result: Wage growth stopped. The typical earner actually brought home less after inflation in 2006 than in 2000. 3) Immigration . In 1986, Congress passed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, granting amnesty to illegal aliens and promising stricter enforcement of immigration laws in the future. The law failed miserably. The amnesty only invited a huge surge of migrants hoping for a second amnesty. The promised enforcement never materialized. Over the ensuing decade, the United States received the biggest influx of migration since before the First World War. These new migrants transformed the lives of middle-class Americans. In the 1960s, McDonald's was the typical night out for a middle-income family. In the 1990s, a family earning the same income could enjoy table service at an Olive Garden or Applebee's. House cleaning, gardening, nannying and valet parking all became more affordable to middle-class Americans. There were losers from this social transformation: lower-skilled natives priced out of low-wage jobs. But they had little political clout, and their feelings were easily ignored. But in the 2000s, it became apparent that the illegal migrant population had grown vastly bigger. Migrants were now displacing the native-born from more desirable work: construction, meatpacking, trucking. More ominously, the children of the migrants were growing into something that looked very much like an underclass. The rate of teen motherhood among second-generation Hispanic children is higher than among blacks. Barely half of second-generation Hispanic migrants complete high school on time. Rejecting the low-skilled jobs that employed their parents, but unprepared for more skilled work, they fall into gangs and alienation. And this time, unlike 1986, we are talking about a population numbering in the tens of millions. These bills for past mistakes arrived in the 2000s. But we did not manage to pay them. Maybe it would be both more numerically and historically accurate to call the decade not the double zeroes but the triple zeroes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","The decade that's ending doesn't yet have a name .

"(CNN) -- Silverstone, home of the British Grand Prix, has officially unveiled a new circuit that will host both Formula One and MotoGP this year. The new $7.5 million 5.9km layout has come in the wake of Silverstone being handed the British Grand Prix for the next 10 years, after it looked certain the race would be moved to rival track Donington Park. The re-design, apart from increasing the length of the track, also sees famous sections of the old course -- Bridge and Priory -- removed altogether. New sections -- Farm Curve, Village corner, The Loop, Aintree corner and Wellington Straight -- have all been added and a new pit and paddock complex is currently in development. This is expected to be completed ahead of the 2011 British Grand Prix. Silverstone is owned by the British Racing Drivers' Club and president Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, admitted to reporters that there was a financial risk involved in spending so much money on the new circuit. ""It's a necessary risk. The alternative was that the British Grand Prix would have gone off the calendar,"" admitted Hill. ""There is a justification to demand first-class facilities if you have a first-class event like Formula One, and others like MotoGP, but it has to make financial sense. ""We are relying a little on this country's tradition of producing world-class drivers who potentially drive people through the gate.""","The new Silverstone Formula One circuit has been officially unveiled .

"(CNN) -- Two men held in the Netherlands may have been trying to test U.S. airport security by putting bottles with electronic devices attached in checked baggage, a U.S. law enforcement source said Monday. The men were taken into custody after landing in Amsterdam on a flight from Chicago, Illinois, Dutch prosecutors said. Both men were being held at Amsterdam's Schiphol International Airport at the request of Dutch national police, airport spokesman Robert Kapel said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said they were arrested after ""suspicious items"" in their luggage raised concern. ""The items were not deemed to be dangerous in and of themselves, and as we share information with our international partners, Dutch authorities were notified of the suspicious items,"" the U.S. agency said. ""This matter continues to be under investigation."" Those items were an empty shampoo bottle with watches attached to it and an empty bottle of a stomach medicine with mobile phones attached, according to the U.S. law enforcement source, who has been briefed on the investigation. That has raised concern that the men may have been testing a future terrorist plot, the source said. Attempts to sneak liquid explosives aboard jetliners were at the heart of a 2006 plot broken up by British authorities. That case led U.S. authorities to ban all but small quantities of liquids from aircraft cabins. U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that the checked bags contained knives and box cutters as well. Passengers have been banned from carrying those items on aircraft since the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The source identified the men aboard United Airlines Flight 908, from Chicago, Illinois, to Amsterdam, as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al-Soofi and Hezem al-Murisi. Al-Soofi began his trip by boarding a flight in Birmingham, Alabama, and al-Murisi originally flew from Memphis, Tennessee, the law enforcement source said. Another U.S. law enforcement official said both men were in the United States legally, but their countries of origin were not immediately known. That official said neither of the passengers were carrying items that are barred from aircraft, and federal air marshals were aboard the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight. However, the law enforcement source said al-Soofi was ticketed for a flight that went to Washington's Dulles International Airport, with continuing stops in Dubai and Yemen, while both he and al-Murisi were aboard the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight. Al-Soofi's luggage went aboard the Chicago-to-Washington flight without him, the source said, in what amounted to another violation of U.S. safety protocols. A U.S. government official said items in at least one of the bags were being examined by law enforcement authorities at Dulles on Monday night. The official said al-Soofi and al-Murisi were seated near each other on the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight, but were not seated next to each other. Authorities are still looking into whether the men were traveling together or simply had similar itineraries, the official said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Jeanne Meserve, Mike Ahlers and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: Men in custody may have been testing security .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- First-time winners and new shows took the lion's share of the hardware Sunday night at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. ""Modern Family"" beat out the heavily favored ""Glee"" for outstanding comedy honors, and wound up winning six Emmys out of 14 nominations while ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" continued their winning ways in the drama category. ""We are thrilled that families are sitting down to watch a television show,"" said ""Modern Family"" creator Steven Levitan. ""Thank you for letting us into your families."" ""The Pacific,"" which won seven Creative Arts Emmys last weekend and outstanding miniseries during the primetime show, was the overall champ, but the night's big winners were the TV movie ""Temple Grandin,"" which won five Emmys for a total of seven. ""Modern Family"" took four Emmys on Sunday night and six overall. ""Mad Men"" received its third straight outstanding drama series trophy. ""I can't believe we are here,"" said series creator Matthew Weiner. The trend-setting AMC series received 17 nominations, and four Emmys. Actress Claire Danes won her first Emmy receiving the best actress in a miniseries or a movie award for her turn in ""Temple Grandin"" which also scored up with seven wins including best miniseries or movie. ""This is in service of your work,"" Danes said, thanking the real-life Grandin during her acceptance speech. The award show proved to be full of surprises. Aaron Paul of ""Breaking Bad"" scored his first win for outstanding supporting actor in a drama, and Jim Parsons from ""The Big Bang Theory"" beat out such veterans Alec Baldwin and Tony Shalhoub for best actor in a comedy. Edie Falco scored her fourth Emmy as lead actress. Falco, who had previously won for ""The Sopranos"" in the drama category, took home the award for best actress in a comedy for her role on ""Nurse Jackie."" ""I'm not funny,"" Falco insisted when she took to the stage. ""Top Chef"" ended seven years of domination of ""The Amazing Race"" in the best reality show category. ""The Daily Show"" won for outstanding variety, music, or comedy series. The critically acclaimed ""Breaking Bad"" swept the drama acting category with the show's star Bryan Cranston winning for best actor. George Clooney received the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award for his many philanthropic works, including  ""America: A Tribute to Heroes in the Wake of 9/11,"" ""Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope,"" ""A Concert for the Gulf Coast"" and the ""Hope for Haiti Now"" telethon. Kyra Sedgwick took home her first Emmy for best actress in a drama for her work on ""The Closer,"" and Archie Panjabi from ""The Good Wife"" won for best supporting actress in a drama. Jane Lynch from ""Glee"" looked shocked for her selection as best supporting actress in a comedy series and was followed to the podium by ""Glee"" co-creator Ryan Murphy, who won the award for directing in a comedy series. Eric Stonestreet, who plays Cameron Tucker in ABC's ""Modern Family,"" won the first Emmy Sunday for best supporting actor in a comedy series. ""All I wanted to be was a clown in the circus, growing up,"" Stonestreet said as he accepted the award. The most spoken words during Sunday night's awards show may be ""Glee"" and ""Mad Men,"" as those two shows dominate nominations with a total of 36. Who wins and what they say will be seen sooner across the entire United States, since NBC moved the broadcast up several weeks to avoid a conflict with NFL football games that the network starts broadcasting on Sunday nights in September. West Coast viewers, who normally have to wait three hours to see a delayed broadcast, could witness the Emmys live this year, which started at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT. The program repeated again on the West Coast immediately after it ended in the Eastern time zone. Comedian Jimmy Fallon served as host of the show at the Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles.

"(CNN) -- Lindsay Spencer was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life: what to do with those Facebook friend requests from people she met through her job. Blurring work and personal friendships is prompting Lindsay Spencer to maintain separate Facebook pages. ""There's nothing on my personal page that's horrible,"" says the 24-year-old communications coordinator for the National Peanut Board in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It's just that there are some things that are not work-appropriate."" Many of the job-related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences. Eventually they would find her by searching on Facebook and request to be ""friended."" Initially Spencer decided to ignore the requests. After all, does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are? Do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time? Spencer's answer was to create a second Facebook page, which she devotes to work-related information. This means she now has her ""friend friends,"" about 400 of them, and then she has her ""work friends,"" four, so far. Spencer's modern dilemma is becoming more common throughout the world, experts say, as friendships with co-workers extend to our lives spent online after work hours. Simultaneously, our computer time at the office is becoming an extension of our personal life, they say. 'Work takes place in more places now' This isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York. ""No one ever forces us to go online -- we can shut it off,"" he says. ""What this is really all about is an increase in information sharing."" And with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices, many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail. They also have the ability to stay in constant touch with their favorite social networking sites. ""There is increasingly less difference in work life and personal time,"" Levinson says. ""We are coming from a time when there were very clear boundaries. That comes from an older expectation. Work takes place in more places now."" And again, Levinson doesn't think it's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers. Spencer, who has friended her manager but not her big boss, says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites. And so far, so good. There have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades, no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts. Social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world, says Dr. Lynn Friedman, a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University. Face time vs. Facebook time . People can use the sites to make new acquaintances outside their departments and groups, and users can extend their networks beyond the traditional workplace, she says in an interview by e-mail. ""It's a way to enter new professional galaxies."" But people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person. ""In most businesses, it's optimal to mix social networking with real-life face-to-face interaction,"" she writes. ""However, social networking can provide a springboard for identifying kindred spirits with whom one might want to do something old-fashioned like, say, having a cup of coffee. In an ideal world, it's best to relate to others in both cyber and real space."" Paula Pile, a psychologist who practices in North Carolina, says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites aren't encroaching on your office time. More than an hour a day is excessive, she warns. Worse, spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time. It can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children. ""If you are spending two hours at home on them each night, you are not available to your family,"" she says. Set boundaries . Both psychologists advise setting boundaries between yourself and the people you work with, as well as your online ""friends."" Friedman also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings. She uses an example of someone who lets people know, ""I don't do those things at nights or on weekends so I can have my time with family."" And Pile says to consider who you're corresponding with during your work time. If they aren't people you would talk to in ""real life,"" she says, you probably are wasting time.","Do job-related Facebook friends really need to know details of your personal life?

"(CNN) -- Germany coach Joachim Low has ended speculation over his future by signing a two-year contract extension in the wake of a successful World Cup campaign. Low's assistant coach Hansi Flick, goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke and national team manager Oliver Bierhoff have also signed on for a further two years. The 50-year-old's previous four-year deal expired on June 30. Talks on extending it had initially stalled in February, reportedly over financial details, and Low's desire for more control over the Under-21 Germany side. But the new deal will now see Low take on the task of helping Germany qualify for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine, after his team finished third at the World Cup. ""We are all pleased that we can continue our work with the national team,"" he told the German Football Federation's (DFB) official website. ""Our team has excellent sporting prospects and it is a big challenge for us to be able to get stuck into the preparations for Euro 2012 after the successful World Cup in South Africa. ""In order to be able to achieve our main goals in the near future, we need the continued hard and consistent work from everyone."" The DFB president Theo Zwanziger announced his delight at securing the futures of Low and his backroom staff. ""I'm happy for German football that we have been able to solve the most important personnel decisions in the national team so quickly and confidentially,"" he told the federation's official website. ""The signature of the Bundestrainers for this young team is immensely important."" Zwanziger was keen to extend Low's position as coach of Germany after the former Stuttgart manager guided his country to third in South Africa. Low's young Germany side won rave reviews as they thrashed England and Argentina before losing to eventual winners Spain in the semifinals. The team finished the tournament with a bronze medal after beating Uruguay 3-2 in a third-place playoff. Many players on the Germany team impressed, none more so than forward Thomas Muller, 20, who won the Golden Boot and the best young player award. Low, who has won 38 out of 55 matches since succeeding Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006, also guided Germany to the final of the European Championships of 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, where they were defeated 1-0 by Spain. Germany's first qualifying match for Euro 2012 will be against Belgium in Brussels on September 3.","Germany coach Joachim Low has signed a two-year contract extension .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- There is a ""maker's movement"" gaining prominence on a global scale. Mister Jalopy works out of converted hot-rod repair shop. This is where he builds ""the stuff of my dreams."" One of its pied pipers is a man known by his pen name, Mister Jalopy. His agenda is simple. ""You need to be able to modify, hack, repair, rebuild and reuse the stuff that you buy."" Mister Jalopy's name comes from a blog he started years ago. From his Web site: . ""When I started the Hooptyrides blog, I pictured a modest used car lot of broken-down, flat-tired junkers that represented great promise and little else. Lit with strings of bare light bulbs, I dreamed of a little desert lot of plucky automobiles and a faded neon sign that erratically blinked 'Mister Jalopy's Hooptyrides.' "" Mister Jalopy owns a laundromat and a used-bicycle store, and he operates out of a converted hot-rod repair shop along an industrial strip of land in the shadow of Interstate 5. He calls his workshop ""Hooptyrides World Headquarters."" ""It's my personal shop where I do my writing, think up my crackpot business schemes, repair bicycles and do my auto maintenance ... where I build the stuff of my dreams."" It's brimming with high-quality tools, odds and ends from 20 years of harvesting garage sales, and machines like a lathe and welder that would delight a working tradesman. He created the ""world's largest iPod."" It's housed in a 1950s record console that can now digitize his music off the turntable, and the original buttons control the iPod. He also made an ""urban guerrilla movie theater"" -- a handmade movie projector sitting on an adult tricycle.  Watch Mister Jalopy at work » . His used-bike shop, Coco's Variety, is named after one of his two dogs. ""The credo of my store is 'Faded champions reborn for another chance at glory.' "" He adds: ""These old bikes, already manufactured, [are] tenderly brought back to life for someone to love anew. The best bike for the environment is one that already exists. Not one made fresh."" Mister Jalopy goes to garage sales every week. ""Some of my favorite stuff ... are the things that were made or worn by human hands. There's an incredible feeling of soul."" His most treasured find? ""It was a lowly glass Skippy jar filled with all of the earthly treasures of a kid from the '50s."" There was a chunky eraser, toy soldiers, and caps for a cap gun. Mister Jalopy has a practical approach to saving the environment and surviving in a downturn economy. ""The hands-off era is over. We were seduced by low prices. Our landfills are filled with cheap plastic fans, broken vacuum cleaners. We're feeling the crunch economically. Maybe this stuff should be repairable."" He wrote an article for Make magazine called the ""Maker's Bill of Rights."" It outlines the need for manufacturers to make products that are repairable, modifiable, have replaceable parts and come with a manual. Of products that are glued shut, he has this to say: ""The idea of the Maker's Bill of Rights was to say, if you can't open it, you don't own it."" Dale Dougherty is the creator of Make magazine, which is at the core of the movement. ""We live in a complex world. I wanted to make a magazine to showcase innovation and ideas around the world ... even in Third World countries."" Make magazine sponsors the annual Maker Faire in Northern California. More than 500 exhibitors will showcase their ideas and innovations on the last weekend in May. Families are a big part of their business. ""There are no famous rock bands or stunts to bring people in,"" Dougherty says. Last year 65,000 people attended. Mister Jalopy will be there hosting the main stage. ""There's this amazing community of people that are makers: carpenters, fabricators, mechanics, electronics repair people, designers of products, garden designers ... that's the great thing about the maker movement. It is passionate individuals willing to make mistakes and build the stuff of our dreams."" ""I'm a professional amateur. I haven't been trained to do anything. I'm not an expert carpenter, metalworker or mechanic. I'm fearless, though. I'll jump into anything. My hope is everyone becomes a professional amateur, that we have the passion and courage to fail."" Mister Jalopy tinkers with a dusty jukebox given to him by a friend. He presses selection ""D5."" The electronics strain to move the parts that pull a 45 onto the needle. Elton John's ""Bennie and the Jets"" warbles along. The speakers grind out the tune. As the song ends, the needle arm unexpectedly skips to another disc. ""Uh ... oh, these old machines are fascinating. There's a visceral quality.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Andy Lipkis was 15 years old on the first Earth Day in 1970 -- the year he says he realized what his calling in life would be. A file photo of the rainwater cistern while it was being constructed at TreePeople's headquarters. Three years later, Lipkis and his teenage friends would found the non-profit, community-based organization known as TreePeople. Based in Los Angeles, California, the environmental organization's primary purpose has been to educate communities on the planting and care of trees and to work with government agencies on issue No. 1 in the West: water. Exploding populations from Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada, to suburban Los Angeles have turned the issue of water supply from problem to crisis. ""The way we use water is so wasteful and so inappropriate today, according to the California Water Plan, there is already so much demand for water, it already exceeds supply,"" says Lipkis. And human consumption isn't the only problem, because as cities grow, so does the amount of pavement and concrete that seals the natural watersheds. That in turn prevents rainwater from refreshing underground aquifers, nature's water tanks. And rainwater is exactly what Lipkis is hoping people will start to think about. Right now, building codes in Los Angeles County, as in most parts of the country, require rainwater to be moved from rooftops to the street. As a result, even in mostly sunny southern California, a massive amount of water gets flushed into storm drains every year. ""When it rains an inch,"" Lipkis says, ""Los Angeles hemorrhages 7.6 billion gallons of water."" Part of the solution to the water crisis, he says, is collecting as much rainwater as possible because ""it represents half or more of all the water we need in this big city."" Lipkis and the TreePeople imagine a time when as many as a million homes and businesses have rainwater cisterns all electronically networked and ready to provide treated drinking water to the public. Lipkis points out that cisterns are not a new idea. If fact, civilizations throughout history have used cisterns to collect rainwater. Cisterns exist now as part of building codes in places like Bermuda, which lack fresh water resources such as lakes or rivers. Lipkis believes it's an idea whose time has come here in the deserts of the West.  Watch how rainwater cisterns work » . TreePeople, in collaboration with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has built five demonstration sites in Los Angeles, which include a large hilltop cistern at the organization's Coldwater Canyon Park headquarters. ""When it rains an inch,"" Lipkis said, ""those five little projects capture 1.25 million gallons."" And it is all that free water that has government agencies thinking about rain. In Los Angeles, storm runoff presents many problems. When it rains heavily the water goes from the streets into the canals of the Los Angeles River and straight into the ocean. With that runoff is all the garbage and toxic pollutants picked up along the way. Another problem, Lipkis argues, is the heavy reliance on the almost 100-year-old California Aqueduct, which routes water from the Eastern Sierras. His main concern is the incredible amount of energy that is spent moving water. ""We're bringing water in from hundreds of miles away. Moving water and using water,"" he says, ""consumes, overall, 19 percent of all the electricity in the state and one-third of the natural gas."" That is the single largest use of electricity in the state, which happens to be the most populous in the country and which, were it an independent nation, would be the eighth-largest economy in the world. That's quite a carbon footprint. Lipkis believes a hybrid water management system is the best solution, one that would include cisterns, natural watershed management and existing water infrastructure, including a less power hungry aqueduct. And perhaps most importantly, it would include the cooperation of water supply agencies, flood control agencies and sanitation agencies, which he believes have done too much conflicting, single-purpose cost-benefit analyses in the past. Lipkis sees only an upside to a large-scale cistern and rainwater infiltration project, and not only because of the environmental benefits. A study in the late 1990s conducted by TreePeople estimated up to 50,000 new jobs that would be created by a sustainable infrastructure system. ""Why would we invest billions of dollars on old infrastructure we know doesn't work anymore?"" he asks. ""It's very important to start putting this new alternative on the table.""","Water supply problem in the West has turned into a crisis .
Rainwater represents half of all the water that Los Angeles needs .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester City's transfer window spending neared the £90 milliion ($139 million) mark after completing the signing of Serbian international left-back Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio. The 24-year-old has been granted a work permit and the formalities of the reported £19 million ($29.32 million) deal with the Serie A club were completed after he passed a medical Saturday. The Kolarov deal has increased speculation that England international left-back Wayne Bridge will now move to Liverpool. But Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has denied Bridge will be leaving Eastlands. ""I want two top-class players for each position,"" the Italian told their official website. ""I first saw Kolarov in his Lazio debut back in 2007. I have watched him a lot since then and so have the Manchester City scouts. ""His attacking capability is very good.

"CNN -- When Apple launched its App Store last summer, few imagined it would reach today's numbers so quickly, if ever. Auto-apps could become the next way to customize your ride. The store now hosts over 85,000 titles and has passed 2 billion downloads. Even Apple is surprised. Now the concept of the app store has spread like a virus among competitors. It's also reached seemingly unrelated industries, like automobiles and TV set-top boxes. The App Store taps the creative energy of entrepreneurial developers. Whether they're big or small, they can make money through it, even though the challenges for them can be considerable. For consumers, the App Store offers third-party applications (free or charged ) that can be downloaded or synched onto an iPhone or iPod Touch. Apple takes 30 percent of a paid app's revenue and charges developers an annual fee to use the iPhone software development kit and upload apps to the store. But the rest goes to developers, some of whom have profited handsomely from their creations. Many companies now offer something similar to the App Store, if not in whole then in part. Even if none has yet come close to Apple's numbers -- or, arguably, its design achievements -- the spread of the app store idea is undeniable. ""It seems like every company remotely related to technology is embracing the app store craze,"" notes IT expert Tony Bradley in a blog post for PC World. Handset makers now offering software stores include Palm, Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion. On the platform side, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows Mobile -- competitors to the iPhone OS -- each have an app store now. Nintendo and Sony, the traditional powers in gaming gadgets, have also launched app stores, for their DSi and PSP handhelds, respectively. Apple is now their competitor thanks to all the iPhone games. The chipmaker Intel announced last month that it's setting up multiple app stores through partners like Acer and Asus to encourage independent developers to create apps for netbooks and handhelds based on its processors. For Twitter, a startup called Oneforty is trying to position itself as the unofficial ""app store"" for tie-in services. Cellular operators, wary of becoming ""dumb pipes,"" aren't sitting idly by. Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, and others getting in on the action with their own app stores. Not every company is a natural fit for creating app stores, so another market is forming for firms that help set them up. A firm called GetJar has helped Sony Ericsson and the cellular carriers Optimus (in Portugal) and 3 (in the UK) with app stores. Amdocs and Comverse, which already provide various services to carriers, have added ""app store provider"" to their offerings. Other firms are helping developers deal with the sudden rash of app stores. A California startup called GoldSpot Media recently launched miApp, designed to let developers ""design once, deploy in any app store."" Of course they weren't thinking about app stores outside the mobile space when they wrote that tagline. From hand-held to real-world . Few anticipated the app store meme spreading to cars, for instance, but Atlanta-based Hughes Telematics says it's helping automakers prepare app stores for drivers. For safety, some of these apps would use an audio-only interface for drivers, or be usable only by passengers or when parked, notes Kevin Link, a vice president with the company: ""Automotive applications must consider driver distraction, network security, and reliability within the vehicle."" But the possibilities are tantalizing and include taking pictures of a thief in action, playing catch-up audio clips of TV shows, deciphering that obscure Check Engine light, and remotely starting the engine or resetting the car alarm. Such apps could be accessed through home computers or smart phones, as well as from within the vehicle itself. Hughes Telematics can't reveal too many specifics about upcoming app stores because their rollouts depend on the schedules of the carmakers. And many details have yet to be worked out, notes Link, such as how revenues will be split with the developers. An app store of sorts will also be offered later this year by Roku, which sells a TV set-top box that connects to your broadband connection and brings online content to your living room. The box already lets customers order Netflix movies. With the upcoming app store, online content normally reserved for computers will be easily accessed over the TV. Possibilities include video and audio podcasts and photo-sharing destinations. As with the App Store, the idea is to let any developer (most likely a content owner in this case) offer their product through the platform. ""What an open platform does is create an opportunity for any content owner or content aggregator that has access to content, to make that content available for viewing on the TV,"" notes company spokesperson Brian Jaquet. Between six and 12 new apps, or channels, will be offered by the end of this year, he adds, and more will follow. Of course exactly what will follow is unclear because -- as with the other App Store-like offerings -- the only real limit is the imaginations of developers. Stay tuned.","Apple's 'Apps Store' has become hugely successful and mimicked by others .

"(CNN) -- Carole Dunham, 69, loved the ocean. Last July, she was diagnosed with cancer and had only a few months to live. Dunham knew her last footprint had to be a green one, and she started looking into eco-friendly alternatives to traditional burial. Carole Dunham, 69, had her remains memorialized on an offshore reef. The concept of ""going green"" has taken new life in the death care industry as eco-minded companies tap into the needs of those like Dunham. From biodegradable caskets to natural burial sites, death is becoming less of a dark matter than a green one. Dunham, an avid scuba diver, chose an eco-friendly company that would combine her cremated remains to form an artificial memorial reef. ""She loved the idea of always being in the water as an alternative to being cremated and scattered,"" said her daughter Nina Dunham. Dying is arguably the most natural phenomenon in the world, but modern death rituals -- embalming with formaldehyde-based solutions and traditional burial in concrete vaults -- are not nature-friendly, according to environmentalists. Along with its dead, the United States buries 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete, 827,060 tons of toxic embalming fluid, 90,000 tons of steel (from caskets), and 30 million tons of hardwood board each year, according to the Green Burial Council, an independent nonprofit organization based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. ""We can rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge with that amount of metal,"" said Joe Sehee, the council's executive director. ""The amount of concrete is enough to build a two-lane highway from New York to Detroit."" Sehee established a burgeoning network of death-care providers that have earned a green thumbs-up in the council's eco-certification program, the first of its kind in the industry. ""We want to reduce carbon emissions, waste and toxins in the death care industry and utilize burial to steward natural areas in the U.S.,"" said Sehee. Among the certified eco-providers is Eternal Reefs, based in Decatur, Georgia. ""We're the surf and turf of natural burial,"" said George Frankel, CEO of Eternal Reefs. The company takes the green movement to sea level by offering a living legacy in the form of underwater reefs used to create new marine habitats for fish and other sea life. The artificial reefs are cast from a mixture of environmentally safe cement and cremated remains. Eternal Reefs was the logical choice for Dunham, who died on November 3. ""She liked the idea of being a home for fish,"" said her daughter. This month, Dunham will travel to Florida to see her mother's reef lowered off the coast of North Miami Beach. Other families will join her, wearing shorts and T-shirts instead of dark suits and dresses. They will have a chance to decorate the reefs with flowers and other sea-friendly mementos. A brass plaque will help Dunham identify her mother's reef. She intends to visit the underwater memorial by scuba diving there in the future. ""These reefs will be covered up with sea life in a very short period of time, so they make a significant contribution,"" Frankel said. The reefs last about 500 years, and so far about 300 have been dropped off the coasts of Florida, South Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia. Another eco-provider certified by the Green Burial Council is UK-based Eco Coffins Ltd., which allows its customers to design their own 100 percent biodegradable coffins, made from 90 percent recycled grid honeycomb cardboard. The company says the coffins release 72 percent less carbon monoxide in the cremation process compared to a traditional coffin. ""We are appealing to customers to make the responsible choice,"" said Sophie Dansie, founder and director of Eco Coffins. ""The fact that standard chipboard is full of resins and formaldehyde, which is either released into the earth when buried or as emissions when burnt, is really unknown to the general public."" The vibrant coffins have even captured some attention in Hollywood. They have a cameo as props in the upcoming film ""Powder Blue."" An eco-friendly funeral can also help conserve land and protect it from development. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is working with the Green Burial Council to become the first state-park agency to offer cremation-based green burials. The funds raised from the services will be used to acquire new state park lands. ""We want burials to be more sustainable for the planet, more meaningful for the planet and economically viable for the provider,"" said Sehee. ""We don't want this to be a marketing gimmick that diminishes the social and ecological benefits of this concept,"" he emphasized. The death care industry, like others, has its share of green hype. While it might be a bit macabre for some, CoffinCouches.com sells eclectic couches made out of used coffins. Founder Vidal Herrera buys unwanted or slightly damaged coffins from funeral homes that would otherwise go to a landfill. From these discarded materials, Herrera designs artsy Goth couches you might see in a music video or a tattoo parlor. Herrera's clientele includes musicians, actors and others who can afford $3,500 for a couch. Hype or no hype, the decision is a personal one that ultimately rests with an individual or family. Sehee emphasizes that the Green Burial Council is careful not to diminish anyone's choices or make recommendations about the greenest way to go. ""There are shades of green and people can distinguish one shade from another,"" he said.","Eco-minded companies in death care industry offer ""green"" funerals .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department issued a report Wednesday sharply critical of China's human rights record, despite the Obama administration's decision to take a different approach to the Asian country. In India on Wednesday, Tibetans living in exile protest Chinese rule in Tibet. ""The government of China's human rights record remained poor and worsened in some areas,"" the report said in reviewing the last year, finding Chinese authorities ""committed extrajudicial killings and torture, coerced confessions of prisoners and used forced labor."" The ""2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,"" the annual report of human rights around the world, also accused China of ""severe cultural and religious repression"" of minorities in Tibet and other regions and increasing harassment and detention of dissidents and activists who signed a petition calling for respect of human rights. China limits the rights of citizens to privacy and freedom of speech, assembly, movement and association, the report said. It also noted that abuses peaked around high-profile events like last year's Olympic Games in Beijing. The critical report stands in sharp contrast to the lower-key approach Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took last week on her visit to Beijing. Clinton broached the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders, but drew criticism from human rights activists for downplaying the issue's importance in the overall relationship with China. ""Our pressing on those issues can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis,"" she told reporters traveling with her, adding, ""It is essential that the United States and China have a positive, cooperative relationship."" In the past, Clinton has been an outspoken, staunch critic of China's human rights stance. But officials have said privately that a new approach to dealing with China's human rights record, including less public criticism and more private discussions, may prove more productive in changing Chinese behavior. While not delving into U.S. human rights practices, the report acknowledged that the U.S. human rights record remains a concern around the world, and it said President Obama has vowed to apply global human rights ideals at home. ""The Department of State remains mindful of both domestic and international scrutiny of the United States' record,"" the report said. ""We and all other sovereign nations have international obligations to respect the universal human rights and freedoms of our citizens, and it is the responsibility of others to speak out when they believe those obligations are not being fulfilled.""","Report contrasts with lower-key approach Clinton took on her visit to Beijing .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing like images of infants and children in distress to make outsiders yearn to help, which is why the unfolding story of Haiti's orphans -- the most  helpless of earthquake victims -- has kept people riveted. But what can be done and what should be the focus of attention and efforts remains a mystery to many Americans, who are flooding the phone lines of organizations, seeking to adopt these children -- immediately. The offer to open arms, hearts and homes is no doubt well-intentioned, but several leading aid organizations recently said new adoptions should stop and not be rushed. They want to protect children wrongly identified as orphans from being moved out of the country or falling victim to child traffickers. To help people understand what is and what can be, here are the facts as they stand right now: . Understanding the numbers . In 2007, the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, estimated that there were 380,000 orphans in Haiti. But -- emphasis on ""but"" -- that number is rough at best, said Christopher de Bono, a UNICEF spokesman. The oversight of children in the system has been lousy in Haiti, de Bono said, and parents -- burdened by hardships -- have been known to leave their children in orphanages on a temporary basis. So determining who was truly orphaned before the earthquake was next to impossible. Despite the large number of orphans, as of last summer, Haiti had only about 100 licensed orphanages and 67 crèches (orphanages licensed to perform adoptions), according to the Haitian Adoption Authority, or IBESR. Orphanages generally have no more than 150 children, according to adoption officials in the United States. This means most kids described as orphans in Haiti have not been housed in licensed establishments. Add to this the recent chaos and inevitable loss of documentation, and nailing down an accurate number of orphans becomes even more difficult. Since the 7.0 earthquake struck two weeks ago, 497 Haitian orphans have been evacuated to the United States, according to Tuesday's figure from a U.S. State Department official. These were children confirmed to be orphans and already far along in the adoption process with identified families waiting for them. In total, 500 orphans had been issued travel documents to go to the United States, said Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that works to raise awareness about children worldwide in need of homes. Strottman estimates more than 900 orphans -- including more than 400 who don't yet have travel documents -- were in the process of being adopted from Haiti and placed in American homes. The actual match between family and child, she says, happens early in the two- to three-year adoption process, which is why this limbo stage is so painful for families who cling to photos of a child they've already grown to love. Should doors open to more children? Late last week, three aid groups -- Save the Children, World Vision and a unit of the British Red Cross -- issued a joint statement, asking for an immediate halt to any new adoptions of Haitian children. The crux of their argument was that hasty adoptions could break up families that may still have a chance of coming together again. Rather than whisk these children off to a foreign land, which might create a new set of problems for already traumatized young ones, these organizations, as well as many advocates in the adoption field, said the children should be cared for where they are -- provided with food, shelter, clothing and medical care -- and given the chance to reunite with family members who may be frantically searching for them. It's better to give to the organizations that are on the ground, looking out for the welfare of kids, they say. UNICEF released a statement last week echoing this stance and saying that efforts to register unaccompanied children are under way. ""Every effort will be made to reunite children with their families. Only if that proves impossible, and after proper screening has been carried out, should permanent alternatives like adoption be considered by the relevant authorities,"" said Ann Veneman, UNICEF's executive director. ""Screening for international adoption for some Haitian children had been completed prior to the earthquake. Where this is the case, there are clear benefits to speeding up their travel to their new homes."" Added to the concern for these children are fears of increased trafficking and sexual exploitation. Before the earthquake, UNICEF estimated that as many as 2,000 Haitian children were being trafficked annually to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, often with the consent of parents. These worries, and the desire to rejoin children with their loving family members, are not lost on U.S. lawmakers who came out Tuesday in support of a more efficient adoption process for Haiti. No one wants to tear children from the waiting arms of family members, nor do they want to place kids in danger. But for those who are ""true orphans,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, and other senators from both parties, are throwing their political weight behind the issue. They say it's time to cut through the red tape that slows down the adoption process and drags it on for years -- for the sake of verified orphans living in Haiti, but also for those who span the globe and will still need loving homes after the media coverage surrounding Haiti's earthquake dies down. These lawmakers are pushing this week to get the Families for Orphans Act out of a Senate committee and onto the floor for a vote. The bill would create an office in the State Department to specifically handle adoption issues and look out for the best interests of the world's most vulnerable children. The stance of the Haitian authorities, though, appears unbending. ""The Haitian government is very clear on this,"" said Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lessgue, the communications minister. ""We are facilitating all of the adoption applications already submitted. Other than those, no child will be leaving the country for adoption.""","Images of Haitian infants and children in distress keep world watching and worried .

"(CNN) -- No one teaches reporters how to cover a war, much less wars that include genocide. Most of us rely on the wisdom of experienced colleagues and a lot of on-the-job training. CNN's Christiane Amanpour in a Sarajevo cemetery; she returned to Bosnia for ""Scream Bloody Murder."" My first war assignment -- Bosnia, in the 1990s -- included visits to the Sarajevo morgue to see the bodies. How else would a journalist know exactly how many Muslim children were cut down by Bosnian Serb snipers? How else could we put names to civilians left faceless by mortar shells from the surrounding hills? I learned what it means to bear witness. I found my voice and my mission in Bosnia. I learned to seek the facts, to tell the truth no matter how difficult or unpopular. I learned that objectivity meant covering all sides and giving all sides their hearing, but never to draw a false moral equivalence when none exists. I learned never to equate victims with their aggressors. I learned that there are limits to the style of journalism that goes: ""On the one hand, on the other hand."" Most of all, I learned that as reporters our words and our actions have consequences and that we must use this powerful platform, television, responsibly. But how many times have people asked me, when I've come back from a place like Bosnia or Rwanda: Is it really that bad? I have found that many people want to believe that I am exaggerating. I guess they do not want to believe such evil can exist. Or perhaps they just do not want to be pushed into that moral space where they would have to take a stand and do something. Genocide is hard to imagine -- despite all we know about the Holocaust. Or perhaps, ironically, as a result of it being the most documented event in modern history. Many people now believe that if the extermination is not done on the Nazis' industrial scale or is less than complete, it is not genocide. They are wrong. Genocide is mass murder with the intent to wipe out a significant part of an ethnic, religious or national group. It means killing people not because of what they did, but because of who they are. It is the world's most heinous crime. And it continues, despite an international treaty written 60 years ago this month. With a unanimous vote on December 9, 1948, the fledgling United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. The signatories committed themselves to act, although the convention does not say what intervention is required. And sure enough, instead of using the convention as a springboard to action, political leaders in the ensuing years have invoked reason after reason not to stop the bloodshed. If there is any hopeful sign, it is in the voices of people with the emotional and intellectual courage to stand up and scream bloody murder -- often at personal or professional risk. Some are members of the political establishment who believe that doing the right thing is also the pragmatic thing to do. Others are ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. What makes them do it? Over the course of filming a two-hour documentary, I found a few common threads. Unlike politicians who make policy from the detachment of their national capitals, these men and women have been on the front lines. Like Father François Ponchaud, a French missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, they have seen the victims' suffering first hand. Like Peter Galbraith, an idealistic staff member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee who wanted the U.S. to punish Saddam Hussein for using chemical weapons against the Kurds, they are convinced that the accounts of refugees are true. And like Richard Holbrooke, a U.S. diplomat whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Hitler came to power, they see where action -- sometimes military action -- can make a difference. None considered himself a hero. And some, like Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who led a U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, believe they did not do enough. Dallaire was one of those good men who put on a uniform and felt that it meant something, that he was actually there to make a difference. Unfortunately, he was sent to Rwanda with an impossible mandate and without the backing of the international community. He was helpless to stop the slaughter of 800,000 to 1 million ethnic Tutsis at the hands of their Hutu countrymen. Imagine if that had happened to you or me? How would we be able to live with ourselves? iReport.com: Have a question for Amanpour? Send it in . In any single crisis, I can understand that political leaders are under pressure not to intervene. But stepping back to look at the consistent pattern, one must ask: Is it acceptable? In the 1970s, the Carter administration touted human rights as a core value in U.S. foreign policy, but knew that military intervention against the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia was politically inconceivable after the disastrous war in Vietnam. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration was courting Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. exports when Saddam Hussein was gassing the Kurds; a punishing trade embargo would have destroyed the budding relationship. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration would not take military action against the Bosnian Serbs without backing from the European allies.  Watch Bosnia's president discuss the 1991 U.N. arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia » . And some U.S. officials even avoided characterizing the slaughter in Rwanda in 1994 as genocide lest it lead to a call for action under the U.N. Genocide Convention.  Military force: The last resort? Or the first resort? » . But three years into the Bosnian war -- after the massacre at Srebrenica -- the U.S. finally forged a coalition of previously reluctant allies to bomb the Bosnian Serb military positions. They stopped the war, then led the peace process and the peace enforcement that has survived to this day. And because we the press, the storytellers, finally made it impossible for our Western democratic governments to tolerate mass murder of men, women and children in the age of 24/7 satellite TV, 3½ years later, the U.S. led its allies in a pre-emptive strike against genocide in Kosovo. NATO, established to protect the West during the Cold War, had launched its largest military strike -- for a purely humanitarian mission. And today, there is a grassroots American movement that has brought the genocide in Darfur to such prominence. We're always told that evil happens when good men do nothing. And the question -- my question as a reporter and as a witness to history is: Will we ever learn? Or will I or my children or my successors be reporting on this same kind of atrocity and inhumanity for years and years to come? This is what I don't understand about the human race. So thank goodness for the few good men and women who summon the courage to do something in the face of evil, to stand up and confront it. They give me hope.","CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled the globe for documentary on genocide .

"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (CNN) -- Richard Holbrooke first visited Bosnia in 1992 as a private citizen. Richard Holbrooke's 'bombs for peace' policy was vindicated when bombings brought an end to the war. Three years later, he would become one of the most influential U.S. figures working to end a war that had introduced a new euphemism for genocide: ethnic cleansing. Holbrooke, who had worked as a diplomat, journalist and investment banker, was intrigued, disgusted and challenged by what he saw in the early days of the war in Bosnia. A month before his first visit, reporters had learned of Bosnian Serb concentration camps where Muslim prisoners were tortured, sexually mutilated and executed. The news photographs and footage seemed like an echo of the Holocaust. In the ethnically mixed capital, Sarajevo, Holbrooke saw Bosnian Serb forces laying siege to the city to drive out Muslims. U.N. peacekeepers even had to negotiate with the aggressors just to truck food into the starving city. In Banja Luka, Holbrooke saw Muslim families being forced to sign over their property to Bosnian Serbs -- Orthodox Christians -- in exchange for their lives and a one-way bus ticket out of town. Returning with CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour in 2008, Holbrooke remembered feeling the connection with his own family history: His Jewish grandfather fled Germany shortly after Hitler took power. ""I thought I'm seeing a color remake of the black and white scenes we'd seen in World War II of Jews signing away their property at the point of a gun and then being shipped off to who knows where,"" Holbrooke said. ""I don't think you have to be Jewish to understand that what you're seeing was a genuine crime against humanity. The Europeans were doing nothing, and the Americans were doing less.""  Watch as Holbrooke talks with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the scene of the crime » . Holbrooke thought only a U.S.-led intervention would stop the slaughter. ""The [Bosnian] Serbs would have melted away because they were thugs and bullies,"" he said. But the White House was vowing to stay out. ""The United States is not going to inject itself into every single crisis, no matter how heart-rending,"" then-President George H.W. Bush said. Holbrooke, who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state, offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign: Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs. ""I took a stand that I believed was correct,"" Holbrooke said. ""I didn't think it was so controversial."" When Clinton embraced a get-tough policy, Holbrooke was optimistic. In the back of Holbrooke's mind, there was a lingering question: ""Will he do as president what he said he would do as a candidate?""  Watch Clinton's campaign pledge » . Holbrooke wanted to handle Bosnia for the Clinton administration. But after the election, Holbrooke -- the consummate insider -- found himself on the outside. Instead of getting the Bosnia portfolio, he was named U.S. ambassador to Germany. ""By advocating vigorous action [in Bosnia], I was kind of marginalized by people inside the government who were less in favor of vigorous action,"" he told Amanpour. America's European allies opposed airstrikes, fearing retaliation against their peacekeepers on the ground. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, told CNN that the Europeans ""were, to put it mildly, extremely reluctant to see us pursue unilaterally any actions which could imperil their troops."" Lake said the president's hands were tied. ""We tried to convince them. And the Europeans said, 'Absolutely no.'"" Over the course of the next year, Clinton was able to persuade his European allies to at least use limited air strikes against the Bosnia Serbs. But it didn't stop the killing. Under mounting criticism in the press, Clinton asked Holbrooke in May 1994 to leave his post in Germany and return to the White House to help with Bosnia. But Holbrooke and others in the administration who advocated force would nonetheless see Bosnia's Muslims endure another 15 months of heartbreak and death -- including the slaughter of 8,000 at Srebrenica.  Watch as a Bosnian concentration camp survivor describes the torture and rape she witnessed » . The massacre shook the world's conscience -- and Clinton's foreign policy. He was now ready to lead, with or without approval from other nations. ""What I said to the Europeans was, 'We're going to do this. And it'll work best if you come with us,'"" Lake recalled. After a Serb mortar attack on a Sarajevo market in August 1995, Clinton pulled the trigger. With the Europeans on board, U.S. and allied planes began attacking Bosnian Serb positions. After eight weeks of NATO bombing, Holbrooke got enough concessions to negotiate an end to 3 ½ years of war. It was vindication for a policy Holbrooke calls ""bombs for peace."" ""I don't like to advocate the use of force, [because] I know people will get killed,"" Holbrooke said. ""But there are times when you have to use force in order to stop people from being killed in larger numbers, and it seemed to me this was a clear-cut example.""","Richard Holbrooke first went to Bosnia in 1992 in the early days of the war .

"(CNN) -- A woman who claims polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs forced her as a 14-year-old to marry her 19-year-old cousin said she is not giving up, despite the Utah Supreme Court's overturning Jeffs' convictions and ordering a new trial. ""This is not the end, and I by no means am backing down,"" Elissa Wall said after the ruling at a news conference, portions of which were posted on the website of CNN affiliate KSL-TV. Jeffs, the ""prophet"" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or FLDS, was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted on two counts of rape as an accomplice in September 2007. He was accused of using his influence to force Wall to marry her cousin Allen Steed in 2001. The Utah Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the jury instructions in Jeffs' 2007 trial were flawed. The first count of rape as an accomplice against Jeffs was alleged to have occurred shortly after Wall and Steed were married, when the two first had sex, the Utah Supreme Court opinion said. The second was alleged to have occurred after Jeffs refused to ""release"" Wall from her marriage and told her to ""give herself to [Steed] ... mind, body and soul."" Prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual, the opinion said. Under those portions, the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct, the victim must be younger than 18, and ""the actor"" must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim. ""Jeffs argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on Jeffs' actions and position of special trust, rather than on Steed's, for the purpose of determining whether Wall consented,"" the opinion said. The justices agreed, saying in the unanimous ruling that the jurors should have been asked to consider whether Steed was in a position of special trust and whether Steed lured or induced Wall into having sex. ""The state interprets the term 'actor' to mean the 'defendant,' "" the opinion said. ""We conclude that the state's interpretation is erroneous."" Also, the jurors should have been instructed that in order to convict, they must find that Jeffs intended that Steed would sexually assault Wall as a result of his conduct. Wall told ""In Session"" on Tuesday night that she was in ""disbelief"" after hearing that the convictions were overturned. ""What I know is this: I would never have married my first husband unless Warren wanted it,"" she said. ""I would never had had unwanted sex with my first husband unless Warren demanded it. The jury understood that."" She told KSL-TV that she has no regrets about her testimony in the case. ""If I had to do this again, I wouldn't change a thing, because I stood up for what I believe in,"" Wall said Tuesday. She is now 24 and has remarried and left the FLDS. Her attorneys made her name public after the Jeffs trial, with her consent. According to KSL, she is in a witness protection program. She said she feared retribution for her testimony against Jeffs. ""He controlled thousands of people in fear for many, many years,"" she said, and ""many abominable sins and many things ... have occurred to thousands of people because of his influence."" The justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial. Defense attorney Wally Bugden said Tuesday that he expects the Washington County, Utah, district attorney to decide quickly on whether Jeffs will be retried. Brian Filter, senior deputy attorney for Washington County, said Wednesday that the district attorney's office is still analyzing the Supreme Court's ruling and consulting with the victim and others involved in the case before deciding to retry Jeffs. Jeffs will be transferred, however, from the Utah State Prison just south of Salt Lake City to Washington County in southern Utah -- closer to the FLDS communities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, Bugden said. Bugden said Tuesday that he will be requesting bail for Jeffs when a hearing is held in the lower court. But Jeffs remains under federal indictment for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in 2006. Federal detainers remain in place, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. If Jeffs is not held on state charges, he will be taken into federal custody, she said. However, Jeffs' biggest legal challenge still awaits him. He is awaiting trial in Texas, where he was indicted in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child. The indictment accuses him of assaulting a child ""younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant"" in January 2005. If convicted on those charges, he could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison. An extradition hearing on the Texas matter was canceled Tuesday after the Utah Supreme Court ruling. But the Texas attorney general's office began new proceedings Wednesday to extradite Jeffs, spokesman Jerry Strickland told The Dallas Morning News. Jeffs had been awaiting trial in Arizona on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor. But last month, a judge dismissed those charges. The Mohave County, Arizona, prosecutor, had asked the court to throw out the charges, citing ""much more serious charges"" against Jeffs in Texas and the desire of his alleged victims that he ""face these more serious charges as soon as possible."" The FLDS drew national attention when Jeffs was arrested during a routine traffic stop in August 2006. At the time, he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. The FLDS is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church, which renounced polygamy a century ago. FLDS members openly practice polygamy at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado,Texas, and the two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place. Jeffs had led the sect since his father's death in 2002. CNN's Ashley Hayes and ""In Session's"" Beth Karas contributed to this report.","Elissa Wall says she ""wouldn't change a thing""

"(CNN) -- Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, Slobodan Milosevic. They are household names, infamous for masterminding genocide. But who were the foot soldiers who did the dirty work? Recently discovered photos show Nazi officers relaxing at a retreat near Auschwitz. In many cases they were equally notorious in their communities because they were the friends, neighbors and co-workers of those they raped, slaughtered and buried alive. Nusreta Sivac watched ordinary people become killers while imprisoned in a concentration camp in Bosnia. She saw prisoners beaten beyond recognition and watched camp guards force a Muslim prisoner to rape a Muslim woman in front of everyone. She was shocked to see people she knew running the camp. ""They acted as if they had never seen me before,"" she said. ""It was difficult for me to understand how people could turn into beasts overnight.""  Watch as Nusreta tells her story » . While some perpetrators participate unwillingly -- they are forced to kill or face death themselves -- many ordinary people are manipulated into participating in the killing machine voluntarily. Researchers say most perpetrators of genocide were not destined for murder and had never killed before. ""You don't have to be mentally ill or even innately evil or criminal. You can be ordinary, no better or worse than you or me, and commit killing or genocide,"" said Harvard psychiatrist Robert Lifton, who has studied Nazi doctors. ""The truth is that we all have the possibility for genocidal behavior."" Experts have reached a troubling conclusion: It was actually very easy for the architects of genocide to find more than enough ordinary people to do the killing. Genocide is often the result of a ""perfect storm."" A country reeling from political and economic turmoil, a fanatical leader promising to make things better and a vulnerable population targeted for blame -- all combine in a blueprint for mass murder. Architects of genocide use the same tools to execute their plan. Group identity . Millions have been killed for being religious, ethnic or simply educated. Group identity is one of the foundations of genocide. This allegiance makes it easier for extremist leaders to stoke age-old animosities between groups. ""We all divide the world into 'us' and 'them,' "" said psychologist Ervin Staub, author of ""The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence."" ""Some people are like 'us' because of nationality, religion, race, etc. Those that are not like 'us' are 'them.' "" ""Group identity intensifies during difficult times,"" Staub said. Jean-Bosco Bizimana, a Rwandan Hutu, slaughtered his Tutsi neighbors 14 years ago. Leaders of the genocide exploited the history of hatred between the Hutus and Tutsis to pit them against each other. But before the genocide, the two groups had overcome their hostility to live peacefully together. ""We were manipulated,"" Bizimana said. ""The government pushed us to kill. Before that, we intermarried, we helped each other in daily life and we shared everything. We ourselves can't even believe what happened."" Bizimana's wife said her husband, ""would go around with the mob, and to show them he was part of it, he would kill."" Perpetrators don't want to be seen as weak, and in a mob mentality, individual guilt seems to disappear. ""People will do almost anything in a group and will do anything not to be rejected,"" said psychologist Philip Zimbardo, a professor emeritus at Stanford and famous for his 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, which divided student volunteers into ""prisoners"" and ""guards"" and showed how easily people could be induced to commit sadistic acts. ""They give up a sense of personal accountability and diffuse responsibility to the leader."" Propaganda and dehumanization . Genocidal regimes use propaganda to incite hatred. During the genocide in Bosnia, for example, a fictitious news report said Muslims were feeding Serb children to animals at the Sarajevo zoo. When people feel threatened and endangered, they can be led to kill. ""Most genocides are shaped on [a perceived need for] self-defense,"" said Christopher Browning, a University of North Carolina history professor who studied a Nazi police battalion. Bizimana said Rwandan government radio broadcasts led him to kill. ""When instructions come from the government, we believed it was the right thing to do,"" he said. ""People tend to believe the world is a just place,"" psychologist Staub said. So the targeted group ""is seen as though they did something to deserve the suffering."" The propaganda machine portrays the victim group as less than human. In Rwanda, the Hutus called their Tutsi neighbors 'cockroaches.' In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge said their victims were ""worms."" To the Nazis, Jews were ""vermin."" Dehumanization is the most powerful psychological tool used in all mass murder and genocides, Zimbardo said. ""Dehumanization blurs your vision. You look at these people and you do not see them as human."" Instead, the enemy is treated as a germ -- as something to eradicate, or else face the threat of infection. ""Purification is at the heart of genocide,"" said Harvard's Lifton. ""In that purification ... [the killers] are healing."" Recently discovered photos show Nazi officers at a retreat near Auschwitz relaxing as though they are taking a break from a routine job, not an extermination factory. ""In order to carry out the function of killing, one must instill in that environment a sense of ordinariness,"" said Lifton.  Watch images of Nazis relaxing » . In the end, the masterminds of genocide see their visions play out: Foot soldiers carry out the mission and entire populations are displaced or killed. Perpetrators and victims don't realize what they're involved in until it's too late, said Ben Kiernan, director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University. ""It's a conspiracy, a silent secret plan to set up a situation whereby the victims, who are unsuspecting, are brought into a conflict with a large number of people, many of whom are also unsuspecting,"" Kiernan said. Looking back at their crimes, some perpetrators are now sorry for their actions, including Bizimana. ""What we did to them in the past was very bad,"" he said. ""Deep in my heart, I regret it."" Bizimana has since reconciled with his surviving Tutsi neighbors, and is trying to build unity in his country. ""What happened,"" he vows, ""will never happen again.""","Genocide's foot soldiers were neighbors of those they tortured and killed .
Many ordinary people are manipulated into participating, researchers say .
Architects of genocide use group identity, mob mentality to execute their plan .
Other tools include propaganda and dehumanization ."
"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN)  -- Francois Ponchaud was a newly ordained Catholic priest when he arrived in Cambodia in 1965 from a small village in France. Francois Ponchaud said refugees' accounts of the genocide ""went beyond my wildest imagination."" He was sent to do missionary work. But within a decade he would become a crusader against the worst genocide since the Holocaust. ""I was staying by the Cambodian people's side,"" Ponchaud said, ""through the good and the sadness and the suffering."" When he arrived at age 26, Cambodia was a peaceful place: a bucolic land of villages, peasants, rice paddies and Buddhist monks. Ponchaud studied Cambodian history and Buddhism, became fluent in Khmer, made friends and immersed himself in the culture -- falling in love with the country and its people. But the peacefulness was short-lived. By 1970, Cambodia was descending into chaos as the Vietnam War spilled across its borders. In the countryside, the Americans were carpet-bombing Vietcong outposts. In the capital, Phnom Penh, Washington was propping up a corrupt government. From the jungles, a sinister and brutal communist rebel group called the Khmer Rouge was fighting to overthrow Cambodia's U.S.-backed regime. On April 17, 1975, Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. They began to reinvent Cambodia according to an insane blueprint. They emptied the cities, including some 3 million in the capital, forcing all the residents into the countryside -- and toward a dark future. ""As of noon, all the people started leaving,"" Ponchaud said. ""Then I saw all my friends who were leaving. ... There were hundreds of thousands of people who were trudging along a few kilometers an hour. It was truly a staggering sight. Incredible.""  Watch Ponchaud describe the exodus from Phnom Penh » . Ponchaud was told to stay at the French Embassy, where thousands fleeing Phnom Penh desperately sought asylum. One of the few foreigners able to communicate with the Khmer Rouge, he spent days at the embassy gate, trying to negotiate.  Watch Ponchaud discuss the significance of the embassy gate » . In the weeks that followed, the Khmer Rouge let him leave the embassy twice. Both times he searched for clues about what was happening in the country. But Phnom Penh was empty.  Read a reporter's notebook of his journey through Cambodia's killing fields » . Ponchaud was expelled from the city in the last evacuating convoy, as the Khmer Rouge forced all foreigners onto trucks and out of the country. At the border, Ponchaud broke down, weeping. ""It was as though we had gone mad,"" he said. ""We were getting out of a country of the living dead."" With the country sealed, the Khmer Rouge went about creating their new Cambodia -- and the killing began in earnest. The Khmer Rouge envisioned a return to Cambodia's medieval greatness -- a ""pure"" nation full of noble peasant farmers. For that, though, they had to purge everyone else: the rich, the religious, the educated, anyone from a different ethnic group. ""All those who were opposed to the government were killed,"" Ponchaud said. ""And all those who didn't work quite hard enough were killed."" Hundreds of thousands were worked -- or starved -- to death. ""Perhaps a good chunk -- a solid half -- died from sickness and lack of health care,"" he said. By September 1975, Ponchaud was back in France and ready to resume his work. His missionary society in Paris asked him to keep track of events in Cambodia. He quickly became the ""go-to"" person for Cambodian refugees arriving from Thailand, and he began documenting their stories. At first, Ponchaud had a hard time believing the accounts of execution, torture, deportation, forced labor and starvation. Read how a Khmer Rouge survivor is documenting the genocide . ""They were burning villages ... sending people into the forest without giving them anything to eat,"" Ponchaud said. ""It went beyond my wildest imagination."" Horrified, Ponchaud devised a plan to gather more information: A friend living on the Cambodian border would record and send him broadcasts from Radio Phnom Penh -- the official voice of the Khmer Rouge -- in which the government described its transformation of the country. Read a former Khmer Rouge member's account of the killings . Ponchaud found that the broadcasts substantiated the refugees' claims. As unbelievable as those claims were, the broadcasts told of the same policies. What the refugees were saying was true. ""I decoded the radio -- the official declarations. And then the refugees would give me the 'experienced' side. It matched up,"" he said. ""On one hand, the ideology, and on the other, the lived experience.""   Watch Ponchaud describe how he was able to decode the Khmer Rouge ideology » . For months, Ponchaud gathered and documented information, repeatedly denouncing the Khmer Rouge. His testimonials appeared in the French press as early as October 1975. He also wrote to the president of France and Amnesty International, and appeared before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.  Watch Ponchaud discuss his efforts to alert people to the genocide » . In 1976, angered by inaccuracies in Le Monde's reporting on the Khmer Rouge, Ponchaud fired off a letter to the newspaper's editor -- along with a dossier of refugee accounts and radio transmissions. He was contacted immediately and asked to write for the newspaper. His articles were published in February 1976.  Watch Ponchaud tell the Le Monde story » . Though few accounts of Cambodia's nightmare were appearing in the press, the U.S. government was receiving frequent briefings about what was happening there. In a meeting in November 1975, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger acknowledged the brutality of the Khmer Rouge. But he also knew that they shared an enemy with the U.S. -- Vietnam. ""Tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them,"" Kissinger told an official in the region, according to a declassified State Department account. The Khmer Rouge ""are murderous thugs,"" he said, ""but we won't let that stand in our way."" Read Kissinger's words in the declassified State Department document (pdf) By 1977, the Khmer Rouge had been in power for two years, and much of the world remained unaware or uninterested. Many who did hear accounts of Khmer Rouge brutality found them hard to believe. Even prominent liberals and intellectuals doubted that a supposedly egalitarian peasant movement would perpetrate such horrors on their own people. Ponchaud then published a startling book called ""Year Zero."" It was one of the first to expose the brutal totalitarian regime of the Khmer Rouge to the world. Still, no help came for Cambodia. ""I was pretty frustrated,"" he said. ""The governments did not react. You know, countries don't defend human rights. They are always subservient to politics."" In January 1977, the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter promised a change. Carter vowed to put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy. But it would take 15 months for him to publicly condemn the Khmer Rouge as the world's ""worst violator of human rights."" Even then he took no action to stop the slaughter. Invasion, he said, was not an option for a country still recovering from the Vietnam War. Instead, in December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia after years of cross-border skirmishes. The Vietnamese quickly overthrew the Khmer Rouge, who fled back into the jungle. The world would finally start to see that all Ponchaud had said was true. More than 2 million Cambodians were dead. The scope of the catastrophe quickly became clear. In the fall of 1979, Carter responded, raising $32 million to help the refugees. Today, Ponchaud is back in Cambodia, continuing his efforts for the Cambodian people, building schools, holding Mass and working on local projects. Often referred to as ""the friend of the Cambodians,"" he is considered an expert on the country. But this time he has no illusions. ""No one defends human rights,"" he said. ""Governments are cold beasts looking out for their own interests.""","Francois Ponchaud was sent to do missionary work in Cambodia in 1965 .

"HELSTON, England (CNN)  -- A huge cyclone struck Myanmar in May 2008. It was the largest recorded disaster in that country, killing more than 130,000 people and leaving millions homeless. Since 2001, Tom Henderson's organization, ShelterBox, has supplied aid to more than 600,000 people. ""We were one of the first aid agencies into the country, delivering our ShelterBoxes,"" says Tom Henderson, whose relief package and organization of the same name has aided more than 600,000 victims of disasters of all scales worldwide since 2001. Designed to help an extended family survive for a minimum of six months, the lightweight, weatherproof box contains items such as a 10-person tent, blankets, basic tools, water-purification tablets and containers, a multi-fuel or wood-burning stove, mosquito nets and other items tailored to the particular region in crisis. The ""ShelterBox is designed to be small enough so two people can carry it -- but it has to be large enough to get equipment in for 10 people,"" Henderson explains. ""It's a simple package of aid delivered to the most needy people in the shortest amount of time."" The ex-Royal Navy search-and-rescue diver says the idea behind the ShelterBox came to him ""literally in a heartbeat"" while watching the news in 1999. Henderson was struck by the footage he saw of relief workers dropping food on the ground to victims of a disaster. ""I decided there and then that I would try to make a difference in a more sensible and dignified way,"" he recalls. ""I went to my study and I got a piece of paper out, and I wrote down 'shelter,' 'warm,' 'comfort,' and 'dignity.' And that's where it started."" Though Henderson says people thought he was crazy, he searched around the world for the products he knew would work. In 2000, he brought his idea to the local Helston-Lizard Rotary Club, where members adopted the cause. In January 2001, the first 143 ShelterBoxes were flown to earthquake-ravaged Gujarat, India. Since then, the ShelterBox organization has responded to more than 70 disasters in 46 countries. ""If people have lost everything why should they lose their dignity as well?"" asks Henderson. ""So we were very keen, as well as delivering aid, to give people back their dignity, put them back in control.""  Watch how ShelterBox helps victims of disasters around the world » . The secret of its success is two-fold, explains Henderson. ShelterBox is nonpolitical, accepting no funding from government agencies, and is a worldwide network with communication hubs near every potential disaster site via Rotary International. This allows ShelterBox to respond within 72 hours of a disaster anywhere in the world, subject to customs and local political barriers. According to ShelterBox, each box costs £490 in the United Kingdom and $1,000 in the United States, including all materials, packing, storage and distribution to recipients around the world. Donations from the British public and money raised from Rotary Clubs worldwide help fund the boxes. Watch Henderson reveal the items in a typical ShelterBox » . ""Nobody can buy our boxes, they are only available for free,"" says Henderson. Although Henderson does not travel to drop off boxes or choose where they go, he says he remains motivated by the thought of the millions of people that need help every day, and that if ShelterBox stops delivering aid, people might not survive. Watch Henderson tell the story of a mother and her baby in a ShelterBox » . ""The goal for me was these people,"" he says. ""I had pictures in my mind's eye... [like] children dying in the snow after a disaster. We want this to last for years to come, not just to get them through this disaster, [but] as a springboard for moving forward."" Stories that Henderson hears from the field remind him that ShelterBox is doing just that. Recently, a woman in Kenya gave birth to a baby girl in a ShelterBox tent. ""The ShelterBox became a crib for the baby. And the blankets became blankets for the baby,"" says Henderson. ""It's a huge feeling of pride and satisfaction when these sorts of things happen.""","Tom Henderson's organization, ShelterBox, helps disaster victims worldwide .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's president has offered asylum to an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning, state-run media reported Saturday. President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva was quoted by Brazil's official state news agency EBC as saying ""I want to make an appeal to my friend Ahmadinejad ... and to the government of Iran to allow Brazil to take in the woman."" Brazil recently participated in talks with Iran aimed at restarting negotiations about Iran's nuclear program. In May, Brazil helped broker a deal with Iran that would provide Tehran with enriched uranium for medical research. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and was originally sentenced to death by stoning. Iranian authorities say the sentence has been put on hold, but there have been no reports as to whether a new sentence has been imposed. The 43-year-old mother of two is reportedly still being held held in Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by another means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN earlier this month that his client confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. He said she later recanted the confession and denied any wrongdoing. Mostafaei has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say. Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities. A letter believed to be written by Mostafaei was posted on the Internet on Saturday, calling for the release of his relatives. The lawyer says he has cooperated with interrogators, and says his wife and brother-in-law are victims of of ""hostage taking."" Mostafaei said he and his family are innocent of any wrongdoing. The Guardian newspaper previously reported that Mostafaei's wife was arrested when they were unable to find him.

"(CNN) -- The number of babies born in the United States dropped 2.6 percent last year, according to a recent study, the latest in a long list of falling indicators. The birth rate, which takes into account changes in the population, fell to 13.5 births for every 1,000 people last year, from 13.9 births in 2008, and 14.3 births in 2007, according to a new report from the National Center for Health Statistics. The news is not surprising, said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, given the sad state of the American economy right now. ""The birth rate is falling because of the Great Recession. When people are unsure of their financial future, they tend to postpone having children,"" Cherlin told CNN. ""It's stronger now than in the last couple of recessions because this is a stronger recession,"" he added. The U.S. birth rate has been declining since the start of the economic downturn in late 2007. When the economy picks up, so should births, said Cherlin, though he stressed it will take time for people to feel secure again. Some of the women postponing having children now will have them later, Cherlin said, while others never will. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, roughly 20 percent of women never had children -- a percentage that Cherlin predicts the United States will hit again. The number of actual babies born in the United States dropped to 4,136,000 in 2009, from 4,247,000 in 2008, the statistics center said. ""I think it's likely to be a few years before this turns around,"" said Cherlin.","The U.S. birth rate fell 2.6 percent last year, according to the National Center for Health Statistics .

"(CNN) -- Considered one of modern Africa's founding fathers, Zambia's first President Kenneth Kaunda has spent much of his life fighting some of Africa's toughest battles. From his struggles against the racism and oppression of colonial rule in the 1950s to the fight against AIDS today, it's been an eventful life for Zambia's former leader. Kaunda's rise to prominence started in the early 1950s, a time of growing political unrest in the region. Independence movements across Africa were gaining momentum and activists, becoming ever more defiant, were demanding the end of colonialism and the right to self government. In Northern Rhodesia -- soon to become Zambia -- Kaunda was in the midst of the struggles, fighting against a repressive and racist regime, he explained to CNN. ""We were going to defy unjust laws, conditions of slavery more or less...There was segregation of the worst form."" He continued: ""Schools for whites, schools for blacks, hospitals for whites, few hospitals for blacks. And so it went on. Everywhere there was racial discrimination."" But his fight for independence was not without consequence and in 1959 Kaunda was arrested and jailed for ten months. For Kaunda, prison was an inevitable part of the fight for freedom. ""I think I succeeded in the end but it meant going into prison defying unjust laws, being arrested by the police, beaten up, thrown into prison,"" he said. ""You come out and you still continue and we did this and in the end thank God we succeeded."" After his release in January 1960 Kaunda became leader of the newly formed United National Independence Party (UNIP) and in 1964 after elections and much political wrangling, Zambia was finally granted independence from the British with Kaunda as its president. It was a presidency which was to last 27 years, but under one party rule. A decision highly criticized, with many accusing Kaunda of presiding over a dictatorship. But Kaunda has remained defiant about his decision to form a one-party state, telling CNN: ""My colleagues and I decided we're going to go into one party. The reason for that, there was no way, no way at all in which we could have fought and defeated colonialism all around us, with so many parties in Zambia at that time. No way at all. He continued: ""No, I have never been a dictator. It was a bargain with the people. But even then I knew it was not the best thing to do. But in that situation it was the only way out."" In 1990 Kaunda finally legalized opposition parties setting the stage for free, multi-party elections, which took place in 1991. The elections saw the end of Kaunda's leadership with Frederick Chiluba from the Movement for Multiparty Democracy coming to power. Now, after 20 years away from the political spotlight, Kaunda is still campaigning. His major battle today is the fight against HIV/AIDS, a disease running rampant throughout his country, affecting one in eight Zambians. It's a cause close to the former leader's heart and one which has affected him personally. ""My own child, one of them, died of Aids. A brilliant boy,"" Kaunda told CNN. ""He died of AIDS but that's not the reason why I am fighting AIDS. I fight AIDS because it's a killer disease, destroys the human race in all fields."" It's this constant will to fight that leaves Kaunda positive about the future of his country and Africa. This despite the many challenges ahead. ""I'm very hopeful that things will come right,"" he said to CNN. ""Because you see there was a time when a leader went wrong and they became an oppressor...but today things have begun to change. ""The struggle, the condemnation is quite often within the continent of Africa. It's a good beginning towards a realization of what, democracy is right in this world, east, west, north, south. So I'm confident that we have begun to grow."" Susannah Palk contributed to this report .","Kenneth Kaunda became Zambia's first President after independence in 1964 .

"(CNN) -- The man known for one of the most partisan practices in American politics had once quit government for a time because of partisanship. Elbridge Gerry was once an accomplished statesman devoted to his country, but nearly 200 years after his death, his legacy is overshadowed by the tactic that bears his name. It's called ""gerrymandering,"" and it means redrawing congressional districts, often in odd shapes, for the sake of political gain. The term was coined after Gerry, as the Massachusetts governor, approved an obscure redistricting plan ahead of the 1812 elections that helped Republicans hold on to power in the legislature. The plan lumped many of the Federalists into one district, while giving his party, the Democrat-Republicans, the advantage in other districts. The Federal press ran a political cartoon calling attention to the salamander-like shape of one of the districts, and thus ""gerrymander"" was born into the political lexicon, according to his bio from the Senate Historical Office. Gerry's partisan tendencies didn't sit well with his state, and he lost his 1812 re-election bid. While Gerry is best remembered for being the namesake behind the redistricting tactic, there were high points in his political career. Gerry, whose name is pronounced with a hard ""g"" unlike the term derived from it, was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, in 1744. He attended Harvard College and graduated with the class of '62. He returned to Marblehead after graduation and by 1770, he was becoming more active in the anti-British movement, according to his Senate bio. In 1772, Gerry was elected to the legislature and later served in the Provincial Congress. He was later elected to the first and second Continental Congress, meetings with delegates from the 13 existing colonies. He was a signatory on the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. Related: Lines drawn over census results . Gerry argued in support of the ""Great Compromise"" at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, according to his Senate bio. The Great Compromise yielded the current bicameral legislature with a House of Representatives and Senate. As the Constitution evolved, however, Gerry feared it would give too much power to what would be the Congress, so he refused to sign it. He viewed it more favorably after the Bill of Rights was added. In the years that followed, Gerry served in the first and second Congresses as a representative but became disenchanted with the partisan debates and retired after his second term, his Senate bio says. John Adams later appointed him as an envoy to France, and although Gerry believed he helped to avoid war, he was sharply criticized for his work. Emerging as Massachusetts' Republican leader, Gerry served as governor twice and was defeated in his bid for a third term, clearing the way for his move to higher office. With the backing of the Republican caucus, President James Madison chose 67-year-old Gerry, a staunch supporter of the War of 1812, to be his running mate. The pair were elected, but Gerry died 20 months after becoming the nation's fifth vice president. Gerry was buried in the Congressional Cemetery. His epitaph displays one of his most well-known quotes: . ""It is the duty of every man, though he may have but one day to live, to devote that day to the good of his country.""","""Gerrymandering"" derived from Elbridge Gerry, former VP and Massachusetts governor .

"(CNN) -- It's not as fancy as an iPad, but it's far more affordable: Kmart's July 25 circular advertised a 7-inch tablet by Augen running the Android operating system. The GenTouch78 is on sale through July 31 for $149.99. That's far less than the cost of a laptop computer, and significantly less than the cost of a typical netbook. It's even less than the up-front cost for many popular carrier-subsidized smartphones -- and it doesn't require a pricey monthly contract. In fact, this device is roughly the size and cost of the Wi-Fi version of the latest Amazon Kindle. It's small enough to carry in a purse, and light enough to hold up easily if you're lying down in bed to read. All of this puts the GenTouch78 in a very interesting market position. It's a net-enabled tablet that is truly affordable for a mass consumer audience. In this unboxing video, YouTube user MrJn7 compares the Android tablet to his iPad and notes that while the iPad functions more smoothly and has a more compelling display, you can buy three GenTouch78 tablets (and then some) for the price of the least expensive iPad model. This tablet certainly has some shortcomings. According to MrJn7's video, the touchscreen is plastic (not glass) and requires a much firmer touch than the iPad. It even comes with a stylus, which seems like a technological throwback. Furthermore, the Android operating system may not be as intuitive as the Mac OS -- although it probably is not more difficult than Windows, which has been the choice of cost-conscious computer users for decades. The big deal is: Devices like this -- and rest assured, there will be many more of them -- can help address the class biases of technology and bridge the digital divide. Tablets like the GenTouch could become popular among people who have never owned a computer, or who own a computer and just want light web access on the go. I could see them becoming popular with teens and students, with seniors (who often feel overwhelmed by learning a computer), or anyone who wants more than an e-reader but less than a netbook as long as it's inexpensive. I also could see this kind of device catching on among businesses and organizations where people must walk around while recording or accessing information. I could envision cost-conscious shoppers opting to meet their communication needs via a small Wi-Fi tablet plus a no-contract, simple-feature phone -- and not feeling left behind by the smartphone craze. I'm sure that some people who are accustomed to laptops and smartphones will scoff at the GenTouch78 and its inevitable successors as underpowered cheap toys. That's fine. They're not the target market. The target market, I think, is people who just want good-enough, easy internet access for the lowest cash outlay. That's a big market -- one that probably includes people who wouldn't ever purchase a computer, netbook, or smartphone. The catch, of course, is Wi-Fi access -- which is still far from ubiquitous in many areas. It's is often available for free at schools, libraries, and many kinds of businesses; but it's a bigger hurdle for people in rural or poor communities. So far, tablets (even the iPad) are mainly intended for media consumption, simple interaction, and light content creation or curating. They aren't good for writing a book, manipulating a big spreadsheet or editing a podcast. But they are good enough to allow considerably more people to do considerably more online, affordably, and with fewer obstacles than most phones present. At the moment, the GenTouch78 is not actually on Kmart's shelves. The retailer is issuing rain checks for this offer. (See the Kmart blog for details.) And it's unknown what Kmart's price for the tablet will be after July 31. But remember, this particular product is just a starting point. It'll be interesting to watch this market develop -- and to see how people put these cheap tablets to use.","The GenTouch78 is a 7-inch tablet running the Android operating system .

"(CNN) -- Some long-time Cuba watchers expressed skepticism Tuesday over a report by a former Mexican foreign minister that Communist leader Raul Castro removed two top-ranking officials earlier this month because they were plotting to overthrow him with the support of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Fidel Castro, beset by illness, ceded power to his younger brother, Raul, pictured, last year. Jorge G. Castaneda, who served as Mexico's foreign minister from 2000 - 2003, wrote in the March 23 issue of Newsweek, which became public Saturday, that Deputy Prime Minister Carlos Lage Davila and Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque were concerned that Raul Castro would make concessions that would betray the 50-year-old Cuban Revolution. ""For at least a month or so, Lage, Perez Roque and others were apparently involved in a conspiracy, betrayal, coup or whatever term one prefers, to overthrow or displace Raul from his position,"" Castaneda wrote. ""In this endeavor, they recruited -- or were recruited by -- Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, who in turn tried to enlist the support of other Latin American leaders, starting with Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic, who refused to get involved."" The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington did not answer a verbal and written request for comment. The Dominican Republic Embassy in Washington did not answer telephones calls at various numbers. Robert Pastor, who served as a Latin America National Security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, returned Saturday from a weeklong visit to Cuba. Pastor said he wrote Castaneda a letter upon his return expressing his disbelief in Castaneda's contentions. ""This is Jorge at his most creative,"" Pastor said Tuesday. Louis A. Perez Jr., a Cuba scholar who has written 12 books on the nation, also expressed his doubts. ""Where is this coming from?"" Perez asked. ""I operate with the idea that there has to be some standard of plausibility. Is there discontent in Cuba and was Lage seen as the heir apparent? Yeah, that's the conventional wisdom since last year. But that there's a conspiracy between Lage and Perez Roque? I don't think so. It would be helpful if the people who write these reports cross the barrier of speculation."" Castaneda freely offers that he has no proof, calling his thesis ""informed speculation."" ""I have no way to substantiate any of this,"" he said by telephone Tuesday from Mexico City. ""I have no evidence of it."" Instead, Castaneda points to an ""enigmatic"" comment former leader Fidel Castro made in a column after the two men were removed. ""He resorted to a baseball metaphor on the occasion of the World Baseball Classic to praise Dominicans for not participating (the team's plans had been unclear) and to claim that Chavez's baseball players, 'as good and young' as they might be, were no match for 'Cuba's seasoned all-stars,' "" Castaneda wrote in the Newsweek article. Castaneda says Castro was thanking Dominican President Fernandez and sending a veiled message to Chavez. The former Mexican official also points to Chavez' silence on the removal of the two men as further proof that he was involved. The two fired functionaries were acting out of loyalty to the revolution, Castaneda wrote. Fidel Castro, beset by illness, ceded power to his younger brother last year. Most analysts see Fidel Castro as the more idealistic and doctrinaire of the two brothers, while Raul is viewed as more pragmatic. ""Their reasons for wishing to unseat Raul were mainly turf and power,"" Castaneda wrote, ""but they also feared that the leader was beginning to feel threatened by the reaction of the Cuban people to excessive economic and social deprivation, and after his brother's demise would be unable to control the flow of events. Consequently, he would accept a series of economic and political reforms to normalize relations with the United States. ... ""They believed this to be a betrayal of the revolution, and the beginning of the end of its survival."" According to Castaneda, Raul Castro detected the plot and went to his brother and gave him an ultimatum: support him or the plotters. Fidel Castro agreed to back his brother, Castaneda wrote. The Castro brothers then called in Chavez and gave him a ""devil's alternative: back off, while maintaining economic support for the island, or lose his Cuban security detail and intelligence apparatus, exposing himself to coups and assassination attempts from eventual Venezuelan replacements. He chose to stick with the Castros."" Castaneda acknowledges that Pastor and others have criticized him but says, ""I ask that they offer a better explanation."" Says Pastor, ""Most of them are quite conventional explanations. Everyone knew he was going to change the Cabinet. The only question was when the changes would be."" Raul Castro was merely trying to make the government more efficient, Pastor said. ""What was he doing?"" he asked. ""Merging different ministries, trying to decentralize and strengthen the government's capacity to undertake economic reforms."" But Castaneda points to the manner in which the two men were removed as proof that there was more to it than just a change in government. Why weren't Lage and Perez Roque given ambassadorships or other face-saving posts, as is often done in cases like this, he asked? Instead, Castaneda said, the men were stripped of all posts and made to sign letters in which they confessed to unspecified ""mistakes."" And one day after the two men were removed, Fidel Castro wrote in his column that they were ousted after they became seduced by the ""honey of power,"" which led them to an ""unworthy role."" Castro further said the two men had reawakened the illusions of ""foreign powers"" regarding Cuba's future. Castaneda says Raul Castro was worried about what would happen after Fidel dies and was trying to avert a succession battle. Perez Roque, 43, might have been perceived as a threat. ""Perez Roque was popular in Cuba; his youth, his humble origins, his combative nature all brought him closer to the people than most Cuban bureaucrats,"" Castaneda wrote in Newsweek. Pastor notes that the decision to remove the two men was not popular. ""There was pushback in Cuba among the [Communist Party] cadres and the public who said, ""We've connected with these two people. Why are they going?"" Pastor said. ""They didn't feel the government had given an adequate explanation for changing those individuals. They were concerned about the language of the resignations and about Fidel's comments."" Interestingly, Pastor said, ""They blamed Fidel more than they seemed to blame Raul."" Perez, the Cuba scholar, also noted Fidel Castro's apparent passing from power. ""Nobody speaks of Fidel anymore,"" Perez said. ""He's a non-presence. Out of sight, out of mind. The only time anyone speaks of him is when they are asked about him.""","Former Mexican foreign minister says Raul Castro removed two top-ranking officials .

"(CNN) -- Political discussions about Iran's nuclear aspirations were benched Thursday when the U.S. and Iranian national basketball teams went head to head at the FIBA World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey. The Americans clinched first place in Group B with an 88-51 win over Iran. But most of the attention wasn't directed toward the players' performance or their skills on the court; rather, it was the fact that the two teams -- whose countries have no diplomatic relations -- were sharing the same court for the first time. ""Yeah I get a lot of questions, most of it about the politics. But our game is nothing to do about the politics, it's just the sport,"" Iranian player Arsalan Kazemi told CNN. ""The only way is for people from USA and Iran can come together and have a friendly time together. We have to go there and play our best. The USA, you know, are a lot better than us. We just have to go there and play so the fans can enjoy the game,"" Kazemi said before the match. The 6-foot, 7-inch forward and sophomore at Rice University in Texas considers himself a fan of both teams. He is the first Iranian to play Division 1 men's college basketball in the United States. Kazemi grew up watching old National Basketball Association games replayed on Iranian television every Friday. This is the first time Iran has qualified for the world championships, and for Kazemi, there was no hiding his excitement at playing against some of the NBA's elite. ""Because they are the best players in the world. They all play in the NBA, which is the highest level of basketball, and that's it. I just want to go and play against them, play good,"" Kazemi said. Only about a quarter of the seats in Abdi Ipekci Hall in Istanbul were occupied for the game, and a majority of the spectators were Iranians or expatriates. Hamed Haddadi, who plays for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies, was the crowd favorite as he played for his home country. Through a sea of Iranian flags and banners, only a handful of American flags were visible, but one group of fans held up an American flag and an Iranian flag with a sign in between them reading ""PEACE."" Relations between the two countries have been strained further in recent years due to Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes. But Washington and many of its allies fear Iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons. Diplomatic ties between the United States and Iran were cut in 1980, after Iranian students seized the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for more than a year. Despite any outside pressures both teams may have felt looming from home, they were not shown on the court. Haddadi shared a friendly bump and a laugh with U.S. forward Rudy Gay, his teammate on the Grizzlies. Haddadi scored 19 points for the Iranians. ""We both came out, played hard, and represented our countries well. Iran fought very hard. It was a very good game. I think we showed a lot of respect for each other. I was happy with the outcome,"" U.S. player Tyson Chandler said. The match provided a trip down memory lane for the U.S. team's coach, Mike Krzyzewski. ""I've been to Iran. I played there in the early 70s, in Tehran,"" he said after the game. ""I have good friends that are of Iranian descent in the United States. So I have a good feeling for the Iranian people. There's no political aspect in my mind about the ballgame."" The Iranian team's coach, who is from Serbia, laughed when discussing the media attention surrounding the game. ""A lot of newspapers would come to practice and make a picture. OK for us, this is interesting. We are first time at the world championship and for us this entertainment is good,"" Veselin Matic said. ""I am very happy for my players. This helps them to motivate them. I think they are very good fighters,"" he added. Despite its efforts, Iran will not advance to the next round. The U.S. win put them at 1-3 for the tournament. ""This was a very hard game, this was a very tough game. This is the first time we are playing in the world championship,"" Iranian player Aren Davoodi told CNN. ""Everyone wants to play against NBA players because they are the biggest players in the world. I hope we can be better next time against the U.S."" CNN's Yesim Comert contributed to this report .","In the first-ever meeting of the teams, the U.S. won 88-51 .

"(CNN) -- The cost of attending college has risen nearly three times the rate of the cost of living, and could eventually put higher education out of reach for most Americans, according to a National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education report released Wednesday. The price to attend college, adjusted for inflation, rose 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, according to a report. The problem could affect the United States' global competitiveness, the center said in its biennial report. ""College tuition continues to outpace family income and the price of other necessities, such as medical care, food and housing,"" the center said. College tuition and fees, adjusted for inflation, rose 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, towering over increases in medical care, housing and food, according to the report. Median family income rose 147 percent during the same period, the report said. In Austin, Texas, Tony D'Addeo, a high school senior and straight-A student, hoped to attend an Ivy League school, paid for with his parents' stock options. But the options, once worth several hundred thousand dollars, are now worthless. ""I think a lot of families -- lower class and middle class -- are having to readjust their plans and goals,"" said D'Addeo, who is now looking at a state school or possibly signing up for an ROTC program to cover college expenses.  Watch how the economy is affecting students' college plans » . The report gave a failing grade in affordability to all states but one, California, which received a ""C."" ""The nation's colleges and universities have become less affordable for students and their families since the early 1990s,"" it said. ""This year continues the trend in deteriorating college affordability in the majority of states.""  See how tuition has risen in comparison to other prices » . In most states, the percentage of an average family's income used for a public four-year college -- after financial aid -- has increased, the report said. ""On average, students from working and poor families must pay 40 percent of family income to enroll in public four-year colleges. Students from middle-income families and upper-income families must pay 25 percent and 13 percent of family income, respectively.""  Watch how the affordability of college is getting tougher in the U.S. » . In addition, students who enroll in college take on more debt to stay there. ""Over the last decade, borrowing has more than doubled,"" the report said. ""Money isn't cheap,"" said Georgia State University senior Eric Hahn. ""The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money,"" said Hahn, who had to scramble to find a new loan earlier this year after his lender suspended its private loan program. Hahn is now borrowing money from Sallie Mae, the country's leading student loan provider. He estimated it will take him five to seven years to repay about $30,000 he will borrow. Read full story . The researchers said states are struggling with substantial budget shortfalls, a consequence of the lagging economy. The soaring cost of college is on the political radar of President-elect Barack Obama. He has promised to create a new American Opportunity Tax Credit worth $4,000 in exchange for community service, according to the Obama-Biden Web site. Recipients of the tax credit would be required to conduct 100 hours of community service. Obama also promised to streamline the financial aid process. Under Obama's plan, families would apply for financial aid by checking a box on their tax form, which would authorize their tax information to be used, and eliminate the need for a separate application. The United States made modest advances in some areas of education, but the rate of enrollment and completion for college is below other countries, the report found. The 34 percent of young American adults enrolled in college puts the United States behind Hungary, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, Greece and Korea -- which ranked the highest, with 53 percent. Nearly 40 percent of older Americans, ages 35 to 64, hold an associate degree or higher, putting the United States second in the world in that category, behind Canada's 44 percent. But the United States ranks 10th in the world for percentage of younger adults holding those degrees -- 39 percent -- far below Canada, which has the highest at 55 percent.","Report: Tuition and fees, adjusted for inflation, rose 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 28 people are dead and at least 218 others were wounded Wednesday after three blasts during a Shiite procession here, authorities in Pakistan said. Khalid Ranjha, a Lahore government official, said two of the dead are children and two others are women, and seven of those injured are in critical condition. The three explosions occurred within a radius of about 600 meters (2,000 feet). All three blasts were the work of suicide bombers, said Nayab Haider, a spokesman for the Lahore police. Police tried to stop the first suicide bomber as the procession was ending, but he blew himself up as the police officer caught up with him in the crowd, Haider said. Three or four minutes later, the second blast erupted. It was followed 25 minutes later by yet a third suicide bomber. Police have found two heads and one body separately, said Haider, who said authorities had assigned 2,500 police officers to the procession after receiving a warning that it might be attacked. Khusro Pervez, a senior government official, said the incidents took place around the time of the daily breaking of the Ramadan fast, and security may have been lax. ""At the end of the procession, security should have been more vigilant,"" Pervez said. ""The incident happened because of security breach."" Pakistan is a largely Sunni Muslim nation, and the attack on Shiite Muslims conjures thoughts of the long-standing tensions between the two groups in the Middle East and Asia. Paramilitary forces have been deployed to the streets to bring order. Local TV channels showed pictures of angry people burning vehicles, beating police and trying to break into a police station. CNN's Samson Desta contributed to this story.","Three blasts strike a Shiite procession in 30-minute span .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ahead of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians on Thursday, President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that he was ""hopeful -- cautiously hopeful"" that the talks could achieve a two-state solution to the long running Mideast conflict. ""Though each of us holds a title of honor --- president, prime minister, king --- we are bound by the one title we share,"" Obama said on a stage with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan. ""We are fathers, blessed with sons and daughters,"" Obama said. ""So we must ask ourselves what kind of world do we want to bequeath to our children and our grandchildren."" The president was speaking at the start of a working White House dinner with Netanyahu, Abbas, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Each made remarks before the dinner. Also attending the dinner were Secretary of State Hillary Clintonand Middle East Quartet Representative Tony Blair. The Quartet consists of the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union. ""We don't seek a brief interlude between two wars, we don't seek a temporary respite between outbursts of terror,"" Netanyahu said. ""We seek a peace that will end the conflict between us once and for all... for our generation, our children's generation and the next."" Netanyahu and Abbas condemned attacks against the Israelis in recent days. ""We do not want any blood to be shed -- one drop of blood from the Israelis or the Palestinians,"" said Abbas. ""We want peace between the two countries... let us sign a formal agreement for peace and put an end to this long period of suffering forever."" In earlier remarks from the White House Rose Garden, Obama said that ""this moment of opportunity may not soon come again."" With the U.S. war in Iraq drawing to a close, the Middle East moved front and center for administration officials Wednesday as Obama held a series of high-stakes meetings with Israeli and Arab leaders. Obama huddled behind closed doors at the White House with the Israeli and Arab leaders. On Wednesday night, Obama called the talks ""very productive."" But he also pointed to challenges ahead. ""We are under no illusions,"" he said. ""Passions run deep... there's a reason that the two-state solution has eluded previous generations --- this is extraordinarily complex and extraordinarily difficult."" ""But,"" he continued, ""we know that the status quo is unsustainable."" Obama and Netanyahu met first on Wednesday, briefly addressing reporters to condemn, in Obama's words, the ""senseless slaughter"" of two men and two women Tuesday near the West Bank city of Hebron. ""Terrorists ... are purposely trying to undermine these talks,"" Obama said.  ""The message should go out (that this attack) is not going to stop"" the United States from backing Israel and the peace process. Later, after meeting with Abbas, he said that ""we are making progress"" in negotiations. During his meetings with Abbas and King Abdullah, according to the White House, Obama was joined by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, National Security Advisor Gen. James Jones, and former Sen. George Mitchell, among others.  Mitchell is Obama's special envoy for Middle East peace. At stake is a unique ""window of opportunity"" for a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within the next year, according Mitchell.  Talks have been stalled for a year and a half. The hurdles, however, remain steep.  One immediate threat is the looming September 26 expiration of Israel's 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat indicated to CNN this week that if Israel does not extend the freeze, direct talks may quickly fall apart. Netanyahu will have ""closed the door in my face"" if settlement construction resumes, Erakat said.  Pressed on whether the Palestinian delegation would walk out of talks at that point, Erakat said that ""we will not be able to go."" Netanyahu can have settlements or peace, but he can't have both, Erakat said. Another roadblock to any comprehensive deal is the Palestinian view that any two-state solution must include a handover of all the land Israel captured in the 1967 war, along with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.  While Netanyahu has expressed openness about a Palestinian state, he has expressed strong opposition to a Palestinian takeover of East Jerusalem. The issue of Hamas control of Gaza, Erakat noted, also remains a ""major problem.""  While Gaza is generally considered to be part of any future Palestinian state, Hamas has refused to recognize Israel's right to exist and is not a part of the talks.  Hamas leaders are frequently in conflict with the more moderate Abbas and his Fatah organization, which has the upper hand in the West Bank. Mitchell, however, told reporters Tuesday that both Netanyahu and Abbas are noting polls showing fear of intensified conflict if negotiations fall apart. This is ""a moment in time within which there remains the possibility of achieving the two-state solution,"" Mitchell asserted.  ""The alternatives ... pose far greater difficulties and far greater problems in the future."" Several top officials close to the negotiations conceded to CNN that it is hard to be optimistic about a peace deal at the moment.  They downplayed expectations, saying that nobody directly involved in the talks expects a deal to be reached this week.  But simply resuming talks was a critical step, and a comprehensive Middle East peace deal has been one of Obama's top foreign policy goals, they said. ""The biggest breakthrough would be an agenda [emerging Thursday] for a second round of meetings soon to move forward,"" one top official actively engaged in the talks said. Clinton is set to play the main role in the talks on Thursday, hosting a meeting at the State Department with Netanyahu and Abbas.

"(CNN) -- New details emerged Tuesday about the controversial ""Park51"" project, involving the proposed Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York City. A source familiar with the project told CNN's Allan Chernoff the structure is being planned as an 11-story building. It will cover 120,000 square feet. Within that space, the source said, 10,000 square feet -- just more than 8 percent -- would be designated for the Muslim prayer space. The developer is considering the possibility of an interfaith education/meditation/prayer space as well, the source said. The Islamic Center's leaders have said plans for the $100 million facility call for a community center including a mosque, performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. It will be built on property the center already owns, two blocks from where the World Trade Center was destroyed by Islamic extremists on September 11, 2001. The attacks on the two towers killed more than 2,700 people. CNN's Allan Chernoff contributed to this report.","Islamic Center in New York planned for 11 stories, source says .

"New York (CNN) -- Facing a sharp increase in bedbug cases, New York became the latest state Monday to require landlords to disclose an apartment building's bedbug infestation history within the previous year to potential tenants, according to a release from New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who sponsored the bill. ""Nothing is more horrifying than signing a lease after a lengthy apartment search only to discover that your new apartment is bedbug-infested,"" Rosenthal said in the statement. ""By requiring landlords to disclose infestations before the lease is signed, people will have a means of guarding themselves against exposure to this plague."" New York is the second state after Maine to adopt such a measure, commonly referred to as a ""right-to-know"" law, according to Missy Henriksen of the National Pest Management Association, which researches and tracks bedbug trends around the country. New Jersey has similar legislation pending, according to Henriksen. ""We actually expect an avalanche of right-to-know legislation introduced,"" she said. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. For the first half of 2010, 1,976 bedbug violation notices have been written. However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market. Owners of bedbug-infested residences are less likely to call 311, the city's nonemergency hot line, which then notifies the Housing Preservation Department. Further, landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation. In recent months, bedbugs have struck high-end retailers, movie theatres and office buildings. Last year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency sponsored a bedbug conference in Arlington, Virginia. Speaking to 230 academics, agency employees and exterminators, Dale Kemery, an agency spokesman, said the incidence of infestation in the United States has tripled since 2005. Despite their name, bedbugs need not live in beds. They generally live within 10 to 20 feet of their hosts and avoid light, preferring the dark security of spaces behind headboards, under baseboards and behind hanging pictures.","Law says landlords have to give history of infestation in previous year .

"(CNN) -- American-born Edgar Valdez Villarreal, believed to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers, was captured Monday, Mexican authorities said. Federal police made the capture, though the exact location and timing of it were not immediately known. The arrest, a high-profile win for Mexican authorities, followed ""intelligence work"" that began in June 2009, federal police said in a statement. His capture came after a shootout, according to Viviana Macias, a spokeswoman with the federal attorney general's office. Valdez, who is known as ""La Barbie"" because of his blue eyes and fair complexion, was a one-time top lieutenant of Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Valdez later joined the breakaway Beltran Leyva cartel, but the leader of that group, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a shootout with Mexican officials late last year. Beltran's brother Carlos was arrested, leaving Valdez in a fight to fill a power vacuum in one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. Lieutenants loyal to the cartel's co-founder deny Valdez is the group's leader, federal police have said. Valdez, thought to be the first U.S.-born cartel leader in Mexico, is accused in the United States of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. He is believed to have played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, U.S. authorities have said. U.S. Justice Department officials offered in June a $2 million reward for information leading to the capture of the alleged cocaine kingpin. His arrest comes on the heels of another big blow against the drug cartels. Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel Villareal, a principle leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, was killed during a military raid in July. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006, according to government figures. The president is under increasing pressure to show results.","Edgar Valdez Villarreal is known as ""La Barbie"" because of his blue eyes and fair complexion .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates helped usher in the next chapter for the United States in Iraq on Wednesday, presiding over a ceremony launching a new military operation designed to train, assist and advise the Iraqis. The ceremony, held at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, marked the conclusion of the U.S. combat mission dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transfer to the assistance mission, named Operation New Dawn. Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III replaced Gen. Raymond T. Odierno as commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq in the changeover, held at one of the many palaces of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- whose regime was ousted from power in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Biden said Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, but promised that ""American engagement with Iraq will continue"" with the new stability mission. ""This change of mission, to state the obvious, would never have been possible without the resolve and tremendous sacrifice and competence of our military -- the finest, if our Iraqi friends will forgive us, the finest fighting force in the world, and I would argue the finest fighting force that ever has existed,"" Biden said. He acknowledged the pain Iraqis endured during the long war, saying tens of thousands of troops and civilians died, and many more were wounded and displaced. However, he said, ""I believe that their darkest days are now behind them."" Noting the divided opinion toward the war in the United States, he said people from both parties had always backed the troops for their ""extraordinary service"" after ""a high-speed invasion that toppled a tyrant became a grinding struggle against violent extremists."" ""Our fighting men and women were given a mission in Iraq that was as complicated as any in our history, an assignment that taught us that war is the realm of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Troops steeped in military doctrine were asked to deal with challenges ranging from electricity to unemployment, currency exchange to trash collection."" The vice president also praised the new electoral system in Iraq, urging political parties there to settle their differences and form a government soon. ""Iraqis have cast their lot as well as their ballots for a better future,"" he said. Biden highlighted Gates' contributions, saying the defense secretary's decision to serve under both Republican and Democratic administrations during the war is a testament to his patriotism. Odierno, who said Iraqi security forces are ready to take the lead there, recalled the wartime period as one of Iraqi heroism. ""This period in Iraq's history will probably be remembered for sacrifice, resiliency and change. However, I remember it as a time in which the Iraqi people stood up against tyranny, terrorism and extremism, and decided to determine their own destiny, as a people and as a democratic state,"" he said. As Biden did, Odierno urged Iraqi political blocs to form a government, which has yet to be established since elections six months ago. ""It is time for Iraq to move forward,"" Odierno said. Odierno said a democratic Iraq ""can become an engine for peace and stability"" in the Middle East. ""We can no longer dwell on our past accomplishments, but must remain focused on the tremendous opportunity at hand. Iraq has always played a vital role in this uncertain part of the globe,"" he said. Austin said Iraq still faces hostile threats from insurgents working to undermine the country. But he said that ""the past few years in Iraq have been marked by steady progress"" and he envisions a ""stable, secure and unified Iraq."" ""Operation New Dawn marks the next phase of an enduring relationship"" between the United States and Iraq, he said. While the U.S. combat mission is ending, roughly 50,000 American troops will remain in the country until the end of 2011 for the assistance mission. When asked Wednesday if the United States is still at war in Iraq, Gates responded, ""No, we're not."" Gates added it is up to historians to determine whether the war was worth it. Along with U.S. political and military dignitaries, Iraqi officials -- including Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, Defense Minister Mohammed Abdul Qader al-Obeidi and the Kurdish region's Prime Minister Barham Saleh -- attended the ceremony. The U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday. The drawdown and end to the U.S. combat phase marks a new page in what has been a controversial seven-year conflict. Weapons of mass destruction, a major justification by the Bush administration for going to war, were never found. Saddam Hussein was toppled, along with his massive Baghdad statue, but sectarian violence soon erupted. On Tuesday night, U.S. President Barack Obama addressed Americans about the transition in a televised speech. ""The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people,"" Obama said from the Oval Office. ""We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home. We have persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization."" The war in Iraq has claimed the lives of more than 4,400 U.S. troops. Obama said he was ""awed"" by the sacrifices of service members and their families and that the U.S. has met its responsibility. ""Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,"" Obama said. ""We have removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq. We have closed or transferred hundreds of bases to the Iraqis. And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq."" Before Obama's speech, some Republicans had urged him to acknowledge that the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq ordered by then-President George W. Bush had worked. Obama, as a U.S. senator and candidate for the presidency, had opposed it. Obama, who spoke with Bush in a phone call earlier in the day, did not mention the former president's role in the surge. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, delivered a speech Tuesday suggesting Bush deserves more credit for reaching this milestone. ""You might recall that the surge wasn't very popular when it was announced,"" McConnell said. ""You might also recall that one of its biggest critics was the current president. So it makes it easier to talk about fulfilling a campaign promise to wind down our operations in Iraq when the previous administration signs the security agreement with Iraq to end our overall presence there."" Obama said the most urgent matter now is restoring the economy and ""putting millions of Americans who have who have lost their jobs back to work."" To strengthen the middle class, he said, ""we must give all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy."" Obama's emphasis on the economy appears to dovetail with the mood of the American public. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll earlier this month, 56 percent of respondents said the economy would be extremely important to their vote for Congress this year. Fewer than four in 10 said that the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan were extremely important to them.

"Corolla, North Carolina (CNN) -- Ray Midgett hunts the Corolla beaches on the Outer Banks of North Carolina almost every day. ""Beachcombing, or metal detecting, or relic hunting is in my blood,"" said Midgett, a retired government worker who hits the sand between October and April. ""There are so many shipwrecks up here, it's just beautiful."" Midgett drives his pickup truck right onto the beach using the access road near the Currituck Beach Lighthouse. With a metal detector and shovel in tow, he's uncovered everything from antique coins to wedding rings. Yet his biggest discovery came in December when he located the remains of a historic shipwreck. The wreckage, hidden under the sand for centuries, became fully exposed after a winter of brutal Nor'easters, making it the oldest shipwreck found off the coast of North Carolina. But historians had to act fast to recover the ship, according to Meghan Agresto, site manager of the Currituck Beach Lighthouse. ""This winter, it just got smacked. After awhile the ocean was going to take it back,"" Agresto said. ""The fact that we got it off the beach makes us excited because we got to save it."" Midgett and other beachcombers had discovered a number of relics near the shipwreck's beach grave site, including coins believed to be from the reign of Louis XIII in France and Charles I in England, lead bale seals used for identification, and spoons dating to the mid-1600s. Midgett said he feels a personal connection to the discovery. ""This shipwreck is a part of me, and some of the other hunters, too, that have been hunting around it for years,"" Midgett said. ""I'm just so glad that they decided to save it."" The rough currents and shallow sand bars off North Carolina's Outer Banks have destroyed thousands of ships in what is sometimes called the ""Graveyard of the Atlantic."" However, it is rare to find the remains of a shipwreck -- particularly a wooden vessel -- intact. Throughout winter, the Corolla beach shipwreck would repeatedly get uncovered and covered again.  The waves would also move it along the coastline, causing damage. ""I'm glad we got to it when we did. ... It may have covered back up and survived another summer,"" Midgett said. ""But next winter it would have been the same thing over and it eventually would have gone to pieces."" Midgett, who used to work as a government auditor, wanted to make sure his discovery was salvaged, so he personally lobbied North Carolina state Sen. Marc Basnight. After numerous phone calls and e-mails appealing to Basnight, a beach lover himself, he was successful. In April, volunteers from the Wildlife Resources Commission, Underwater Archaeology Branch, the Corolla Fire Department and area residents helped free the wreck from the sand and tow it near the lighthouse. Archaeologists originally thought the wreck could be the HMS Swift, a British Navy ship from the late 18th century that originally ran around in the southern Chesapeake Bay off Virginia's coast. The HMS Swift drifted to the Outer Banks, where it was looted once it hit shore, then disabled by the looters so it wouldn't resurface. After further examination of the ship's 12-ton skeleton -- complete with wooden peg fasteners -- archaeologists determined that it was not the HMS Swift, but most likely a merchant's ship dating to the mid- to late-1600s. That makes it the oldest shipwreck found along the state's coast. ""History is the one thing we have that has a reasonable amount of certainty attached to it,"" said Joseph Schwarzer, director of North Carolina Maritime Museums. ""It tells us where we've been, it tells us what's happening, and it's a directional sign for where you need to go next."" Before the Corolla Beach discovery, the oldest shipwreck found along the state's coast was Queen Anne's Revenge, the presumed flagship of Blackbeard the pirate said to have run aground in 1718, according to the North Carolina Maritime Museums. The remains of the Corolla Beach wreck and some of its artifacts will be moved to the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum on Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Midgett and the other beachcombers are entitled to keep the coins and other artifacts found near the ship they discovered. ""It's very exciting to find something from this time period,"" said Richard Lawrence, director of the North Carolina Underwater Archaeology Branch for the Department of Cultural Resources. ""And amazingly we found it in this beach environment. It appears this wreck has been sitting here for 350 years almost undisturbed until this winter."" Lawrence said the discovery would never have happened without Midgett. ""Ray Midgett was probably more responsible than anybody to get this wreck off the beach,"" Lawrence said. ""He created enough of a stir to get various organizations involved. ""Thankfully, Ray and his colleagues collected various artifacts that would have otherwise not survived.""","Ray Midgett finds shipwreck while on his regular beachcombing route .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy became faint while jogging late Sunday morning and was taken to a hospital, the presidential office said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy is often seen jogging with bodyguards. He did not lose consciousness, and initial tests showed nothing abnormal, said a statement released by the president's office. His heart will be monitored until Monday morning, which is standard procedure in such cases, the statement said. In the meantime, according to the statement, he is resting and keeping in touch with his advisers. Sarkozy, 54, had been jogging with bodyguards for about 45 minutes near the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the president, when he fell ill, the statement said. After being seen by the Elysee doctor, Sarkozy was taken by helicopter to the military hospital Val-de-Grace.  Watch more on Sarkozy's trip to hospital » . No further announcement was expected until morning, the statement said. Sarkozy exercises regularly and is an avid jogger.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Intense rain and gushing flood waters threatened Wednesday to cause more misery in monsoon-bloated Pakistan, where 3 million people are already suffering. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Americans to donate to relief efforts, saying that experience in post-earthquake Haiti showed that small donations can make a big difference. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appealed to residents to curtail expenditures for Ramadan feasts and upcoming independence day celebrations and contribute instead to help their desperate compatriots. As many as 1,500 people have died in Pakistan's worst flooding in 70 years. Relief agencies were struggling to reach people who have lost everything to walls of water. Many were cut off after roads and bridges washed away. Thousands of others were people already displaced by violence in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The flooding also washed away tens of thousands of homes, devastated livestock and swept away farm land. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it has distributed 10,000 tents so far, along with other relief supplies which have assisted some 50,000 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. assistance to Pakistan, a strategically important country whose relationship with Washington continues to be a work on progress. The Obama administration is looking to turn the natural disaster into opportunity, hoping a robust response to the crisis will help improve its poor image among a skeptical Pakistani public. A senior Pakistani military official told CNN that six U.S. helicopters landed at Ghazi airbase Wednesday near the village of Tarbela Ghazi, just north of Islamabad, to participate in the rescue and relief work. The United States has already committed $10 million in aid, and U.S. helicopters have airlifted flood victims and helped deliver critical supplies including temporary bridges and 300,000 halal meals, food that meets Islamic dietary law. ""We've been working hard over the past year to build a partnership with the people of Pakistan, and this is an essential element of that partnership -- reaching out and helping each other in times of need,"" Clinton said. She urged Americans to use their cell phones to text the word ""SWAT"" to the number 50555 to make a $10 contribution to the U.N. refugee agency. The Pakistan Meteorological Department predicted more misery in the days ahead. As much as 2 inches of rain is forecast over the next two days for central Pakistan while scattered showers will continue to fall in the north. Rushing river waters could cause more flooding in downstream areas by this weekend, meteorologists said. In some areas, Pakistanis complained the government has been sluggish to respond. In a special emergency meeting Wednesday, Gilani said the government was doing all it could to address the crisis. People stranded in Tonsa Sharif and Dera Ghazi Khan were still waiting for government relief, reported CNN affiliate Geo TV. Meanwhile, limited access to clean water and poor hygienic conditions raised the threat of widespread acute respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin infections, said the medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres (also known as Doctors Without Borders), which is supporting health units in Mandrakhel, Wadpaga, and Gulbela in the Peshawar district, and the Paddi Hospital in the Nowshera district. Collapsed bridges meant the medical teams were unable to reach the badly hit North Swat region. A case of cholera has been confirmed in Swat.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane warnings and watches stretched from North Carolina to Delaware and covered parts of Massachusetts on Wednesday as forecasters upgraded Hurricane Earl to a Category 4 storm and warned it will be approaching the East Coast by late Thursday. Hurricane models have Earl passing close to North Carolina's Outer Banks on Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said in an 8 p.m. Wednesday forecast. ""Only a small westward deviation of the track to the west would bring the core of the hurricane to the coast,"" it said. The center extended hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings northward through Massachusetts on Wednesday evening and said the storm's track has shifted slightly to the west, closer to North Carolina's Cape Hatteras. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Ocracoke Island, on North Carolina's Outer Banks, and Cape Lookout National Seashore, as well as Hatteras Island. Earl had been downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane earlier Wednesday but was judged to be a Category 4 in the National Hurricane Center's forecast on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Earl's maximum sustained winds have increased to near 135 mph and the storm is growing, the National Hurricane Center said. Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach parts of the North Carolina coast by Thursday afternoon, with hurricane force winds arriving by late Thursday, the center said. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Earl is expected to make its closest pass to Cape Hatteras around 2 a.m. Friday as a Category 3 storm, with hurricane force winds of up to 75 mph expected on the Outer Banks. Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast, with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet, along with 3 to 4 inches of rainfall, Morris said. Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible. Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach the coast from Virginia to New Jersey by early Friday. Morris said that Earl will make its closest pass to New Jersey on Friday afternoon as a Category 2 hurricane. The long duration of tropical storm force winds threaten widespread power outages in parts of the South and the mid-Atlantic region, he said. Tropical storm force winds will arrive on Massachusetts' Cape Cod by Friday afternoon. Morris said that hurricane force winds are possible there later on Friday, with Earl making its closest pass to Cape Cod on Friday evening as a Category 1 hurricane. Forecasters have issued a hurricane warning for the area from Bogue Inlet, North Carolina, northeast to the North Carolina-Virginia border, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. On Wednesday evening a tropical storm warning for the area between Cape Fear, North Carolina, and Bogue Inlet, was extended from the North Carolina-Virginia border to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. A hurricane watch stretched from the North Carolina-Virginia line up to Cape Henlopen, Delaware, while another hurricane watch covered a chunk of the Massachusetts coast, from Wood's Hole to Sagamore Beach, and includes Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket . A tropical storm watch extends from Sandy Hook, New Jersey to Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, encompassing Long Island Sound and Block Island. A tropical storm watch also covers the area from north of Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, to the mouth of the Merrimack River. Because of Earl's size, effects of the storm are expected to be widely felt. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 kilometers) from the center, and tropical storm-force winds up to 200 miles (325 kilometers). As of 8 p.m. Wednesday, Earl was centered about 565 miles (910 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northwest at about 18 mph (30 kph). Overnight Tuesday, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoy recorded a wave with a 50-foot peak associated with Earl, National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read told reporters. ""The buoy survived it just fine and it's still reporting,"" he said. On Friday, Earl is forecast to move away from the Outer Banks and northward, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. It is not expected to make a direct hit on the coast from Virginia to New Jersey, but heavy rain, high surf and gusty winds are likely. Friday night, Earl will make its closest pass to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and the outlying islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Again, no direct hit is forecast, but any deviation could bring Earl's center over the area, Hennen said. Earl is expected to make a direct landfall over southern Nova Scotia, Canada, on Saturday morning as a strong Category 1 hurricane. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said Wednesday he had briefed President Barack Obama on what the agency is doing in preparation for the storm. Teams are in place or on standby to assist each state along the East Coast, he said, and supplies were being moved into two incident support bases to be available if they are needed. Several airlines said Wednesday that fliers to and from cities along the eastern seaboard, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bangor, Maine, could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty. Though they have not announced cancellations, Air Tran, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers. On Ocracoke Island -- a long sliver of land reachable only by ferry -- not everyone was planning to flee as Earl approached. ""A lot of times when [residents] evacuate, it's hard to get back on the island,"" said Brandon Benecki, who tends bar at Howard's Pub on Ocracoke Island. ""It's simpler to just stay here and kind of ride it out."" ""None of my neighbors are leaving,"" one man on Ocracoke Island told CNN affiliate WVEC-TV. ""We're just going to hang in and ride her out."" Some tourists didn't seem deterred either. ""They'll throw us off the island,"" one woman told WVEC. ""That's all right. We'll just camp somewhere else."" However, Paula Schramel, who co-owns the Flying Melon restaurant on Ocracoke with her husband, Michael, said she has made plans to go to Charlotte, North Carolina, where her mother is. The couple are natives of New Orleans, Louisiana, who moved to Ocracoke 10 years ago. Their restaurant specializes in Creole cuisine. Some of Michael Schramel's relatives in New Orleans who lived through Hurricane Katrina are urging them to evacuate, she said. ""They're probably more nervous than we are,"" she said. ""It wakes you up a little bit to the fact that it can be"" dangerous. Once the wind gets to 50 mph, she said, the ferries stop running and ""you're stuck."" Officials are ""running the ferries as fast as they can,"" she said, but some visitors are dragging their feet -- understandably, since it means cutting their vacation short. Earl is also dealing the couple an economic blow, they said, as it's considered the last big week of business for the summer tourism season. The restaurant was busy Tuesday night, Paula Schramel said, but closed on Wednesday once the evacuation order was issued. Michael Schramel said he will leave if Earl becomes a Category 4 storm, and said he is ""a little bit nervous. ... A 4 would be devastating."" ""We are concerned about the storm, and it is important that people aren't here who don't understand the [potential] flooding issues,"" said Alan Sutton, the owner of Tradewinds Bait and Tackle on Ocracoke Island. But for regular residents, he said, the threat of hurricanes is ""just part of living here."" Staff members of Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina also ordered an evacuation Tuesday, according to park Superintendent Russel J. Wilson. The park will be closed to all visitors beginning at 5 p.m. Wednesday, until further notice. Hurricane Earl is approaching the United States just ahead of Labor Day, a holiday weekend that many families spend at the beach. ""Unfortunately, they're just getting started with their vacation and now they have to turn around and go,"" bartender Benecki said. ""However, I think most people do understand why."" Rip currents and dangerous surf will threaten beachgoers all along the East Coast, Hennen said. The hurricane already dealt a glancing blow to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, downing trees and knocking out power lines. The hurricane center said Earl's center is set to pass east and northeast of the Bahamas on Wednesday and Wednesday night. A tropical storm warning for San Salvador Island in the central Bahamas was discontinued Wednesday afternoon. Sixty-six members of the North Carolina National Guard have been told to report Wednesday night for storm response duty. They will report to facilities in eastern North Carolina, but away from the coast, said spokesman Maj. Matt Handley. After the storm has moved away, they will assess damage and formulate a response, he said. FEMA has urged those living in the region to prepare for the storm, stock up on supplies and have a plan in case it becomes necessary. Besides FEMA's Ready.gov website, people can use FEMA's mobile application, which links to the National Hurricane Center, to stay up to date on information. Tips include developing a family communications plan, putting together a kit with food and water for 72 hours, and staying informed of risks in the area. Meanwhile, Tropical Depression 9 was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston on Wednesday night, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the center said. The storm is located in the far eastern north Atlantic Ocean approximately 1,635 miles east-southeast of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands. The depression had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was heading west at 15 mph (24 kph). It is likely the depression will become Tropical Storm Gaston within 48 hours, forecasters said. And Tropical Storm Fiona was moving out into the open Atlantic on Wednesday, and the center discontinued all watches and warnings related to the storm.

"Washington (CNN) -- Several observers on the left side of the opinion spectrum write dismissively of the followers of the Tea Party. About the kindest labels appended to them are ""rednecks,"" ""highly volatile"" and ""laughable."" Young research assistants at George Washington University see them as ""psychopaths,"" ""racists,"" ""anti-Semites"" and ""homophobes"" and hold that, in the political arena, ""one cannot talk to them; one must defeat them."" As I see it, it is never a good idea to dismiss out of hand a major social movement. One poll in December found the tea party movement was then viewed favorably by more Americans (41 percent) than either the Democrats (35 percent) or the Republicans (28 percent). More importantly, the concern on the part of tea partiers that the government is not responsive to the interests and values of the majority is a valid one. Whether the bank and auto industry bailouts, the huge economic stimulus package and the health care bill are good policies or bad --and will help the economy or hurt it -- they are not favored by the majority of  Americans. And the things that people most care about -- the creation of new jobs and vigorous economic growth -- are lacking. Even more important are the ways the bills were fashioned. There is a saying in Washington that one should never see the ways laws and sausages are made. Well, many people are choking on them even without knowing how they were concocted. Those of us who follow politics closely have become inured to the fact that the bills that are finally enacted (often after months of haggling, slicing and dicing) are loaded with earmarks that favor some congressional districts or industry and are riddled with exceptions for special interests. You may not wonder why the auto dealers won exemptions in Congress from the new financial regulations. But the behind-the-scene deals the White House has made are enough to make you sick. These include deals with private hospitals to drop the public option in exchange for their support of the health care bill and with the pharmaceutical industry to block Americans from purchasing low-cost drugs from other countries. Some of us have learned to live with these maneuvers as long as something comes out at the other end. However, many Americans are busy working or looking for a job, taking care of their families and trying to find some spare time to follow their favorite sports team and have a beer. But when they are made aware of these shenanigans, they are nauseated. As they should be. I choose my words carefully. I suggest that the sense of the tea partiers that they have been had is largely a valid one. At the same time, their ideas of what ought to be done are very much off the mark. The desire to gut the government ignores the fact that there are many important missions that the government is best-suited to accomplish. However, before those of us who do not belong to this movement can carry this message to the tea partiers, we first need to validate their feelings, rather than dismiss them. And we must be honest: Reforming the government so that it will be less captured by special interests and more responsive to the public interest is a difficult road to navigate. Indeed, that road was recently made more difficult to navigate by a Supreme Court ruling that largely lifted the limits on legalized bribery, which is the proper name for allowing corporations and labor unions to make unfettered donations to the political campaigns of those who do their bidding. The best we can offer is to point out that a major, populist social movement can serve to countervail special interests, as long as it sees its role as to straighten out the government, rather than to decimate it. This is what the progressive movement of yore accomplished. However, we cannot have this very badly needed dialogue with the followers of the tea party unless we make it clear that we understand where they are coming from. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: Tea party correct that government not responsive to majority .
He says they are right to be disgusted by Washington deals that grant special favors .
He says tea party movement is wrong about the solution .
Gutting government is not the answer; getting it on the right track is, says Etzioni ."
"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- California's Senate has voted down a measure that would have banned plastic bags at grocery stores. The new ban was rejected by a 21 to 14 vote late Tuesday. The ban would have included grocery stores, convenience stores and drugstores. The California Assembly passed the legislation in June. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had said he would have signed the measure into law, the Los Angeles Times reported. Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club encouraged Californians to contact their state senators to push for the measure. The group Heal the Bay produced what it calls a ""mockumentary,"" narrated by actor Jeremy Irons, called ""The Majestic Plastic Bag"" that charts the life of a plastic bag. The video is on YouTube. The measure had its opponents, too. The American Chemistry Council criticized California Assemblywoman Julia Brownley, D-Santa Monica, who proposed the bill. ""Assemblywoman Brownley's inflammatory comments are obviously intended to distract public attention from the substance and dire consequences of Assembly Bill 1998,"" the group said. ""Her proposed legislation to ban plastic grocery bags in California ... is bad for the economy and bad for the environment: It will eliminate several hundred California manufacturing jobs and dismantle existing plastic bag recycling programs."" According to its website, the chemistry council represents companies that ""make the products that make modern life possible, while working to protect the environment, public health, and the security of our nation."" In this case, that includes plastic bags. Brownley said she was disappointed with the vote. ""This is a sad day for California,"" Brownley said. ""Communities across the state were waiting for the state to adopt a uniform, statewide ban on single-use bags before they adopt their own ordinances. The state failed them."" Brownley has been fighting to reduce plastic bag waste for three years, calling single-use bags ""an unnecessary scourge that blows like urban tumbleweeds into every corner of the earth."" Her bill gained support from the California Grocers Association, which decided to back the bill after Brownley agreed to subject all stores that sell groceries to the ban. CNN's Adam Blank contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawmaker who proposed bill is disappointed .

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Walking down a street in Cambodia's capital city, Phymean Noun finished her lunch and tossed her chicken bones into the trash. Seconds later, she watched in horror as several children fought to reclaim her discarded food. Phymean Noun is helping give Cambodian children a chance at a better life. Noun stopped to talk with them. After hearing their stories of hardship, she knew she couldn't ignore their plight. ""I must do something to help these children get an education,"" she recalls thinking. ""Even though they don't have money and live on the sidewalk, they deserve to go to school."" Six years after that incident, Noun is helping many of Phnom Penh's poorest children do just that. Within weeks, she quit her job and started an organization to give underprivileged children an education. Noun spent $30,000 of her own money to get her first school off the ground. In 2004, her organization -- the People Improvement Organization (PIO) -- opened a school at Phnom Penh's largest municipal trash dump, where children are a large source of labor. Today, Noun provides 240 kids from the trash dump a free education, food, health services and an opportunity to be a child in a safe environment.  Watch Noun and some of the children who attend her school » . It is no easy task. Hundreds of them risk their lives every day working to support themselves and their families. ""I have seen a lot of kids killed by the garbage trucks,"" she recalls. Children as young as 7 scavenge hours at a time for recyclable materials. They make cents a day selling cans, metals and plastic bags. Noun recruits the children at the dump to attend her organization because, she says, ""I don't want them to continue picking trash and living in the dump. I want them to have an opportunity to learn.""  Watch Noun describe what life is like for children at the trash dump » . Growing up during the Pol Pot regime, Noun faced unimaginable challenges. ""There were no schools during Pol Pot's regime,"" she recalls. ""Everyone had to work in the fields. My mother was very smart. She told them that she didn't have an education. That was how she survived. If they knew she was educated, they would have killed her."" Noun's mother died of cancer when Phymean was 15. Phymean's sister fled to a refugee camp, leaving her young daughter in Phymean's care. ""When my mom passed away, my life was horrible, "" says Noun. ""It was very sad because there was only my niece who was 3 years old at that time."" Yet Noun was determined to finish high school.  Watch Noun describe the hardships of life during the Pol Pot regime » . That dedication paid off, and after graduating she spent the next decade working with various aid organizations. ""I tell the children my story and about the importance of education,"" she said. ""I'm their role model."" Some of the children who attend her school continue to work in the dump to support themselves and their families. Without an education, she said, these children would be vulnerable to traffickers or continue to be caught in the cycle of poverty. ""We are trying to provide them skills that they can use in the future,"" Noun said. ""Even though we are poor and struggling and don't have money, we can go to school. I tell them not to give up hope."" Noun has even bigger plans for them. ""These children are our next generation and our country depends on them.

"(CNN) -- Even 6-year-olds at Hamilton Central School in central New York came to school prepared for swine flu. Jessica Poyer, a first-grade teacher, noticed in the spring that kids had begun bringing their own hand sanitizer, tissues and water bottles. Guidelines on when schools should dismiss the student body because of H1N1 were released Friday. Poyer, also the mother of two young children, thinks about swine flu, also known as influenza A H1N1, every day, both at school and at home. She knows that some schools nationwide have had to close because the disease was widespread, and she has mixed feelings about the school closures. ""I hate to close schools, because it interrupts learning, but we leave it up to health professionals,"" said Poyer, who lives in Deansboro, New York. Federal health officials, releasing guidelines Friday, suggested  that closure of schools this fall be rare. ""There are measures we can take to protect the students, protect the staff, and to allow learning to continue,"" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A key change in the new guidance is that people with H1N1 should stay out of school for 24 hours after their fever is gone, regardless of whether they are taking medication such as Tamiflu. Before, the recommendation was seven days, Frieden said.  Watch a report on the new recommendations » . In the current context of the H1N1 outbreak, if it is similar to the situation in the spring, schools should consider closing if most or all students have particular medical needs, such as children on ventilators or pregnant teens, Frieden said. In addition, some districts may decide that because there are so many cases of H1N1, from an administrative point of view, they cannot stay open, he said. In addition, despite telling parents to keep sick children home, some parents may continue to send their children to school with a fever -- a situation that resulted in the closing of some New York schools in the spring, Frieden said. Officials emphasized that school closures are ultimately local decisions, which Superintendent Al Hambrick at the Sherman Independent School District in North Texas also stresses. He said his district will always take federal guidance into account, but individual localities will handle the H1N1 situation differently depending on the particular circumstances of the outbreak. If there are cases of swine flu at Sherman ISD, and the federal guidelines suggested that children shouldn't necessarily be sent home, the school may decide to dismiss the students anyway, he said. ""We might send the whole school home because we want to sanitize the building,"" he said. Ryan Koczot, a teacher at Broad Creek Middle School in Newport, North Carolina, believes that if proper precautions are taken early, such as telling parents to keep their sick children at home, schools will not have to close. He is concerned about creating panic among faculty, staff and students, and about making up lost days at the end of the year. ""Let the individual students and parents handle it,"" he said. Tara Whittington, a math teacher at Villa Rica High School near Atlanta, Georgia, who makes hand sanitizer available for her students, considers school closures a waste of time if only one student has H1N1, but supports dismissal if a quarter of the students become ill. ""By the time a fourth of the students have it, your school may be the cause of it being spread between the students, need to step in and clean it out,"" she said. Boston Public Schools in Massachusetts had 10 closings in the spring, which came about through collaborative decisions between the city public health commission and the superintendent, said Matt Wilder, spokesman for the schools. In Georgia, the final decision about closing schools because of H1N1 is usually up to the local school board with input from local and state public health officials, the Department of Community Health said. ""Some school closures may be based on operational interruption due to a significant percentage of student and staff absences, while some school closures may be based on a recommendation of public health to reduce the virus spread,"" the department said in a statement. The novel virus is known to have been circulating worldwide since April. There have been 353 deaths, and more than 5,500 people have been hospitalized for H1N1 in the United States so far, according to the CDC. In Montgomery County, Maryland, public school principals have been asked to come up with plans for giving students lessons in the event of school closings, said schools spokeswoman Kate Harrison. One option for continuing instruction is a Web resource called Edline, which lets them post lessons and assignments online, she said. There is also a cable television station that could be used to broadcast lessons, she said. These Maryland schools, which will follow the guidance of local health authorities on school closings, have also ordered hospital-grade face masks, she said. It is still unclear under what circumstances these masks would be used, but, for example, employees who have to work together closely may use them, she said.  Watch the U.S. education secretary talk about preparedness » . Other schools across the country are ramping up their cleaning efforts to prevent H1N1 transmission. At Sherman ISD in Texas, the staff is disinfecting door handles during the upcoming school year, something the school didn't do before, Hambrick said. Most schools in the district have hand sanitizer in every classroom, he said. Sherman ISD schools, which have not had any confirmed cases of the virus, will also be distributing informational pamphlets about H1N1, he said. For athletic practices, coaches discourage the sharing of towels and water bottles, Hambrick said. In the spring, the schools canceled field trips to places where there had been reported cases of H1N1, he said. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told government leaders last month that a vaccine to fight the H1N1 virus should be ready for distribution in mid-October. At what point schools should close because of the new virus, if ever, is a matter of controversy. A recent study in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases concludes that there are a lot of uncertainties about the consequences of closing schools during a pandemic -- for example, the ways that children interact when they are not in school. For example, children may mix with each other at the mall if school is not in session, said Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Public Health, who was not involved with the study. Moreover, school provides a relatively safe environment, whereas other problems could arise outside school such as children getting hit by cars, he said. Disinfecting classrooms may not be so effective, either, because the virus dies within about three hours, he said. ""If people will stay away from school when they are sick and do the ABCDs, that will mollify, or make less severe, the transmission of disease in schools,"" he said.","NEW: Federal agency releases guidance on closures related to H1N1 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Before President Obama says a word during his Tuesday Oval Office address, the backdrop will make a statement for him: that he is the decider. Obama is set to give his second Oval Office address, a speech meant to mark the end of combat missions in Iraq. But besides the remarks he will make, the setting of his speech will convey something, too. ""The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office, that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs,"" says presidential historian Robert Dallek. ""[When] a talk to the nation is given from that office, [it] is underscoring his executive powers, his leadership."" The Oval Office symbolizes power, command, and authority, Dallek said. It shows the president, ""as George W. Bush put it, is the 'decider' "" and that symbolism is important. For example, former President George H.W. Bush announced the start of the first Gulf war from the Oval Office, telling Americans and the world that he was the commander in chief just by setting the scene in the Oval Office. And on the night of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, former President George W. Bush spoke to the American people from the Oval Office, to show he was in command and to reassure the nation. Dallek points out the differences between giving a speech in the Oval Office versus a speech in a different venue. For example, Obama's speech in front of the joint session of Congress a year ago conveyed his desire to get Congress to act on health care reform. ""A joint session of Congress has a different function,"" Dallek said. A speech in front of both the Senate and House shows the president is ""trying to convince Congress to join with him."" When Obama addressed both chambers in September 2009, the health care debate was still waging. He called for bipartisan proposals to address health care reform and focused attention on the issue, on Congress and on the presidency. An Oval Office address is different. The prime-time address focuses the attention singularly on the subject matter. ""Presidents don't give speeches from the Oval Office casually,"" Dallek said. ""It's given with forethought and consideration. So the fact that he's giving the current speech about the end of America's combat role in Iraq is something that he wishes to emphasize and underscore and in a sense I think it's a demonstration of his completion of his mission or fulfillment of a commitment that he made."" Because of the singular focus on the subject matter during Obama's Tuesday evening address, Obama will have to navigate the tricky road of marking the end of a war he did not support and honoring the lives of all the Americans killed in the war, Dallek said. Obama must use a ""certain amount of domestic diplomacy to bring the war to a close; you don't just end the war and say it's a mistake. It's unpalatable because of all the deaths,"" Dallek said. So Obama must do it in a way that is ""politically palatable to the American public -- that is at the heart"" of his address Tuesday, Dallek said. The Oval Office will also help convey a sense of intimacy of the message. Since former President Jimmy Carter, each president has delivered his farewell address from that room, using the office of the presidency to say goodbye to the American public. President Reagan used the intimate space to comfort the public after space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. President Johnson used the room in 1968 to tell Americans he would not seek re-election and President Nixon gave several speeches regarding the Watergate scandal, including his decision to resign from the presidency in the wake of Watergate in 1974. Obama's other Oval Office address was two months ago to address the nation about the Gulf oil disaster. And who does the presidential historian think was most successful at intimate talks to the American people? Franklin Roosevelt's fireside addresses -- although there were no televisions at the time, these radio talks were effective in boosting the country's confidence.","Obama to give Oval Office address on end of combat mission in Iraq .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- India offered another $20 million in aid to its neighbor and rival Pakistan on Tuesday, but an official in the flood-ravaged country said he has no knowledge of the aid. Abdul Basit, spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday he is not aware of such an offer by India. Basit said India was formally notified that Pakistan would accept an earlier offer of $5 million through the United Nations -- but not directly from India. He said Pakistan did not accept the aid directly from India because ""that is our government's policy."" However, Basit said, Pakistan has received aid directly from other countries. The world community has geared up to help Pakistan recover from the devastating floods. More than 1,600 people have died in the colossal tragedy, according to the country's disaster authority, and at least 17 million Pakistanis have been affected. In the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton encouraged donations to the Pakistan Relief Fund In television and radio public service announcements released by the Ad Council on Tuesday. The new PSAs, which include television and radio spots and Web banners, urge audiences to visit www.state.gov, where they can make donations. ""Now is a time for our shared humanity to move us to help. That is why the United States government through the Department of State has established the Pakistan Relief Fund for all Americans to join in this tremendous relief, recovery and reconstruction effort,"" Clinton says in the message. The money will go toward U.S. government programs or to give money to international programs focused on relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Pakistan. Daniel Feldman, deputy to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told reporters on Monday that the flood crest is reaching the Indian Ocean, but it may take weeks to determine what Pakistan will need to recover, and ""we calculate that the needs are going to be absolutely vast."" ""The good news at this point is is that in most places waters are no longer rising but are finally receding,"" Feldman said. He also said that the United States is planning to deploy 18 more helicopters to supplement the 15 already there. He said that, in addition to some $200 million in aid pledged by the U.S. government, American companies are providing assistance -- including $1 million from Coca Cola and $1 million and dried food items from Sheraton, $1 million . from BP, and $600,000 in cash and water purification tablets from Procter & Gamble. The U.N. World Health Organization said this week that health services are a priority for humanitarian agencies, as many of those affected by the floods need treatment for diarrhea, skin infections, respiratory problems and malaria. WHO said about 400 of the more than 1,000 health facilities in flood-affected regions have been damaged or destroyed, and it could take months before such facilities can be rebuilt or restored. About 3.7 million people were reported to have received some medical treatment from July 29 to August 23.. ""Of those, 500,000 were cases of acute diarrhoea, 517,000 involved acute respiratory infections, there were 693,000 cases of skin infections and 94,000 suspected cases of malaria,"" the United.Nations said.","An earlier offer via U.N. was OK'd by Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- The California State Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on a bill that would ban the use of plastic bags by retailers in the state, including grocery stores, convenience stores and drugstores.  This year's Senate session ends Tuesday, so it's the last opportunity for the Senate to pass the bill. The California Assembly passed the legislation in June. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he would sign the measure into law, the Los Angeles Times reported. Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club have encouraged Californians to contact their state senators to push for the measure.  The group Heal the Bay produced what it calls a ""mockumentary,"" narrated by actor Jeremy Irons, called ""The Majestic Plastic Bag"" that charts the life of a plastic bag. The video is on YouTube. But the measure has its opponents, too. The American Chemistry Council criticized California Assemblywoman Julia Brownley, D-Santa Monica, who proposed the bill. ""Assemblywoman Brownley's inflammatory comments are obviously intended to distract public attention from the substance and dire consequences of Assembly Bill 1998,"" the group said.  ""Her proposed legislation to ban plastic grocery bags in California ... is bad for the economy and bad for the environment:  It will eliminate several hundred California manufacturing jobs and dismantle existing plastic bag recycling programs."" According to its website, the chemistry council represents companies that ""make the products that make modern life possible, while working to protect the environment, public health, and the security of our nation.""  In this case, that includes plastic bags. ""We had to work hard to win passage for the bill in the Assembly and I anticipate an equally hard battle in the Senate,"" Brownley told CNN in June. ""Nasty habits, like our reliance on plastic and paper bags, are hard to break."" Brownley has been fighting to reduce plastic bag waste for three years, calling single-use bags ""an unnecessary scourge that blows like urban tumbleweeds into every corner of the earth."" Her bill has gained support from the California Grocers Association, which decided to back the bill after Brownley agreed to subject all stores that sell groceries to the ban. ""Our hope is the consumer is driven towards reusable bags"", says Dave Hanley, vice president of the grocers association. ""We have a huge responsibility to educate consumers."" However, Hanley told CNN he's acutely aware of the speed bumps the legislation might encounter along the road to passage. For instance, he said, the bill requires grocery stores to sell reusable bags for at least 5 cents if customers don't bring their own. ""With the economy, there's always the concern when legislation has fees,"" Hanley said. Californians appear to be split on the issue. While some people told HLN recently they could go either way, others said a ban would be beneficial.  ""I'm one of those people who's really good at picking up cloth bags, and really bad at remembering to bring them to the store,"" one woman told HLN.  ""It could be just the kick I need to make sure I use recycled bags."" Another wondered whether it really mattered.  ""It's not just plastic bags.  I mean, everything else I get that comes in a container is in plastic,"" one man told HLN.  ""Just eliminating plastic bags, as far as I'm concerned, you are not really making that big an impact."" So just how much plastic and paper bag waste do we produce a year? According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn, 3.96 million tons of plastic bags, sacks and wraps were generated in 2008 in the United States alone. That's more than three times the 1.17 million tons of waste generated by paper bags and sacks that same year. And of that, what's being recycled? A combined total of 830,000 tons of plastic and paper bags was recycled in 2008, while a combined total of 4.3 million tons was discarded, according to the EPA -- the equivalent, speaking in terms of weight, of nearly 24 jumbo jets. San Francisco already has a ban on plastic bag use, and it's not the only city where such a law has been discussed. Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Dallas, Texas; and Portland, Oregon, just to name a few, have all considered the environmental impact of plastic bag distribution. And then there's the global initiative currently underway. Several cities in China, Africa, Australia, India and Ireland have all imposed bans or surcharges on plastic bags. Prior to China's ban, an estimated 3 billion plastic bags were used on a daily basis, creating more than 3 million tons of garbage each year, according to the website World Watch Institute, an independent research organization which has programs that focus on areas such as the climate, energy, food and agriculture. CNN's Adam Blank contributed to this report.","California state senators are expected to vote on plastic bag ban Tuesday .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was released from the Lynwood Correctional Facility early Monday morning after less than two weeks behind bars, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Lohan was released at 1:35 a.m. (4:35 a.m. ET), Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Benjamin Grubb said. He said she was taken to a treatment facility. After Lohan was taken to jail July 20, a sheriff's spokesman said her stay would likely last between 13 and 15 days. Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel sentenced Lohan to 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. But the sheriff, who runs the jail, has the power to release prisoners early because of jail overcrowding. Lohan was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program after her jail term is completed. Revel ordered Lohan to enter a program within 24 hours of leaving jail. ""I would like the transition to be sooner rather than later,"" Revel said last month. She said Lohan's next court date would come a week after her release from jail, although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""

"Amsterdam, Netherlands (CNN) -- Two men arrested at Schiphol International Airport in the Netherlands are being held on suspicion of plotting a terrorist act, Dutch authorities said Tuesday. They are Yemeni citizens who were en route to the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, from Chicago, Illinois, officials said. They were arrested Monday morning and authorities continued to question them Tuesday, Dutch prosecutors said. A U.S. law enforcement source said Monday the men may have been trying to test U.S. airport security by putting bottles attached to electronic devices in their checked baggage. But two U.S. government officials said Tuesday an initial U.S. investigation into the men shows no evidence of terrorism and no indication the men even knew each other. ""This looks like nothing,"" said one of the officials, saying both men missed flights in Chicago because of a gate change and their airline rebooked them onto the same plane. ""We see no evidence of a dry run or a connection to terrorism,"" said the source, who is not authorized to discuss the case with the media and asked not to be named. The Department of Homeland Security noted that the two men ""have not been charged with any crime in the United States"" and cautioned ""against jumping to any conclusions."" Appropriate airport security protocols were followed, the department said. ""In this instance, sound judgment led to suspicious items being identified, which triggered automatic security responses by U.S. security personnel,"" the department said. "" ... When the investigation tells us more, we will let you know, but we don't have anything else at this time."" An announcement about whether the men will be charged will be made ""in a few days,"" Dutch authorities said in a statement. The men were still being held at Schiphol Airport on Tuesday, said Martijn Boelhouwer, a spokesman for Dutch prosecutors. Another U.S. official said the Dutch are being cautious and checking everything. That official, who also asked not to be named, said the United States is doing the same and is continuing to investigate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Monday the two were arrested after ""suspicious items"" in their luggage raised concern. ""The items were not deemed to be dangerous in and of themselves, and as we share information with our international partners, Dutch authorities were notified of the suspicious items,"" the U.S. agency said. ""This matter continues to be under investigation."" Those items were an empty shampoo bottle with watches attached to it and an empty bottle of a stomach medicine with mobile phones attached, according to the U.S. law enforcement source, who has been briefed on the investigation. Dutch authorities confirmed that one phone was found taped to a bottle and seized in the United States. Nothing else suspicious was found in the men's luggage, the Dutch said. The items have raised concern that the men may have been testing a future terrorist plot, the source said. Attempts to sneak liquid explosives aboard jetliners were at the heart of a 2006 plot broken up by British authorities. That case led U.S. authorities to ban all but small quantities of liquids from aircraft cabins. U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that the checked bags contained knives and box cutters as well. Passengers have been banned from carrying those items on aircraft since the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, but they are allowed in checked bags. The source identified the men aboard United Airlines Flight 908, from Chicago, Illinois, to Amsterdam, as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al-Soofi and Hezem al-Murisi. Al-Soofi began his trip by boarding a flight in Birmingham, Alabama, and al-Murisi originally flew from Memphis, Tennessee, the law enforcement source said. A co-worker of al-Soofi said he was not known to express anti-American opinions and was ""not a very good Muslim"" because he drinks beer. Al-Soofi had been back to Yemen at least twice before to deliver money and gifts, and bought watches and cell phones as gifts for family members on this trip, said co-worker Ali Moqbel in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Al-Murisi was scheduled to fly from Chicago to Yemen, with connections in Washington and Dubai, a U.S. government official said, but his flight was changed to go from Chicago to Amsterdam. Another U.S. law enforcement official said both men were in the United States legally. That official said neither of the passengers was carrying items that are barred from aircraft, and federal air marshals were aboard the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight. Al-Soofi's luggage went aboard the Chicago-to-Washington flight without him, the source said, in what amounted to another violation of U.S. safety protocols. A U.S. government official said items in at least one of the bags were being examined by law enforcement authorities at Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday night. The official said al-Soofi and al-Murisi were seated near each other on the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight, but were not seated next to each other.

"Washington (CNN) -- A House ethics investigative panel has charged a high-ranking Democratic congresswoman with violating House rules by seeking federal assistance for a bank with financial ties to her husband. According to the House ethics committee, California Rep. Maxine Waters helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials. OneUnited Bank ultimately received $12 million in bailout funds. Waters is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. Waters, according to a preliminary report, called then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson during the height of the financial crisis ""and requested that Treasury Department officials meet with representatives from the National Bankers Association,"" an organization representating over 100 minority-owned banks. ""A meeting was in fact granted, however, the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- OneUnited. Rep. Waters' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and, at the time of the meeting, was a stock holder of the bank."" The report states that Waters approached Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, to say that she was ""in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank, but 'OneUnited people' were coming to her for help."" Waters, ""according to (Frank) ... knew she should say no, but it bothered her. It was clear to (Frank) that this was a 'conflict of interest problem.'"" Frank's advice to Waters, the report states, was to 'stay out of it.'"" According to Waters' 2008 financial disclosure statement -- as mentioned in the report -- her husband had two investments in OneUnited at the time valued between $500,000 and $1 million. ""There is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Waters' conduct may have violated"" House rules, the report concludes. Waters, a 71-year-old 10-term Democrat representing the Watts section of Los Angeles, insists she did nothing wrong. ""I have not violated any House rules,"" she said in a statement released Monday. ""I simply will not be forced to admit to something I did not do."" Waters asserted that ""the record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor I benefited in any way, engaged in improper action or influenced anyone. ... The case against me has no merit."" Waters stressed that the meeting ""was requested and scheduled on behalf of the (National Bankers Association), not on behalf of OneUnited Bank as has been suggested."" The announcement by the ethics committee means Waters may now face a trial by committee members tasked with determining whether there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" she broke congressional rules. Also facing a possible ethics committee trial: Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has been accused of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. Both trials could take place in September -- only a few weeks before the midterm elections. The prospect of inquiries into two high-profile Democrats has compounded the fears of congressional Democrats nervous about their prospects in November. The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation. Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America.

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains caused flash flooding across the Boston metro area Saturday, stranding cars and causing damage, the National Weather Service reported. No injuries were immediately reported. Flash flood warnings were issued for four counties in eastern Massachusetts, and 2 to 4 inches of rain fell in the region, according to the weather service. There were several reports of cars getting stuck in floodwaters, particularly in the Somerville area, northwest of Boston, where the weather service said at least five vehicles were stranded underneath the Assembly Square Underpass. Video from CNN affiliates WHDH and WCVB showed the vehicles fully submerged beneath the underpass. Drivers had to be rescued from their cars when the tunnel filled with up to 18 feet of water, according to an off-duty police officer involved with the rescue efforts. The officer told WCVB that the water was heavily mixed with sewage. The flooding also forced the closures of at least two bridges. Witnesses told WHDH that cars were also submerged around the bridges and residents waded through water up to their knees. Some locals said they helped direct traffic since lights were knocked out by the storms. The bad weather also disrupted travel for the Boston area transit system. Joe Pesaturo, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, told CNN affiliate WCVB that there were weather-related delays during the afternoon, including the suspension of rail service in one area due to water on the tracks.","Storms cause flash flooding in eastern Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities searching a man with a bulge under his shirt at the airport in the nation's capital found 18 monkeys hidden beneath his clothes, police said. Investigators grew suspicious after Roberto Sol Cabrera Zavaleta, 38, became ""markedly nervous"" when asked what he was transporting, Mexico's Public Safety Department said. Two of the tiny titi monkeys he was carrying in a belt were dead, the department said in a statement, and 16 of them survived the journey from Lima, Peru. Cabrera has been detained as authorities continue their investigation, the statement said. In an interview with authorities released by police, Cabrera said he first carried the monkeys in his suitcase, but then hid the animals in his clothes so they would not be harmed by X-ray machines at the airport. Cabrera described the animals as ""pets"" and told authorities he had purchased them for $30. Titi monkeys are protected endangered species requiring a permit for possession, police said. Images released by police show the tiny creatures, many of which are tied up in pouches, squirming in a cardboard box.","Police say the man was carrying 18 monkeys in a belt under his shirt .

"Kapikoy, Turkey (CNN) -- Hamide Yeni is a woman on the hunt. The women's rights activist wears a determined expression on her face as she paces the dirt roads of this remote village, looking for the man who Turkish authorities say beat his wife and put her in a hospital twice in less than 12 months. ""Have you seen Faruk?"" she asks the village mayor's daughter. ""He disappeared with his car."" ""No one's seen him,"" the woman replies. Some other villagers retreat behind the mud-brick walls of their homes as Yeni approaches. Convicted wife beater . The man Yeni is looking for is Faruk Platin, one of the 600 residents of Kapikoy. Last fall, a court sentenced him to 15 months in prison for assault, after his 30-year old wife Sidika was hospitalized with trauma wounds. Video footage filmed in September of 2009 shows Sidika outside of the hospital in the provincial capital of Van. Her face was horribly bruised; her head encased in bandages. Part of Sidika's right ear had been sliced off. The woman could barely walk and leaned on her brother for support, as she hobbled a few short steps into the hospital. After the incident, Turkish authorities separated Sidika Platin and her children from her husband and placed them in a state-run women's shelter. But barely two months later, a local criminal court asked that Sidika and her children be handed back to Faruk Platin. He had not served any jail time for beating his wife. ""At that time, because he showed regret and because his [criminal] record was clean, his sentence was postponed,"" said Meral Demirbas, the governor of Saray district where Kapikoy is located. ""Also, the wife withdrew her complaint."" Sidika Platin is an ethnic Kurd who speaks no Turkish. According to eyewitnesses, when she appeared in court, she could not understand the judge or prosecutor, and relied on her husband to translate legal proceedings. On a snowy day last December, local women's rights activists like Hamide Yeni could do little more then watch helplessly, as Faruk Platin led his mutilated wife away from the courtyard, back to the village where they lived. Widespread violence against women . ""This kind of thing happens in every village,"" says Yeni, one of the founders of a grassroots local family protection association in the Saray district of southeastern Turkey. ""There are thousands of women like Sidika out here."" In fact, according to a 2009 Turkish government report, 42 percent of women surveyed said they had been the victims of either physical or sexual abuse by their husband or partner. The report concluded that one in four married Turkish women had been injured by partner violence. Meanwhile, one in ten Turkish women were injured by such violence while pregnant. Some Turkish activists fear the real statistics for violence against women may actually be much higher. ""In all domestic surveys there are 'shadow figures.' That is because women are not willing to tell about the violence, it's a very sensitive issue,"" says Pinar Ilkkaracan, a co-founder of the Istanbul-based group Women for Women's Human Rights. ""We think it's much higher than 42 percent."" Domestic violence against women is not confined to economically-depressed, rural regions of eastern Turkey. According to the Turkish government survey, the statistics for physical and sexual assault were roughly the same in the countryside as in the most developed, fast-growing cities in the western part of the country. Over the past 15 years, Turkey has adopted several progressive pieces of legislation to protect women, including a 1998 Protection Order against Domestic Violence. Reform of Turkey's Civil Code in 2001 gave women legal equal status to men in the family. Meanwhile, changes to the country's Penal Code in 2004 criminalized marital rape. But critics argue that the Turkish state has lapsed far behind in implementing these laws. ""The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse, but the government did not effectively enforce it,"" the U.S. State Department said in its 2009 human rights report on Turkey. Despite widespread violence against women, in 2009 the Turkish government reported there were only 52 state-run shelters for women in the entire country. Those shelters have the capacity to house less than 1,300 residents, in a country where the population exceeds 70 million. ""There is a lack of coordinated action and strong will on the part of the government to stop violence against women,"" says Ilkkaracan. 'It looks as if she was tortured' Not long after Sidika Platin returned to the village of Kapikoy, neighbors and relatives began contacting authorities, reporting that her husband was once again beating her. But Sidika's parents and siblings said Faruk Platin repeatedly threatened them when they tried to intervene. Sidika's brother claims on one such occasion, his brother-in-law beat him up. ""That man started beating my daughter the day she put on her wedding dress and he has been violent with her ever since,"" said Cemile Ozer, Sidika's mother. ""I wish he killed her long ago to spare her all the suffering."" In early July, gendarme security forces were summoned to the crude house where the Platin family lived. Niyazi Yakin, a member of the Kapikoy village council and a relative of Faruk Platin, says he personally asked Sidika if she was being abused, and she said no. ""She deserved what happened,"" Yakin said. ""Because we gave her the chance to leave him and she didn't."" On July 15, Faruk Platin brought his wife to the hospital in Van. ""When the doctors discovered that she was battered, the husband escaped,"" the Van Social Services Directorate announced in a written statement on July 19. Doctors at Van hospital said Sidika had trauma marks on various locations on her head, infections from injuries, a fever and there was a third-degree burn in the shape of an iron on her back. ""It looked as if she had been tortured,"" one Van hospital doctor told CNN, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give an interview. Though there was no evidence of brain damage, for more then two weeks after being hospitalized, Sidika was in a near-catatonic state, unable to move or respond to questions. Hakan Cankaya, the deputy chief doctor at the hospital, said psychiatrists suspected she suffered from extreme post-traumatic stress disorder. He added that the hospital frequently received female patients who appeared to be victims of abuse. ""Usually if a woman comes in who has been beaten, she will say 'I fell down the stairs' or 'I bumped into the refrigator,"" Cankaya said. ""It stays in the family...and as doctors, we cannot interfere."" Meral Demirbas, the district governor of Saray, told CNN an arrest warrant has been issued for Faruk Platin, who is on the loose. But Hamide Yeni says that is not enough. ""The state is guilty, the system is guilty,"" she says. ""It failed to protect the victim."" The governor of Van province and Turkey's minister of state responsible for women's and family affairs did not respond to numerous requests from CNN to comment on the case. Both officials have made visits to Sidika's bedside in Van hospital. In village of Kapikoy, where many residents eke out a living herding sheep, Yeni goes house to house, dressed in a long skirt and loose headscarf, asking locals why they did not speak up about the violence that had been taking place in their community. ""It wasn't our responsibility,"" insists Saban Altinli, a brother of the village muhtar, or mayor. ""When there is violence, it doesn't matter if it's your relative,"" Yeni responds. ""You can still make a call and inform that this woman is being beaten.""","Statistics show the violence is in urban and rural regions .
Turkey has adopted legislation to protect women .
There are only 52 state-run shelters for women in the nation ."
"(CNN) -- Three crew members were killed and one was injured Wednesday when a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crashed in waters near James Island in LaPush, Washington, officials said. The surviving crew member is hospitalized in Seattle with non-life threatening injuries, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Gary Blore. The helicopter, a MH-60 Jayhawk, was flying to Sitka, Alaska, after departing the Coast Guard Air Station in Astoria, Oregon. ""The Coast Guard lost communication with the helicopter around 9:30 a.m. PT (12:30 p.m. ET),"" said Blore. ""Rescue crews were launched shortly after that."" The survivor was pulled from the water by a good samaritan and transferred to a medical facility, said the Coast Guard. The recovery phase for those killed is continuing, said Blore. ""The helicopter is in the water, inverted,"" he said. ""There are power lines down at the beach."" The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a flight restriction in the area near the crash to allow response crews to search without distractions, said the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the accident, said Blore. With his voice cracking at times, Blore told reporters at a media briefing Wednesday afternoon that accidents such as this are deeply personal to members of the Coast Guard. ""We all have flown helicopters, we have flown the same machine. This hits close to home,"" he said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The mother of a California woman missing for nearly a year is dismissing a recent turn in the search for her daughter that has led investigators to Las Vegas, Nevada. In a statement released Sunday, Latice Sutton -- mother of Mitrice Richardson -- said she ""does not believe Mitrice is in Las Vegas, nor does she believe the sighting of Mitrice by a teenage acquaintance is a credible sighting since he has not seen her since she was 15 years old, which was over nine years ago."" Sutton, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies for negligence in her daughter's disappearance, suggested the recent turn in the investigation could be a ""diversionary tactic"" by California authorities. Investigators have spent about six weeks checking out a high school classmate's report that he saw Richardson at a hotel casino, and are ""unable to show that it is not a good lead,"" Los Angeles, California, police Capt. Kevin McClure said Thursday. Detectives have talked to several witnesses since then who believe they have seen her in the area, he said. Richardson, who would be 25 now, is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Malibu, California, in the early morning hours of September 17, 2009. She had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal, and patrons at the restaurant said she exhibited strange behavior. Her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff's station until a relative arrived to pick her up. ""Latice Sutton hopes this is not a diversionary tactic to redirect attention and efforts away from where Mitrice was last known to be last seen -- leaving the Los Angeles Sheriff's department, Malibu/Lost Hills station, without her cell phone, money, transportation, or asthma medication, which is where their massive search efforts and public plea should be concentrated,"" the statement, signed by Sutton, said. It added: ""The more time spent following leads in Las Vegas, is less time spent following up on facts in the Calabasas [California] and surrounding area."" Sutton also disputed authorities' claims that the person who reported seeing Richardson in Las Vegas spent significant time with her daughter. ""Contrary to law enforcement official statements during their press conference, Mitrice did not grow up with, go to school with, nor spend any significant time with this witness,"" the statement said. According to the wrongful death and negligence suit filed last month in Los Angeles Superior Court, authorities launched a homicide investigation into Richardson's disappearance in December. The lawsuit claims Richardson suffered ""grievous bodily harm and loss of life."" Sutton argues in the lawsuit that the sheriff's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that Richardson was released ""alone in an unfamiliar area without money, a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence."" The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff's department, told CNN in September that the decision to release Richardson was made because ""she was not intoxicated, she didn't exhibit any mental issues, so when we were done running her fingerprints and criminal history, then we are obligated by law to release her from custody."" Police have not discounted the possibility that Richardson may not want to be found, but her family believes that would be ""out of her character,"" McClure said. ""We could find that out, but we'll never know that until we actually talk to Mitrice,"" he said. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","Mother of Mitrice Richardson does not believe her daughter is in Las Vegas .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Calling it an ""unprecedented development,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Monday the U.N. will launch a panel of inquiry to investigate the May 31 Gaza flotilla incident that left nine Turkish activists dead. ""For the past two months, I have engaged in intensive consultation with the leaders of Israel and Turkey on the setting-up of a panel of inquiry on the flotilla incident,"" Ban said in a statement. ""Today I am very pleased to announce the launch of the panel. This is an unprecedented development. I thank the leaders of the two countries with whom I have engaged in last-minute consultations over the weekend, for their spirit of compromise and forward-looking cooperation."" The panel will be led by Geoffrey Palmer, former prime minister of New Zealand, as chairman and Alvaro Uribe, outgoing Colombian president, as vice-chair, Ban said. Representatives from Israel and Turkey will be the panel's other two members. The panel will begin its work on August 10 and submit its first progress report by mid-September, the statement said. Ban said he hopes the panel's work will ""give me recommendations for the prevention of similar incidents in the future."" He said he also hopes the agreement will ""impact positively on the relationship between Turkey and Israel as well as the overall situation in the Middle East."" The United States welcomed the announcement. Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the panel will receive and review reports from both Israeli and Turkish investigations into the incident, and issue recommendations on how such incidents can be avoided in the future. ""The panel is not a substitute for those national investigations,"" Rice said in a statement. ""It complements them, affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international community."" Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those on board one boat in the flotilla, the Mavi Marmara. Soldiers were attacked with knives, metal poles and other objects, Israeli officials have said. But passengers on board the boat insist they were fired upon without provocation. The incident left a wide-ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey, its powerful regional ally, badly shaken and drew international outrage. Israel maintains it must inspect all goods entering Gaza so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that has said it is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Israel had asked the flotilla to dock at the port of Ashdod so its cargo could be inspected and transferred to Gaza, but flotilla members refused. ""Israel has nothing to hide,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. ""The opposite is true. It is in the national interest of the state of Israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world, and this is exactly the principle that we are advancing."" Israel had previously resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident, but an Israeli military investigation was conducted into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara and it criticized some aspects of the operation. The operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan, military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship, and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough, the report found. But the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly, with bravery and professionalism, and that the use of live fire against the activists was justified. The Israeli Commission of Inquiry also is conducting an ongoing investigation into the incident and is not expected to complete it for some time. Rice said the United States hopes the panel ""can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.""","The former New Zealand prime minister will chair the panel of inquiry .

"(CNN) -- Republicans are predicting big wins in the November midterms. Across the aisle, Democrats are saying the same thing about their chances at the polls. But both can't be right. Republicans speculate that they will take back the House -- and possibly the Senate -- as voters express their frustration at where Democrats and President Obama are taking the country. ""I think it's pretty clear that the American people are tired of the job-killing agenda in Washington, D.C. They want the spending spree to stop,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I think we're having a good year, but we've got a lot of work to do before the Election Day on November 2,"" he said. Boehner advised Republicans heading home for the August recess to ""talk about the better solutions that Republicans have been offering over the last 18 months."" His counterpart in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, encouraged her members to do the opposite. ""We've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents,"" she said on ABC's ""This Week."" Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said that although his party will probably lose a couple of seats, ""it's going to be a lot better than what people now look at."" Democrats hold a 256-179 advantage in the House and a 59-41 advantage in the Senate, including the two independents who caucus with Democrats. This year, 37 seats are up for grabs in the Senate, and 18 of those are considered at least somewhat vulnerable, according to The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter covering campaigns and politics. Eleven of those are held by Democrats, and seven are held by Republicans. In the House, all 435 seats are on the ballot, and 88 are considered vulnerable, according to Rothenberg. Twelve are held by Republicans, and 76 are held by Democrats. In order to net control, Republicans need to pick up 39 seats in the House and 10 in the Senate, said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. ""The most likely scenario is the Republicans gain 28 to 33 seats -- but the House is definitely in play. The majority is at significant risk for Democrats,"" Gonzales said. In the Senate, however, Republicans have a tougher task. ""Republicans need to win every competitive race in order to take the majority. It's possible but difficult,"" Gonzales said. Although the election is still three months out, the trajectory of the cycle is not going to change, Gonzales added. ""Republicans will gain seats in November. We just don't know how many yet,"" he said. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had some fellow Democrats fuming last month over his take on the midterms. ""I think there's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control. There's no doubt about that,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Asked Sunday about those comments, Pelosi said, ""with all due respect, I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another."" ""We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grass-roots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not,"" she said. After facing backlash from Democrats, Gibbs revised his prediction and said the party will hold on to the House and Senate. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll indicates that Democrats and Republicans are tied on which party can bring the kind of change the country needs. The Republicans hold an 8-point margin over the Democrats on the question of which party shares the respondents' view of the government and which party can effectively manage the government. ""These results illustrate the reasons why the Democrats are now behind on the so-called generic ballot question,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The Democrats manage no better than a virtual tie on issues, but they are behind when it comes to handling the government. And when the presidency is not at stake, the congressional elections are the only way that voters can do something about the direction the government will take."" Full results of the poll (PDF) A potential thorn for Democrats is the ethics cases dogging two House members. California Rep. Maxine Waters has chosen to face a House ethics trial rather than accept a finding of wrongdoing by the House ethics committee, according to a source familiar with the process. The ethics committee has been looking into whether Waters violated House rules when she helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between Treasury Department officials and a bank she and her husband had ties to financially. Longtime Rep. Charlie Rangel also could face an ethics trial, barring a settlement between him and the committee members. The House ethics committee last week accused Rangel, a New York Democrat, of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. Bill Kristol, editor of conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, said Republicans would be ""foolish"" to jump on the ethics problems because they are not unique to the Democratic Party. ""They should just shut up. There's a bipartisan ethics committee. Let the process go forward,"" he told Fox. ""Democrats are going to lose the House and suffer the loss of a lot of Senate seats because of their policies,"" Kristol said. ""And the idea that Republicans should go around throwing stones at Charlie Rangel, I think, is just foolish on their part."" Lawmakers are entering the most crucial part of the campaign season, when candidates start to engage each other and their messages begin to stick with voters. But as the cliché goes, three months is an eternity in politics. ""I'd love to have the election tomorrow, but obviously it's not tomorrow,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox when asked whether anything short of a Republican takeover could be considered a victory for Democrats. ""If the election were today, we'd certainly have a good day, but it's a long way until November. They have a lot of money. They've outspent us for the last three cycles, and I expect them to do it again. They're not going to go down easily,"" McConnell said.","""I think we're having a good year,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner says .

"(CNN) -- The defense in the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor filed an emergency motion to delay supermodel Naomi Campbell's testimony against him, the court announced Monday. She is scheduled to take the stand against him at the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone on Thursday. Prosecutors say Taylor gave her a diamond during the brutal war in Sierra Leone, contradicting Taylor's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict. The defense says it hasn't seen a copy of her testimony, which interferes with Taylor's right to a fair trial. Under tribunal rules, the defense team should get advance access to prosecution witness testimony so it can prepare its arguments. It asked the court to decide by Wednesday whether Campbell would testify Thursday, according to court papers. Campbell did not want to be involved in the trial but was subpoenaed on July 1 to appear at the tribunal for Taylor, who faces war crimes charges over a brutal conflict in Sierra Leone that was fueled by rough diamonds, also known as blood diamonds or conflict diamonds. Witnesses have said Taylor gave Campbell a diamond. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009. They asked to reopen it specifically to call Campbell, as well as actress Mia Farrow and a witness named Carole Taylor, court papers show. Prosecutors said they learned in June 2009 that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond in South Africa in 1997. Farrow confirmed it, they said. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the bloody civil war in Sierra Leone. It was fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior, and often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, sexual slavery and violence, and enslavement. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. CNN's Carol Jordan contributed to this report .","Naomi Campbell is due to testify in the trial of Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor .

"Dover, New Hampshire (CNN) -- The Tuttle farming legacy may come to an end soon. Since 1635, the Tuttle farm has been passed from father to son and after years of thought, Will Tuttle has put what's known as the country's longest family-run farm up for sale. As the 11th generation Tuttle man to farm this now 134-acre plot of land in New Hampshire, Will Tuttle says he has no regrets. ""I'm not a museum curator, I'm a farmer,"" Tuttle says. He's tall, lean and tanned from head to toe, apart from his red cheeks and white beard.  Shaking his head underneath the beating sun, he adds, ""I wasn't the first one. I may be the last one. You can't live anybody else's dream, and 57 years is enough."" Tuttle, now 63, left the farm to attend Tufts University in the 1970s. But after graduation, he grew tired of his job as a salesman and says he was drawn by the feeling of ""self-reliance, satisfaction at the end of the day"" that farming gave him. ""The variety of our lives here, as on every farm, is incredible,"" Tuttle says. ""Being out in the fresh air, being tired when I get home, that's all good stuff,"" he says, sighing, and adding that those also are the worst parts about farming. Tasking work . Tuttle wakes up at 4:30 a.m. and says he works anywhere from 12 to 17 hours a day. He says he's learned to ""survive on less sleep"" but admits he longs to spend more time with his children. As he trudges along rows of tall, ripe corn, Tuttle recalls what his grandfather once told him. ""He said be careful where you set foot on this farm because that footprint is going to be there for the rest of time, you're gonna leave your mark on this farm,"" he says. But in the end, Tuttle admits he ""had to take the weight of our ancestors off the decision, they're not here to advise us. I think probably most of them died with their boots on."" Tuttle says his health has been compromised by decades of farm work; he ruptured his Achilles tendon a couple of years ago and he says he suffers from neck and back problems. Standing next to her big brother Will, Lucy Tuttle confesses she has mixed feelings about selling the family's land and says it will be a tough adjustment. ""I feel a great sense of continuity here with the family,"" she says, ""To be standing there hoeing or weeding and to think about my father doing that or my grandfather doing that ... is just an incredible feeling."" But Will Tuttle says his two grown sons were not interested in running the family business and he couldn't make the decision for his two younger sons to carry on the tradition. ""I believe it would be unfair of me to say ... one of my kids is going to run it. I can't decide for them,"" he said. Customers and condolences . On a tour of Tuttle's Red Barn store, youngest sister Becky Tuttle, 58,  points to a heap of fresh radishes, proudly noting ""everything that says 'our own' on the sign was grown here."" The air-conditioned shop resembles a modern grocery store, but with freshly picked vegetables of all sizes and colors as the main attraction. Abundant varieties of squash and lettuce are lined up on shelves near a mound of the Tuttles' ""famous"" sweet corn. Fresh cucumbers are added as soon as they are scrubbed clean. Many regulars recognize Becky Tuttle and they ask about her family. They also offer their condolences. Kathleen McShera, a lifelong customer who shops at the store at least once a week, says the thought of the Tuttles selling their farm brings tears to her eyes. ""I've got goosebumps. It's really sad. It's a tradition. It's been here forever,"" she says. In 1956, when the Tuttles' parents started the farm stand store, Becky Tuttle says, ""This place became a destination for people, where they could come and know they were getting fresh, homegrown, quality vegetables."" Since then, she says, ""Supermarkets have caught up to speed"" on offering fresh vegetables and gourmet products and they have competitive prices that are hard to match. ""Places like Walmart and even the supermarkets with their buying power, to buy the products we sell, they are able to buy them cheaper at wholesale than we can,"" she says. That results in retail prices that are often cheaper than the Tuttles' wholesale prices. Fresh ideas, fresh backs . Although the Tuttles will not be working on the farm once it's sold, the three older Tuttle siblings remain hopeful about the land's future. As a first step of the selling process, the family went through a conservancy to ensure the farm would be worked and viable for generations to come. ""I believe it's not psychologically possible for the three of us to sell this farm for residential or commercial development,"" Will Tuttle says. ""The fact that it's going to remain open in someone's gentle care, in some form or another is very comforting to me."" Though they've booked showings already, Tuttle says the farm's sale is not imminent. ""This is not going to sell in one day,"" he says. ""Its may take a long time to sell it. We're prepared to battle it out until that time and spend what's left of our energy, so I can keep this place as vital as it can be."" Becky Tuttle adds that for now, ""The business still will remain open, and the corn is still as fresh and sweet as ever."" What's needed to make the farm thrive for years to come? Tuttle says the farm needs a ""fresh approach, fresh ideas and fresh legs and backs to do that.""","The oldest family farm in U.S. -- the Tuttle farm in New Hampshire -- is up for sale .

"(CNN) -- With nearly 86,000 people evacuated from fire-ravaged regions, Russian authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over blazes sweeping across thousands of acres in western Russia. ""Despite complicated weather conditions, the situation is under control thanks to preventive measures and efforts taken by the Russian Emergencies Ministry,"" a spokesman for the ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. At least 28 people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the wildfires, which are among the worst ever to hit western Russia. No fire-related deaths were reported since Friday, officials said Sunday. Two firefighters were among the dead, Itar-Tass reported, citing the Emergency Ministry. Latest figures from the ministry showed that 128,500 hectares (317,530 acres) were burned or had burned, and 774 ""hotbeds of wildfire"" were counted as of 6 a.m. Sunday. About half the fires had either been extinguished or contained, the ministry spokesman said. ""The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements,"" the ministry's information department said. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. Moscow, Russia, hit a temperature of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires have destroyed more than 1,200 homes, the ministry said, and nearly 5,000 people have been left homeless. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from the village of Maslovka, Russia, near Voronezh, that almost every house in the village of 500 people had burned to the ground. All the residents of Maslovka had been evacuated to nearby hotels. A resident of Maslovka named Nina told Chance she had returned to the village after the fire to sift through the rubble of the house where she was born. For 50 years, she said, she lived under the same roof. A few days ago, the wildfires were swept by high winds to the village and quickly engulfed her house. Now there was nothing left. Even the clothes she was wearing were not hers -- they had been given to her by a neighbor. As Nina told her story, an elderly woman walked from behind a broken wall, wailing with tears. Nina said the woman was her mother, devastated she had lost the home where she raised her family. Russia's government has vowed to compensate the more than 1,870 families whose houses have been burned down. Amid complaints, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered regional governors to speed up the compensation process. The Kremlin has called the wildfires a natural disaster of the kind that appear every 30 or 40 years. Critics, meanwhile, accuse local authorities of mismanaging the response. Desperate to control the blazes, Russia says its deployed nearly a quarter of a million people to fight the fires. But around Voronezh, many of the firefighters that Chance saw were just volunteers with buckets.","About half of the hundreds of wildfires in Russia are extinguished or contained .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro said Sunday that his government would allow more private businesses and make it easier for those businesses to hire workers, as the socialist economy struggles to get back on its feet and shed up to one million redundant state jobs. The government ""agreed to broaden the exercise of self employment and its use as another alternative for the employment of those excess workers,"" Castro said during a biannual session of the National Assembly. He went on to say that the government would eliminate ""numerous"" prohibitions to the granting of licenses for private businesses and to the sales of some products, as well as ""make the contracting of a work force more flexible."" In exchange, those businesses will pay taxes on income and sales, and pay contributions for employees, he said. The measures ""constitute a structural and conceptual change in the interest of preserving and developing our social system to make it sustainable in the future,"" Castro said. The decision was part of a series of measures approved by the Council of Ministers to reduce ""the considerably inflated payroll in the state sector,"" he added. Earlier this year, Castro said that more than one million state jobs, out of a total of 5.1 million, could be redundant. The government has launched a few, small free-market reforms. In April, for example, barbershops were handed over to employees, who pay rent and taxes but charge what they want. Licenses have also been granted to private taxis. For a couple of years, fallow land in the countryside has been turned over to private farmers. The more they produce, the more they earn. Not surprisingly, output is up. In his speech, Castro also mentioned for the first time the release of political prisoners that started last month. ""The Revolution can be generous because it is strong,"" he said. The Catholic Church and Spain negotiated the release of 52 prisoners jailed in 2003 as part of a crackdown on people the government accused of receiving money from the enemy government in Washington. So far, 21 prisoners have been released and flown abroad. Castro did not give details about why Cuba agreed to free the ""counterrevolutionaries"" or if he expected any gesture in return. Former President Fidel Castro did not make an appearance despite expectations that he might.","The Cuban president says it will become easier to have a private business .

"New York (CNN)  -- In the first two days back from his Martha's Vineyard family vacation, President Obama gave two speeches on two important subjects. The first was a four-minute address from the Rose Garden on Monday on the economy. This was obviously a quickly thrown together speech to let the country know that even though the economic indicators, to quote the Washington Post, ""trended from bad to worse"" while the president golfed and relaxed, his team was aware of them. We all come back a little rusty, and hopefully relaxed, from our vacations, and certainly the president and his family are entitled to theirs. But this speech offered nothing new on the most important subject of concern to voters, who in two months may alter the political makeup of the Congress and change the way this president can do things for the remainder of his term. The president slammed the Republicans one more time. This is his campaign theme, and obviously it isn't working. Besides, the more he blames the Republicans, the more difficult it will be to work with them in January, when they may have a majority or at least a lot more clout in the Congress. Saying his economic team was working on identifying new ways to boost the economy, the president said he would provide details ""in the days and weeks to come."" It raises the obvious question: What has the administration been doing in the weeks and months just past? It may not matter if the administration proposes any new measures on the economy, especially if they would require a vote in Congress. I can promise you, Mr. President, in the heat of a campaign battle royal -- in which your congressional team is on the brink of a disaster unlike any that Democrats have faced since 1994 -- in the ""days and weeks ahead,"" they are going to be focused on doing nothing except trying to get re-elected and running as far from you and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as possible. The second speech was given from the newly decorated Oval Office on Tuesday night in prime time. It was to celebrate the ""Campaign Promise Kept"": the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq. I couldn't quite figure out what the speech was about. Our combat troops moved out of the cities of Iraq last summer and haven't been in real combat since the success of the surge much earlier. There still isn't a functioning government there and may not be for months to come. Mr. President, you need to fill in the blanks about what you meant when you said, ""Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq's future is not."" It was appropriate to thank our troops and military leadership. It was a nice gesture to tell the country that George W. Bush supported our troops and loved our country, and obviously was committed to our national security. It would have even been more appropriate to say that the program he and Secretary Robert Gates laid out is the one the president implemented without change, and it seems to have worked. It would have been an accurate statement to remind people that we were withdrawing our troops because of a Status of Forces agreement signed in December 2008 by Bush and Iraq President Nuri al-Maliki to do so -- and not because Obama had promised this in his campaign. The Iraq government insisted that we withdraw all of our forces by December 31, 2011. I hope we can. We certainly will know by then whether the Iraq government can stabilize and whether the Iraq army and police can keep the peace. If not, the president has another tough decision to make. We signed an armistice in Korea in July 1953 -- and we still have nearly 30,000 troops there. Let's hope that's not the outcome here. The president said: ""Now is the time to turn the page."" But, as in his speech on the economy, he raised several issues that will need to be clarified ""in the days and weeks ahead."" He gave the clear impression that now that we are finished with the ""bad war"" in Iraq, his term we can focus on the good war, Afghanistan. ""Because of the drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense [in Afghanistan]."" I am sure that the more than 100,000 troops fully engaged under the leadership of Gen. David Petraeus already think they are on the offense and didn't realize they were being bogged down by Iraq. But the president couldn't leave it there. He had to return to politics, because every speech will be political between now and November 2. He went on to say: . ""As we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home [jobs, deficits, energy independence and education] with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad."" The war was expensive, not only in terms of the soldiers who were killed and injured but in the trillion-plus dollars spent on it. But if the president thinks the nation and the world are in this economic mess because of a war he didn't want to fight and didn't support, we are in worst shape than I thought. We still have expensive obligations to those men and woman who so bravely served us. It's not like we can close down the Pentagon and use that money to build more buildings to house Energy and Education Department employees. Now that Iraq is fixed -- and in a few weeks we will hear how the president and his team plan to get the economy moving again -- we now move on to solving the crisis in the Middle East. Lots of luck! Like most Americans, I want my president's focus to be on the economy. In a few short weeks, we Americans get to exercise our voice and vote for a new Congress. I promise our voice and our message will be a lot clearer than these two pedestrian speeches the president just made.

"(Mashable) -- 25.94 seconds. That's how much time it took Melissa Thompson of Salford, England, to type a complex sentence on a Samsung Galaxy S, which makes her the new Guinness World Record holder for fastest typing on a phone. The sentence for this particular record, as determined by Guinness, reads as follows: ""The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human."" Before Thompson, Franklin Page of Seattle held the record, having typed the above sentence in 35.54 seconds earlier this year. Interestingly enough, Melissa claims she's out of shape as far as texting goes. She used to send a lot of text messages to her boyfriend Chris -- 40 or 50 per day day, she says -- but after they moved in together she hasn't been texting as much. But when Samsung invited her to have a go at breaking the world record, it turned out her fingers were in better shape than she thought; she texted faster than anyone else and by a large margin. The new world record still awaits official approval from Guinness, but if it turns out to be legitimate, the title of the world's fastest texter will move from the U.S. to England. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Food from healthy clones of cattle, swine and goats is as safe as food from non-cloned animals, the Food and Drug Administration said in a report released Tuesday. Debate has raged around food products from cloned cattle, such as this one produced by the company Viagen. ""Extensive evaluation of the available data has not identified any subtle hazards that might indicate food-consumption risks in healthy clones of cattle, swine, or goats,"" the 968-page ""final risk assessment"" concluded. ""Thus, edible products from healthy clones that meet existing requirements for meat and milk in commerce pose no increased food consumption risk(s) relative to comparable products from sexually-derived animals."" But the FDA said it needs more information to determine the safety of meat and milk from cloned sheep. The FDA also concluded that food from newborn cattle clones ""may pose some very limited human food consumption risk."" The purpose of using cloned animals is to improve the overall value of a given herd by creating genetic copies of donor animals, resulting in a herd that produces higher-quality milk and meat. For years, heated debate over the use of cloned animals for food production has stretched from Congress to cattle farms and dinner tables nationwide.  Judy Fortin has more on the debate over meat and milk from cloned animals ». Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency's Center of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, acknowledged the controversy to reporters. About half of the more than 30,500 comments from the public the FDA has received about the matter have dealt with labeling, he said. But, he added, agency regulators cannot require cloned products be labeled as such if -- as they assert -- there is no material difference between them and food produced by conventional methods. ""There's really nothing for us to label,"" he said. Consumers won't be able to figure it out for themselves, he said. No test exists that could distinguish meat from a cloned animal from other meat. Either way, food products from cloned animals or their offspring would not reach store shelves for years, experts said. But companies could label their clone-free products as such, Sundlof said. In addition, foods labeled ""organic"" would not contain cloned products. Tuesday's announcement followed the agency's December 2006 preliminary conclusion, reached after a four-year review, that milk and meat from cloned animals are safe for human consumption. The agency was then to collect more safety data before issuing a final decision. Last month, the Senate passed a measure intended to bar the FDA from approving the products until further study was conducted. The legislation, part of the Senate's $286 billion farm bill, also required the Agriculture Department to examine consumer acceptance of cloned meats. On Tuesday, opponents of using cloned animals in food production expressed anger at the move. ""The FDA has acted recklessly and I am profoundly disappointed in their rush to approve cloned foods,"" Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, said in a written statement. ""Just because something was created in a lab doesn't mean we should have to eat it. If we discover a problem with cloned food after it is in our food supply and it's not labeled, the FDA won't be able to recall it like they did Vioxx -- the food will already be tainted."" Vioxx, a painkiller, was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after it was linked to a heightened risk of heart attack and stroke. ""We think the FDA should pay attention to what Congress is asking them to do,"" said J.D. Hanson, policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety. ""It looks like they are releasing it to sidestep what Congress has asked them to do."" The National Farmers Union, in a written statement, said ""consumers have the right to know if the food they feed their families comes from a cloned animal."" Another concern is possible economic fallout. ""People will start consuming less dairy and meat"" if they are not sure of the products' safety, predicted Michael Hansen, a senior scientist with Consumers Union. His group calls for more study and clear labeling. Perhaps in an effort to placate critics, Tuesday's report included hundreds of pages of raw data in the risk assessment. Some consumer groups said they were pleased with the report. ""There are still unanswered questions about the use of cloned animals in the food supply, but the Food and Drug Administration has satisfactorily answered the safety question,"" the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a written statement. ""While the safety of any food cannot be proven with absolute certainty, consumers should have confidence that meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring will be safe."" Experts say it is unlikely actual clones would be used in food production. A cloned cow costs $15,000 to $20,000 to create. More likely, experts said, the offspring of cloned animals would be used. Bruce Knight, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said only about 600 cloned animals exist in the United States, about 570 of which are cattle. He said the agency is urging providers to extend a voluntary moratorium on the use of the meat or milk from cloned animals during the transition, a period he would not specify. Mark Walton, president of ViaGen, which uses cloning technologies, said his company will comply with the request, but he played down the scope of the matter. ""The number of cloned animals in the barn yard today is minuscule compared to the size of the total livestock population,"" said Walton. ""In addition, clones are to be used as breeding animals, not for consumption. Because of a supply chain management system that allows tracking of cloned livestock, consumers are unlikely to ever eat these animals."" A spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Karen Batra, predicted, ""It will be many, many years"" before the technology becomes mainstream. She further predicted that its adoption would not be accompanied by a hike in prices. ""There comes a point where consumers will find another form of meat,"" she said. E-mail to a friend .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A second person survived a massacre in which 72 migrants from Central and South America were killed last week in northern Mexico, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Mexican officials said. A man from Ecuador was previously thought to be the only survivor. That man, identified as Luis Freddy Lala Pomavilla, said someone else also lived through the mass shooting, Correa said at a news conference late Tuesday night upon his return to Ecuador from a trip to Haiti. Correa did not provide details other than to say the second survivor came from Honduras. ""We don't want to put him in danger,"" Correa said. Viviana Macias, a spokeswoman for the Mexican attorney general's office, confirmed Wednesday that a second person had survived the attack. The attorney general's office said authorities had not revealed news of the second survivor in order to protect the person's safety. For the same reason, officials said Wednesday, they will not reveal the person's identity. The attorney general's office said in a release Wednesday afternoon that the survivor is being held and protected as a witness and has given officials ""relevant information to identify those presumed to be responsible."" The agency has been in touch with authorities in Honduras, the release said. Lala Pomavilla, the Ecuadorian survivor, was returned to his homeland  late Sunday. The young man was wounded in the attack and said he survived by playing dead. He later walked several miles to a military roadblock near the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state, less than 100 miles from the U.S. border. Officials are investigating whether members of the Zetas drug cartel were responsible for the deaths. The bodies of the 72 victims are being returned to their homelands, which include Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Brazil. Mexican officials returned the remains of 16 migrants to Honduras on Wednesday. A live broadcast on CNN affiliate Televicentro showed six-man honor guards wheeling the bodies one by one off a transport aircraft. Bereaved relatives and friends cried and held each other as the gray caskets glided by slowly, guided solemnly by soldiers in dress uniforms and red-plumed hats. The caskets, each adorned with a bouquet of flowers on top, were placed under a large tent on the tarmac at the air force airport in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. ""Repatriation,"" said the Televicentro banner imposed over the bottom of the TV image. ""What started as a search for the American dream ended in a mortal nightmare."" After the 16 caskets were gathered in the tent, a Roman Catholic priest prayed over them. ""Don't lose your faith in God,"" he told those gathered there before he sprinkled holy water on each of the caskets. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo also addressed the crowd, merely reading the names of the 16 victims before walking back to his spot in a line of dignitaries. Some family members were brought up to have a word with Lobo, who hugged them and spoke quietly with them. The caskets were released to the families after the ceremony, and at one point Lobo went to where a man with a gray New York Yankees cap was sobbing as he leaned on a coffin. Lobo patted the man on the shoulder and reached out to a woman standing next to him. The victims will be taken to their hometowns for burial. CNN's Jose Antonio Flores, Krupskaia Alis and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","The second survivor is a migrant from Honduras, officials say .

"(CNN) -- A 25-foot dead whale washed ashore on New York's Jones Beach Island on Thursday morning, a New York State Parks official said. George Gorman, director of recreational services for New York State Parks, told CNN that officials believe it's a humpback whale. Jones Beach Island is a barrier island bordering the south of Long Island and a popular recreational spot for New Yorkers. The New York State Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding Program -- a branch of the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation that rescues and rehabilitates marine animals -- was called to examine the whale and remove it from the beach. Riverhead officials estimate that the animal weighs 20 to 25 tons. The group is moving the animal out of the path of the incoming tide with a tractor. An necropsy will be performed Friday and then officials will determine where to bury the remains.","25-foot dead whale washes ashore on New York's Jones Beach Island .

"Washington (CNN) -- There are just times, when you are president of the United States, that formally speaking to the American people is part of the job. Not because it's politically wise, or even politically advisable -- but because you have something important to say. As in, the seven-year-combat-mission-in-Iraq-is-over. Or, more specifically, as President Obama said, ""it's time to turn the page."" It wasn't a particularly artful speech, nor was it full of new and interesting ideas. It was what it was: a ceremonial proclamation ending combat in a war Obama inherited (and opposed) and a declaration to fight another war (also, as he says, inherited) on the economy. No talk of winning or victory, only of transitions (to noncombat mode) and of a new focus for resources: on investments at home, on fighting al Qaeda in Afghanistan. No self-congratulation, only plaudits for the troops. The declaration ending combat was clear, but what comes next in Iraq was completely ambiguous: Will a government finally form? Are the Iraqi security forces up to the job? And if it all falls apart, what do we do? In many ways, it was an opportunity for the president to remind us of a promise kept. Fair enough: He said we would leave Iraq as combatants, and we have. He tipped his hat to President Bush in an effort to try and finally end the longstanding political divisions over Iraq (declaring Bush's ""love for his country""), but stopped short of saying the obvious: Bush's surge strategy worked. The world can argue over why it worked, but one thing is clear: Obama opposed the surge. And now he's employing one in Afghanistan. The pressure to talk about something else other than Iraq was palpable. There's an election in a couple of months, and it looks like the Democrats are about to get thumped. They're sitting ducks, in a way, victims of their own success. They hold almost every swing congressional seat; they have incumbents in about 40 districts that John McCain won. Unemployment is high; there's been no summer of recovery, as some promised. The Democrats are in charge, and voters are ready to throw the bums out. So the president had to talk about the economy, I suppose, but it fell flat. That's because there really wasn't anything he could tell us that would make voters feel any better. He went through the drill, but no one was under any illusion that this Oval Office speech would budge the needle for him -- or the Democrats -- at this dicey time. In a way, it's more interesting to watch Obama now than it was during the campaign. Back then, he was the great communicator, an inspirational figure promising to take government where it had never been, promising to rescue an electorate sick of partisan divisions and gridlock in the mechanisms of government. It was easy to digest because the public was so eager to move on from what it had. Change seemed the natural order of things. But now, after two years in which the White House has been locked in combat with a GOP that found its voice in its almost unanimous opposition to everything -- the stimulus, health care, financial reform -- the campaign call for change seems ancient. The president, for all of his success in checking off his to-do list, is now seen as just more of the same by a growing number of voters: a partisan Democrat addicted to big government and big spending. It's strange, really, that the man who touched so many during the campaign has failed to connect in the same way during his presidency. It's not that we don't see Obama; we see him more than just about any other president. So why is it that we still can't figure out who he is? Because a Zelig-like devotion to announcing one more agenda item or one more stimulus project or give one more speech just isn't enough. Visibility doesn't guarantee connection. Connection guarantees connection. That's where Bill Clinton comes in. There's no one who was better at empathy. And so, as Obama and the Democrats trudge toward an election bound to make them unhappy, the question is this: If Obama loses seats (or even control of the House), who will he be? Will he be Bill Clinton (a la 1994, after losing the House to Newt Gingrich and the GOP), adjusting to his new circumstance, working to pass welfare reform and a budget agreement? Or will be Jimmy Carter, who went from bad to worse, sulking with not much to show for it? Granted, if the Republicans win handily, they'll have problems of their own: some of the newest members of Congress will be virtually unmanageable. They'll vote against every spending bill, not to mention funding the war in Afghanistan. They will have no appetite for compromise at all. They will make some GOP leaders miserable. But Obama will be the one to watch, as always. The thing about Bill Clinton is that he knew where to draw a line between the ground he had to yield and the ground he refused to yield. And then he got something done. About 90 days after the midterm election, we will really know who Barack Obama is, and what he's willing to do. He'll have plenty of time to shape his legacy, and he won't need an Oval Office address to point it out. We'll already be watching. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger says President Obama's discussion of economy fell flat .

"(CNN)  -- Millions of hot dogs, beers and explosive devices will help Americans celebrate their country's 234th birthday on July Fourth this Sunday. If people didn't gobble down the 150 million hot dogs they are predicted to eat on the holiday, the wieners could be strung across the nation five times, from San Diego, California, to Washington, according to Tom Super of the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council. About one-third of hot dog lovers will smear them with mustard, almost a quarter prefer ketchup, 17 percent will put chili on their dogs, 9 percent relish and 7 percent onion. Folks in Chicago, Illinois, like their dogs in yellow mustard, dark green relish, chopped raw onion, tomato slices and topped with a dash of celery salt, according to the council. Kansas City, Missouri, dogs are served with sauerkraut and melted Swiss cheese. Chili, cheese and jalapenos are the favorite toppings for dogs sold at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, the council's website says. Watch 4th of July spending index . But New Yorkers eat more dogs than any other group in the U.S., and they top them with steamed onions and mustard. Some of those dogs will be swallowed in the 12 minutes allotted to contestants of Nathan's Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest -- an event held nearly every year at New York's Coney Island since 1916. Last year's record of 68 hot dogs and buns was set by Joey Chestnut. Watch Chesnut discuss his chowdown strategy . About one in every four hot dogs and pork sausages eaten by Americans this holiday will come from Iowa, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The beef hot dogs, steaks and burgers sizzling on backyard grills are likely to have originated in Texas. And the barbecue or fried chicken most likely will come from either Georgia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi or Texas. The odds are about one in three side dishes of baked beans started in North Dakota. The tomatoes on the table have a 7 in 10 chance of coming from Florida or California. And there is a 66 percent chance that the corn on the cob was grown in Florida, California, Georgia, Washington or New York. Much of the holiday feasts will be washed down with beer. ""In fact, according to IRI Infoscan data, the Independence Day holiday period is the number one occasion for sales and servings of beer in the United States,"" says Jeff Becker, President, Beer Institute. American Pyrotechnics Association predicts a booming day on Sunday despite the recession. The group says on its website that more fireworks are ignited on the Fourth of July than on any other country's celebration in the world. It also notes that 213.2 million pounds of fireworks were used in 2008. All those celebratory explosions will create some casualties. Last year, there were two fireworks-related deaths and some 9,000 injuries that required treatment at hospital emergency rooms, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Serious burns and eye injuries are the most common, says the agency, reminding people that even the harmless looking sparklers reach temperatures of about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hot enough to melt some metals.

But in 1800 when the two men ran against each other for the presidency, the campaign turned ugly, according to Mental Floss magazine. It took about 12 years to repair the friendship before the two men began exchanging letters. On July 4, 1826 -- the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence -- both men died.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The American people need to know that American troops will not still be fighting in Afghanistan in 2025, Pentagon chief Robert Gates said, but the United States' relationship with that country will be a long-term one. Gates and Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke after the two met Thursday. ""Americans will still be here after July 2011,"" the defense secretary said. ""The president has been very clear that that is the beginning of a process, and the pace will be determined by conditions on the ground in Afghanistan."" But, he said, ""the American people need to know we are not still going to be fighting this fight 15 years from now."" ""That said, the reality is we are looking at a long-term relationship with Afghanistan, and we have the confidence that the progress we are making jointly with our Afghan partners and our other allies will allow us to begin a transition to Afghan security control within the next year."" Karzai, he said, has indicated he believes his country will be ready to accept full security control in 2014. ""We learned our lesson in turning our back on Afghanistan ion 1989 and we have no intention of doing it again,"" he said, referring to the support the United States provided Afghans during their lengthy battle with Russian troops -- that disappeared when Russia withdrew. Gates' visit came on the same day that a NATO airstrike killed 10 people in the country's northeast.  A provincial official said those killed were parliamentary campaign workers, but NATO and U.S. officials said the precision airstrike targeted a senior member of an insurgent group.  NATO is investigating the incident. Karzai has issued pointed criticism at the coalition for civilian casualties during warfare, including this latest incident, which comes a little more than two weeks ahead of the parliamentary elections. ""The reports that we get so far are 10 killed and three wounded in this operation,"" Karzai said in a joint appearance with Gates after their meeting. He added that a parliamentary candidate was wounded in the attack and that an investigation was under way. ""I have limited knowledge of the strike at this point,"" Gates said. ""I believe I can confirm that a very senior official of the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan was the target and was killed. This was an individual who was responsible for organizing attacks here in Kabul and in northern Afghanistan. This is the first I heard that civilians may have been killed, and we will certainly look into that."" Gates' trip comes a day after he visited Iraq, where he attended a change of command ceremony that marked the end of the U.S. combat mission there. Karzai defended his government's decision to kick private security companies out of the country in four months. ""On the issue of the private security firms, the decision of the Afghan government is final and conclusive,"" he said. ""The presence of security firms is not only adding to the problems of corruption in Afghanistan, the problems of lawlessness in Afghanistan and lots of other affectations ... but they're also running a parallel structure to the Afghan government. We will not have an effective growth of Afghan security forces"" with the private firms still operational. ""We cannot sustain them any more in our country, and I'm glad to say the U.S. backs this decision with us."" Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military man in Afghanistan, said initial approaches to some Taliban members as part of a reconciliation initiative have shown promise and could help in the effort to resolve the conflict there. Petraeus, who heads the U.S. and NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, spoke to reporters after greeting Gates, who arrived in the war-torn country Thursday to consult with political and military officials. Petraeus said there have already been approaches toward Taliban officials at senior levels that hold some promise. This comes amid discussions about reaching out to some Taliban members as part of a reconciliation process, but the military isn't envisioning peace talks with hard-liners. Petraeus also addressed a number of other issues, such as the community police plan, which he described as basically ""community watch with AK-47s, under a Ministry of Interior chain of command"" so there aren't concerns about warlords or militias. ""This will not be Sons of Iraq in Afghanistan,"" he said, referring to anti-al Qaeda Sunni groups in Iraq. He also said that since the departure earlier this summer of Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- who was forced to step down after he made controversial comments about members of the Obama administration in a magazine article -- there has been ""a change in personnel, not in overall concept"" in the Afghan mission.","NEW: Gates says American troops will eventually leave Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Controlled drugs were found in one of two tour buses carrying rocker Bret Michaels and his band during a traffic stop in northeast Indiana late Wednesday, police said. No one was arrested, but the evidence was passed along to the DeKalb County prosecutor for consideration of charges, according to the police report. Drug detection dogs did ""vehicle scans"" of the buses after a sheriff's deputy pulled Michael's tour convoy over on the northbound side of Interstate 69, police said. ""Both K9s alerted for the odor of narcotics coming from the front of the bus,"" Deputy Aaron Long wrote in his report. Another dog alerted to the odor of drugs in the second bus, the one in which Michaels was riding, the deputy said. ""Searches were conducted on both buses yielding marijuana on each bus, as well as a quantity of Schedule II controlled substances on the first bus,"" Long said. Schedule II substances are those defined as having a high potential for addiction or abuse, but also have a legitimate medical purpose. Michael's publicist said the buses were stopped because a trailer had no tag light. ""Mr. Michaels allowed an open search of the buses and everything was handled in a professional manner,"" the publicist said.

"(CNN) -- Florida's Everglades National Park and rain forests in Madagascar have been added to a list of world heritage sites in danger. The World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced the decision at its 34th annual meeting in Brasilia, Brazil. Degradation of the Everglades has caused its addition to the list this year, with UNESCO reporting that water inflows have reduced up to 60 percent and high pollution levels are currently killing marine life. The Everglades is the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, with more than 1.5 million acres of estuaries, prairies, and shady stretches of pine. This is the second time the Everglades has been included on the list, the first time was between 1993 and 1997 because of damages caused by Hurricane Andrew. The rain forests of Atsinanana in Madagascar make the list this year after illegal logging and hunting of endangered lemurs on the site. Due to the illegal exporting of logged timber, many rare species found in the rainforest are threatened, especially lemurs found only in Madagascar.","Degradation of the Everglades leads to its addition to the list .

Johnny Depp underwrote the fireworks display at a cost of $2 million. 3. Into a Pringles can . The name Fredric Baur may not ring any bells, but you know his most famous creation. In 1966 Baur invented the Pringles can so Procter & Gamble could ship its new chips without using bags. Baur was so proud of the achievement that he told his children he wanted to be buried in the iconic can. When he died in 2008 at 89, they honored his wishes by placing his ashes in a Pringles can before burying them. According to his son Larry, Baur's children briefly debated what flavor canister to use before settling on original. Mental Floss: Where'd the name ""Pringles"" come from? 4. Onto a Frisbee . More than anyone, Edward ""Steady Ed"" Headrick was responsible for transforming the Frisbee from a fad toy into a valued piece of sporting equipment. While working as a manager at Wham-O, Headrick designed numerous improvements to the flying disc, and during the 1970s he created the sport of disc golf. Mental Floss: 10 specialized summer camps . Before his 2002 death, Headrick told his children that he wanted to have his ashes mixed into the plastic for a batch of Frisbees. His hope was that the proceeds from the sales could help establish a disc golf museum, but he also wanted to have a bit of fun. Headrick's son Daniel later told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""He said he wanted to end up in a Frisbee that accidentally lands on someone's roof."" Headrick's wish came true, and the discs are quite valuable as collectors' items now. A two-disc set fetches upwards of $200 on Amazon. 5. Out of a shotgun . There's no more fitting way for a hunter to go out than this. When James Booth, a British expert on vintage shotguns, died in 2004, his wife asked an ammunition company to mix his ashes into a batch of shotgun shells. The Caledonian Cartridge Company happily complied and presented Joanna Booth with 275 12-gauge cartridges containing James' ashes; a minister even blessed the shells. The widow then invited a group of close friends over for a hunt, and the group used the cartridges to bag ducks, pheasants, and partridges. Mental Floss: What makes No. 2 pencils special? 6. Into space . Looking for the remains of '60s icon and LSD advocate Timothy Leary? You're going to need a space shuttle. In 1997 Leary's remains were on the first rocket to send cremated ashes into space. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's ashes went into orbit on the same flight. Space burial company Celestis will send a portion of anyone's remains into the final frontier for a fee. According to the company's website, your ashes can go into Earth orbit for $2,495, find their way into lunar orbit for $9,995, or make the trek into deep space for $12,500.

When English parents Mark and Lisa Richmond tragically lost their son Ayden when he was just two years and four months old, they wanted to find a fitting way to honor his memory. The couple owned a tattoo parlor, so they decided to remember the boy with a bit of ink. Mark got a seven-inch portrait of Ayden tattooed on his chest using ink that had been mixed with his son's ashes. 8. Onto a reef . If you're a sea lover, Eternal Reefs can help turn your remains into a permanent reef. After the ashes are mixed into concrete, the reefs go into the water and provide a new habitat for fish and other marine life. A 2' x 3' Aquarius Memorial Reef will set your loved ones back $3,995. 9. Into a diamond . LifeGem can take the ashes of a departed loved one and convert them into a diamond. The process looks basically identical to the production of synthetic diamonds, except the carbon used to kick start the production comes from the cremated remains. Depending on the color and size of the diamond you want, prices can range from $2,699 all the way up to $24,999. Mental Floss: 10 weird places to get married . 10. Up Keith Richards' nose? In 2007 music mag NME asked Rolling Stones guitarist to name the strangest thing he'd ever snorted. The reporter was probably expecting an odd answer given Richards' legendary proclivity for partying, but Richards' response was a jaw-dropper. Richards told the magazine, ""The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow."" Richards went on to explain that snorting a rail of dear old Dad hadn't caused him any health problems and that he didn't think his old man would have cared. The remarks sparked a predictable media firestorm, though, and the Stones' publicist released a statement calling Richards' story ""an off-the-cuff remark, a joke."" Richards himself later revised the tale and said that he planted his father's ashes at the base of an oak tree. Mental Floss: 7 different Seven Wonders of the World .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Tears rolled from Fernanda Romero's eyes as the Mexican soap opera actress told jurors that she really loved Kent Ross, the pizza deliveryman she married five years ago. Their marriage was real, but it soon fell apart because of his drinking and her focus on a modeling and acting career, Romero testified Tuesday. Closing arguments are set for Wednesday in the trial of Romero and Ross on federal charges their marriage was an illegal sham, intended only to earn her a U.S. work permit. Romero is accused of paying Ross, 28, $5,000 to marry her on June 12, 2005, but the prosecutor alleged they never lived together as a couple. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real blocked defense lawyers from using evidence they said would show Romero was set up and turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances. The job of convincing jurors the marriage was real fell on Romero, a 28-year-old actress-singer-model who starred in Telemundo's ""Wounded Soul"" soap opera. The prosecutor suggested Romero was using her professional acting skills to sell her own fiction. Romero testified she married for love, not a green card. ""To be in a loving relationship, forever and ever, like my parents,"" she testified. The couple didn't have a family wedding because he is Mormon and she is Catholic, she said. They kept separate Hollywood apartments because he couldn't break a lease and she traveled a lot, she said. The first months were ""very loving, fun,"" she said. ""We socialized together, passionate. It was the honeymoon stage."" Romero and Ross separated after less than a year together because ""he was coming on very late and drunk,"" she said. ""We started to fight a lot, sweat a lot, throw things. It was not healthy."" The villain in Romero's script would be Markus Klinko, a celebrity photographer she met at a Hollywood casting call about the same time her marriage was ""on the rocks,"" she said. Klinko, a 49-year-old Swiss native, is the star of his own reality TV show -- Bravo's ""Double Exposure."" Romero said the relationship initially was ""professional and creative,"" but she eventually engaged in a ""short affair"" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. ""I felt very pressured and I was vulnerable,"" Romero said as she cried. ""It was the biggest mistake I've done in my life."" Her friendship with Klinko turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair, she said. ""Mr. Klinko wanted more and more and he knew I wasn't able to give it to him,"" she said. Klinko threatened to turn her in to immigration officials, she said. ""He was losing it, he was very psycho,"" Romero said. ""I was very scared, because he wouldn't stop."" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week he said it was ""completely incorrect"" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said. The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might be extorted by Ball. ""My case has never been against Fernanda,"" Klinko said after his testimony. ""I wish her the best."" Ross also had his turn on the witness stand Tuesday, hoping to convince jurors that he and Romero were a real couple at one time. ""I was in love with her,"" Ross testified. ""It felt right at the time, so I rolled with it."" He was asked why he asked the actress to marry him after knowing her for only a short time. ""I had a tiger by the tail and I wanted to keep her here,"" he said. Romero and Ross sat directly in front of jurors throughout the one-week trial, holding hands much of the time. They could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences, according to the prosecutor. The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JC Penney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her online biography says.","Fernanda Romero testifies in her own defense Tuesday .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The police chief in Cancún has been relieved of his duties and placed under house arrest while he is investigated in the killing of a retired Mexican general who had been the area's anti-drug chief for less than 24 hours, Mexican media are reporting. A Mexican soldier guards the entrance at a Cancún police station where the military is investigating a murder. Francisco Velasco Delgado was detained by military officials early Monday and flown to Mexico City, where he was placed under 45 days of house arrest, according to the media reports. With Delgado's removal, the military has taken over the Cancún police force, several newspapers reported. Cancún Mayor Gregorio Sanchez Martinez said the move was made ""to facilitate all types of investigations into the triple murder that happened last week,"" the Diario de Yucatan newspaper said. Salvador Rocha Vargas, the secretary for public security for the state of Quintana Roo, will lead the police force. He said he will take all the pertinent measures ""to clean up the Cancún police,"" the Excelsior newspaper reported Tuesday. Retired Gen. Mauro Enrique Tello Quinonez's bullet-riddled body was found a week ago on a road outside Cancún. Authorities said he had been tortured before being shot 11 times. His aide and a driver also were tortured and killed. Quintana Roo state prosecutor Bello Melchor Rodriguez y Carrillo said last week there was no doubt Tello and the others were victims of organized crime. ""The general was the most mistreated,"" Rodriguez y Carrillo said at a news conference. ""He had burns on his skin and bones in his hands and wrists were broken."" An autopsy revealed he also had broken knees. Tello had been appointed less than 24 hours earlier as a special drug-fighting consultant for Gregorio Sanchez Martinez, the mayor of the Benito Juarez municipality, which includes the city of Cancún. Tello, who retired from the army in January at the mandatory age of 63, had moved to the resort area three weeks ago. Mexico is undergoing an unprecedented wave of violence that some have likened to a civil war. The government is battling drug cartels as the traffickers fight each other for control of the lucrative illicit market. Tello was the second high-ranking army officer to be killed in the area in the past few years. Lt. Col. Wilfrido Flores Saucedo and his aide were gunned down on a Cancún street in 2006. That crime remains unsolved. The latest killings come as Mexico grapples with the highest violent-death rate in its history. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora reported in December there had been around 5,400 slayings in 2008, more than double the 2,477 tallied in 2007. There already have been more than 400 drug-related killings this year, according to some news accounts.","Mexican media says local chief put under house arrest for 45 days .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to the hospital after her husband found her ""unresponsive"" Tuesday morning, her publicist told CNN. Gabor, 93, was taken by ambulance from her Bel Air, California, home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery earlier this summer, publicist John Blanchette said Tuesday. The spokesman for Gabor's daughter Francesca Hilton said the doctor told Hilton the situation was ""not life-threatening."" Gabor was hospitalized for several days earlier this month for complications relating to the surgery. Her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, was ""very agitated"" after calling for an ambulance Tuesday morning, Blanchette said. Gabor had returned home from the hospital two weeks ago because she ""wants to spend her final days at her home,"" Blanchette said at the time. She spent three weeks in the hospital after breaking her hip in a fall from her bed on July 17. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- Forecasters predict the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season will be ""near-normal,"" with four to seven hurricanes likely, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday, less than two weeks before the season begins. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters predict a 'near normal' hurricane season. ""While we cannot prevent hurricanes, we can prepare, and we must,"" Commerce Secretary Gary Locke told reporters at Reagan National Airport, just outside of Washington. The Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1 and runs through the end of November. Locke said it is likely there will be nine to 14 named storms, with four to seven of those becoming hurricanes. Of the hurricanes, NOAA predicts that one to three will be major hurricanes -- storms classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. In 2008, there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes, five of which were major. It was among the busiest and costliest seasons to date, with about $54 billion in damages, according to the National Climatic Data Center.  Learn more about hurricanes and how you can stay safe » . The weather agency had predicted a total of 12 to 16 storms last year. NOAA's predictions for 2009 are similar to those of four other organizations: AccuWeather, (13 named storms and eight hurricanes), Colorado State University, (14 named storms and seven hurricanes) WSI Corp. (13 named storms, seven hurricanes) and Weather Research Center (seven named storms, four hurricanes). Competing climate factors are shaping the 2009 seasonal outlook, NOAA said, saying enhanced rainfall over West Africa, warmer Atlantic waters and reduced wind shear encourage greater storm activity. Should El Nino develop in the equatorial eastern Pacific this summer, or if ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Atlantic stay cooler, storm activity could be diminished, NOAA said. The weather agency will release an updated hurricane outlook in August, ahead of what it says is historically the peak period for hurricane activity. Newly appointed Federal Emergency Management Agency director Craig Fugate emphasized that people who live in coastal areas should prepare for the hurricane season. ""We cannot tell you where a hurricane is going to hit this year, and there's a lot of our coast that hasn't had a hurricane in decades. People grow up in areas and haven't had a hurricane, and live in a hurricane prone area and don't realize it,"" Fugate said. ""Hurricane season is upon us, and to anyone who lives or works in hurricane-prone areas, to any of you who have family or friends in hurricane prone areas, NOAA's message is clear -- be prepared, have a plan,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said. The first named storm of the Atlantic season will be named Ana. CNN's Greg Clary contributed to this report.","NOAA predicts four to seven hurricanes, with one to three major storms .

"(CNN) -- The morning after a masked gunman killed two people and wounded six more at a party, police in Indianapolis, Indiana, were still on the scene investigating, authorities said Tuesday. Indianapolis police said the victims were Barbara Johnson, 37, who lived at the home where the shots were fired, and Charles Mays, 54, also of Indianapolis. Investigators had found two cars that may be related to the incident, Indianapolis police Lt. Jeff Duhamell said Tuesday. Police have recovered a silver/green Chrysler 300 sedan ""that had been shot several times"" that may be the suspect's vehicle, an Indianapolis police news release said. The vehicle was found parked and unoccupied and was towed for further investigation, it said. Earlier in the morning, investigators found a silver Dodge Charger that they believe was initially at the crime scene, and then was driven away by someone attending the party, Duhamell said. Video from CNN affiliate WISH showed the vehicle was riddled with bullets. But no one inside that vehicle was wounded, the news release said. The incident happened in the ""near northwest"" part of the city, in a neighborhood rife with gun violence, drugs and prostitution, Indianapolis police Sgt. Michael Jefferson said. Seven victims were found outside the house where the party was going on. The eighth victim was found in a vehicle less than a mile away. ""It makes you sick. And it makes you wonder, 'Why are people so bent on killing each other, shooting each other? For what?'"" an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate WISH. ""I don't know what's going on, what's happening in our neighborhood. Hopefully, we can get some help over here. And the young people have taken over. They're doing whatever they want to do."" Read, watch WISH's coverage . Witnesses said that around midnight, at least one person got out of a car, put on a mask and fired what appeared to be an assault rifle at a crowd gathered at the party, Duhamell said. ""Unfortunately, two people were killed,"" he told WISH. ""We're talking at least 25-30 rounds from a high-powered rifle, so although eight people were shot, it could've been a lot worse."" The six other gunshot victims, all Indianapolis residents, were rushed to hospitals, Duhamell said. Clarian Health spokesman Gene Ford said Tuesday morning that four patients had been brought to Methodist Hospital. Tamera Williams, 32, and Nakeisha Morris, 24, were treated and released, he said, and he was unable to disclose information on Jewel Dotson, 21, and Prinsonia Johnson, 54. Wishard Hospital received two victims. Willie Battles, 28, was treated and released, while Kendall Hill, 25, remained in the intensive care unit in good condition, hospital spokesman Todd Harper said Tuesday morning. Police had initially been sent to the vicinity of the party around 10 p.m. Monday after they received a call about a person toting an automatic weapon, Jefferson said. Investigators were still searching for the gunman Tuesday morning and trying to determine if others were involved.

"(CNN) -- Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, of MTV's reality show ""Jersey Shore,"" will soon learn her fate after the young reality star was arrested Friday on disorderly conduct charges, court officials said Monday. Polizzi is set for a first-appearance court date on August 18 at 9:00 a.m. in municipal court, said Seaside Heights court administrator Jane Carrozza. According to Seaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd, Polizzi, 22, was acting in a disorderly manner while on the beach at Seaside Heights Friday around 3:30 p.m. She was placed under arrest and was later released with a summons, said Boyd.

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Kentucky woman missing for two weeks has been found, and police are searching for a registered sex offender believed to be involved in her disappearance, authorities said Monday. Brittney Kustes was last seen July 17 at her grandparents' home in Brooks, Kentucky, just south of Louisville, Kentucky, according to Det. Scott McGaha of the Bullitt County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses told police that sex offender Roy Vernon Elwell -- who has a history of kidnapping and unlawful confinement -- was seen driving up and down the street where Kustes' grandparents live on the day she disappeared. ""Shortly after, she was gone,"" McGaha said last week. Numerous witnesses reported seeing the pair in Louisville and surrounding areas over the past two weeks. On Friday, Kustes was driven to a drop-off point by a friend of her alleged captor, according to authorities. Kustes then called her boyfriend, who picked her up, drove her to a motel and called police. Her mother told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" Monday night that getting the news was ""one of the greatest moments of my life."" ""It was truly a blessing,"" Laurie Kustes said. ""When we found her, we just stared at each other and I told her over and over you're safe now ... and she just cried and cried."" Laurie Kustes said her daughter was so ""brutally, mentally tortured"" during her disappearance that she was hospitalized Friday night. ""She's just really been through a lot of horrible things,"" she said, declining to elaborate due to the ongoing police investigation. Brittney Kustes has a history with the 34-year-old Elwell, according to her mother. ""This guy came into my daughter's life with drugs,"" Laurie Kustes told CNN affiliate WHAS last week. She said the last time Elwell was with her daughter, Brittney returned home addicted to methamphetamine, a drug habit she had recently kicked. But Laurie Kustes said Monday that her daughter again returned from Elwell's alleged captivity hooked on drugs. ""We're going to have to start all over with drug counseling, rehab,"" she said. ""Also, I'm going to have to get her into a psychiatrist for the past two weeks."" McGaha described Brittney Kustes as ""terrified"" and ""extremely frightened"" of Elwell, and described him as ""very dangerous."" ""She is not under police protection, but we are under alert to watch her,"" McGaha told ""Issues,"" adding that Brittney Kustes is ""at a location [Elwell] is not familiar with."" McGaha has said that Elwell knows police want to speak with him about Kustes. Friends of Elwell's have told police that he laughs off requests to come in to the sheriff's office, according to McGaha. Meanwhile, Elwell has been found to be noncompliant with the laws of the state's sex offender registry as he continues to evade police. The Class D felony carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, McGaha said.","Brittney Kustes was last seen July 17 .

"(CNN) -- Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Tuesday he shrugged off reports of a $1 million bounty on his head by Mexican drug cartels, saying this is not the first -- nor the largest. Arpaio, who calls himself ""America's toughest sheriff,"" told CNN he had a $5 million bounty on his head when he worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Mexico. ""It's nothing new,"" Arpaio said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It's part of my job. They keep coming after me."" Maricopa County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Lisa Allen said Monday that authorities are investigating the threat, which came in the form of a text message from a throwaway cell phone in Mexico. Allen said that the message was sent to a ""text message tree,"" similar to a phone tree. The message offered $1 million to anyone who could kill Arpaio. She said investigators ""don't know how likely it is"" they will be able to track down the sender. It was not clear how the threat came to light. Allen said the FBI is assisting in the probe, but FBI special agent Manuel Johnson, a spokesman for the bureau's Phoenix office, said the agency is aware of the reported threat but he knows of no federal investigation. Johnson said the bureau would help if Arpaio's office requested assistance. Arpaio is well-known for creating a tent city jail in the Arizona desert, providing pink underwear for inmates and bragging that he spends more to feed his dog than a prisoner in his jail. He made national headlines for his tough enforcement of Arizona's anti-illegal immigration laws and for his outspoken support for a new state immigration law, parts of which were blocked by a federal judge last week. His critics say he has a long history of abusing his power and launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents. Those critics note that while the probes were launched with great public fanfare, they rarely resulted in convictions. A federal grand jury is probing the complaints, but Arpaio's allies have defended the investigations as necessary. The 78-year-old sheriff, who has been the chief law enforcement officer for the county that includes Phoenix and many of its suburbs since 1992, would not discuss the issue with CNN in a July interview, citing the federal probe. Arpaio was elected Maricopa County sheriff in 1992 and has been re-elected every four years since. He served for 32 years in federal law enforcement before then, ultimately becoming head of the DEA's Arizona office. Speaking Tuesday on ""American Morning,"" Arpaio said the latest threats come with the job. ""It's part of my work,"" he said. ""I do my job.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A clash between Lebanon and Israel along their volatile shared border Tuesday left an Israeli officer and several Lebanese soldiers dead while escalating fears of renewed violence between the nations. Lt. Col. Dov Harari, a battalion commander, was killed in the fighting, according to an Israel Defense Forces statement. Another Israeli soldier was seriously wounded, it said. A Lebanese army spokesman said at least two Lebanese soldiers were killed and several others were wounded. Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that journalist Assaf Abu Rahal also was killed in the exchange of fire between Lebanese and Israeli soldiers. In a statement, the spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ""took immediate steps through contacts with the parties and the presence of the acting force commander alongside peacekeepers at the location to help restore calm in . the area."" UNIFIL will investigate the incident, it said, adding that Ban ""urges the parties to exercise maximum restraint and to work with UNIFIL and the U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon in taking steps to consolidate the calm now restored in the area."" Two separate narratives emerged about the incident. Israel said the Lebanese fired on Israeli soldiers who were on the Israeli side of the border. In Jerusalem, Israeli Intelligence Minister Dan Meridor said the incident was captured on video and that it all occurred on Israeli soil. ""This is all under Israeli sovereignty,"" he said. ""Somebody wanted to ignite fire and kill one of our soldiers and wound another. We responded in a military way. But this should serve as a warning: Don't dare do this again."" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned the Lebanese government against continuing provocations of Israeli forces and demanded an investigation into Tuesday's violence. He said Israel would not tolerate attacks on Israeli territory. ""The IDF will continue to act firmly and determinedly to protect the residents of Israel and the sovereign borders of Israel,"" Barak said in a written statement. The Israeli military said its soldiers were on ""routine activity"" when the incident occurred. It issued a statement saying that the soldiers were in ""an area that lies between the 'blue line' [the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon] and the security fence, thus within Israeli territory."" The Lebanese army's account and a report from Lebanese media said, however, that the hostilities occurred when Israel wanted to remove a tree. A Lebanese army unit stopped the Israelis, and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon intervened, the National News Agency said. The Lebanese army said it asked the U.N. force to arbitrate the issue, but the Israeli forces didn't comply and entered Lebanese territory. That led the army to open fire, with Israeli forces returning artillery fire and hitting a house in the village of Odaise. But Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Israel violated U.N. Resolution 1701 in crossing the blue line and by bombing a Lebanese army checkpoint in Odaise. He said Israeli aggression needs ""to be confronted, whatever the sacrifices are"" and that he will pursue the issue diplomatically. Israel fought a five-week war with Hezbollah in summer 2006 after Lebanese-based militants kidnapped two Israeli soldiers during a cross-border raid. Resolution 1701, which was intended to resolve the 2006 conflict, bars Israel from conducting military operations in Lebanon. Israel has accused Lebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States, of violating the resolution by smuggling arms into southern Lebanon. In a televised speech marking the fourth anniversary of the war, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah accused Israel of never having stopped its attacks on Lebanon and said it is guilty of 7,000 violations of Resolution 1701. ""We salute the Lebanese army and we salute their commander, their soldiers and their officers for baptizing the land with their blood,"" Nasrallah said. ""Our young men were in Odaise and other neighboring villages in the south but we asked them to exercise restraint. We were ready to fight and defend our land."" In the aftermath of the 2006 fighting, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers to the area. The U.N. troops were focused Tuesday on restoring calm, said spokesman Neeraj Singh. Acting Commander Brig. Gen. Santi Bonfanti flew to Odaise and said the situation had quieted. The United Nations was urging Israel and Lebanon ""to exercise maximum restraint,"" Singh said. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri had discussed the potentially explosive situation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian Prime Minister Samir Rifai, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Hariri's office said. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stated Syria's support for Lebanon ""against the heinous aggression launched by Israel,"" according to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA. ""This aggression proves once more,"" he said, ""that Israel has always been seeking to destabilize security and stability in Lebanon and the region."" In Washington, the Obama administration expressed concern about the clashes and urged both sides to exert calm while the United Nations investigates. State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters the State Department was in touch with the Israelis, Lebanese and the UNIFIL, the United Nations mission on the ground, to establish the facts. But Hezbollah leader Nasrallah predicted any U.N. investigation would not favor Lebanon. ""Israel wasn't condemned for massacres that they have committed,"" he said. ""The U.N. will not condemn their aggression in Odaise."" Still, he predicted, the incident is not likely to turn into another war. ""I don't believe that there is a likelihood of a[nything] close to war but there is reason for concern,"" he said. Nasrallah further accused Israel of involvement in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in Beirut. He promised to present evidence of Israel's involvement to reporters on Monday. ""We officially accuse Israel in Hariri's assassination,"" he said. ""We will expose the true killer."" To that, Israel's Meridor was unequivocal. ""It is ridiculous,"" he said. ""It's not the first time that he says lies. It's easy for him."" CNN's Saad Abedine, Nada Husseini and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","Differing narratives emerge from Israeli, Lebanese sides .

"(CNN) -- Recent newspaper articles and a flurry of online responses have put the role of job training in our economic recovery under a microscope. Even in the midst of high unemployment, some industries are having trouble finding workers with the right skills. And yet some people graduating from federally funded workforce programs are still not able to find jobs. This ""new"" debate actually reflects a question policymakers have asked for several decades: Does job training work? But is this the right question to ask? Experts project an increasing gap between workforce skills and employer needs. The gap is already pressing in some places and will worsen as the economy recovers. For example, in Cleveland, Ohio, manufacturers have had difficulty finding people with the English, math and technical skills to operate the high-tech machinery that today's jobs require. Worker skills are a critical ingredient in making any business go -- ask any small or medium-sized business owner, particularly in industries facing global competition. Other national governments invest a much larger portion of their GDP in worker skills. Training cannot erase the job losses we have seen in the past year, but done right it could build worker skills and help American businesses compete in the global economy. If we want to deal with the skills gap and put more Americans to work, then training is the only option. So the question is not whether training works, but rather what kind of training is most effective? So what's wrong with the way training works now? Our current approach is built on the idea that getting someone quickly into the workforce is the best first step. Today, the lion's share of public workforce training dollars is spent on short-term job readiness training -- basic computer skills, interview prep, and resume development -- rather than on industry-specific skills. Organizations that offer workforce services are typically funded to get people quickly into jobs, an approach to workforce development that was built during the high-employment '90s when it was much easier to find a job. In this economy, that approach is not working as well. But there is an approach that works better. Some organizations -- swimming against the tide of public policy and supported in large part by private philanthropy -- have developed an approach known as sectoral employment. This approach cultivates a deep understanding of local industries and employers and provides training that is closely tailored to their needs. At Public/Private Ventures (P/PV), we have just completed a rigorous evaluation of three such programs: one in New York's South Bronx that prepares people for jobs in the IT industry, another in Boston, Massachusetts, that trains medical billers, and a third in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that focuses on both health care and construction. Following a two-year study funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the results are clear and difficult to dispute: Participants in these sector-based programs were more likely to be employed and found jobs with higher wages and better access to benefits than those who did not participate in the programs. They earned about $4,000 more, or 29 percent, in the study's second year alone. What makes these programs work? First, a flexible and nimble organization that has the ability to make connections between local employers and job seekers and that can marshal money from public and private sources to provide needed training. On their face, these programs might not look much alike, yet they share key elements, including an understanding of what local employers need and a focus on teaching relevant technical skills; a careful recruitment and screening process that helps ensure a good match between program participants and available jobs; and connections to resources that participants might need -- like child care subsidies and transportation assistance -- to complete training and succeed on the job. This study shows that job training can work -- if it is closely tied to local labor market needs and offered by organizations nimble enough to change as those needs, and the needs of workers, change. The study was referenced on July 19, as the House passed the Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional Success Act of 2010, with bipartisan support. This legislation is an effort to provide more resources for developing programs that bridge the gap between employer needs and worker skills -- a complex and vitally important task as the economy begins to recover. The SECTORS Act reflects a growing understanding on both sides of the aisle that investing in skills is critical to our economic recovery. The Senate should move to pass it quickly. But much more needs to be done to foster public policies that support effective sectoral programs -- and to expand our base of knowledge about successful approaches to training. We must invest in research that will help us better understand the many types of programs that fall under the umbrella of ""sectoral employment,"" improve their ability to serve job seekers, and, crucially, forge a path by which effective approaches to training may be brought to scale. Among other things, this research should examine specific program practices and costs; the role of sector-based programs in supporting local businesses; and the most effective mix of services for different populations. The debate about whether or not training works is a distraction from the urgent need to learn more about and build on the specific strategies that have demonstrated success. Developing an effective workforce training system is too important for America's workers and businesses to let it be derailed by an outdated debate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheila Maguire.","Experts have debated whether job training works, says Sheila Maguire .
She says giving people basic job skills isn't enough .

"(CNN) -- The case of a missing 2-year-old boy who disappeared from an Arizona campground more than a week ago has turned into a criminal investigation, the Yavapai County sheriff announced Monday. Syler Newton was last seen shortly after midnight July 24, sleeping in a tent with the family at the Beaver Creek Campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. July 25, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag. ""The sheriff's office believes Syler did not wander from the campground and he is presumably dead,"" Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told a news conference Monday. ""The search effort is now in a recovery mode and the investigation has become criminal in nature."" Waugh said investigators have spent the past three days searching more than 200 tons of garbage in a nearby landfill ""to try to determine if in fact the boy's body was there."" About 50 people, along with highly trained bloodhounds, had joined in the search for Syler, who was wearing only a diaper when he disappeared, according to Yavapai County Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn. The bloodhounds, normally used by the state Department of Corrections for tracking down escaped felons, failed to detect the boy's scent outside the immediate campground area, investigators said as they described an exhaustive search that included aerial surveillance, scuba teams and underwater cameras. ""Anything we could have done in that area has been searched,"" one investigator said Monday. Syler was camping with his custodial mother, Christina Priem, and her children, when he disappeared. Priem has said she was in the process of adopting the boy from his biological mother. D'Evelyn said last week that that ""there's no evidence"" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, ""but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated."" About 25 other people were at the campgrounds the night of Syler's disappearance -- all of whom have cooperated with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.","""The investigation has become criminal in nature,"" sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- A woman babysitting her two young nieces Saturday night was arrested after police say she stabbed the girls multiple times in their Katonah, New York, home across the street from property owned by Martha Stewart. Lisa Turkki, 39, of East Syracuse, is being held in Westchester County jail on two counts of assault in the first degree, Lt. Jeffrey Dickan of the Bedford Police Department, told CNN Monday. Police were alerted to the stabbings by a 911 call placed by Turkki, Dickan said. When a responding officer arrived, Turkki was standing out in the driveway of the home, unarmed, and was taken into custody, he said. Upon entering the home, the two girls -- identified as 7-year-old Maeve Kelly and 9-year-old Annabel Kelly -- were found on the kitchen floor with ""multiple"" stab wounds, Dickan said. ""The scene was pretty terrible,"" he said. ""There were large amounts of blood all over the kitchen."" Two kitchen knives that appeared to have been used in the stabbings were recovered from inside the home, Dickan said. The girls were conscious and talking to authorities before they were rushed to Westchester County Medical Center, Dickan said. As of Monday morning, the girls were in stable condition and were improving, he said. The girls' parents, identified as Joseph and Eva Kelly, were attending a concert at a local performing arts center when the incident occurred, Dickan said. Dickan described Katonah as ""usually a very quiet area"" with neighborhoods made up of larger homes and estates. The Kellys' expansive home -- once touted on a sustainable-living blog for its eco-friendly features -- sits across the street from a large piece of property owned by Martha Stewart. ""We're fortunate here -- our crime levels are not that high,"" Dickan said.","Lisa Turkki was babysitting the girls Saturday night, police say .

"(CNN) -- An FBI webpage quoted an agent calling Mexico's drug cartels more violent than al Qaeda -- a comment sure to grab attention, but which doesn't tell the whole story, the agency said. On its website, the FBI was highlighting a special series of stories on law enforcement challenges along the Southwest border. The report includes a quote from an unidentified senior agent based in El Paso, Texas, who says, ""We think al Qaeda is bad, but they've got nothing on the cartels."" The controversial-sounding comment was just one of point of view that exists on the ground, the FBI said, explaining the remark. ""The quote is the opinion of one FBI agent who lives and works on border violence every day,"" said Special Agent Jason Pack, an FBI spokesman in Washington. ""The FBI does not believe the cartels are any more dangerous than al Qaeda."" According to the FBI report, ""Some areas on the Mexican side of the border are so violent they are reminiscent of the gangster era of Chicago in the 1930s or the heyday of the Mafia's Five Families in New York."" It cites the violent and ruthless tactics of the cartels, using as an example the case of a man known as El Pozolero -- the stew maker -- who is said to have dissolved hundreds of murder victims in acid. Mexico has seen other violent acts that are reminscent of al Qaeda tactics, including the severing of heads and videotaping of kidnap victims. But according to one analyst, comparing one to the other is apples and oranges. ""Obviously, it's a more complex issue than that,"" said Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, a global intelligence company. ""Reading between the lines here, what they might be trying to say is that clearly the scope of the drug cartels from a geographic perspective is very robust,"" he said. The cartels are very brutal and violent, but they haven't hijacked planes, built complex improvised explosive devices or attacked U.S. vessels, as al Qaeda has, Burton said. The major drug trafficking cartels in Mexico do use terror, however, in their rivalries for smuggling routes to the United States market. In one recent sign of escalation, a device that authorities called a car bomb exploded in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, killing four. However, Burton said, it wasn't clear whether it was a case of explosives packed into a car, or a carefully rigged car bomb in the true sense of the word, the type of fine deliniation that separates groups like al Qaeda and Mexican drug cartels.","An FBI webpage includes a quote comparing al Qaeda to Mexican drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan state television has showed the skeletal remains of one of Hugo Chavez's heroes as the country's president called for an investigation into his death. Most historical accounts say tuberculosis killed Simon Bolivar, who died in 1830 at the age of 46. But Chavez ordered investigators to exhume the body of the former military leader and determine whether he was murdered. ""Bolivar is alive. Let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton. He is like lightning, like a sacred fire,"" Chavez said. With the national anthem playing in the background, a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth, revealing a skeleton on the table below. The broadcast then faded to black, showing Chavez singing along to the national anthem. A DNA test will be performed on the remains as well as the clothing items found inside the tomb, Chavez said. He said on his Twitter page that he cried when he first saw Bolivar's remains Thursday. Chavez has credited Bolivar with inspiring him as ""the father of the revolution."" In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. He led the armies that liberated Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown and is credited with spreading democratic principles in Latin America.","Venezuelan state television broadcast images of Simon Bolivar's exhumed skeleton .

"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (CNN) -- Weakening by the hour but still covering a massive area, Hurricane Earl spun off the North Carolina on Thursday night, lashing parts of the Outer Banks with rain and high wind. People along the East Coast made just-in-case preparations despite the waning power of the storm. The hurricane has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday night, but warned that ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks"" of North Carolina. Hurricane warnings and watches stretched from North Carolina to Delaware and into Massachusetts, where a hurricane warning was issued for Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the surrounding area. A hurricane watch was also issued for the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect for most other coastal areas between North Carolina and Nova Scotia. iReport: Share your images and information . As of 8 p.m., the center of Earl was about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 625 miles (1,005 kilometers) south-southwest of Nantucket. It was heading north at about 18 mph (30 kph). A tropical storm warning is now in effect for the coast of Massachusetts from north of Hull to the Merrimack River, and for the coast of Maine from Stonington to Eastport. The tropical storm warning from Cape Fear to west of Surf City, North Carolina, has been discontinued. The storm, which had been a Category 3 until Thursday night, has maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph), the Hurricane Center reported just before 11 p.m. ET. Further weakening is expected overnight, forecasters said, but ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks."" Two more tropical systems are in the Atlantic -- Fiona and Gaston. Fiona is on track for Bermuda, and as of Thursday afternoon, Gaston wasn't threatening any land. Read more on Gaston and Fiona . But for now, all eyes are on Earl. President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for North Carolina on Wednesday evening. The action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts and makes federal funds available. Maryland's governor issued an emergency declaration earlier in the day. The monster storm is forecast to pass close to the Outer Banks on Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said. ""Even if the center of Earl remains offshore ... hurricane force winds are expected to occur in the Outer Banks overnight tonight,"" the center said in its 8 p.m. Thursday forecast. The storm is expected to take aim at southeastern New England on Friday night. ""Hurricane force winds are expected within the Hurricane warning area in Massachusetts Friday night,"" the center said Thursday. Officials in Dare County, North Carolina, issued mandatory evacuation orders Thursday for visitors to the coastal county, including the Outer Banks. The mandatory evacuation extended to residents in some areas, including the town of South Nags Head and Hatteras Island. Dare County schools and courts were closed Thursday and will be closed Friday. Earl concerns homeowners along coast . ""Early this evening Hatteras Island will begin feeling the impact of Hurricane Earl's approach,"" the county said in a statement Thursday evening. ""Throughout the evening, weather conditions will progressively deteriorate ... until the storm leaves the area around daybreak Friday morning."" ""Hurricane Earl will produce high seas, ocean overwash, dangerous rip currents, and strong winds,"" it said. On Thursday night, Dare County Manager Bobby Outten told CNN that ""evacuations went well."" ""We got everybody off Hatteras [Wednesday],"" he said, referring to one coastal island. In other nearby areas, Outten said, ""I'm sure there are people holding out."" ""Residents of Dare County have been through this many times,"" the county's emergency response coordinator, Warren Judge, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""And they have their own individual practices and procedures to get their homes and businesses secured and prepared for the oncoming storm. What we need to happen now is for the visitors to heed the warning, to evacuate."" Earl is a large storm, meaning effects will be widely felt even if it does not make a direct hit. It covers about 166,000 square miles -- larger than California, which covers just under 160,000 square miles. The storm's outflow, or the clouds associated with it, could stretch from one end of the state of Texas to the other, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. The North Carolina coast should begin experiencing tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph by Thursday evening, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph arriving later. Local coverage by CNN affiliate WECT . ""Conditions are going to deteriorate rapidly,"" FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said Thursday, and people should not be lulled into thinking Earl is going to miss them. ""We have teams in all coastal states ready to support (governors) all the way up the New England States,"" Fugate told CNN Thursday night, describing FEMA's standby teams. ""We're not going to wait till things get bad."" Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast, with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet and 3 to 4 inches of rainfall, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible. The National Hurricane Center said those in the hurricane warning area -- coastal North Carolina from Bogue Inlet up to the Virginia state line, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds -- could see storm surge of 3 to 5 feet. However, the most severe part of Earl is expected to remain offshore, which might mean a lower storm surge, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""The fact that it happens overnight always gives us cause for concern,"" Judge said. ""But we're going to get a glancing blow."" He said he hoped the storm will not deal a direct hit to the area and will pass through quickly. ""This is my first hurricane and I'm looking forward to it, "" said Sarah Baker, a native of Oklahoma who works for a vacation rental company in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. ""The locals have been really nice, telling me what I needed to buy to get ready."" Rip currents and stormy seas were reported all the way up the East Coast, from Florida to Maine. Earl will make its closest pass to New Jersey on Friday afternoon, Morris said. It is expected to make its closest pass to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Friday night as a Category 1 hurricane. Tourist towns on Cape see effects from Earl . The long duration of tropical-storm-force winds threatens widespread power outages in parts of the South and the mid-Atlantic region, he said. Earl is expected to make a direct landfall over southern Nova Scotia on Saturday morning as a strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm will turn northeast as it collides with a cold front, said National Hurricane Center director Bill Read. But the hurricane was undergoing a phenomenon known as eyewall replacement, in which the existing eyewall weakens and a new one forms. That means the eye likely will grow in diameter and the storm will grow even larger as hurricane force winds stretch farther out, he said. Several airlines said Wednesday that passengers to and from cities along the Eastern Seaboard, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bangor, Maine, could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty. Though they have not announced cancellations, Air Tran, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers. North Carolina Gov. Bev Purdue urged residents and visitors to prepare for the storm and heed evacuation orders. Indeed, some people were stocking up on food at grocery stores and attaching plywood to windows and doors of coastal homes. However, others thumbed their noses at Earl, set to arrive just ahead of the Labor Day holiday, and said they were staying put. ""We're from Michigan, so we're used to storms,"" one man said. ""But this is our first hurricane, so we're kind of excited about it and hope everything goes well."" ""I got three bottles of wine hidden in there,"" another man said, gesturing toward his grocery bags. ""The kids are good with the milk."" He said Earl ""might ruin some beach time ... looks like it's OK, but we'll keep an eye on the TV."" One sign on the Outer Banks warned, ""Earl, you are not welcome here."" CNN's Angela Fritz and Randy Harber contributed to this report.","NEW: Just before 11 p.m. ET, sustained winds reported at 105 mph .

"(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny. He liked foreign novels, old buildings and could spell in complete words. He looked like a cute professor. Could this be ... my guy? I'd been online dating for a few months -- long enough. There were the guys who lied about their age/height/marital status, the guy who said I was a dead ringer for his favorite blond sports reporter and would I mind putting on a fake newscast for him and my favorite, the guy who asked me not to use face cream because he had a phobia about moisturizers. The Frisky: Cat gives birth to a dog?! Dan seemed so normal. Even with that bright orange shirt. Forgivable. He told me about his knee injury, his love of almond butter and Alpine air. I reciprocated with anecdotes of world travels and professional mishaps. We beamed in mutual online adoration. Two weeks later, I was eating pre-date whole-wheat toast and deciding on outfit options: size 10 pencil skirt, black cashmere sweater, and boots. Understated sexy 30-something outfit, yes! The Frisky: 6 roles intended for men, but cast as women . I went to meet Mr. Could Be, and spotted a guy with a round, waffle-sized bald patch pacing outside the bar. Is that Dan? It was. He looked more Woody Allen than George Clooney. I wondered where the guy in his pictures was tonight. Some awkward gazing and polite chitchat later, he ordered two courses and a bottle of Pinot, and I ordered salad. Then he began the food and fitness inquisition. The Frisky: 10 songs secretly written about celebrities . ""You like fettuccini, right?"" he asked me, twice. ""Yah, but I'm fine with the caprese,"" I said. And this was just supposed to be drinks. ""So, how often do you run?"" he asked, shoving pasta in his face. ""Whenever I can, mostly on the weekends."" ""Not during the week?"" ""I try and avoid that getting raped and robbed in the park after dark thing,"" I said. We discussed our jobs, artistic pursuits and the dog he still visited at his ex's. Then he launched into a half-hour story about his best friend in prison. I wanted to go home, and I crossed my eyes to see if he'd look better blurry. Nope. He was still talking. The waiter came over. The Frisky: 10 famous females who have a twin . ""I hate it when they do that,"" Dan said. ""Do what?"" ""Just assume that we want more wine."" He snorted. And when the bill came, he let it sit there. ""Surely a strong, modern woman like you would like to pay?"" Dan asked. I told him that this strong, modern woman was happy to have him pay. The Frisky: 8 celeb guys with revenge bodies . We walked away, a comfortable distance of non-touchiness in between us. During our pat-on-the-back goodbye, he asked me about my workout schedule -- for the third time. I must have laughed since the air coming from my mouth was visible. Watch me run home now, you freak! I sighed and mentally scribed the ""thanks, but no thanks"" message I'd write to him tomorrow. The Frisky: 7 sexy ladies missing belly buttons . Dan beat me to it. I clicked on his message. It was 13 paragraphs long: . I had a lovely time last night. You are so interesting, and smart and witty. Not to mention as pretty as Springtime. (Far prettier than I am handsome!) I have no idea if you'd like to see me again, but a part of me would strongly like to ask you to do so. But-- . Sigh. As is often the case in this fallen world, there is more that at least one of us--me--must say. I'm an unusually sensitive and empathetic man, who is very aware of other people's (particularly women's) feelings. The task facing me has been to decide whether to simply say ""I had a great time, but didn't feel any chemistry,"" or instead to say more. It won't shock you that I've chosen the latter. So. I'm by no means a fetishist for the skinny women whom Hollywood and Madison Avenue shove down our throats, but--I don't feel chemistry, frisson, with very curvy women. That may well be the end. (You can let me know by writing me an angry final message.) This much is certain: You're beautiful, and there's certainly no health-related reason why you would want to change a thing about yourself. I'm writing, though, because several factors--specifically, that phrase in my profile about me seeking ""[someone] who'd like to move in that direction""; plus your frequent mentions of running; plus your markedly small dinner last night--leave open the possibility that you've decided to embark on and commit to a process of transformation. When I moved back to the city, I weighed 163 pounds and was skinny; I now weigh 185 pounds, with virtually all the gain being muscle. If this is the case, and if you were interested in continuing to explore a relationship with me, you'd find me an encouraging, energetic, optimistic--but firm--addition to your team. Fondly, Dan . I took a long breath and hit the ""reply"" button. Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you. Like how I spat out tuna and little bits of celery all over my keyboard the first time I read your message. Or how, on the second read-through, I had to run to the closest meeting room to hide. That didn't really help since it has glass walls, so now I was crying in a fishbowl. Yeah, thanks for sending me that message. At work. You can take your 'frisson' and go jump off a you-know-what since a man with any testosterone would drool over my cleavage. And that poofball above your forehead isn't fooling anyone, so would you mind growing your hair back, and while you're at it, get some real shoulders, and stop being so rude to the nice waiter pouring our wine. Perhaps then I could consider dating you. Thanks. The one thing I will say, however, is this: I am not your petri dish. Nor is any other woman -- yes, the ones you're out there wooing with your in-depth knowledge of romantic poetry and early 20th century architecture. Enjoy being single, Dan. Forever. Fondly, Me . P.S. I sent your literary bile to my friends, who forwarded it to their respective boyfriends, husbands and mailmen, all of whom want to conduct a manhunt and slowly tear you into little pieces of Dan. Be careful out there. The Frisky: 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 . But I never pressed the ""send"" button. Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them. I am grateful for my body, for its healthy curves propping up my wardrobe, and these legs that run around Central Park and up infinite subway stairs. I don't need a guy to tell me that.

"(CNN) -- She was a call girl working the streets of Sin City. He's a guitarist in a heavy metal band. They found commonality in their Christian faith and Friday evening, the two were married in a Las Vegas, Nevada, ceremony broadcast live via the Web. Its Web site says Hookers for Jesus ""addresses the realities of human sex trafficking."" Annie Lobért, who founded Hookers for Jesus, and musician Oz Fox of the Christian band Stryper said their ""I do's"" at the Church of South Las Vegas in front of an applauding crowd and an audience on the Internet. The wedding had been widely touted on several Christian Web sites. Lobért, 41, walked up to the stage in a white strapless gown, gloves and veil. Earlier this week, she wrote on her MySpace blog: ""I am getting married. It's about time."" She had worked as a prostitute for 11 years, making as much as $500 an hour. She said she hit rock bottom when she overdosed on cocaine and everything went black, according to an ABC interview posted on her Web site. She asked Jesus to help her and became what many jokingly call a ""porn-again Christian."" Lobért says her mission now is to save the souls of women who sell their bodies. She often spends time at night on Las Vegas streets handing out Bibles to prostitutes and seeking to convince them there is a better way to make a living. The Hookers for Jesus Web site describes the organization as ""an international, faith-based organization that addresses the realities of human sex trafficking, sexual violence and exploitation linked to pornography and the sex industry."" Before he administered the vows, Pastor Benny Perez said Lobért was a shining example of Christ's love for everyone. Fox, 47, is a longtime member of Stryper, which stands for Salvation Through Redemption, Yielding Peace, Encouragement and Righteousness.

"Oxford, England (CNN) -- Was last year's financial crisis a chance event? Or was it the product of 35 million years of evolution? Laurie Santos' research suggests that some of the bad choices made on Wall Street and in the mortgage business may have been deeply rooted in the basic nature of the human species. Santos, a professor at Yale University, has been investigating the workings of a dangerous inconsistency in people's attitudes to risk. She spoke about it Wednesday at the TED Global conference in Oxford, a four-day event ending Friday where experts passionate about their work got the chance to give contrasting views of the future we all face. Which would you do: Accept a guaranteed gift of $500 or gamble by taking a risk on a coin toss that would give you $1,000 for heads -- and nothing for tails? Most people would play it safe and take the sure $500, Santos said. What if, instead of a gain, you faced a potential loss? Your choice would be to give up $500 for sure or take a risk on a coin toss that could cost you $1,000 if you lost -- or nothing if you won? Most people opt for taking the risk rather than playing it safe. Using tokens as a form of money and grapes as prized products to be exchanged for the tokens, Santos has shown that capuchin monkeys make the same set of irrational choices -- taking more risk when they have something to lose than when they have something to gain. ""The errors we make are predictable, we make them again and again,"" said Santos, explaining that she wants to learn ""how a species as smart as we are"" can make such persistent mistakes. We can overcome our biological limitations, she said, but first we have to recognize what they are. Adding to the pressure on the human species is the future we're staring down. Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey, imagined the world in 2050. To keep greenhouse gases from reaching an unsustainably damaging level, the needed improvements in energy efficiency would have to occur at a pace 10 times faster than at any time in history. And, Jackson said Thursday, the only times the world has made substantial improvements in reducing carbon emissions have been during recessions. He views the world economy as built on an engine of growth that feeds the appetite of people in Western countries for novelty, for ever more consumer goods that impress others but that can only be purchased by creating more debt. Even if we don't want the products, we have to buy them -- or the economy crashes. In what has probably been the most cited quote of the conference on Twitter, Jackson said, ""We spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about."" Does that mean our choice boils down to this: Crash the economic system or trash the planet? Not exactly, according to Jackson. The answer, he said, lies in creating socially responsible businesses and nonprofits that plow money back into ""protecting and nurturing"" the environment on which our future depends. As an example, he cited ecosia.org, a search engine that says it allocates 80 percent of its search-related revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. Santos and Jackson were by no means the only speakers at TED Global to suggest people make dumb choices but can overcome them by taking the right measures. TED is a nonprofit that distributes ""Ideas Worth Spreading"" through its conferences and through more than 700 talks freely available at its web site. [CNN partners with TED to present one talk every Tuesday, along with added content.] . Among the topics and speakers were: . Making the web really worldwide . Ethan Zuckerman, of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, showed that while the framework and theory of the internet is global, in reality, web traffic tends to stay within a user's country and social networks are generally segregated. We think we're getting a wide view of the world by going online, but ""most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores,"" he said. Since the most compelling problems in the world are global, it will take global solutions to fix them. Zuckerman urges people to become xenophiles, people who take an active interest in other lands. Watch Zuckerman's talk at TED.com . A headset that reads your brain . Tan Le, the head of Emotiv Systems, demonstrated a headset that uses brain activity and facial expressions to control computers and other devices. A volunteer was able to manipulate the image of a cube on a computer screen using the headset, and Le showed how facial expressions, such as a blink or a smile, could control the movement of a wheelchair. Packaging material that biodegrades . Eben Bayer demonstrated an organic replacement for Styrofoam, which winds up taking huge amounts of space in landfills and contributes to the stream of waste in the Pacific and other bodies of water. Bayer showed how fungi can be used to transform crop waste into recyclable packaging that blends back into the soil when it is discarded. Aiming for a zero-waste supermarket . Chef Arthur Potts Dawson, who developed green restaurants in London, has now opened ""The People's Supermarket,"" which aims to produce virtually no food waste. He said food is one of the most wasteful industries in the world but that practices including composting and allowing diners to choose how big a portion they want can dramatically reduce waste. ""If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, we will fail,"" he said. Are whales and dolphins wise? Marine wildlife researcher Toni Frohoff, who studies dolphins and whales, says the question shouldn't only be are these mammals intelligent; she asks whether we should say they are wise. They exhibit strong social behavior and reach out to humans, even though they're often hunted and sometimes driven close to extermination. She showed videos of a pair of free-ranging dolphins in the Bahamas rubbing pectoral fins to show affection, of a beluga whale in eastern Canada watching its reflection in a large camera lens, of an orca mimicking a person's whistling sound, of a gray whale in the eastern Pacific that allowed people in a small boat to rub her newborn calf even though the mother bore a harpoon scar. She also told the story of a pod of dolphins encircling a swimmer who was having difficulty in the water until human rescuers could come to her aid. Online video is revolutionizing the world's talent . TED curator Chris Anderson sketched the potential for online video to do for communication what the Gutenberg printing press did for writing. Online video can drive ""crowd-accelerated innovation"" that elevates the work of emerging dancers, artists, teachers and thinkers, who can see what their peers are doing everywhere. The rise of online video allows ""the world's talent to be shared,"" Anderson said. ""Who's the teacher? You're the teacher ... capable of carrying all of us to a smarter, wiser place.""","TED Global speakers focus on ways to overcome faults in human nature, human systems .

"(CNN) -- Despite everyone talking about Arizona's new immigration law, Senate Bill 1070, no one has asked if it was Arizona's best option. Was there no other approach to address immigration without undermining the state's economy or shredding our social fabric? Nobody had a better idea for balancing security with the draw and demand of American jobs? What about an offer to work with Congress? Was the only solution to blow up the place? It should concern everyone that no one asked these questions. If you watch the SB1070 hearings here, not a single legislator asks about or offers alternatives, although a few express ""concerns."" One legislator, Daniel Patterson, strongly challenged the law's sponsor, state Sen. Russell Pearce, on his immigration claims. Patterson's courage was rewarded with the loss of his committee assignment. Pearce announced he would run primary challengers against any Republican who voted against SB1070. He threatened to hold up bills sponsored by anyone who did not support SB1070. He was so hell bent on passing his immigration bill that he packed hearings with supporters and, surprise, committee chairs limited the speaking time of opponents. Even if someone had another idea, the process was set up to ignore it. So what hath SB1070 wrought? Distrust. Blame. Boycotts. Poorly worded protest signs. There's the rumored loss of 200,000 to 300,000 convention room bookings for 2011-2013. There's damage to Arizona's reputation. Hispanic citizens expect to be racially profiled. There's the potential filing of hundreds of lawsuits against state and local government agencies and big paydays for the lawyers who will try those cases. Nothing much positive so far -- but it gets worse. Simple math suggests kicking 300,000 workers out of the state means at least a $6 billion hit to Arizona's economy. Add those jobs lost in support or supply businesses and the impact could reach $29 billion annually. Don't expect the law's proponents to have a plan for replacing those lost billions with anything other than empty promises of thousands of newly available low-paying jobs and overestimated savings -- all based on a flawed report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The report ignores that undocumented workers and family members pay the very same property and sales taxes that fund Arizona's education system and the state's general fund. It ignores the contributions that children who are citizens make to the state's tax base once they enter the workforce. If undocumented worker departures open up jobs, then why is the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting Arizona's unemployment rate increased every month since SB1070 was signed into law? The bureau reports that Arizona lost 11,700 jobs from May to June and unemployment rose to 9.7 percent. We see news reports of immigrants leaving all the time, so jobs must be available. How can this be? The fact is, SB1070 is pushing out both the legal and the undocumented. They own businesses. They employ people. They pay taxes. They own homes. They spend money at stores owned by people who aren't leaving. Those businesses will lay off workers, reduce operations or close. That means fewer jobs, increased housing and commercial vacancies, depressed home values and foreclosures, and less sales, property and employment tax revenue for the state. We see it happening daily. Anyone paying attention could have seen this coming. Unfortunately, few really were. The rest were ""satisficed"" -- a combination of satisfied and sufficed that means settling on any solution rather than an optimal one -- that SB1070 would solve the problem, in glorious denial as to the real damage the bill is doing to Arizona. Has SB1070 solved any part of the problem? SB1070 doesn't secure the border and the unemployment figures don't indicate any improvement. It has created far more economic and social problems than it solves, but few proponents want to admit that. This is the result of not asking, ""Is there a better way?"" States considering mimicking SB1070 would be wise to heed warnings of adverse economic and social impacts. They would be wiser to question the ""facts"" SB1070 proponents trot out to support similar efforts. They would be wisest to say, ""What else have you got?"" Is there a better way? How about putting Ellis Island-type centers on the borders and channeling everyone looking for work through them? Employers, as in current law, would  tell the government what type and how many jobs they need, ones that aren't being filled by domestic workers. Those jobs would be advertised on the internet, where interested immigrants and Americans can compete for them. Knowing the job demand, Congress could set market-based visa quotas that make sense. Instead of paying coyotes $2,500 to be smuggled into the United States, the job seekers would pay Uncle Sam to expedite the privilege. This takes billions out of the hands of smugglers and funds the solution to the problem. If 500,000 people are crossing into Arizona each year, this generates $1.25 billion to help cover the costs of building and operating these centers, with access to labor for business and better allocation of Border Patrol resources to finding drug smugglers. Read more about the proposal here. Arizonans have lived with political obsession and distortion on immigration for four years and my only suggestion to other states is: Don't follow our lead. Think of something else, because SB1070 isn't worth the economic and social trouble.

"Durham, North Carolina (CNN) -- The earthquake of 2010 is not the first one of this magnitude in Chile's long, traumatic history. Almost 50 years ago, I was watching a soccer match in the National Stadium in Chile's capital when, seconds after a gigantic rumble from under the ground terrified the 60,000 fans attending the game, the mountains suddenly disappeared. I am not exaggerating: The stadium was rocked like a cradle and rose in the air, blotting out my view of the Andes, and then, fortunately for all of us, settled back to stability. We had just been through what is still considered, at 9.6 on the Richter scale, the greatest seismic activity ever recorded. We soon learned that the epicenter had been more than 400 miles south of Santiago and that the devastation was massive. On top of the quake itself, which had flattened towns and killed thousands, a tsunami had swept our coast, causing even more havoc. A few months later, when I traveled to that region, I saw for myself the masts of large sunken ships in the Valdivia River many miles inland, and the remains of colossal iron-smelting ovens in Corral that had been twisted beyond recognition by the rush of the invading waters. The human toll was unbearable. From the survivors, I heard of men, women, children heading for the hills and being sucked out to sea as if they were driftwood. I remember all this now so many decades later as I watch, this time from afar, this time from the safety of my home in the United States, yet another ruinous earthquake destroy my country. I remember el gran terremoto de 1960 to offer myself some sort of historical perspective on the recent earthquake, offer myself some trembling ground, so to speak, beneath my feet, as I try to come to terms with the possible meaning of what has just happened. It is obscene to compare cataclysms as if they were contestants in a horror show -- this one cost so many billions, that one cost so many lives -- and yet, to measure what has changed in Chile between these two major disasters in the intervening half century may help us to answer what is, after all, the most urgent question of the moment: What lies ahead? Chile is today a far more prosperous country than it was 50 years ago. Its economy is considered the most dynamic and advanced in all of Latin America -- even though still ravaged now by a grossly unfair distribution of income. This relative affluence of Chile (the GDP today is 15 times more than in 1960!) leaves us better equipped to deal with our current catastrophe, as we have human and scientific resources that we could scarcely have dreamt of back then, to the point that our wonderful outgoing president, Michele Bachelet, initially informed the international community that the country would not require foreign assistance (she has since modified that stance and aid from abroad is starting to arrive). Paradoxically, however, Chile's advances in technology, its abundance of material goods, its many highways and bypasses, its enormous fleet of planes and cars and high-rises, leaves much more of the land and many more of its citizens open to distress, and makes the economy more vulnerable. The richer you are, the harder your potential fall. The more roads you have, the more cracks in the pavement. This wealth, furthermore, has not been accumulated without severe social consequences. Back in 1960, the whole nation came together to rebuild the country. I spent the month after the earthquake, like many university students, collecting money, food, blankets and mattresses that were sent down to the south in caravans filled with enthusiastic volunteers. It was a lesson in solidarity that I have never forgotten -- those who were most deprived gave so much, cared so much, sacrificed so much for their wounded compatriots. If Chile is more opulent now, it has also become a more egocentric and individualistic society where, instead of a vision of social justice for all, the citizenry is, for the most part, engaged in a frenzied race toward ever more consumption and subject, of course, to the accompanying stress and anomie. Like all major misfortunes, the current tragedy of Chile can be seen as a test, a chance to ask ourselves who we really are, what really matters as we rebuild, not only our wrecked hospitals and broken roads and fractured bodies, but our damaged identity. I believe that the deepest wells of that solidarity and fellowship I witnessed when the earthquake of 1960 reduced my land to rubble is still inside most of the people of Chile, and will constitute the main source of our efforts to lift our country up from its desolation, the reason why we may be able to once again prevail, as so many times in the past, against the forces of blind nature. Fifty years ago, the people of Chile found a way to survive all that death and destruction and I can only hope that this time we can painfully, painstakingly, even joyfully, do it again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ariel Dorfman.","In 1960, an earthquake shook Chile, the most powerful one ever recorded .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A car bomb in the Russian republic of Dagestan killed a driver and injured a government official and his two bodyguards on Saturday, state-run news agencies said. Bekmurza Bekmurzayev -- Dagestan's minister of national policy, Information and external relations -- received minor, non life-threatening, injuries, Itar-Tass reported. Investigators said the victims were headed to work in two cars from the minister's apartment in Makhachkala, the region's capital, when a device at the bottom of one of the vehicles exploded seconds later and caused a fire. It wasn't clear which car Bekmurzayev was riding in. Bekmurzayev was targeted because of his work, Itar-Tass said. Similar attacks in 2003 and 2005 killed his two predecessors, Russia Today said. Moscow has been targeting terrorism in Dagestan and other regions of the Caucasus, such as Ingushetia and Chechnya. In recent years, Dagestan has faced ethnic friction, spillover from the discord in neighboring Chechnya and attacks on government officials by Islamists, the International Crisis Group said.","Dagestan is in the turbulent Caucasus region .

"Washington (CNN) -- Monkeys on cocaine. New windows for a closed visitor's center. Modern dance as a tool for software development. A report released Tuesday by conservative Sens. Tom Coburn and John McCain cited these and 97 other projects as leading examples of misguided or wasteful spending under the Obama administration's $862 billion economic stimulus bill. Titled ""Summertime Blues,"" the report is the third by the two senators targeting projects that they say fail to meet the job-creation goal of spending under the Recovery Act of 2009. The report highlights the extraordinary ""waste and mismanagement"" of taxpayer dollars, said McCain, R-Arizona.  The stimulus plan ""was supposed to create jobs.  It does not."" The ""American people have awakened to the incompetency of Washington,"" declared Coburn, R-Oklahoma.  ""The rest of the federal government is filled with stuff just like this."" Both senators conceded that the stimulus plan has had some positive effect on the economy, but insisted any benefit was due solely to the sheer size of the package, and that its effectiveness had been blunted due its poor design and spending choices. Coburn complained the measure was full of projects that are ""stupid or inappropriate,"" and fail to meet ""the common sense test."" The plan failed to give ""us the biggest bang for our buck,"" he asserted. The Recovery Act, which was passed a few weeks after President Barack Obama took office, was a government-funded effort to kick-start economic activity in response to the ongoing recession. It called for ""shovel-ready"" jobs -- from road and bridge repair and construction to scientific research and expanded broadband and wireless service -- through federal contracts, grants and loans, as well as helping state and local governments avoid layoffs and funding tax cuts. The senators' report challenged the viability or effectiveness of specific projects across the country. However, the report's use of selected information from hundreds of footnoted sources left it unclear if the brief summaries of each project told the whole story. In a previous report last January, the senators included the Napa Valley Wine Train as an example of wasteful stimulus spending without mentioning that the money was for a flood control project along the train's route, rather than the train itself. The latest edition covered a broad range of projects including construction, research, development and conservation. Topping the list was $554,763 spent for new windows at the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center at Mount St. Helens in Washington state. The U.S. Forest Service facility opened in 1993 at a cost of $11.5 million to provide visitors with panoramic views of the scenic volcano. However, it closed in 2007 due to staffing shortages, and now is getting the stimulus funds to replace its trademark windows in preparation for use for another purpose, according to information provided by the Forest Service. ""One government official likened it to 'keeping a vacant house in good repair,' while another official noted that there is hope to find some purpose for the building in the future, whether as a hotel, science camp or restaurant,"" the report said, attributing the information to a July 2009 article on tdn.com, a local news website. ""Despite those efforts, there are no plans to use the empty space."" The Forest Service information provided no timetable for the possible reopening of the visitors' center for another purpose. ""The Forest Service is now reviewing several proposals for how the facility could be used in the future through a variety of public-private partnerships, including a science facility, education camp, or an overnight lodge,"" the Forest Service document said. Ranked second on the senators' list was a University of North Carolina at Charlotte project that received $762,372 in stimulus finds to develop a computerized choreography program, the report said. Quoting a July 6 story posted on the Charlotte-based news website WCNC.com, the report said the project involves recording dancers on video, then logging and analyzing their movements. ""This will allow choreographers to explore the interactive dance without always having a full cast of dancers present,"" said the grant posted on the government's stimulus bill website, recovery.gov. ""The system will be extended into a Web-based 'Dance Tube' application that will allow the public to engage in interactive dance choreography,"" the grant goes on to say. However, the senators' report initially failed to state the money was spread over three years. Again citing the WCNC.com story, it also initially said lead researcher Celine Latulipe ""noted that her funding was severely restricted by the fact that the university is taking a 44 percent cut to cover 'overhead' expenses."" In reality the website story said: ""The money is spread over three years and Latulipe points out the university takes 44 percent overhead."" After the discrepancy was pointed out by CNN, the report was changed, an aide to Coburn said. In an interview with CNN, Latulipe said the project fit the kind of research and development work called for by the Recovery Act. Through its application and further development, it could lead to audiences having an impact on performance by registering their reaction through handheld audience response devices, Latulipe said. ""We'll need to develop a bunch of different software packages that never existed before,"" she said, adding that project employs three students part-time over its three-year span and pays for dancers and other participants in what amounts to direct economic activity. ""I think it's sad that this research money that is really allowing innovation and funding students doing great research is being used as a political tool,"" Latulipe said. Then there is the project listed at No. 28 by the senators -- $71,623 to researchers at Wake Forest University to see how monkeys react under the effects of cocaine. Titled ""Effect of Cocaine Self-Administration on Metabotropic Glutamate Systems,"" the project calls for monkeys to self-administer drugs while researchers monitor and study their glutamate levels, the report said. It cited a March 8 Raleigh News and Observer article that quoted Wake Forest University School of Medicine spokesman Mark Wright as saying the stimulus money would allow the university to continue a job that otherwise might have been cut. Paula Faria, assistant vice president for media relations at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, said the grant will ""have significant impact on public health in regards to cocaine addiction and the issue of relapse."" ""It's also important to note that the applications for these grants are peer reviewed and this study was deemed of merit by a panel of scientific experts, and then reviewed by the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse before funds were awarded,"" Faria said in a statement to CNN. Liz Oxhorn, the White House spokesperson for the Recovery Act, called the senators' report a partisan effort intended to undermine the overall success of the Recovery Act. According to Oxhorn, new research shows stimulus money is responsible for nearly 3 million jobs and has lowered unemployment by 1.5 percent. ""We'll look into each of their claims and take action if any have merit, but with more than 70,000 Recovery Act projects underway, any misguided project is just a small fraction of tens of thousands coast to coast that are rebuilding America and putting people to work,"" Oxhorn said. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs Tuesday dismissed the GOP report as ""political,"" and said it lacked credibility.

Although Collins would not comment, typically when a report is sent for a higher-level review by the Defense Department it is an indication that people from other services or civilians may be cited for wrongdoing.

"(CNN) -- A federal district court has dismissed a challenge filed by a Tucson police officer against Arizona's tough new immigration law. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said Tuesday that Tucson officer Martin Escobar lacks the legal standing to sue, according to court documents. Escobar's lawsuit was one of several against Arizona's controversial immigration law. The Justice Department mounted a successful challenge to Arizona's law in July. On the eve of the law going into effect, Bolton granted a preliminary injunction that blocked the most controversial parts of the law. The injunction means police are prevented from questioning people's immigration status if there is reason to believe they are in the country illegally, which was a hotly debated part of law. Bolton also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime to fail to apply for or carry alien registration papers or ""for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work,"" and a provision ""authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person"" if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation. Other parts of the law, however, went into effect. This includes a ban on so-called sanctuary cities and the criminalization of hiring day laborers who are in the country illegally. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has appealed the judge's decision to side with the Justice Department in its challenge of the immigration law. She said she was pleased with the judge's decision in the case involving the Tucson officer. ""I strongly believe that Arizona will ultimately prevail in all of these legal challenges. My defense of the rule of law will continue,"" Brewer said.","Justice Department challenges the law .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- French police raided the Paris home of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt on Wednesday, a local prosecutor told CNN. Investigators have been looking into Bettencourt's finances for weeks after allegations of secret, possibly illegal payments to French politicians, including President Nicolas Sarkozy. The lawyer for Bettencourt, reported to be France's richest woman, asked the court last month to stop the retrieval of additional information on his client. A decision on his request is due in two weeks. Bettencourt is at the center of several ongoing cases, including the one involving the alleged payments to politicians. Her former bookkeeper, Claire Thibout, told police she received envelopes of cash that were to be given to Sarkozy and French Labor Minister Eric Woerth, who previously worked in the Budget Ministry and was in charge of reforms to France's retirement system. Thibout said she withdrew the sums of money at the request of Bettencourt's financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre. Police have questioned de Maistre several times about the allegations, which Sarkozy and Woerth have both denied. The alleged payments came to light in secret recordings, purportedly made by Bettencourt's butler and revealed this summer, that also refer to a Bettencourt bank account in Switzerland containing 80 million euros ($98.3 million) which had not been reported on her taxes. At the same time, Bettencourt's daughter went to court in June accusing a photographer of bilking her mother out of a billion euros.  Bettencourt was friends with the photographer, Francois-Marie Banier, and allegedly gave him the money. The daughter, however, claims her mother is not mentally competent to handle her own affairs and took the case to court to recover the funds. Bettencourt has since cut Banier out of her will, her lawyer, Georges Kiejman, told CNN on Wednesday. Banier had been the sole heir to Bettencourt's fortune, and no one has been added to the will in his place, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Kiejman. CNN's Sarah Goddard contributed to this report.","Liliane Bettencourt is at the center of several ongoing cases .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- An American's cartoon showing the eagle in the Mexican flag dead in a pool of blood is drawing criticism. The sketch created by political cartoonist Daryl Cagle depicts the green, white, and red Mexican flag with a bullet-riddled eagle sprawled in the center of the emblem. Mexico's coat of arms includes the eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus, devouring a snake. Cagle says he created the cartoon to depict the violence rampant in parts of Mexico. ""Editorial cartoonists look for readily recognizable metaphors and that's an obvious one for Mexico,"" says Cagle. More than 28,000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderón declared war on drug cartels after taking office in December 2006. But the cartoon has offended many Mexicans who feel their national symbol is off limits, especially to foreign cartoonists. Many readers reacted angrily when the cartoon was displayed on the front page of newspapers. ""It is a shame that a patriotic symbol like our flag, which is so beautiful to me, can be mocked by a stupid cartoonist,"" wrote a reader to the Mexico City newspaper El Universal. ""I think there are many other ways to graphically protest what's happening in our country."" Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said that ""as any democratic society, Mexico respects and defends freedom of speech and freedom of expression, in any way it's manifested. Regarding the case of Mr. Cagle's cartoon, we differ on the use he makes of the Mexican flag and the message it conveys."" Mexican cartoonist Paco Calderón reprinted Cagle's cartoon on the Reforma newspaper, adding his own comment. ""I'm not offended by the cartoon. I'm offended by reality and the huarache-wearing Taliban members,"" he said. Huarache is a type of a Mexican sandal and Calderón was using the reference to talk about members of the seven drug cartels terrorizing Mexico. Even President Felipe Calderón admits the situation in his country is dire. ""As we all know, we face unscrupulous criminals with enormous economic capacity and great firepower,"" said the president in his fourth state-of-the-nation speech Thursday. ""I am fully aware that in the past year the problem of violence has risen."" Cagle admits he's somewhat surprised by the reaction to his cartoon. ""This one has been a little unusual in that it has been splashed all over the press in Mexico and I've been hearing quite a lot about it,"" he says. Cagle, who is the editorial cartoonist for msnbc.com, says his work appears in 850 subscribing newspapers around the world. ""All I was looking to here is make a statement that the violent in Mexico is terrible and make it visually compelling."" In 2008, Mexican pop sensation Paulina Rubio was fined more than $4,000 after posing nude wrapped in the flag for Cosmpolitan, a Spanish magazine.","Cartoon depicts eagle in Mexican flag dead in a pool of blood .

"(CNN) -- An al Qaeda-linked militant movement has taken control of a radio station in Somalia's capital, the government announced Saturday. The weak central government claims the group is spreading propaganda from at least two radio stations, including Mogadishu's Holy Quran radio, a private FM station, which it took earlier this week. Al-Shabaab earlier this year looted private radio equipment to use in a station, the government said. ""We strongly condemn these acts. They want to silence the independent media with brutality and intolerance,"" said . Abdirahman Omar Osman, Somalia's minister of information. Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, controls much of southern Somalia and portions of Mogadishu. It follows the strict Saudi Arabian-inspired Wahabi interpretation of Islam, rather than the Sufi Islam of many Somalis. ""Somalis in remote areas are not educated in the detail of Islam,"" the transitional government said in a statement. ""They are vulnerable to radicalization and Al-Shabaab is intent on using radio as a means to impose their views and extreme interpretation of our faith and to brainwash the young men, women and children, especially in rural areas, where the number of educated people is limited. ""This is a serious issue as we see that the recent forced recruitment of young men and boys is occurring outside the capital Mogadishu."" The National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) condemned the takeover of Holy Quran Radio as a ""blatant crime."" In a statement issued earlier this week, al-Shabaab said all radio equipment belonged to Somali Muslims and that listeners in the capital will enjoy religious programs and other coverage. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Militant Islamic group controls radio stations .

""Considering information available at present, my judgment is that the classification of the crime is rape."" She said more investigation is necessary before she can make a final decision. An ongoing investigation about a separate charge of molestation will be extended, she added, but the charge will also be escalated to include a sexual component. The molestation charge was previously equivalent to a non-sexual charge of harassment, but it will now come under the heading of sexual coercion and sexual molestation, which are both crimes, she said. Assange's lawyer, Leif Silbersky, said he and his client were ""very surprised"" at the decisions. ""It's unbelievable,"" he told CNN. ""We thought that this circus had ended. Now it's happening all over again."" Prosecutors questioned Assange for about an hour on Monday, though only about the complaint of molestation, Silbersky told CNN. He said police never mentioned the rape allegation during that questioning. ""He maintains that he is completely innocent,"" Silbersky said. Silbersky said he has not been shown anything about the rape allegation and is not sure what the next step is. Swedish authorities arrested Assange ""in absentia"" last month on charges of rape and molestation. The chief prosecutor later revoked the arrest warrant and dropped the rape charge. The charges came from two separate women. The lawyer for both women appealed, asking for the rape charge to be reinstated and the molestation charge to be upgraded to include a sexual component. Before he was questioned, Assange told CNN he had no idea what the case was about. Assange told the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera August 22 the accusations are ""clearly a smear campaign."" The only question, he said, is who is behind it. The allegations follow WikiLeaks' release last month of 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has criticized the leak, saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. Assange has defended the leak, saying it can help shape the public's understanding of the war. He said the material was of no operational significance and that WikiLeaks tried to ensure the material did not put innocent people at risk. The attorney for the alleged victims has told CNN that rumors of possible Pentagon or CIA involvement in the sex crime accusations against Assange are ""complete nonsense.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A new anti-crime technology has reached downtown Washington -- but so far, it's getting a mixed reception. A device called the Mosquito, which makes a high-pitched noise aimed at driving away young loiterers, has been installed near a Metro entrance just down the block from the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. ""I thought it was really annoying,"" said a passerby named Conrad, during a break in the noise. ""It gave me a headache."" Some pedestrians looked around bewildered until they found the source of the noise, which sounds like an electronic beeping; but most people who walked by showed no reaction at all. The Mosquito's sound has to compete with the everyday urban cacophony of traffic, the Metro, and a couple of video billboards pitching ads. The building's management company, Transwestern, says the new device was installed in the past few weeks in response to loiterers. The area is a popular strip at night, but a month ago, police say, a fight that began at the Gallery Place Metro station around 11 p.m. grew to a brawl involving 50 or 60 teenagers and young adults. Five people were hospitalized with injuries. A local youth advocate is critical of the device. ""This isn't the best solution,"" said Judith Sandalow, whose Children's Law Center is just down the block. ""We need to have better programs for youth, we need to engage them in activities."" Transwestern issued a statement saying its goal is to ensure ""a pleasant and fulfilling experience to each visitor."" But Conrad, who declined to give his last name as he passed by, said the cure might be worse than the disease. ""I probably wouldn't shop at any of these shops if I heard it again. It doesn't just target the people who are causing the problems."" Another passerby, who said he was 15, told CNN, ""I think we should be able to hang out where you want, as long as it's not rambunctious or disruptive."" Mike Gibson, whose company is the distributor for the Mosquito, said the device is particularly effective on youths ages 13 to 25, because that is the age at which humans can hear the highest pitches. ""When a youth hears the sound, they find it extremely annoying and will leave the area in a few minutes,"" he said. ""The sound is benign, will not harm anyone, and is very effective in moving loiterers from an area."" But Transwestern said it has set its Mosquito at a pitch that can be heard by all ages, not one that targets teenagers in particular. For anyone curious about whether their ears can hear the noise, there are samples of the sound at various pitches on the company's website, http://www.movingsoundtech.com.","A noisemaker installed near a Metro entrance aims to keep people moving .

"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN) -- Recovery crews worked in a West Virginia coal mine Monday, hoping to bring out by late afternoon the last nine bodies remaining there out of the 29 miners who died in an explosion a week ago, officials said. Authorities redirected airflow in the mine to decrease methane levels that had impeded recovery efforts on Sunday, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. Thirteen bodies were removed Sunday, and rescue teams re-entered the mine around midnight. Officials predicted the remaining nine bodies would be removed by 4 or 5 p.m. Monday, Jarrett said. While a state and federal investigation began immediately after the blast at the Upper Big Branch South Mine, officials cannot fully study conditions inside the mine until the bodies are removed, said Jimmy Gianato, West Virginia director of homeland security. The U.S. flag will be lowered to half-staff at all federal buildings in West Virginia for a week to honor the miners, according to a proclamation signed Monday by President Obama. Hours after rescue efforts at the mine turned into a recovery operation Saturday, Obama urged a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion, saying, ""We cannot bring back the men we lost. What we can do, in their memory, is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability."" Crews on Saturday found the bodies of the last four miners who were unaccounted for after the blast. The death toll previously had stood at 25. The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, in an audio message released Sunday, offered prayers for those affected by the explosion and the families of the dead, and praised the perseverance of the rescue workers. ""You have our deepest sympathies, our deepest support,"" Rockefeller said, ""and please know that all of us grieve for your loss."" Obama plans to meet with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and a Mine Safety and Health Administration official to hear their initial assessment of what caused the blast, along with their recommendations for steps the federal government should take to improve safety. Richmond, Virginia-based Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine, said in a statement released Friday that it will conduct ""extensive"" reviews of the mine accident ""to ensure that a similar incident doesn't happen again."" Some have pointed to Massey's safety record in the wake of the blast. But the company said the mine has had less than one violation per day in inspections by MSHA and added the rate is ""consistent with national averages."" Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long-wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin said Saturday that even though the cause of the explosion is unclear, there needs to be a focus on better ventilation and on sensors to alert mine personnel when gas levels become dangerous. ""We are going to get to the bottom of this, because families should never have to pray, as they send their loved ones to work every day, that those loved ones will in fact return,"" Rockefeller said Sunday. ""Our heroic coal miners have lost too many brothers and too many sisters, and now we must stop all of this.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- In February, when Ben Harper, Joseph Arthur and Dhani Harrison arrived at the Carriage House studio in Los Angeles' Silverlake neighborhood, they had three days booked and zero songs to record. ""I thought I was going there to add some guitars or harmonies on Joseph's album,"" says Harrison, who was invited to the session by Harper, whom he befriended at a skate park in Santa Monica. ""When I got to the studio, I saw Joe and asked, 'What songs are we going to do?' He said we hadn't written them yet."" After three long days, the trio had recorded the nine acoustic tracks that make up ""As I Call You Down"" -- and called themselves Fistful of Mercy, after the track of the same name. ""I never thought we'd pull off an entire album, [I thought] maybe we'd get an EP,"" says Harper, who credits Arthur as the catalyst who pushed for three songs a day. ""The three of us were able to create something we never could have done on our own."" With three acoustic guitars and three microphones, the team worked out musical arrangements, and then retreated to different corners of the studio to write. ""We were each others' lyric police,"" says Arthur. (""It was very 'Wilbury' style,"" says Harrison, whose late father George was a member of the Travelin' Wilburys.) Many times, Harrison threw out lyrical themes for inspiration. ""Things Go 'Round"" is a throwback to John Lennon's ""Instant Karma,"" imagining a world where people are immediately accountable for their actions. When Harrison called for a blues number, the trio quickly drafted ""My Father's Son."" Says Arthur: ""It's really about the three of our voices, and the harmonies. We're basically singing together the whole time."" With nine acoustic and vocal tracks completed, Harrison was determined to ratchet the music up to another level. He instinctively called the legendary session drummer Jim Keltner, an old family friend. ""I'd never done anything that I thought was worthy of calling Jim,"" says Harrison. ""We had an emotional conversation on the phone, and he heard some of the stuff we'd done, and he said he'd do it."" Keltner overdubbed percussion, Arthur added bass, and Harper (who calls Keltner the ""Dalai Lama of the drums"") added some slide guitar. ""These guys are so talented,"" says Harrison of his bandmates, who will all hit the road together in October. ""I can't believe I get to call them my musical brothers.""

"(CNN) -- The gunman who held three people hostage at the Discovery Channel headquarters was once convicted of smuggling an illegal immigrant into the country from Mexico. In 2003, James Lee, pleaded guilty to smuggling a woman from Tijuana, according to documents from a California federal court. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the crime. In court documents, Lee admitted to smuggling immigrants at least three times and being paid for it. This revelation comes in stark contrast to the manifesto Lee left where he railed against immigrants. Lee was killed by police Wednesday after the attacker held three people hostage for hours in the Discovery Channel offices in Silver Spring, Maryland. Lee was linked to a manifesto that was posted on the Internet, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The writer blasted immigration, farming, weapons of mass destruction, automotive pollution ""and the whole blasted human economy."" On immigration, he said: ""Programs must be developed to find solutions to stopping ALL immigration pollution and the anchor baby filth that follows that. Find solutions to stopping it,"" the statement said. The hostages were unharmed in the Wednesday incident. Police on Thursday said that Lee had two starter pistols that he used during the standoff, and not handguns as previously thought. Montgomery County Fire Chief Richard Bowers said that authorities recovered four devices from the scene, and an additional four devices from a residence. He described the objects only as ""devices,"" and said that they were rendered safe and detonated.","In 2003, James Lee, pleaded guilty to smuggling a woman from Mexico .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The judge declared a mistrial in the sham marriage trial of Mexican soap opera actress Fernanda Romero on Friday after jurors said they were deadlocked with no hope of agreeing. The U.S. Attorney's office did not immediately say if the case will be retried, but the judge set a hearing for January to discuss the case. A defense lawyer said the Romero was disappointed that the prosecution of her may continue. It was a trial filled with so many twists and turns that the judge compared it to a soap opera. Most of the 12 jurors individually told the judge on Thursday that they could not reach a verdict unless he replaced a ""hostile"" member of the jury. The juror was kept on the panel. ""It would be extremely difficult,"" one male juror told the judge. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real decided not to remove the woman and instead ordered jurors to keep trying. Ultimately, they could not decide if Romero married Kent Ross, a pizza delivery man and musician, for love or for a U.S. work visa. Jurors heard the tearful testimony of the actress proclaiming love for her husband, along with evidence she engaged in a romance with a photographer less than a year after her wedding. The prosecutor argued Romero paid Ross $5,000 to be her husband in June 2005 so she could get a U.S. work visa. ""Why would anybody have to be paid to marry her?"" asked defense lawyer Michael Nasatir, pointing to the beautiful actress-singer-model. Romero and Ross were both 23 when they had a Los Angeles wedding. Only the bride's mother and a handful of others attended, but Romero said a larger wedding was impossible because he is a Mormon and she's a devout Catholic. There was no honeymoon, which Special Assistant U.S. Attorney James Left argued was evidence of a sham marriage. ""You'd figure they could go somewhere, Palm Springs, San Diego,"" Left said during closing arguments Wednesday. They did have pictures together, which the prosecution suggested were staged to present to immigration officials who would decide on her green card. When immigration agents conducted a surprise ""bed check"" at Romero's Los Angeles apartment in October 2007 they found her, but not him. They found Ross at a Hollywood apartment, they testified. Romero testified that she really loved Ross when they got married and she intended to build a life with him. The first months were ""very loving, fun,"" she said. ""We socialized together, passionate. It was the honeymoon stage,"" she said. But his drinking and late night cavorting split them just seven months after their wedding, she said. ""We started to fight a lot, sweat a lot, throw things. It was not healthy,"" Romero said. Her defense lawyer argued jurors only have to conclude that the marriage was real when it began. ""There are all kinds of marriages,"" Nasatir said. ""No one else knows if people are in love."" The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. Judge Real blocked the defense from using much of the evidence they said would show it was only investigated because Romero was turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances. She met Markus Klinko at a Hollywood casting call about the same time her marriage was ""on the rocks,"" she said. Klinko, a 49-year-old Swiss native, is the star of his own reality TV show -- Bravo's ""Double Exposure."" Romero said the relationship initially was ""professional and creative,"" but she eventually engaged in a ""short affair"" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. ""I felt very pressured and I was vulnerable,"" Romero said as she cried. ""It was the biggest mistake I've done in my life."" Her friendship with Klinko turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair, she said. ""Mr. Klinko wanted more and more and he knew I wasn't able to give it to him,"" she said. Klinko threatened to turn her in to immigration officials, she said. ""He was losing it, he was very psycho,"" Romero said. ""I was very scared, because he wouldn't stop."" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week, he said it was ""completely incorrect"" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said. The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might be extorted by Ball. ""My case has never been against Fernanda,"" Klinko said after his testimony. ""I wish her the best."" They could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences, according to the prosecutor. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JC Penney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her online biography says.","NEW: Judge in Los Angeles declares a mistrial .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Clark County, Nevada, filed a felony charge against Paris Hilton on Monday stemming from her arrest over the weekend on suspicion of cocaine possession. Hilton was charged with possession of a controlled substance. She is set to be arraigned October 27 in Clark County District Court, according to courthouse spokeswoman Jillian Prieto. The hotel heiress, 29, was arrested late Friday. Police pulled alongside a Cadillac Escalade in which Hilton was a passenger about 11:30 p.m. and smelled ""a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle,"" according to the arrest report. When the officer looked over, ""the female passenger started to put the window of the vehicle up,"" the report said. Police told the driver of the Cadillac to pull over, which he did, in front of the Wynn Hotel. The driver, whom police identified as Cy Waits, 34, was arrested for driving under the influence after he failed field sobriety tests, the report said. Waits is a Las Vegas nightclub mogul and Hilton's rumored boyfriend. Authorities immediately recognized Hilton as the passenger, the arrest report said, but police did not want to release the vehicle to her following Waits' arrest because of the continuing investigation and also because of the strong odor of marijuana emanating from the SUV. A large crowd began to gather at the side of the vehicle as people realized Hilton was inside, the report said. The police lieutenant who wrote the report, identified as D. Flynn, said he approached the vehicle and told Hilton she needed to get out, as police were going to search it for drugs. ""Hilton told me that she was extremely embarrassed, due to all the people taking pictures of her, and she did not want to be seen by them,"" the report said. She said she wanted to stay and see what was going to happen to Waits, but also needed to use the bathroom. She asked Flynn if he would escort her inside the Wynn Hotel to protect her from the crowd ""and also asked to go somewhere private and out of the public's eye until the investigation was over."" Flynn wrote that he took Hilton inside, and hotel staffers directed them to the security holding room, which was private and had a nearby restroom. The officer had Hilton place her purse on the table while the two awaited a female officer to accompany her to the restroom. ""While we were waiting for the female officer to arrive, Hilton said she needed to put some lip balm on, and I handed her the purse from the table,"" the report said. As she opened it, a bundle of what looked like cocaine in a plastic bag fell from the purse, and the lieutenant caught it. The officer put the bundle back insde the purse, waiting for other officers to witness it, he wrote. When other officers arrived, Flynn wrote that he opened the purse, removed the suspected bundle and read Hilton her Miranda rights. ""She told me the purse was not hers, and that she had borrowed it from a friend,"" the report said. However, Hilton did admit that a broken tablet of Albuterol, also found inside the purse, was hers and was prescribed to her, according to the report. Albuterol is commonly prescribed for diseases such as asthma. Hilton said several cosmetics inside the purse were not hers, but that $1,300 cash and credit cards in the purse were hers, the report said. She also said a package of Zig Zag papers, ""which are commonly used to roll and smoke marijuana,"" according to the report, were hers. ""I asked Hilton whose cocaine it was, and she said she had not seen it but now thought it was gum,"" according to the arrest report. Authorities placed her under arrest and transported her to the Clark County Detention Center, the report said. The substance was tested and confirmed to be 0.8 grams of cocaine. Hilton was released from jail Saturday morning after authorities determined she was not a flight risk, Lt. Wayne Holman told CNN. ""This matter will be dealt with in the courts, not in the media, and I encourage people not to rush to judgment until all of the facts have been dealt with in a court of law,"" Hilton's attorney, David Chesnoff, said in a statement Saturday. Last month, Hilton was briefly detained in South Africa for allegedly smoking marijuana at the World Cup. Her publicist called the July 2 incident ""a complete misunderstanding,"" and the case was dropped. In Session's Carol Gantt contributed to this report.","Cocaine fell out of Hilton's purse as she was looking for lip balm, police say .

"(CNN)  -- Four years ago, Nintendo's gesture-tracking Wii system proved the power of motion controls to extend the mainstream appeal of video games. Now Microsoft and Sony are readying their own motion-sensing solutions. But will these user interfaces be novel enough to move gaming fans en masse? Launching September 17, ($99.99 starter bundle) the wand-like PlayStation Move claims to offer greater precision than the Wii remote when translating gamers' physical movements into on-screen actions. Debuting November 4, Microsoft's Kinect system ($149.99 starter bundle), employs a 3-D camera that makes your body the controller and eliminates the need for handheld hardware. Each aims to broaden the appeal of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, respectively. But despite their high price tags (roughly $300-$400 total, including accessories), both are betting their chips on their appeal to casual gamers. Initial software offerings clearly reflect this sentiment, with a range of virtual pets, mini-game collections and sports-themed games. It seems a strange fit, because their steep costs are likely to limit early sales largely to current system owners -- most of whom are die-hard gamers. Sony hopes to bridge the gap by supporting traditional games, ranging from military shooter ""SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy Seals"" to colorful platform-hopper ""LittleBigPlanet 2."" For now, Microsoft is mostly leaving third-party publishers such as Sega and UbiSoft to fight this battle instead. On the bright side, both Move and Kinect deliver on user friendliness and accessibility in hands-on tests. But neither seems to offer any must-have titles or even anything that expands greatly on previously explored Wii game concepts, making it difficult to justify the upgrade. Early game offerings hint at the hardware's grand possibilities. But with few reasons for shoppers to buy, beyond first-adopter bragging rights, there's also little incentive for software makers to raise the bar. Developers need time to gauge these units' capabilities and come to grips with the vast differences between developing for 2-D and 3-D playing fields. As a result, we'll likely see games which offer only passing glimpses of these gizmos' potential for the next several months. One also has to wonder why sales of the Wii and supporting game software are finally slowing. Is consumer interest in motion-controlled gaming cooling? Is the novelty of gesture-tracking fading as developers struggle to invent novel applications? Or does everyone who wants a Wii already own one? Some observers even question whether exhausting yourself flailing around with so-called ""active"" games is really preferable to issuing commands by pressing buttons -- as evidenced by the thousands of Wii Balance Boards gathering dust in people's closets. Of this fall's two big new offerings, it's Kinect that appears to offer the most potential -- but, curiously, not for its gaming features. Microsoft's system also supports living-room videoconferencing and lets you browse menus and multimedia with spoken commands or a wave of the hand, which seems like a natural way to make everyday electronics more accessible to people. So it's too early in the game to predict how either Move or Kinect will fare. But there's still reason to be thankful for both. By delaying the release of new PlayStation or Xbox consoles, they're sparing us the cost and headaches of replacing our current hardware.","Microsoft and Sony are releasing motion-sensing gaming systems this fall .

"(CNN) -- The State Department told U.S. government employees in Monterrey, Mexico, on Friday to send their children elsewhere because of heightened security risks related to drug violence. The order is the first of its kind in any Mexican city, said Brian Quigley, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate General in Monterrey, adding it reflects an increasingly violent and insecure reality. Monterrey is located in northern Mexico. The travel warning was issued after an August 20 shooting in front of the American Foundation School in Monterrey, said the State Department. The high incidence of area kidnappings was also cited as a motive behind the move. ""U.S. government personnel from the Consulate General in Monterrey have been advised that the immediate, practical and reliable way to reduce the security risks for children of U.S. government personnel is to remove them from the city,"" the State Department said in a statement. The new rule will take effect on September 10 and affect roughly 25 families, Quigley said. In a separate message, also issued on Friday, the U.S. consulate in Monterrey said adequate safeguards simply do not exist to protect the children of U.S. employees. ""Local police and private patrols do not have the capacity to deter criminal elements from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel assigned to the consulate,"" read the statement from Monterrey. The authorized departure of family members of U.S. government personnel from consulates in the Mexican cities of Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros remains in place, the State Department said.

"(CNN) -- Three Iranian prison officials have been charged with murder after three imprisoned protesters were beaten to death in the aftermath of the country's disputed presidential election, Iranian media reported Saturday. Iran's military court announced that nearly two dozen officials from Tehran's Kahrizak prison were indicted; of those, there is enough evidence to prosecute 12, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. Three were charged with premeditated murder for participating in the beatings; nine will face other unspecified charges. The judiciary did not identify the defendants. Kahrizak officials initially said that Mohsen Rouhol-Amini, Amir Javadifar, and Mohammad Kamrani died of meningitis, according to the judiciary. However, a coroner's reported indicated that the three were severely beaten behind bars by prison personnel, and died from their injuries. The judiciary also blamed the prison's medical shortcomings and sub-par conditions as factors in the men's deaths. Iranian media first reported the three protesters' deaths nearly two weeks after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, ordered the Kahrizak facility shut down amid reports of prisoner mistreatment. In the wake of the deaths, authorities fired and arrested Kahrizak's warden. The three protesters were among some 4,000 people arrested in connection with protests following the June 12 presidential election. Thousands of Iranians demonstrated against the official result of the vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The government said he won by a landslide, but his opponents accused officials of rigging the results. The opposition to the results and the mass arrests were a blow to Iran's Islamic leadership. Further tarnishing the image of the government's handling of the demonstrations was the identification of 72 protesters killed during the unrest, released by Iranian reformist Web site Norooz in September. Putting the prison officials on trial is an attempt by the government to build credibility and maintain public order, some scholars say. But, they argue, it's a political move that will likely fail. ""Ayatollah Khamenei will be the loser no matter what happens,"" said Ali Alfoneh, a research fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute who has researched the relationship between Iranian civilians and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. ""Does it make him more credible in the eyes of the government -- no, I don't think so."" He said the guards would likely be prosecuted in a ""show trial,"" noting that the Iranian government has orchestrated such trials in the past by giving in to public demands for accountability, but without holding high-ranking officials responsible for their roles in any wrongdoing. Another expert described the defendants as ""scapegoats."" ""Even if they are some lowly soldier or some lowly revolutionary guard who was doing this, it was obviously under the order of higher-ups,"" said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian studies at Stanford. Amid earlier reports of prisoner mistreatment at Kahrizak, Khamenei ordered the facility shut down. Nearly two weeks later, Iranian media reported the deaths of the protesters. In the wake of the deaths, authorities fired and arrested Kahrizak's warden. When Gen. Esmaeel Ahmadi Moghadam, commander of Iran's security forces, announced the arrest of the warden, he also said no one died at Kahrizak from physical abuse and that the inmates died from illnesses. The coroner later disputed that claim. Despite earlier attempts by high-ranking Iranian officials to dispute allegations of abuse of detained protesters, government officials have also promised to investigate the supposed cases. Such a dichotomy reflects Khamenei's desire to be both ""feared and loved,"" Alfoneh said. ""The supreme leader and the regime want to show they are powerful and can't be shaken,"" he said, ""and, on the other hand, they don't want to accept responsibility."" In August, Khamenei met with Rouhol-Amini's father, Abdol-Hossein Rouhol-Amini, vowing that ""the system has no intention to forgive or be courteous to any wrongdoers."" The bereaved father announced on Khamenei's Web site in September that he was satisfied with how the government was handling the case. But the trial will not help Khamenei's relationship with the public, Alfoneh said. ""Regardless of what the father says or does not say, the person responsible is Khamenei,"" Alfoneh said.

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge sentenced Rachel Wade, the 20-year-old woman convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight last year, to 27 years in prison Friday. While acknowledging mitigating factors -- primarily Wade's youth and lack of a criminal past -- the judge said her actions were not ""unaggravating."" ""The murder was no accident,"" Judge Joseph Bulone said. Wade went to trial in July, accused of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of 18-year-old Sarah Ludemann. The two women, only teenagers at the time, had fought for months via voicemails, text messages and MySpace postings over their relationship with the same man, Joshua Camacho. The feud culminated in a fatal confrontation in the early morning hours of April 15, 2009. After a three-day trial and only two and a half hours of deliberation, a jury of five men and one woman convicted Wade of second-degree murder. Wade had claimed self-defense and hoped for an acquittal or no more than a manslaughter conviction. A life sentence was recommended by Florida prosecutors. The defense had recommended 15 years, followed by 15 years of probation. TruTV's ""In Session"" correspondent Beth Karas spoke to Wade days before her sentencing. ""I think about it every day, regardless if they give me five years or 20 years more than they could give me,"" Wade said.  ""I never meant to do it, and I'm still gonna have to live with it, no matter if I'm home or if I'm in prison."" Wade's lawyer told HLN Friday that the sentence was ""very fair."" ""I just don't think this was a case that called for life,"" said Jay Hebert. Hebert said the case is a cautionary tale about the potentially deadly mix of young people and modern communications technology. ""When you start looking at the tragic nature of this, the social networking, the instant messaging, the ability of people to hide behind the screen and make statements and create situations -- it just festered until it bubbled up and exploded into a situation... until two good girls, their worlds collided,"" he said. Hebert said Wade has resolved to teach young people about the dangers associated with social networking. ""I don't think we can appreciate how young people talk,"" he said. ""And that's the lesson for parents. Pay close attention to your children. Watch how they talk and who they talk to. Watch their social networking outlets."" ""Because it's an explosive situation when when you don't have to be accountable, when you can break up with somebody or ask somebody to prom via text,"" he said. ""There's no face-to-face interaction."" In Session Correspondent Beth Karas contributed to this report.","NEW: Defendant Rachel Wade's lawyer says sentence is ""very fair""

"(CNN)  -- Chris Keith was 12 years old when he learned his family didn't die in a car wreck. His father suffocated his mother and then shot Chris' 8-year-old brother, Mikey, in the back of the head while he slept, his grandparents explained. The elderly couple had taken the boy to a counselor. As they told him the real story of what happened, they pulled out newspaper clippings from October 1985. Chris had begun to wonder about the scars on his own head, and he had pieced together other clues from the past. Yet he'd never known the full truth. His grandparents then told him the hardest news of all. Before his father killed himself, he put the .38-caliber handgun to Chris' head and pulled the trigger. Medics had declared everyone in the house dead, including Chris. Now 30, Chris Keith visits church youth groups and juvenile justice centers to tell his story. A Christian, he believes God had a plan for him and that's why he survived. Follow CNN's Belief Blog . Headlines occasionally bring back terrible memories, like the recent case in South Carolina where a mother is  accused of suffocating her two boys before putting them in their car seats and letting the car roll into a river. When he hears stories like that, especially when a child survives, he bows his head and prays. At 12, Chris grappled with the impossible: How could my father do something so evil? ""It was almost like going through it again. I started feeling all these feelings again, of anger, of betrayal, of feeling like nobody wanted me. I was angry at the world, and mad at my grandparents for waiting so long to tell me. ""I was mad at my dad. Mad at my mom for taking him back so many times."" Memories flooded back. He recalled being in the hospital, staring at the door. ""I was waiting for my mother to walk through or for my brother to come in and say, 'Hey, everything's going to be OK.  We're going to get out of here soon.' "" Now, he tells struggling youth that they're not alone in this world. ""Even when we feel we have no inner strength left, you can make it,"" he says. After he was shot in the head, he crawled to his brother's bed and saw that his beloved brother was dead, he says, citing the coroner's report of the massacre. Bloodied with a hole in his head, Chris then crawled toward the doorway as if he was trying to find his mother. It was there that a medic saw him move, ever so slightly, after he'd already been pronounced dead. A video from the scene shows a first responder emerge from the front door. ""We've got one alive in here!"" ""I didn't want to give up,"" he says. ""I firmly believe Jesus had his hands on me, saying, 'Somebody is going to come for you.' "" He says he doesn't know why he survived, while his mother and brother died. He's struggled with that over the years: ""What if my brother survived and I didn't?"" Those are questions he'll never be able to answer. ""I just know that my life was saved,"" he says. ""Doctors don't know why I'm alive. ... I have a second chance in life, and I just want to make the most of it and maybe help others who are internally suffering."" Yet, it took years -- and lots of counseling -- to reach this point. He turned into a recluse in middle school and high school. Sometimes, he'd lay in bed all night, unable to sleep, ""just thinking."" He was the kid who just wanted to get through to the next day. ""It's crazy to think about -- those incidents were something that my dad did,"" he says. ""My own dad tried to kill me, so who am I supposed to trust?"" Sometimes he struggled with guilt -- feeling it somehow was his fault. ""I was always searching for things that I could have done."" Once, somebody asked him: Are you afraid you're going to go crazy like your dad? ""It just hit me really hard, and I don't want to be like that."" He carried a newspaper clipping about the killings in his wallet. At 14, he showed it to his youth minister. Tears rolled down the preacher's face as he read. ""It was amazing to me because I had never seen a man cry before,"" he says. ""It made me realize somebody cared about me."" Chris' best friend walked in at that moment. Handed the article, he too began crying. Chris credits his youth minister and his best friend, as well as his grandparents and his church, with helping him get through. In them, he could see that ""not everybody is as selfish as my dad was. And that helped me cope."" When he would lock himself in his room, he'd often listen to music. The lyrics of one song resonated: ""Do not let the world get you down and remember that a bright shiny day comes after the rain. It is going to get better."" ""I just clung to that,"" he says. He married young -- at 19. ""I was longing for a family. That's just something I wanted."" He and his wife celebrated their 10th anniversary this year. If you need proof that good can come from evil, he says, all you have to do is look at his own son, 6-year-old Dylan. He says he constantly tells his boy ""I love you"" and holds him tight. When he sees his boy playing, he sometimes thinks, ""Man, how could my dad do that?"" Chris now works with Upward Bound Outreach ministries as well as working at a long-term care pharmacy in Fort Worth, Texas. He's working on getting a degree in computer engineering and maintains his own blog. He's got many goals in life. At the top of the list: ""To not end up like my dad.""

"(CNN) -- Officials declared a state of emergency Saturday after a powerful predawn earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand, sending people into the streets as windows exploded, water mains broke and buildings crumbled. No deaths were immediately reported. The Christchurch City Council declared a state of emergency in response to what it called ""significant damage,"" just hours after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rattled residents. The order allows authorities to force evacuations and prohibit entry into areas believed unsafe. Officials in Selwyn, a rural district near where the quake hit, also declared a state of local emergency. A curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. was in place, and the army was assisting local police to ensure there is no looting. Roughly 100 people were being treated for minor bumps and cuts after the strong quake, hospital officials said. Two people suffered more serious injuries. ""The house felt like it was on wheels, like it was rolling around on marbles,"" resident Hadlee Wright told CNN's Rick Sanchez. Pictures that Wright took of the city before daybreak showed collapsed buildings and streets littered with bits of brick and rock. The facade of one structure was almost entirely torn off. Power was out in the northwest part of the city, while water and sewage services have been affected in several regions, the Christchurch Civil Defense Group said in a statement. Roads also were damaged. Images taken by Jimmy Le Comte, and sent to CNN's iReport, showed flooding in New Brighton, a Christchurch suburb. In one, a giant crack cuts across a road. The quake had a magnitude of 7.0, down from an initial assessment of 7.4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck about 35 miles from Christchurch, a city with a population of some 386,000 people on the east coast of South Island. An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.7 struck not far from the epicenter about 20 minutes later, the survey said. A man in his 50s was hit by a falling chimney, while another suffered serious injuries after being cut by glass, said Michele Hider, a spokeswoman with Christchurch Hospital. Sebastian Koga, a hospital neurosurgeon, said roughly 100 people were being treated for minor injuries. He was not aware of any deaths. ""We've had a flood of lacerations and minor head injuries, but nothing that could not be handled,"" Koga said. Civil Defense Minister John Carter said the country's prime minister is headed to Christchurch to assess the earthquake damage. ""We don't know entirely what level of issues we're dealing with at the moment. We're still getting reports on it, but it has been extensive,"" Carter told CNN affiliate TVNZ. ""We were lucky that the impact on the people from a death point of view has not been what it could have been under normal circumstances."" The earthquake struck at 4:35 a.m. Saturday (12:35 p.m. ET Friday), when few people would have been out and about. Police said there was some initial looting activity, but that it was quickly brought under control. A man who was at the international airport in Christchurch described the scene. ""The entire terminal started shaking,"" he said. ""I knew it was an earthquake. There was not much you could do at that point."" Authorities evacuated the airport, he said, adding that he saw minor damage. Reinier Eulink, general manager of the Holiday Inn in Christchurch, said there is damage around the hotel corridors and ""big cracks in the walls."" ""It was a big big long jolt, and the building moved a lot,"" he said. The 13-floor building, with about 150 rooms, was about 40 percent occupied, and he estimated that 80 or more people were staying at the hotel at the time. Power was knocked out, but emergency power came on, Eulink added. People were milling around in the hotel lobby, trying to get warm during the chilly Southern Hemisphere winter. The quake was 7.5 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the event is not likely to generate a tsunami. Prime Minister John Key told CNN affiliate TVNZ it would likely be some time before the full cost of the quake could be calculated. He sought to reassure residents. ""We're not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on its own,"" said Key.

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Indian police fired on pro-independence protesters in Indian-administered Kashmir Monday, killing four people and wounding 16 others, a senior police officer said. The deaths bring to 69 the number of people killed in 87 days of violence, as demonstrators stage large protests and block highways in marches calling for independence for the region. Hundreds of others have been wounded. Monday's violence came in Palhallan, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Srinagar,when protesters blocked a highway. Police fired to disperse the crowd after some demonstrators began throwing stones, some of them targeting a motorcade carrying the Kashmir zone police chief. Guards accompanying the motorcade chased members of the mob, injuring some in the process, a police spokesman said. The police administration has initiated an inquiry into the shooting, the spokesman said. ""The ammunition of the policemen is being checked to (determine) responsibility. Those found to be involved shall be proceeded against strictly according to the law,"" the spokesman said. Thousands of people shouting anti-Indian slogans later blocked the highway. The Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen some of the worst unrest ever against Indian rule since June 11, when a teenager was killed in Srinagar by a tear gas shell. New Delhi's efforts to break the cycle of violence have not yet shown any results. Kashmiri separatists have put forth five demands for ending the unrest and starting a dialogue with New Delhi. They include the acceptance of Kashmir as an international dispute by New Delhi, which views it as a domestic problem. They also want the release of detainees and the withdrawal of security forces from civilian areas of Kashmir. The separatists warned that if the demands were not met by the Muslim holiday of Eid, which falls later this week, they will intensify the agitation. Kashmir has been a source of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan. The region is claimed by both, and each rules part of it. Indian-administered Kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence for the past 20 years, leaving -- according to the official count -- 43,000 people dead. However, many human rights groups and non-governmental organizations say the figure is twice the official estimate.","4 killed in latest Kashmir violence .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigating drinking water contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, found benzene and methane in wells and in groundwater, agency officials said. At a community meeting with well owners, EPA officials revealed Tuesday they found low levels of petroleum compounds in 17 of 19 drinking water wells sampled, and that nearby shallow groundwater was contaminated with high levels of petroleum compounds such as benzene, according to the report. The affected well owners were advised not to drink the water at the recommendation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and told to use alternate sources of water for drinking and cooking, agency officials said. Meanwhile, the EPA is working with various government partners and EnCana, a natural gas company, to provide affected residents with water and to address potential sources of the contamination, agency officials said. The study included sampling 21 domestic wells within the area of concern, two municipal wells, plus sediment and water from a nearby creek. The EPA also sampled groundwater and soil from pit remediation sites, and produced water and condensate from five production wells operated by the primary natural gas operator in the area, agency officials said. No health concerns were found related to inhalation exposure to chemicals while showering or using evaporative coolers, agency officials said. The EPA has not reached any conclusions about the sources of chemical compounds found in drinking water wells, including hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground, agency officials said. Officials are uncertain if the contaminated shallow groundwater will migrate to the drinking water aquifer, according to the report. ""EPA will work as long as necessary to ensure that Pavillion residents have safe water,"" Jim Martin, EPA's regional administrator in Denver, said in a statement released Tuesday. ""While our investigation continues, EPA has secured commitments from our partners to identify alternate sources of water for affected homes and to evaluate long-term solutions."" In addition to detecting several petroleum hydrocarbons, the EPA found a number of ""inorganic constituents"" such as sodium and sulfates in drinking and groundwater wells, according to the report. In spring 2008, residents of Pavillion -- concerned about the quality of their drinking water -- contacted the EPA in Denver, Colorado. The agency sampled 39 individual wells (37 residential wells and two municipal wells) in March 2009 and found nitrate, arsenic and methane gas. The agency conducted the second sampling in January 2010. Over the past week, officials from EPA and the federal agency for toxic substances met privately with individual residents to provide health information and recommendations based on well-specific sampling results, agency officials said.","Residents of a Wyoming town became concerned about well water in 2008 .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI is monitoring the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning and has not ruled out getting involved through diplomatic channels, the Vatican said Sunday. As he has in the past in humanitarian cases, the pope would intervene if asked by authorities in another country and would do so through proper diplomatic channels, not publicly, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said in a statement. ""The Holy See is following the case with attention and participation,"" Lombardi said. ""The position of the church, which is opposed to the death penalty, is that stoning is a particularly brutal form."" According to Italy's official news agency ANSA, the Italian government is leading the case for clemency for the woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. Ashtiani was sentenced to death by stoning after she was convicted of adultery. Iranian judicial authorities say a final verdict in her case has not yet been made, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported recently. In July, Iran's judiciary said the case was under review. A large photo of Ashtiani has been hung outside Italy's Equal Opportunities Ministry to draw attention to her plight, ANSA reported. ""'This unprecedented act aims to mobilize opinion and contribute to saving Sakineh from a brutal, unacceptable sentence,'' Foreign Minister Franco Frattini and Equal Opportunities Minister Mara Carfagna said in a joint statement, according to ANSA. Italy's Foreign Ministry told ANSA that it is pursuing clemency for Ashtiani through diplomatic channels. ''The case is being followed closely by the foreign ministry and personally by Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, who has given instructions for close bilateral relations to be maintained with the Iranian authorities so that they consider clemency in this specific case,'' a recent ministry statement said. Italy is one of Iran's most important trade partners in the European Union, with bilateral trade exceeding $8 billion in 2009, according to a report on the website of the Iranian-Italian Chamber of Commerce. Meanwhile, Ashtiani also faces a sentence of 99 lashes because of a photograph in a newspaper, but opponents of the execution say it is a case of mistaken identity. Iranian authorities imposed the sentence after they saw the photo of a woman without a head scarf in the newspaper, said the International Committee Against Stoning, a human rights group. In an apology, The Times of London, which ran the photo on its front page August 28, said the woman was wrongly identified as Ashtiani. The Times said the photo actually is of Susan Hejrat, a political activist living in Sweden. Iranian law requies all women, regardless of their faith, to wear garments that cover their hair and bodies. According to the Times, one of Ashtiani's former lawyers, Mohammed Mostafaei, gave the paper the photo. Mostafaei told CNN on Saturday that he still thinks the photo may be of his former client. The Times reported that Mostafaei said Ashtiani's 22-year-old son had e-mailed the lawyer two photographs three months ago and told him both were of his mother. ""One was the widely used picture of Ms. Ashtiani with her face obscured by a chador [cloak], and the other was the one used by The Times ... That showed the full face of a woman,"" The Times said in a statement Friday. Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, wrote in an open letter that another lawyer sent the newspaper an authentic photo of his mother, but that it did not appear in the Times article. The letter was circulated by the International Committee Against Stoning on Friday. ""We do not know how that picture was originally obtained, nor to whom the picture belongs,"" Ghaderzadeh said in the letter. ""My mother has been called in to see the judge in charge of prison misdemeanors and he has sentenced our helpless mother to 99 lashes on false charges of spreading corruption and indecency by disseminating this picture of a woman presumed to be her [Sakineh] without hijab,"" he wrote. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran did not answer a CNN telephone call early Sunday morning. The Committee Against Stoning said Friday ""it is Mr. Mostafaei's responsibility to provide an explanation as to why he has disseminated [a] counterfeit photo and information regarding Sakineh's case; his action has only led to increased pressure on Sakineh and her family."" ""We strongly condemn this barbaric new sentence of 99 lashes imposed by the Islamic Republic against Sakineh and we demand that this sentence be abandoned immediately,"" the committee said. Mostafaei told CNN that Ghaderzadeh three months ago gave him two photos -- one of Ashtiani wearing a hijab (covering) and one without it. The lawyer said he immediately released the photo of Ashtiani wearing the chador and sent the Times the photo of her without the hijab more recently. Asked about whether the photo printed by the Times is of Ashtiani, Mostafaei said, ""In my opinion it is Ms. Ashtiani. It was given to me by her own son. If it is not indeed her, it looked just like her. She was wearing religious clothes in the photo. She had the same face, same everything."" Ashtiani, who is being held in Tabriz, Iran, no longer has visitation rights, the family told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Protesters gathered in Iran on Friday for a demonstration to observe an annual holiday that marks the country's solidarity with Palestinians and calls for the end of Israel occupation. One notable absence was Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi, whose security force feared for his safety and advised him to stay away, his son said. About 50 people surrounded Karrubi's home Friday morning -- shooting paint balls and shouting chants against him and the opposition movement, the son said. Attackers targeted his father's house repeatedly to stop him from participating in Friday's events, said Mohammad Taghi Karrubi. The opposition leader's website said his apartment had come under attack four times in four consecutive days. The site said the head of his security team was in a coma after being beaten as he tried to talk with a group of attackers who broke into the apartment complex Thursday. His son told CNN the attackers fired shots, set small fires in the courtyard and lobby and vandalized parts of the building. But around the country Friday, Quds Day demonstrations continued. Large crowds chanted ""Death to Israel"" and ""Death to America"" in Palestine Square near Tehran University. In the city of Kerman, a man with a loudspeaker chanted the slogans, with the crowd repeating after him. Some were carrying Iranian flags and banners supporting Palestinians while others waved cartoon caricatures of U.S. President Barack Obama. Speaking at Tehran University, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denounced Israel, repeatedly referring to the ""Zionist regime."" He said this week's direct Middle East peace talks in Washington were doomed to fail. ""These talks are dead. There is no reason to hold talks,"" he said. ""The fate of Palestine will be determined on the ground in Palestine, not in Washington and not in London,"" he added. Ahmadinejad said Iranians sympathize with Palestinians. ""We know how hard it is for them to resist,"" he said. As he spoke, the crowd chanted, ""Death to Israel."" Security forces lined the streets near Haft-e-Tir Square in central Tehran, and at least two people were detained. There were no reports of opposition clashes. Last year, demonstrators took the streets in anti-government protests, shouting ""Death to the dictator"" in particularly tense rallies following the unrest over Iran's disputed presidential elections in June. Clashes between security forces and protesters were reported around the university during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech last year. On Thursday, Mohammad Taghi Karrubi told CNN that attackers had repeatedly come to his father's house because he had expressed his desire to take part in Friday's events. He said he was inside his father's fifth-floor apartment when about 20 Basij broke into the courtyard Thursday. Several of the men threatened to kill his father, he said. ""When we asked the police to come to help...nobody came,"" he said. Asked who was responsible, he said, ""They are in the name of the Basij, but in my opinion they are hooligans. The government tries to use these hooligans against the opposition and against the people."" Several members of his father's security team were injured -- but not shot -- and were taken to a hospital, he said. Asked if he and his father planned to attend Quds Day events on Friday, he said, ""Do you think we'll still be alive tomorrow morning to take part?"" International Quds Day, or ""Jerusalem day"" is observed on the last Friday of Ramadan. The government sponsored holiday was established in August 1979 by the late founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini shortly after the Islamic Revolution. Khomeini called for all Muslims worldwide to participate in the events that denounce Israel and show support for the Palestinian cause. ""The day for those nations suffering under the pressure of American oppression and oppression by other powers to confront the superpowers; it is the day when the oppressed should arm themselves against the oppressors,"" he said in a speech in August of 1979. Anti-Zionist demonstrations, parades, and seminars are held in some Muslim and Arab countries, but are especially large in Iran. A senior Iranian commander says the massive participation proves the global support for Palestinians. The Quds Day ""appears to pave the way for the collapse of Israel and its allies, namely the U.S. and Britain,"" Brig. Gen. Masoud Jazayeri, the deputy head of Iran's armed forces joint chiefs of staff, told the Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.","NEW: Son says attackers targeted his father's house repeatedly to stop him from participating .

"(CNN) -- John Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman, is up for parole for the sixth time, just months short of the 30th anniversary of the former Beatle's death. Chapman is scheduled to be interviewed by two members of the parole board during the week of August 9. Four letters were submitted against Chapman's release this year, according to a representative of the New York State Division of Parole, and there were two letters in support. The last time Chapman was up for parole, in 2008, the New York State Division of Parole issued a release saying Chapman's request was denied ""due to concern for the public safety and welfare."" He also was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. Chapman, 55, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison for the shooting death of Lennon outside Lennon's New York City apartment on December 8, 1980. He has served 29 years of his sentence at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility, where he is held in a building with other prisoners who are not considered to pose a threat to him, according to officials with the state Department of Correctional Services. He has his own prison cell but spends most of his day outside the cell working on housekeeping and in the library, the officials said. For the past 20 years he has been allowed conjugal visits with his wife, Gloria. The visits are part of a state program called ""family reunion"" that allows inmates to spend up to 44 hours at a time with family members in a special setting. Inmates must meet certain criteria to receive the privilege. Chapman has not had an infraction since 1994, said Erik Kriss, spokesman for the Department of Corrections. ""He goes about his business, doing his prison job and without any fanfare,"" Kriss said. Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. Attempts to reach Ono's legal representative and publicist for comment have been unsuccessful.","Mark David Chapman will be interviewed by parole board members in August .

"(CNN) -- A JetBlue flight attendant whose fame took off after his dramatic exit down an emergency chute is is no longer employed by the airline. JetBlue spokeswoman Jenny Dervin told CNN on Saturday that Steven Slater no longer works for the airline. She said that the separation occurred last week, but declined to elaborate how Slater and the company parted ways. Slater became a hero to some after an August incident when, authorities said, he grabbed some beer and triggered an inflatable emergency chute from a plane at a JFK Airport terminal in New York. As of Sunday, Slater had amassed more than 210,000 ""fans"" on a public Facebook page. The drama on the plane may have started before takeoff. ""A number of passengers were competing for overhead carry-on luggage areas,"" Howard Turman, Slater's attorney, has said. ""With great difficulty, they were shoving the bags around, attempting to get it in. Steven came over to assist and either the bag or the overhead (bin door) hit him in the head and at that point he suffered an injury."" Turman has also said a woman ""started cursing and -- based on the information -- slammed the overhead luggage bin on his head."" After various exchanges with the woman and a crew member, some passengers said, he grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and leaving. Turman has sharply denied a JetBlue passenger's assertion that the flight attendant instigated the confrontation. JetBlue removed Slater from duty following the incident and launched an internal investigation. Slater has pleaded not guilty to charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief -- both felonies -- and criminal trespass. If convicted, he could face a maximum of seven years in prison. Slater has a court appearance scheduled for Tuesday. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Steven Slater is no longer employed by JetBlue .

"London, England (CNN) -- Religious leaders in Britain on Friday hit back at claims by leading physicist Stephen Hawking that God had no role in the creation of the universe. In his new book ""The Grand Design,"" Britain's most famous scientist says that given the existence of gravity, ""the universe can and will create itself from nothing,"" according to an excerpt published in The Times of London. ""Spontaneous creation is the reason why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,"" he wrote. ""It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper [fuse] and set the universe going."" But the head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Rowan Williams, told the Times that ""physics on its own will not settle the question of why there is something rather than nothing."" He added: ""Belief in God is not about plugging a gap in explaining how one thing relates to another within the Universe. It is the belief that there is an intelligent, living agent on whose activity everything ultimately depends for its existence."" Williams' comments were supported by leaders from across the religious spectrum in Britain. Writing in the Times, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said: ""Science is about explanation. Religion is about interpretation ... The Bible simply isn't interested in how the Universe came into being."" The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, added: ""I would totally endorse what the Chief Rabbi said so eloquently about the relationship between religion and science."" Ibrahim Mogra, an imam and committee chairman at the Muslim Council of Britain, was also quoted by the Times as saying: ""If we look at the Universe and all that has been created, it indicates that somebody has been here to bring it into existence. That somebody is the almighty conqueror."" Hawking was also accused of ""missing the point"" by colleagues at the University of Cambridge in England. ""The 'god' that Stephen Hawking is trying to debunk is not the creator God of the Abrahamic faiths who really is the ultimate explanation for why there is something rather than nothing,"" said Denis Alexander, director of The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion. ""Hawking's god is a god-of-the-gaps used to plug present gaps in our scientific knowledge. ""Science provides us with a wonderful narrative as to how [existence] may happen, but theology addresses the meaning of the narrative,"" he added. Read why Hawking says God didn't create the universe . Fraser Watts, an Anglican priest and Cambridge expert in the history of science, said that it's not the existence of the universe that proves the existence of God. ""A creator God provides a reasonable and credible explanation of why there is a universe, and ... it is somewhat more likely that there is a God than that there is not. That view is not undermined by what Hawking has said."" Hawking's book -- as the title suggests -- is an attempt to answer ""the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,"" he wrote, quoting Douglas Adams' cult science fiction romp, ""The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Read CNN's Belief Blog . His answer is ""M-theory,"" which, he says, posits 11 space-time dimensions, ""vibrating strings, ... point particles, two-dimensional membranes, three-dimensional blobs and other objects that are more difficult to picture and occupy even more dimensions of space."" He doesn't explain much of that in the excerpt, which is the introduction to the book. But he says he understands the feeling of the great English scientist Isaac Newton that God did ""create"" and ""conserve"" order in the universe. It was the discovery of other solar systems outside our own in 1992 that undercut a key idea of Newton's -- that our world was so uniquely designed to be comfortable for human life that some divine creator must have been responsible. But, Hawking argues, if there are untold numbers of planets in the galaxy, it's less remarkable that there's one with conditions for human life. And, indeed, he argues, any form of intelligent life that evolves anywhere will automatically find that it lives somewhere suitable for it. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Hawking: ""Given existence of gravity the universe can and will create itself from nothing""

"(AOL Autos) -- Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars. Drivers of the dependable Camry know what's important in life, says expert. Our panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit. Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches. Toyota Prius: Green no matter its color . Brinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius . ""Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,"" said Brinley. ""Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations."" Bell adds, ""New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club."" ""Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,"" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: ""There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world."" We're just quoting here, folks. Chevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis . The Chevy Corvette ""seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X."" Bell adds: ""Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven."" Better car than its image suggests . Bell sees another side to the Corvette. ""It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,"" said Bell. ""It's an affordable giant-killer."" Markwalder adds, ""There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy."" Toyota Camry: A major transportation appliance . ""I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,"" said Bell. ""It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car."" Dodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car . The Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y. Auto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. ""All ages stop and stare at this car,"" said Bell. ""Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd."" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging. Ford F-150: Working man's truck . According to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: ""Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living."" Bell adds, ""We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine."" Mercedes-Benz R-Class: A marketing mystery . ""With 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles, we don't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an R-Class,"" said Brinley. ""The more expensive GL-Class and ML-Class SUVs each sold three times as many."" Markwalder states, ""The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality."" Bell quips, ""My experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three-pointed star (badge appeal) or the large discounts because the R-Class hasn't sold well."" The R-class, a ""tweener"" that is somewhat minivan, somewhat wagon and somewhat crossover, has few rivals. Only the Ford Flex and the new Toyota Venza seem to come close. Experts' first thoughts . Bell on Chrysler Sebring Convertible: ""I hope it's a rental."" Brinley adds, ""It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y."" Bell on the Honda Insight: ""They're members of the Prius Alternative Club for Honda lovers."" Markwalder on Smart ForTwo: ""Experimenters with a sense of humor who would rather sprint away from a light than hold up traffic.""","The model of car you drive may be telling people all about you .
Prius drivers: College educated, want to be part of the ""green club""
Corvette: An ""affordable giant-killer"" for men in midlife crisis .

"This is the second part of a two part series on the best used luxury cars. (AOL Autos)  -- Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. The Porsche 911 has several versions, but all have been annointed with the ""supercar"" appellation. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $30,000+ price range: . 2007 Acura MDX . The newer MDX is classified as a crossover SUV, but it's a deluxe version. It was all-new in '07, and was built on a proper platform -- as opposed to being adapated from the Accord passenger-car platform. It also came in three flavors: Base, Technology and Sport Packages, and all three were powered by a 3.7-liter 300-hp V6. The voice-activated navigation system is a nifty feature, as it comes with rearview camera and AcuraLink satellite communications with real-time traffic data. AOL Autos: Used Acura . 2007 BMW 328i sedan . The 328i is another sleek, finely-tuned and beautifully-designed driving machine, offering sporty performance and Euro-style luxury. It is widely considered to be the definitive ""sports sedan."" The '07 328i was propelled by a 3.0-liter 230-hp inline six-cylinder engine, which you can find mated to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Consumer Reports also recommended the 3-Series coupe and convertible that joined BMW's model line-up in '07.  AOL Autos: Used BMW . 2004 BMW M3 . The M3 is the top-of-the-line, high-performance-tuned version of the 3-series coupe. Performance power, therefore, is much higher than the other 3-Series editions. It came as a coupe or convertible, and churned out 333 horses. The M3 is often favorably compared to the Porsche 911 when it comes to quick acceleration, crisp braking and taking tough corners at brisk speeds without breaking a sweat. 2007 Infiniti FX35 . Well, the marketplace surely is not lacking for luxury crossovers. Here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of SUV-type spaciousness, pampering amenities, deft handling and burly engine muscle. For '07, the FX35 was a two-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti . 2006 & 2007 Infiniti M . Infiniti's M series is another winner, which seamlessly synergizes sleek styling, aggressive engine performance and a bevy of luxo-line amenities. It comes in both the M-35 and M-45. During the last used-model year, '07, the primary distinction between the two was that the M35 was powered by a V6 that kicked out 275 horses, while the M45 muscled up to a 325-hp V8. Luxury features included standard leather seats with heating and ventilation, and optional 10-way power adjustments for the driver's seat. Lexus . Just like in the $24,000-to-$30,000 category, Consumer Reports recommended a slew of world-beating used Lexus models in this segment: the '06-'07 6-cylinder GS RWD; the '07 GS450h Hybrid; '05-'07 GX; '07 IS; '04-'07 LS; '03-'06 LX and '06-'07 RX. AOL Autos: Used Lexus . Lexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until '07, when another carmaker, Buick, finally tied them for first. Porsche 911 (various years) Consumer Reports included the '98 911 in the $24,000 to $30,000 category. Here, the model years get more recent as the price range climbs. The 911 went through some changes over this time period, of course, but all have been anointed with the ""supercar"" appellation. AOL Autos: Used Porsche . And by the latest recommended used-model year, the '07, you could choose among various styles and engine sizes, including the Carrera, with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet, with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6; the 911 Turbo, with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine; and the GT3 track model, powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine.","Newer Acura MDX is classified as a crossover SUV, but it's a deluxe version .

"(CNN) -- Officials declared a state of emergency Saturday after a powerful predawn earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand, sending people into the streets as windows exploded, water mains broke and buildings crumbled. No deaths were immediately reported. The Christchurch City Council declared a state of emergency in response to what it called ""significant damage,"" just hours after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rattled residents. The order allows authorities to force evacuations and prohibit entry into areas believed unsafe. Officials in Selwyn, a rural district near where the quake hit, also declared a state of local emergency. A curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. was in place, and the army was assisting local police to ensure there is no looting. Roughly 100 people were being treated for minor bumps and cuts after the strong quake, hospital officials said. Two people suffered more serious injuries. ""The house felt like it was on wheels, like it was rolling around on marbles,"" resident Hadlee Wright told CNN's Rick Sanchez. Pictures that Wright took of the city before daybreak showed collapsed buildings and streets littered with bits of brick and rock. The facade of one structure was almost entirely torn off. Power was out in the northwest part of the city, while water and sewage services have been affected in several regions, the Christchurch Civil Defense Group said in a statement. Roads were also damaged. Images taken by Jimmy Le Comte, and sent to CNN's iReport, showed flooding in New Brighton, a Christchurch suburb. In one, a giant crack cuts across a road. The quake had a magnitude of 7.0, down from an initial assessment of 7.4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck about 35 miles from Christchurch, a city with a population of some 386,000 people on the east coast of South Island. An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.7 struck not far from the epicenter about 20 minutes later, the survey said. A man in his 50s was hit by a falling chimney, while another suffered serious injuries after being cut by glass, said Michele Hider, a spokeswoman with Christchurch Hospital. Sebastian Koga, a hospital neurosurgeon, said roughly 100 people were being treated for minor injuries. He was not aware of any deaths. ""We've had a flood of lacerations and minor head injuries, but nothing that could not be handled,"" Koga said. Civil Defense Minister John Carter said the country's prime minister is headed to Christchurch to assess the earthquake damage. ""We don't know entirely what level of issues we're dealing with at the moment. We're still getting reports on it, but it has been extensive,"" Carter told CNN affiliate TVNZ. ""We were lucky that the impact on the people from a death point of view has not been what it could have been under normal circumstances."" The earthquake struck at 4:35 a.m. Saturday (12:35 p.m. ET Friday), when few people would have been out and about. Police said there was some initial looting activity, but that it was quickly brought under control. A man who was at the international airport in Christchurch described the scene. ""The entire terminal started shaking,"" he said. ""I knew it was an earthquake. There was not much you could do at that point."" Authorities evacuated the airport, he said, adding that he saw minor damage. Reinier Eulink, general manager of the Holiday Inn in Christchurch, said there is damage around the hotel corridors and ""big cracks in the walls."" ""It was a big big long jolt, and the building moved a lot,"" he said. The 13-floor building, with about 150 rooms, was about 40 percent occupied, and he estimated that 80 or more people were staying at the hotel at the time. Power was knocked out, but emergency power came on, Eulink added. People were milling around in the hotel lobby, trying to get warm during the chilly Southern Hemisphere winter. The quake was 7.5 miles deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the event is not likely to generate a tsunami. Prime Minister John Key told CNN affiliate TVNZ it would likely be some time before the full cost of the quake could be calculated. He sought to reassure residents. ""We're not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on its own,"" said Key. CNN's Nick Valencia, Mark Bixler, Joe Sterling and Katy Byron contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime minister says government will not abandon Christchurch .

"(CNN) -- Since World War II, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have consistently held the United States out as a worldwide model for the protection and promotion of human rights standards. The U.S. government has also consistently acknowledged the importance of all countries upholding and protecting universal human rights. Indeed, on the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, President Reagan famously described the declaration as ""a global testament of humanity, a standard by which any humble person on Earth can stand in judgment of any government on Earth."" In recent years, one of the ways the United States has sought to portray itself as a human rights leader is by regularly reporting on its compliance with domestic human rights obligations. Former President George W. Bush's administration submitted three major reports on domestic human rights treaty compliance to various international bodies of experts charged with overseeing treaty conformity. Last month the Obama administration submitted a report to the U.N. Human Rights Council as part of its Universal Periodic Review  process, through which the human rights records of all the countries in the world will be reviewed and assessed based on the obligations and commitments expressed in the universal declaration and other human rights instruments. The goal of the periodic review, and of human rights reporting in general, is to boost human rights compliance all over the world with powerful nations leading by example. On August 27, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer sought to make political hay out of the U.S. report's mere mention of SB 1070, the infamous Arizona law that has drawn worldwide criticism for its potential to institutionalize racial profiling in Arizona. The U.S. government's reference to SB 1070 in the periodic review report, which made no comment on the merits of the law, was brief; it merely laid out some simple facts: The law generated significant attention around the world (true); the law is being addressed in a court action (true); parts of the law are currently enjoined (true). Still, Brewer sent a letter to the State Department expressing ""concern and indignation"" that the report included a reference to SB 1070 at all. Brewer's bizarre statement that this country's participation in a human rights reporting process is ""internationalism run amok"" and ""unconstitutional"" ignores the fact that human rights reporting requires countries to report on issues at the federal, state and local levels. When the Bush administration reported on U.S. compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a treaty that the United States has signed and ratified, the report included mentions of issues in states and in cities, in addition to national issues. In fact, human rights activists argued (correctly) that the Bush administration's report insufficiently included information from states and cities. In response, the State Department under the leadership of both the Bush and Obama administrations has (appropriately) committed that the United States will improve its reporting on both state and local issues. Most international human rights treaties require regular reporting to encourage compliance by nations who are parties to these conventions. The ""Supremacy Clause"" of the U.S. Constitution describes ratified treaties as ""the supreme law of the land,"" so there is nothing unconstitutional about the U.S. government complying with ratified treaties or reporting on compliance of ratified treaties; in fact, one could very easily argue that reporting on treaty compliance is entirely consistent with the ""intent of the framers"" of the Constitution. Further, Brewer's suggestion that the human rights record of the United States (and Arizona by inclusion) be weighed against those of other nations participating in the periodic review process (such as Libya) is absurd, and her claim that the United States would ""win in any such comparison"" rings hollow. The periodic review was established by the United Nations General Assembly as a process through which the human rights records of all the United Nations' 192 member states would be reviewed and assessed, so to single out Libya, or any other country, and compare it to the United States is meaningless at worst and harmful at best. The United States is the most powerful country in the world and it seeks to portray itself as a human rights leader. As a leader, it is incumbent upon the United States to evaluate its own laws and make sure they meet the human rights standards set for the rest of the world. As such, it makes sense for the United States to participate in the periodic review process, and to include SB 1070 in its review, because not participating in the process and not mentioning an extremely controversial issue in the review would make the United States appear to the rest of the world as though it had something to hide. What the U.S. report does not say, and what Brewer should be concerned about, is the fact that SB 1070 violates U.S. human rights obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which is binding on all levels of federal, state and local governments. The convention obligates federal, state and local governments to guarantee that laws and policies do not discriminate, in purpose or effect, on the grounds of race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin. It also guarantees to all noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, equal protection and equality before the law and prevents federal, state and local governments from employing or carrying out racial or ethnic discrimination against individuals or communities. Racial profiling remains a pervasive problem all over the country and it is pretty difficult to argue that SB 1070 will not have a disparate negative effect on communities of color, particularly Latino communities. SB 1070 would require police to demand ""papers"" from all people that the police stop and suspect are not legally authorized to be in the US. Because, there is no clear bright-line identifier for who is legally authorized to be in the US, people who may be perceived to be ""foreign"" by police will be the subject of arrest, investigation or harassment simply because of who they are/what they look like, as opposed to because of any verifiable evidence of criminal activity. This will obviously have a disproportionately discriminatory impact on communities of color and immigrant communities, and that discriminatory impact violates ICERD. In a state like Arizona, with a well documented history of racial profiling, there is even more cause for concern. Enforcement of controversial provisions of the Arizona law has been stopped by a federal judge while the merits of the case are being debated. The United States government should not back down from its participation in human rights reporting. And it should go even further to create a concrete program of action to make sure state governments are aware of their legal obligations to protect and promote human rights. Brewer should acquaint herself with the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the U.S. Constitution, and commit to upholding human rights ""close to home."" That would be real leadership and real courage and would help steer Arizona (and our country) toward the fundamental values of fairness and equality.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Teodoro ""El Teo"" Garcia Simental, one of Mexico's most wanted drug traffickers, was arrested Tuesday, Mexican and U.S. authorities said. The capture of the high-level drug trafficker comes on the heels of successful military operations against another cartel last month. Mexican federal police, assisted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, made the arrest in the city of La Paz, Mexico, the capital of the state of Baja California Sur, DEA spokesman Michael Sanders said. Garcia Simental was a top lieutenant of the Tijuana cartel until he defected to the rival Sinaloa cartel after a power struggle. ""He is one the most notorious drug lords and was on a list of the Top 24 drug traffickers in all of Mexico"" said another DEA official, who asked not to be identified because officials were still gathering preliminary information. Authorities presented Garcia Simental, together with another man captured in the raid, Diego Raymundo Gutierrez Gomez, to the media in Mexico City on Tuesday. Garcia Simental is accused of more than 300 murders, most of them since he split from the Tijuana-based Arellano-Felix organization in April 2008, Federal Police Section Chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno said. One of his jobs for the Arellano-Felix cartel was disposing of bodies, Pequeno said. Garcia Simental is accused of disposing of 300 body parts by dipping them in acid, Pequeno said. Once he split from the Arellano-Felix cartel, Garcia Simental continued to operate a drug trafficking organization in Tijuana with the help of rival cartels. The Sinaloa cartel and the Michoacan, Mexico-based La Familia cartel supplied Garcia Simental's group with drugs, which he would smuggle into the United States, Pequeno said. This splintering of the Tijuana cartel was a cause of much of the violence seen in the border city since 2008, he said. Tuesday's arrest was the result of more than five months of intelligence operations, Pequeno said. There was a reward of up to 30 million pesos (U.S. $2.4 million) for Garcia Simental's capture. CNN Justice Producer Terry Frieden in Washington contributed to this report.","Teodoro ""El Teo"" Garcia Simental one of Mexico's most wanted, it says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A handful of Republican senators have proposed a constitutional amendment to limit how long a person may serve in Congress. Currently, there are no term limits for federal lawmakers, but Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and several of his colleagues are advocating that service in the Senate be limited to 12 years, while lawmakers would only be allowed to serve six years in the House. ""Americans know real change in Washington will never happen until we end the era of permanent politicians,"" DeMint said in a statement released by his office. ""As long as members have the chance to spend their lives in Washington, their interests will always skew toward spending taxpayer dollars to buyoff special interests, covering over corruption in the bureaucracy, fundraising, relationship building among lobbyists, and trading favors for pork -- in short, amassing their own power."" Two-thirds of the House and Senate would need to approve the amendment -- a stumbling block that short-circuited the idea 14 years ago. The new proposal echoes the Citizen Legislature Act, part of the original Contract with America proposed by Republicans before they won control of Congress in 1994. That measure, which would have allowed both senators and members of the House to serve just 12 years, won a majority in the Republican-controlled House in 1995, but failed because it did not meet the constitutionally-required two-thirds threshold. ""There is no question there are big obstacles in the way,"" said Philip Blumel, president of U.S. Term Limits, a nonpartisan organization that advocates putting time restrictions in place. ""It is difficult to pass a constitutional amendment, however the goal is worthwhile and it is very important to the country. Also, if not now, when?"" This time around, proponents are not calling on lawmakers who believe in the idea to place a self-imposed term limit on themselves. ""If you are asking people to self-limit, what might happen -- and what did happen -- is that honorable politicians who made the pledge left office,"" while others did not, Blumel said. ""The answer to the term-limit supporter is not self-limiting. It is the body as a whole."" DeMint, who is currently serving his first six-year term in the Senate, echoed Blumel's rationale for dismissing self-imposed term limits. ""I want to be clear: demanding that reformers adopt self-imposed term limits is a recipe for self-defeat on this issue,"" DeMint said in Tuesday's statement. ""We lost the battle for term limits after the 1994 Republican Contract with America because we forced our best advocates for reform to go home, while the big-spending career politicians waited them out. We must have term limits for all or term limits will never succeed. Only when we apply the same rules to all will we be able to enact vital bipartisan reforms."" One of the original co-sponsors of the amendment is Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who is serving her third term in the Senate, but is expected to resign her seat to focus on a gubernatorial bid. A spokesman for Hutchison said it is easy to square the fact that the Texas Republican is advocating a cap of two terms, even though she is currently in the middle of her third term. ""Throughout her career she has fought for term limits and continues to do so, and that is why she is co-sponsoring this bill,"" said Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky. ""But until it is passed, it would do a disservice to Texas and the people of Texas to do away with the seniority she has gained, unless all the states and all of the senators hold themselves to the same standard."" The two other original co-sponsors of the amendment are Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas. Coburn, a first-term senator, is up for re-election to his second term in 2010, while Brownback is retiring next year after pledging to serve only two full terms in the Senate. As congressmen, both voted in favor of the GOP's Contract with America term limit proposal in 1995. Coburn, a longtime term-limits supporter, retired from the House in 2000 after serving three terms, based on that pledge.","There are no term limits for federal lawmakers .

Ferguson: Yes -- a friend of mine wrote a book about one. CNN: Why does Sheriff Carter's car always get destroyed and why doesn't he have a cool Subaru like Deputy Lupo and Fargo? Ferguson: Tell me about it. They discovered first season that they like hurting me, so whether it's a set of stairs I have to fall down or driving into a post, anything that has to do with me has to be destroyed. The Subaru ad placement people are on set and we were doing this big stunt and they dropped the tree at the wrong time and the tree slammed the Subaru, and the ad people said, ""That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?"" CNN: How do you feel about the rivalry between yourself and Dr. Grant for the affections of Allison? Ferguson: I was concerned that it was gonna be a really forced triangle, but they managed to make it an adult exchange where we could put it on the table and discuss it and I like it. CNN: You've also done some directing and camera work. Which do you prefer? Ferguson: Being the lead of the show is more difficult, it's harder on my body, it's more strenuous, it's harder on my mind but it's rewarding in a day to day manner, but what I love about being the director is you get to protect the story for longer, so you can take all these talents you know, all the people you work with and you get to make sure they get to do all they can do. I love them both. Directing is -- it's easier to act in something that you have questions about than it is to direct something. Directing is so much work for such a long period of time. CNN: We took a look at your IMDb.com page. Canada has a ""Duck, duck, goose"" competition and you're the reigning champion? Ferguson: That's a lie that somebody put on the IMDb website. CNN: You are a founding member of Detroit, Michigan's Second City improv comedy club. Do you still get the chance to do improv or does the show and movies take up your time now? Ferguson: I improvise on a regular basis on the show, so I get to do it in that format. As for stage stuff, I'm rusty compared to what I used to be, so I don't do it all that often, although Second City celebrated its 50th anniversary in December and I went back for that.","Subarus don't always have the best luck on the set of ""Eureka""

"(CNN) -- Paul the octopus -- who correctly predicted the outcome of eight World Cup matches in a row -- is officially retiring from the prediction business, said the aquarium in Germany where he lives. ""A host of offers from around the globe will be carefully vetted in the coming days to see if there are opportunities to spread Paul's fame even further, without involving the canny cephalod directly,"" Sea Life aquariums said in a statement. Oberhausen Sea Life Center in Germany, where Paul resides, is also considering establishing a school for octopods ""so that Paul has the opportunity to pass on some of his skills to younger cousins before his short but memorable life reaches its natural conclusion."" Said spokesman Mark Oakley, ""He has been a superstar and deserves a quiet retirement. Paul the octopus is arguably the most famous sea creature there has ever been."" Paul: The first millionaire octopus? Paul had a correct prediction for each of his eight tentacles, ultimately foreseeing that Spain would win Sunday's final against the Netherlands and that Germany would beat Uruguay in the playoffs. Before that, he correctly predicted the winners in all six of the German national team's matches. The two-year-old octopus, who was born in England, became a global celebrity during the soccer tournament. During each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag were lowered into his tank. Whichever box he chose conveyed the winning team. He drew cries of despair from assembled watchers before the semifinal round, when he lingered over the box for the German flag before opting for the Spanish flag instead. Spain won the match 1-0. Bitter German fans later threatened to turn him into sushi and Sea Life in Oberhausen received death-threat emails saying ""we want Paul for the pan,"" said entertainment supervisor Daniel Fey. But after Spain's triumph in Sunday's final, the country's Prime Minister Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero called for octopus bodyguards.","Paul the octopus will retire, the aquarium says .

"(CNN)  -- Alpine skiing superstar Bode Miller is swapping the piste for the tennis court as he attempts to qualify for the U.S. Open championship at Flushing Meadow later this year. Miller will be competing in the sectional qualifying tournament in Honolulu, Hawaii on Thursday with the winner advancing to the U.S. National qualifying tournament in August where spots at the hard court grand slam will be decided. Millar last made the sporting headlines as he finally won Olympic gold at the Vancouver Winter Games in February in the super-combined event. He ended with a full set of medals after a silver in the super-G and bronze in the downhill, at last fulfilling his promise in the biggest arena of all. But the 32-year-old is also a notable tennis player and was the 1996 Maine State singles champion while his family won a tennis camp in New Hampshire. He gets his chance because of a new policy by the U.S. tennis association (USTA) to give anyone over the age of 14 the opportunity to play their way to the main draw at Flushing Meadows through a new national playoffs system. Miller, a two-time World Cup overall champion, sees his foray into tennis as a new competitive outlet ahead of the start of the new skiing season later this year. He is widely regarded as the greatest American ski racer of all-time with a record 32 World Cup victories and five Olympic medals, capped by his Vancouver triumphs.","Bode Miller competes in sectional qualifying for U.S. Open tennis championships .

"(CNN) -- A small plane with four people aboard crashed Monday in a residential neighborhood of Las Vegas, Nevada, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said. The conditions of the four passengers were not immediately known. The single-engine Piper Cherokee was unable to gain altitude after taking off from Henderson Executive Airport, just south of Las Vegas, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told CNN. The pilot tried to return to the airport, but crashed on a street in a neighborhood about two miles northwest of Henderson, Gregor said. The plane hit a few cars upon crashing, according to Stacey Welling, a spokeswoman for Clark County. The crash occurred about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET). The plane is registered to a Louisiana resident, but the identities of those aboard were not released. Investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are expected to arrive at the scene later Monday, Gregor said.","Four people were aboard the plane; their conditions are unknown .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican Federal Police captured eight people involved in a daylight shootout that paralyzed three sections of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday afternoon, authorities say. Among those arrested were five cartel members with ties to the Sinaloa cartel who admitted to being involved in the kidnapping of a groom and three others at a wedding in Juarez on May 7, Municipal Police spokesman Jacinto Seguro told CNN. The four victims from the wedding were found dead in the back of a pickup truck days later. Some have speculated that the groom, a U.S. citizen whose family owns a transporting company in New Mexico, had ties to the Juarez cartel. When the bodies of the victims were found, they showed signs of torture. The victims also had pig faces drawn on their foreheads, a symbol used by the Sinaloa cartel to describe their rivals from the Juarez cartel. Federal police said the other three of the eight people detained had ties to the Aztecas, a local gang of drug dealers in Juarez that acts as the enforcing arm for the Juarez cartel in the city. With them was a man from El Paso, Texas, who had been kidnapped and held for 15 days, Seguro said. The sequestered man, 54, identified only by his alias ""El Pistolita"" had ties to a cartel, Seguro said. The eight men were captured Wednesday in two separate events that took place between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., Seguro said. Police identified the detained Sinaloa cartel hit men as Ricardo Esteban Rubalcaba Reyes, 24, alias ""El Guawis""; Jose Alfredo Monreal Escajeda, 37, alias ""El Primo""; Porfirio Rubio Valle, 48, alias ""El Pilo""; Jesus Emilio Gil Acosta, 40, alias ""El Milo""; and Cecilio Torres Adriano, 43, alias ""El Cilo."" Among the men detained with Aztecas/Juarez cartel connections were Tomas Antonio Duarte Amaya, 33, alias ""El Tony""; and Jesus Alfredo Lopez Cruz, 30, alias ""El Chuy,"" police said. A third member of the Juarez cartel, who was only identified by his first name ""Jesus,"" is 17. Mexican law prohibits the release of the identity of minors. Pictures from arrests showed an arsenal of weapons and ammunition seized during the captures. The three from the Juarez cartel were detained while riding in a stolen green Ford Windstar which they used in a separate attack on a residence in Juarez, police said. Mexican federal police are calling the captures the most significant arrests since they took over security from the Mexican military one month ago.","Eight people arrested in daylight shootout between suspects, Mexican federal police .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese scientists have produced clones of mice that have been dead and frozen for 16 years -- a feat that could lead researchers to one day resurrect long-extinct species, such as the mammoth. Dolly was cloned using cells from live animals. Now scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species. Until now, scientists have only been able to produce clones using cells from live animals. This is how researchers created Dolly the Sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult animal. Researchers had thought that frozen cells were unusable because ice crystals would have damaged the DNA. That belief would rule out the possibility of resurrecting extinct animals from their frozen remains. But the latest research -- published in the journal, Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences -- shows that scientists may have overcome the obstacle. Researchers at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, used cells from mice that had been frozen for 16 years at -20 Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit). They extracted the nucleus and injected it into eggs whose DNA had been removed. Several steps later, the scientists were able to clone the mice. ""This is the first time a mammal has been cloned from a sample stored at conditions reasonably close to what might be expected in permafrost,"" Teruhiko Wakayama, who led the study, said in a statement. ""(It) gives some hope for those who might seek to clone extinct species from frozen carcasses.""","Japanese scientists produce clones of mice dead and frozen for 16 years .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday was the first day of classes at the Portland, Oregon, school where Kyron Horman allegedly was last seen in early June. The new year at Skyline Elementary also brings additional security measures to protect the children and staff. In a letter to parents, Principal Ben Keefer said video cameras will be installed this weekend at Skyline. ""These cameras will show external views of the building as well as the main hallway,"" he wrote. Also, security procedures will be reviewed to ensure they are effective, he added. Tributes, messages, posters and cards that adorned a ""Wall of Hope"" for the missing 7-year-old boy were moved Tuesday from school property to a fence outside a nearby fire station, said the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. ""We're happy that the fire district can provide this service to the community,"" said Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue Communications Officer Brian Barker. ""Our hearts go out to Kyron's family and we all hope for a positive resolution to this case."" The criminal investigation into Kyron's disappearance has now entered its fourth month with no signs of the child. Police searches are ongoing as officials ask the public for tips and leads on his whereabouts. Kyron's stepmother, Terri Horman, who said she dropped him off at school on the morning of June 4, has been the subject of intense scrutiny for several months. In divorce filings, her ex-husband, Kaine Horman, said he believes that Terri Horman ""is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron."" Court documents also allege Terri Horman attempted to hire a man to kill her husband. Investigators are seeking anyone who may have seen a white pickup truck believed to have been driven by Terri Horman on the morning Kyron vanished. Thursday will mark Kyron's eighth birthday.

"(CNN) -- As Sen. John McCain prepares to promote free trade during a high-profile trip to Colombia and Mexico, a poll out Tuesday suggests the issue may be a political hurdle as the general election campaign heats up. Sen. John McCain's free trade stance could pose a problem in November, according to a new poll. According to the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 51 percent of Americans view foreign trade as a threat to the economy -- the first time in a CNN poll that a majority of Americans report holding negative views on free trade. That compares with only 35 percent of Americans who felt free trade posed a threat to the economy in 2000, and 48 percent who felt it was a threat in 2006. Now, only four in 10 Americans say free trade presents an opportunity for economic growth, a sentiment that clearly makes the issue a challenge for McCain, especially in the crucial Rust Belt states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last decade. ""It's possible that John McCain's decision to highlight his free trade position may wind up losing him some votes among Americans who feel threatened economically by competition from other countries,"" CNN polling director Keating Holland said. ""Recent polls in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have shown McCain well behind Barack Obama. Calling attention to his stand on an issue like trade may be a part of the problems he apparently faces in those Midwestern states."" The poll also shows that some of the key voting blocs McCain is courting are most against free trade.  Women, older Americans and lower-income voters report feeling the biggest threat from unfettered trade. Many of these voters were particularly receptive to Sen. Hillary Clinton in key states during the Democratic primary as she increasingly developed an anti-trade stance. The survey results come as McCain, who is a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, heads to Colombia and Mexico to promote the advantages off a free trade policy and economic cooperation. He made a similar trip to Canada earlier this month. Campaigning Monday through Pennsylvania -- one of the crucial political battleground states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee acknowledged many voters disagree with him on the issue. ""I understand it's very tough. But for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""And the most precious commodity I have with the American people is that they trust me."" In another challenge for McCain, the new CNN survey indicates Americans continue to rank the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president. Nearly six in 10 voters say the country's poor economic conditions will be extremely important -- ranking the economy as the No. 1 issue in this campaign out of 15 issues tested in the poll. That finding represents a clear change from the beginning of this year, when the war in Iraq and the economy were tied as the top campaign issues.  Now, the economy is eight points ahead of Iraq -- a fact that could pose a threat to McCain, who has admitted he is more comfortable discussing foreign policy issues than economic ones. Rising gas prices are also among voters' concerns, with nearly 50 percent saying the issue will play an important role in their vote for president. That number is just behind those that say the economy and Iraq are important, a clear sign that higher prices for gasoline are the primary reason for voters' economic worries, though not the only one. ""It also means that a significant number of voters are concerned about other economic woes, like the stock market or unemployment, rather than gas prices,"" Holland said. ""Unless there is a noticeable upturn in the country's economy between now and November, this election is likely to be dominated by economic concerns."" The poll, conducted June 26-29, surveyed 906 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","New CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll released Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Contradictory reports swirled around the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery, with one Iranian lawyer saying Monday that she had been whipped 99 times for another alleged offense but another casting doubt on it. A woman who was in prison with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani told lawyer Javid Houtan Kian that his client had been lashed over a newspaper photograph that, Iranian authorities thought, showed her without a headscarf. Iranian law requires all women to cover their hair, regardless of their religion. The Times of London ran the photo on its front page on August 28, identifying a woman in it as Ashtiani. It later apologized, saying it was not her. On Monday, the newspaper published an editorial calling the lashing an ""outrage."" ""Ms Ashtiani has been imprisoned in Tabriz for five years,"" The Times wrote. ""The prison authorities know exactly what she looks like and therefore must have known that the photograph printed in The Times on August 28 was not of her."" The newspaper also accused Iranian authorities of punishing her ""to make her suffer for an international campaign to save her that that exposed so much iniquity."" Kian was not able to speak to Ashtiani, and neither the courts nor the prison would confirm the whipping, but he believes the other woman, he said Monday. ""I know what she is saying is correct. If she is making this up, then how did she know that the reason for the flogging was over a photo released in a foreign newspaper?"" he asked. Ashtiani asked the woman, who was released from prison, to tell her son she had been whipped, Kian said from Iran on Monday. He declined to identify the woman who passed the information to Ashtiani's son, saying it would put her at risk of further harassment by the Iranian authorities. Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, corroborated Kian's report and said, ""I am very extremely worried at this point about my mother's life."" He expressed concern that Ashtiani's death sentence will be carried out after the end of Ramadan, which falls Friday. Another lawyer associated with Ashtiani said Monday that he doubted reports about her lashing sentence. Mohammed Mostafei said in Paris, France, Monday that ""there was no evidence of a sentence of lashings."" ""I spoke with an official in the judiciary in Iran. They said no punishment was carried out on her,"" he said later Monday. The Times says it got the picture from Mostafei. He said Monday that he sent the photo to the newspaper, ""but I did underline that this photo was not necessarily a photo of Sakineh; it was not confirmed."" Mostafei spoke at a press conference alongside French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who said France ""will do everything in its power to make this case known and support Sakineh."" ""Really this is a national case for us and the president said that France must defend Sakineh,"" Kouchner said. ""I'm making this a personal case and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to save her,"" he said. ""If it means going to Tehran, I will go to Tehran."" Kouchner later said that he is making it a personal case ""because I'm a moral person [and] because this is barbaric treatment."" Ashtiani was earlier sentenced to death by stoning after she was convicted of adultery. Iranian judicial authorities say a final verdict in her case has not yet been made, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported recently. In July, Iran's judiciary said the case was under review. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Becky Anderson contributed to this report.","NEW: The Times of London publishes a scathing editorial condemning Iranian authorities .

"(CNN) -- A blowout preventer that may hold important forensic evidence as to why it failed, triggering the world's largest accidental oil spill, has been brought to the surface of the Gulf and placed on a vessel, officials said Saturday night. The device ""was taken into custody by the U.S. Department of Justice as evidence in its ongoing investigation into the incident,"" BP said. The blowout preventer was lifted to the surface at 8:53 p.m. (9:53 p.m. ET). Adm. Thad Allen, the government's national incident commander, said the huge blowout preventer ""is considered evidentiary material."" The April 20 explosion killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig. A new blowout preventer was installed atop BP's plugged well late Friday. Crews had to flush out potential hydrates -- crystals that form in cold temperatures -- before the old blowout preventer was hauled about the Q4000 surface vessel. Joint investigation teams, engineers and the Department of Justice will pore over the recovered device. ""I'm very pleased to announce that with the new blowout preventer on [and] the cement that was previously put in ... this well does not constitute a threat to the Gulf of Mexico,"" Allen said earlier Saturday. He provided details on the installation of the new blowout preventer late Friday. ""This is an important milestone as we move toward completing the relief well and permanently killing the Macondo 252 well,"" he said. Once the new device is successfully tested, BP will drill the last remaining feet of a relief well to intercept the damaged well. Finally, the company will execute a ""bottom kill"" -- a measure that fills the well from the bottom with mud and cement. That is believed to be the only way to seal the well for good. ""Depending upon weather conditions, mid-September is the current estimate of the most likely date by which the relief well will intercept the MC252 well,"" BP said in a statement Friday, using the shorthand reference to the well's official designation, Mississippi Canyon Block 252.","NEW: The failed blowout preventer is brought to the surface .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain told supporters he will ""take nothing for granted"" after defeating former Rep. J.D. Hayworth in a bitterly fought Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Arizona Tuesday. ""I ... will fight with every ounce of strength and conviction I possess to make the case for my continued service in the Senate, and the policies and principles I will advocate and defend if I'm fortunate to be re-elected,"" McCain said in his victory speech Tuesday night. McCain -- seeking a fifth term as senator -- was ahead 58.8 percent to 29.8 percent, with 20 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press. The race between McCain -- the 2008 GOP presidential nominee  -- and conservative talk show host Hayworth started off nasty and didn't get any friendlier down the home stretch. Forced to spend $20 million in the campaign, McCain was driven to the right on some issues as Hayworth accused him of not being a true conservative. McCain is expected to easily beat any one of the four Democratic primary candidates in the solidly red state. In Florida -- one of four other states to hold primaries Tuesday -- millionaire political newcomer Rick Scott claimed victory over Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum in the Republican primary for governor. In a speech to supporters, Scott, who spent $50 million of his own fortune since joining the race in April, alluded to the divisive nature of his fight against McCollum, the party-establishment favorite and former Congressman. ""Some of you may have noticed this was a hard-fought race. We talked a lot about our differences, but tonight it's time to remember those things that bring us together -- to recall our core beliefs and recommit ourselves to fighting for our principles,"" Scott said. ""The Republican Party will come together, and the reason we will come together is our shared devotion to the values that make America great."" Scott was ahead of McCollum, 46.5 percent to 43.4 percent, with 96 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press. The winner will face a November general election against Alex Sink, Florida's chief financial officer, whom CNN projected will win the state's Democratic primary for governor. In a different race featuring a political veteran against a self-funded candidate with deep pockets, Rep. Kendrick Meek declared victory over billionaire Jeff Greene in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. Meek led Greene 57.3 percent to 31.2 percent, with 97 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press. Meek will take on Marco Rubio -- who won the Republican primary for Senate -- and Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned independent, in the general election. In an e-mail Tuesday night, Meek thanked supporters for lifting him past Greene, a billionaire real estate investor who was funding his own bid after making a fortune betting against the housing market. ""The pundits thought this seat could be bought. Our critics wrote us off. But together, you and I proved them wrong,"" Meek's message said. Meek used his victory speech minutes later to try and establish himself as the candidate for Democratic voters in November. He noted that he is ""running against two conservative candidates"" -- a clear swipe at Crist, who could siphon votes from Meek in November. ""I made the case, and I am the real Democrat in this race,"" Meek said. Crist, who avoided a primary battle with Rubio by announcing an independent candidacy, framed the three-way Senate race as a choice between him, the hard right and the hard left. ""If ... you want somebody who wants to fight the gridlock in Washington and put the people first instead of the party, [and] do what's right for Florida rather than what's right for Washington or right for just Republicans or Democrats, then you have an alternative,"" he told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday night. Rubio told his supporters that Crist and Meek would be the candidates for voters who already ""like the direction that America is headed."" ""If, on the other hand, you are unhappy with the direction that Washington is taking America ... then there is only one person running, there is only one campaign in Florida in 2010 that is offering to stand up to that agenda,"" Rubio said. Florida's Democratic primary for Senate and the Republican primary for governor were two races in which two deep-pocketed political novices came virtually out of nowhere this spring, but managed to transform a pair of primaries into two of the most outlandish contests of the 2010 cycle. Meek, a Democrat from Miami, Florida, had a clear path to his party's Senate nomination until April, when Greene decided to fund his own bid. Both campaigns quickly trained fire on one another, with Meek dubbing Greene a ""Meltdown Mogul."" Greene linked Meek to an indicted Miami real estate developer and questioned Meek's commitment to Israel, a weighty charge in a state with a large population of Jewish voters. Republicans also were grappling with a divisive primary in the governor's race between McCollum, a former Congressman backed by the state's party establishment, and Scott, a millionaire former health care executive. Scott spent $50 million of his personal fortune since joining the race in April, mostly by blanketing Florida's expensive television and radio airwaves with advertisements questioning McCollum's conservative bona fides. He eventually stumbled on the campaign trail as he faced questions about his management of two health care companies that went on to face legal problems. Arizona's GOP Senate race also was bitter, with Hayworth insisting that after running to the right in the primary, McCain would seek to build his legacy by cutting deals with President Obama and the Democrats if re-elected. Fights over immigration fueled the race, as Hayworth and Tea Party activists challenged McCain's previous efforts at reform, which called for tougher border security, but included a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented workers. But McCain defended Arizona's new immigration law, State Bill 1070, and went on a six-stop statewide tour with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, whose signing of the bill earned her wide praise from conservatives, and made her the symbol of opposition to amnesty. On Tuesday night, McCain told supporters he was convinced that Republicans will regain majorities in both the Senate and the House. ""And when we do, we will stop the out of control spending and tax increases and repeal and replace Obamacare,"" McCain said. ""We will keep families in their homes, we will create new jobs and we will allow our businesses to grow without Washington interference. We will secure our borders, defend our nation and bring our troops home from Afghanistan with honor and victory."" Other races: . -- Republican Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona easily won her party's gubernatorial nomination Tuesday night, according to a CNN projection. Brewer captured 87 percent of the vote in the GOP primary election, according to early unofficial vote returns from the AP. -- In Alaska, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, with one of the best-known political names in the state, is pitted against an unknown challenger. But attorney Joe Miller's campaign picked up the support of the Tea Party movement and the backing of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. In a last-minute robocall for Miller, Palin went after Murkowski saying, ""Lisa Murkowski has voted with the Democrats more than any Republican up for re-election this year. She waffled on the repeal of ObamaCare, co-sponsored cap and trade and voted for TARP."" But some think that endorsement of Miller is at least partly personal. Palin had tangled with Murkowski's father Frank and defeated him in the 2006 governor's race. The Tea Party made its support known again in the final hours, promoting the more than half-million dollars it put into Miller's campaign. -- Also in Alaska, voters decide on gubernatorial nominees. Gov. Sean Parnell, who replaced Palin when she resigned last year, faces two challengers in the GOP primary. Two Democrats are battling for their party's nomination. -- Longtime Republican Gov. Jim Douglas is retiring in Vermont, giving Democrats hope of competing for the seat. Five Democrats are running in what's considered a tight race. The winner will face GOP Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie. -- In Oklahoma, two U.S. House Republican nominations will be decided in a runoff. In the 2nd District, Republicans think they have a chance for a pickup this fall against conservative Democrat Dan Boren. And two Republicans are battling to likely replace Rep. Mary Fallin, who's running for governor. -- A 10-way Republican primary in the Arizona 3rd Congressional District race to replace retiring Rep. John Shadegg has attracted national attention because Ben Quayle, son of former Vice President Dan Quayle, is one of the candidates.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Walking through the downtown hotels hosting Dragon*Con, it's remarkable how many costumes on display are influenced by Japanese animation. Dynamic hairdos, gravity-defying clothes and exotic weapons are the hallmarks of the dedicated anime fans who proudly dress up as their favorite characters. Such detailed imagery was not always a part of anime, but in 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's movie ""Akira"" ushered in a wave of creativity that has inspired fans ever since. This supernatural tale of two troubled teenagers caught in the middle of a military coup impressed audiences around the world with its cinematic approach to chase scenes and explosions. ""When the theater version arrived in America, I forced my father to drive me two hours to Athens, Georgia, to see the screening -- which was in Japanese, with no subtitles. And I was blown away,"" said Joe Peacock, an author and passionate ""Akira"" fan. Peacock travels to fan conventions and animation companies such as Pixar to give lectures about the art and influence of ""Akira."" Peacock is at Dragon*Con in Atlanta this weekend to show off his collection of more than 12,000 original production cels, backgrounds and layouts from ""Akira."" Instead of dressing up like his favorite ""Akira"" characters, Peacock has tattooed scenes from the movie on his arms and leg. His devotion to ""Akira"" started with an unassuming, purple-hued background cel that opened his eyes to the level of art that is possible through anime. ""That piece is the lynchpin to this whole exhibit,"" said Peacock. ""When I found it, I didn't even realize it was part of 'Akira' at first because it was hidden behind all those layers of great art."" Peacock said that because of this one picture, he realized, ""there are pieces of that film that you never, ever clearly see that rival any of the foreground visuals."" Before ""Akira,"" anime seen in America was cheaply produced and relegated to Saturday morning cartoons, said Joe Wos, founder of Toonseum, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, museum and website devoted to the art of comics and animation. By offering mature art and story lines, ""['Akira'] saved anime,"" said Wos, who is collaborating with Peacock on the ""Art of Akira"" exhibit. ""When you see the film, your jaw drops. It's beautiful; it's an astounding feat. But you miss so much because there's fantastic art on top of fantastic art on top of fantastic art. When it's pulled apart and each layer is presented to you individually, you have a chance to fully appreciate the magnitude of the artistic effort that went into this. To look at one cel gives you an idea of how much work went into each and every cel. ""Akira"" is ""considered the pinnacle of animated art by a lot of aficionados,"" said David Kramer, co-founder of the Nichibei Anime Club. ""[The artists creating 'Akira'] actually hand-painted 160,000 cels to make the film. And a huge number of backgrounds, probably at least 10,000 backgrounds, I'm going to guess. The art was spectacular. It was a stunning film; it had a huge budget,"" he said. People visiting the exhibit tell Peacock and Wos that ""Akira"" has dramatically influenced their lives. ""For some of them, it introduced them to the fact that cartoons could be art, and then they began to pursue cartoons as an art form. For others, it really did speak to them on a different level, of these teen characters and the angst they were going through. And it spoke in a true voice. ""These weren't Disney teenagers who were waiting to be kissed by a prince. These were teenagers who were troublesome youth and needed an outlet to express themselves,"" said Wos. "" 'Akira' blew my head apart when I saw it. It quite literally changed my life,"" said Yuri Lowenthal, a voice actor best known for his work on the animated series ""Ben 10"" and on English versions of anime such as ""Afro Samurai."" ""I had never really seen anything like it, but after I did, you'd better believe I started looking for anything else like it I could find,"" he said. ""It was a game-changer for a lot of people, I think."" ""Akira"" made it possible for anime to thrive in the United States, said Kramer. Before ""Akira,"" anime ""was exclusive, there were no major distributors, so fans would hand down third- or fourth-generation VHS copies with blurry subtitles,"" he said. But as entertainment companies began lucrative distribution operations in the 1990s and 2000s, the anime fan base became as diverse as the genre itself. One especially popular practice now is cosplay, in which fans dress up as their favorite anime characters, taking great pains to get the costume details exactly right. ""I think right now cosplay is the most active segment of anime. Fans love to go to the anime conventions and meet up with people from all over the country,"" said Kramer. ""Many people from Japan also go to these conventions, and they love to dress up as their favorite characters.""","""Akira"" ushered in a new wave of sophisticated and diverse anime .

"(CNN) -- Detroit Mayor David Bing called Tuesday's 85 fires in the city a ""natural disaster"" and defended the fire department's response. ""I have ultimate confidence in the Detroit Fire Department,"" he said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. ""I think they've done an outstanding job."" Asked whether the department was adequately staffed or had enough equipment Tuesday, Bing said the important thing was that no one was hurt or killed. ""I don't care how much money you have. When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,"" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. ""It just created a firestorm where we had fires,"" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. ""I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has."" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. ""It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?"" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. ""A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,"" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. ""We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,"" Mack said. ""We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. ""It's a matter of public safety,"" Dumas said.  ""We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. ""I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,"" the mayor said. ""That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city. I think our community understands we are all in this together.""","He defends fire department response, staffing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Boston trolley operator killed in a crash last year likely had a sleep disorder and fell into a ""micro-sleep"" shortly before the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled Tuesday. Since last year's trolley crash in Boston, Massachusetts, there has been another incident on the same line. The safety board, completing a 14-month investigation, faulted operator Ter'rese Edmonds for ignoring a red signal along the tracks but directed harsh criticism at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which operates the train system. The transit authority failed to screen operators for sleep disorders while enforcing a work schedule that could prevent train operators from getting enough sleep, the NTSB said. The NTSB's conclusion that Edmonds fell asleep is partly conjecture, the board acknowledged. Edmonds, a part-time trolley operator, had an opportunity for adequate sleep the day of the wreck, although investigators were not able to determine her sleep history. In addition, Edmonds had been given a break earlier in the day, had not complained to co-workers about fatigue and was found to be free of drugs and alcohol. ""We cannot say for certain that she did have it (sleep apnea),"" board member Dr. Mitch Garber said. But the NTSB concluded there was a ""high likelihood"" that Edmonds had an undiagnosed sleep disorder, largely because she was obese and because tests showed she had taken doxylamine, an ingredient commonly found in sleep aids, suggesting she had trouble sleeping during at least one of the nights leading up to the accident. In addition, there is a lack of other evidence to explain why Edmonds failed to slow or stop the train, the board concluded. Tests showed that the stopped train could be seen at a distance of 764 feet, and that ""there were multiple opportunities to slow and stop this (advancing) train,"" NTSB investigator Wayne Workman said. ""There was not any evidence that brakes were applied."" Edmonds' westbound train was traveling at 38 mph when it struck the other train, which was traveling at 3 mph in the same direction. An estimated 185 to 200 passengers were on the two trains during the collision in the Boston, Massachusetts, suburb of Newton. Damage was estimated at $8.6 million. The board also noted that the MBTA had not installed systems on its Green Line to prevent two trains from occupying the same stretch of track, the NTSB said. The systems, known as ""positive train control"" systems, would have prevented the accident, the safety board said. One year after the fatal accident, more than 50 people were injured in another accident on the same line. The Boston accident highlights two issues that have risen to the top of the NTSB's concerns in recent years, positive train control and operator fatigue. The safety board says positive train control issues were involved in two other light rail incidents this year, a May 8 wreck on the same MBTA Green Line and a June 22 wreck which killed nine on Washington, D.C.'s Metro system. ""If technology exists... on the other (MBTA) lines, why would the Green Line not have everything possible... to prevent accidents from happening,"" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker asked. ""I don't understand that as an operator; I just don't."" The Metro system had a form of positive train separation, but investigators are exploring whether that crash resulted from a circuit malfunction. The safety board said fatigue issues affect all forms of transportation. It noted that two pilots fell asleep during a flight over Hawaii and that sleep issues played a role in a Cosco Busan ship incident in San Francisco, California, and a fatal bus crash in Mexican Hat, Utah. Rosenker said details that surfaced in the Boston trolley crash will guide the NTSB in the future. ""Now it is up to us, because we now are the advocates for these changes,"" Rosenker said. Recommendations resulting from the Boston crash ""raise the bar of safety not only in this system, but across the United States.""","Obesity, evidence that operator was taking sleep aid leads to conjecture .

"London, England (CNN) -- A South African has become so fat on her diet of marshmallows that she's been taken to England to lose weight. She's ""quite a character,"" her new caretakers say, but settling her into her new home has proven tricky -- she's an orangutan who has never seen another of her species before. Oshine, the animal, arrived at the Monkey World Ape Rescue Center in southern England last week, the center announced on Twitter. ""We have a new arrival, very large & orange!"" the center said September 1 -- but kept details close to its chest. A day later, it said she was settling in well. ""Our new orange lady has spent the day in the nursery playroom today, she's doing really well but we have a long way to go, she is obese! That's what a diet of marshmallows does, the center tweeted. Weighing in at 100 kilograms (220 pounds), Oshine is ""the largest orangutan in Britain today,"" the center said. She weighs about twice as much as she should, it added. She'd been kept as a pet in South Africa for 13 years, the center explained. Her owner first contacted Monkey World for help in 2008. The center has been working to bring Oshine to England since then, it said. ""The care that she received in South Africa was effectively misguided love,"" Monkey World Director Alison Cronin told CNN on Wednesday from the center in Wareham, England. She explained that Oshine's previous owners had kept her as a pet, which she said is never a good idea with primates because they can become aggressive as they enter adulthood. ""Oshine's care became a problem because she was effectively left on her own for long periods of time during the day when the family weren't there to entertain her, and so they simply tried to keep her busy and happy by feeding her a lot of junk food -- so a lot of candy, a lot of sweets, and processed food,"" Cronin said. ""Because she was basically inactive and not flying around through trees and things, she put on an awful lot of weight, and now we have our work cut out for us here at Monkey World to get that weight off of her and to get her fit so that she, too, can become a breeding female and have a family of her own one day."" Late last month, ""The Monkey World team went to Johannesburg, with a specially designed transport box, several days prior to the move"" so the orangutan could get used to being in the box. After two days of ""playing"" in the box, the door was shut for good and Oshine was on her way to a more natural life in England, the center said. Only on Wednesday did the center finally post pictures of Oshine, revealing her to have such an enormous belly it looks difficult for her to move. A second photo showed her in a cage being moved by forklift to her new home. The center is already itching to see progress, it admitted. ""It's very early days,"" its most recent tweet on Oshine says. ""I so wish I had a magic wand!"" Cronin said the orangutan would be put on a special diet and, with luck, would find a mate at the center. ""Now that she is at the park, we have her on a healthy diet of vegetables and fruits and she is getting a lot more exercise climbing through"" a section of the park designed for baby orangutans. ""It will take a few months for Oshine to reach a more appropriate weight and then she will be ready to meet a new man and consider a family of her own,"" she said. Orangutans have the slowest metabolism of any of the great apes, even humans, Cronin said, making it a challenge for Oshine to lose the weight -- but as long as she is ""getting all of the exercise and moving around as she should, the weight should start falling off naturally.""","Oshine came from South Africa to England to lose weight .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A brazen gunman wearing a porcelain doll mask robbed an Atlanta, Georgia, bank and made off with a stash of money, the FBI said. However, authorities said the bank robber waited a little too long to put on his mask. The FBI has clear pictures of him looking nervous as he enters the bank Tuesday morning before he donned the mask. The photos may be the key to catching him, according to authorities. ""Two very detailed photographs of the robber's face were taken by the bank's ATM machine just prior to the robber placing the mask over his face,"" the FBI said in a news release. The man entered the Chase Bank, put on the porcelain doll-type mask and jumped on the counter of the bank, brandishing a silver semi-automatic handgun, the FBI said. Close-up photos of the man taken before the robbery show his facial hair and prescription glasses. ""Sometimes, the investigators that work these bank robberies do get lucky in terms of the robbers doing something stupid, leaving something behind that is an incredible investigative lead,"" Steve Emmett, a spokesman for the Atlanta FBI office, told CNN affiliate WSB.

"(Rolling Stone) -- In its first season, ""Glee"" featured some weirdly eclectic song choices: Remember ""Thong Song"" and ""Sweet Caroline"" in the ""Mash-Up"" episode? But in the season-two premiere on September 21, the show will outdo itself. Rolling Stone has learned that the first episode will feature renditions of Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind,"" Lady Gaga's ""Telephone,"" Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire,"" and Poison's ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn."" In true Gleek fashion, the cast will also perform two vintage Broadway musical standards -- ""What I Did for Love"" from A Chorus Line and ""Getting to Know You"" from The King and I -- as well as ""Listen"" from the film version of ""Dreamgirls."" According to the series' music supervisor, P.J. Bloom, the episode's plot paved the way for the Jay-Z track: Having placed at the Regional competition in last season's finale, New Directions will travel to New York for the Nationals. ""So we needed a New York song,"" explains Bloom. He also says that the use of a second Gaga song -- after ""Bad Romance"" in the previous season -- is all due to co-creator Ryan Murphy. ""Ryan's a huge Lady Gaga fan,"" Bloom says. ""I suspect we're going to continue to look to her to be part of the show.""

"(CNN) -- Police in Ohio say a father cut his family off from the outside world, sexually abused at least one of his daughters and locked one child in a closet-sized room for a year. A grand jury has indicted Jeffrey York, 47, on charges that include rape and child endangerment, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Police in Madison Township, Ohio, revealed new details about the investigation to reporters Saturday. Authorities began investigating in December, when York's wife called 911 to report a sexual offense, Detective Dan Boerner said. When detectives arrived, she told them she and her seven children wanted to leave the home. Family members accused York of abusing them mentally and physically for more than a decade, Boerner said. ""The children who were of age for education were home-schooled for the most part, had no friends to speak of and no real outlets or resources to go to,"" he said. York locked one child in a tiny room for a year, Boerner said, letting the child out periodically to go to the restroom. ""In general, meals were brought to this child. Access to clothing, the restroom and everything was restricted by Mr. York,"" Boerner said. A grand jury has indicted York on charges that include two counts of rape involving a female under the age of 13, five instances of gross sexual imposition and six counts of child endangering, WJW reported. York has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The public defender representing York declined to comment when reached by CNN affiliate WEWS. Detectives who have worked on the case for months said the investigation is difficult to handle. ""There are just so many directions to go,"" Boerner said. ""It's not just one allegation involving one victim. It's multiple allegations involving multiple victims, so it makes it a little more difficult.""","Police say their investigation began after the children's mother called 911 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Don't let Jack Johnson fool you. Jack Johnson makes sure his business and his concert venues are environmentally friendly. Tabbed as a ""mellow rocker"" by perhaps one too many publications, the chart-topping singer-songwriter has a fire within that belies his laid-back manner -- a fire that extends to his company, Brushfire Records, and his environmental activism. Johnson started the record label in 2002 ""as a way to put out soundtracks for surf movies we were making,"" he says. ""Then our friends G. Love and Special Sauce were coming to the end of their record deal with another label, and the idea came up to put out their stuff."" The Hawaii-based artist -- whose latest album ""Sleep Through the Static"" hit No. 1 in the U.S. and sold over 2 million albums worldwide -- has continued to assemble talent. The label's roster now includes indie-rockers Rogue Wave, folk-pop musician Mason Jennings and keyboardist Money Mark. Johnson says the record label is not driven by dollar signs. ""We never try to talk anybody into joining the label, but we just offer a lot of creative control over all their music and a fairer deal than with most other labels,"" he explains.  Watch Johnson, Zach Gill and Money Mark perform ""Hope"" » . Rogue Wave frontman Zach Schwartz is one of the converts. ""The music business is traditionally pretty cutthroat, nasty and evil, but [with Brushfire], it is not that way,"" he tells CNN. ""You can make the music you want to make."" Still, even in these major-label-dominated times, artist-friendly labels aren't unusual; Dave Matthews has also attracted talent with his ATO Records. It's in making Brushfire a model of green business that Johnson and his colleagues have stood out. As keen environmentalists, Johnson and his team have required Brushfire and its distributors to engage in earth-friendly implementations that have influenced others in the record business. ""The music is one thing, but there is this business side,"" says Zach Gill, a Brushfire solo artist and member of Johnson's touring band. ""I think more and more businesses are saying, 'Yeah, we want to be responsible. Responsible to our employees. Responsible for the waste our company generates.' We're starting to see that a lot in all kinds of businesses, not just in music,"" he says.  Watch Gill and Johnson perform ""Family"" » . Entertainment industry giant Universal Music Group -- the largest family of record labels in the recording industry -- has taken notice. Under Brushfire's direction, UMG uses recycled stock on all of the packaging for its releases, including movies, ensuring that the paper is as environmentally friendly as possible. Some is even made using wind power. Moreover, Brushfire's artists have exerted their eco-influence on venues and promoters for concert tours worldwide. The tour rider, a checklist of artists' requirements at each venue, usually consists of specific brands of beer or (in one case involving Jennifer Lopez) the way the coffee is stirred. Brushfire uses an EnviroRider, a handbook of eco-friendly options and actions for various components of concert tour production. ""It gets augmented every year. What started out as suggestions are now becoming requirements [for us to play at a venue],"" says Johnson. Johnson and his management also created All At Once, a social action network that provides tools and information to people who want to become more involved in their community and worldwide. Visitors to the All At Once area at tour venues will be rewarded with exclusive music downloads by their favorite Brushfire artists. Johnson's charity, Ohana Charitable Foundation, will match any donation (up to $2,500) to nonprofits made by fans at the shows or online. ""We shrink our carbon footprint always, but we have all these nonprofit groups that we all work with,"" says Johnson. ""Money from the shows goes to these groups and helps bolster their memberships so that after we leave the town, these groups can continue to do good things. So more than just lessening our negative [environmental] impact, it's actually leaving a positive impact [wherever we tour],"" says Johnson. Additional actions taken by Brushfire tours will include fueling tour vehicles with sustainable biodiesel, offering eco-friendly merchandise, working with venues to create waste management programs, onsite recycling and encouraging fans to use alternative transportation. Back at home, Brushfire has adopted a similar strategy. All the power for the recording studios and the offices is generated by solar panels. Insulation is supplied by cotton from scraps of blue jeans. Energy-efficient lighting runs throughout the building. Second-hand furniture is all you will find in its offices. The mission resonates with the other artists on the label's roster. ""For me, it's so great to be a part of the label because so many people provide information about what we can do to make it better -- touring more efficiently, biodiesel -- stuff like that,"" says Jennings. ""I'm learning a ton being around those guys."" At bottom, the atmosphere of collaboration and common purpose is rooted in the shared love of music, says Gill. ""Music is the great synchronizer. They've become quite a wonderful community to be a part of. I feel grateful to Jack for having the idea to bring together all these like-minded people to make music together,"" he says. Johnson agrees. ""It's everything. It is the whole reason to play music. I learn so much from playing with these other musicians,"" he says.","Jack Johnson has artist-friendly record label, Brushfire Records .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The Basque separatist group ETA's cease-fire statement is insufficient, Spain's interior minister said Monday. Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, in the government's first major reaction, said that the statement, released to media Sunday, is ""very far from the minimums"" that the Spanish government has laid out for the group. ""The word 'truce' as a concept of limited peace to have a dialogue is dead. That's the past,"" Rubalcaba told Spanish state television TVE. He said the government's demand remains steadfast -- that ETA agree to unconditionally lay down its arms and end the violence forever, with a process to verify that. Rubalcaba said security forces would not let up on ETA during its unilateral cease-fire, and he said ETA called the cease-fire at a time of ""extreme weakness,"" due to police crackdowns against the group. ETA has announced cease-fires before and broken them, notably the 2006 cease-fire that was announced as ""permanent,"" only to be broken months later with a car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two people. In a statement published on the website of Basque newspaper Gara on Sunday, ETA -- which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence in northern Spain and southwest France -- ""calls on the Spanish government to agree to the the minimum democratic solutions toward a peace process."" The latest cease-fire announcement was not unexpected, following weeks of calls for a new peace process by some smaller leftist Basque political parties. The cease-fire announcement also follows months of what is widely regarded as a successful police crackdown against ETA operatives in Spain and also in ETA's hideouts in neighboring France and Portugal. Police have arrested many of ETA's suspected top operatives, as well as many ETA foot soldiers, and seized bomb-making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches, virtually shutting off ETA attacks. In its cease-fire announcement Sunday, ETA said that ""months ago it decided not to carry out armed offensive actions,"" but made no mention of what it might consider a ""defensive"" action. The announcement was accompanied by an ETA video which showed three apparent ETA members seated at a table in front of an ETA banner. They wore white hoods covering their faces. The hoods had eye holes, but their mouths were covered. The person in the middle apeared to do all the speaking in the ancient Basque language -- not in Spanish -- and the voice seemed to be that of a woman. ETA is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union for its campaign of car bombings and shootings. The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero began a peace process in 2006 during the last unilateral ETA cease-fire, but after ETA's airport bomb, the government called off negotiations. Since then, officials of Zapatero's government have said they would not accept a simple cease-fire statement. Instead, they have said they will accept only a definitive statement from ETA to end its armed fight, and to announce when and where it would lay down its arms forever. Only then would the government be willing to consider leniency for some of the more than 500 ETA prisoners in jail, officials have said. The Basque region in northern Spain already has considerable home-rule authority, with its own police, parliament, taxing power and control of health and education. But ETA rejects those as partial steps, and has fought for full independence. ETA's goal is an independent Basque nation comprising the three-province Basque region and the neighboring Navarra region in Spain, along with three departments in southwest France that also have Basque roots. About three million people live in those areas now. ETA's cease-fire statement called on the international community to get involved in the Basque peace process. On Sunday, the leader of the Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland said he supported the cease-fire. ""Gerry Adams has welcomed ETA cease-fire announcement,"" the Sinn Fein party said on its Twitter page. While ETA has announced cease-fires before, the absence of government involvement makes Sunday's statement unique, said Luis Aizpeolea, a correspondent for the Spanish newspaper El Pais. Past announcements have come after back-channel negotiations between government officials and ETA, Aizpeolea said. But this time, it was smaller leftist Basque political parties that appeared to have pushed ETA to make the cease-fire. The most significant of those parties is Batasuna, which is outlawed because the courts have found it is not independent, but a very part of ETA. Rubalcaba, Spain's interior minister, said that if Batasuna wants to get back into local politics and run candidates in elections next year, it must either make a full and convincing break from ETA, or convince ETA itself to end its armed struggle.","Interior minister says cease-fire statement does not meet government's requirements .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The judge in the drug trial of Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend-lawyer and two doctors raised questions Wednesday about the California law being used to prosecute them. Judge Robert Perry said he did not realize until researching the law on Tuesday night that the California Legislature changed the definition of an addict after most of the incidents the three are accused of allegedly happened. While Perry was not ready to decide how it might change the course of the trial, he suggested he would revisit the issue. ""We'll keep going forward,"" Perry said. Howard K. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor are accused of a conspiracy to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith. The prosecution alleged both doctors gave the former Playboy model and reality TV star a steady flow of dangerous painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs while knowing she was a drug addict. The charges cover the last three years of Smith's life, which ended in a Florida hotel room with her death caused by ""acute combined drug intoxication"" on February 8, 2007. The three are not charged in Smith's death. On Tuesday, Perry suggested the prosecution had fallen short so far in proving the core of its case, including that Smith was a drug addict. Perry began Wednesday's session by saying he had not realized revisions in the ""Intractable Pain Act,"" which guides the use of controlled drugs for pain treatment, were made in September 2006. ""An addict meant something different from what it meant before September, 2006,"" after most of the conspiracy allegedly happened, he said. The law was changed to specify that a patient who depended on drugs for pain treatment could not be considered an addict. Defense attorney Ellyn Garafalo said before the law was changed, a doctor might have been prosecuted if he or she gave drugs to ease pain for a drug addict who broke an arm. Perry read from the law, which included a statement that the California Legislature ""recognizes that prescription drugs can play a critical role in treatment of pain. Undertreatment of pain is a continuing problem."" A prosecution witness, who had concluded from a review of medical records that Smith was an addict, acknowledged during testimony Wednesday that Kapoor may have actually ""undermedicated"" the actress when treating her for two fractured ribs in 2004. The defense contends that Smith was in chronic pain, including from the rib injuries and later from childbirth and the death of her son. The trial, which began on August 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court, is expected to last at least two more weeks.","Judge suggests the prosecution's case is falling short .

"(CNN) -- I come from a family with diverse religious traditions: Baptist, Methodist, Apostolic, Buddhist and nondenominational. My mother was a spiritual seeker, and when she became Catholic, I was baptized into the Catholic faith as a young child. Growing up, I attended a parish with Irish, Polish and black Catholics, and observed that the spiritual gifts of black Catholics were often diminished. When it was suggested that we include a gospel song in the liturgy, we were told that was not Catholic. ""Ave Maria"" was sung, but not ""Mary had a Baby,"" a Negro spiritual. I learned about St. Theresa the ""Little Flower,"" but not St. Benedict the Black. A Kwanzaa table was a no-no. I learned while the word ""catholic"" meant ""universal"" and ""involving all,"" much of the gifts and experience of black Catholics were not included. Black Catholics have a heightened awareness of what W.E.B. Dubois called ""double consciousness."" This emerges from the tension between one's awareness of self and how others perceive one. Dubois used this term to speak of the experience of black people within the segregated United States. Today, a particular form of double consciousness is experienced by black Catholics: as a religious minority within the broader black Church community, who defend our religious affiliation to our black Protestant brothers and sisters while also confronting discrimination and ignorance from those within our own Catholic churches. What has helped black Catholics survive in the midst of almost insurmountable odds is a spirituality that bridges both our African-American experience and our Catholic faith. Father Augustus Tolton, the first recognized African-American priest, lived a similar struggle. His mother escaped slavery with him and his siblings, settling in Quincy, Illinois. He was baptized as a child, and by the time he was 16, he felt ""called"" to the Roman Catholic priesthood. No American Catholic seminaries accepted a black man, so in 1880, he traveled to Rome, Italy. He was ordained six years later, then returned to America to begin his pastoral ministry. After returning to Quincy, he was invited to Chicago, Illinois, by the local bishop. He began his new ministry at St. Mary's Church in Chicago. The basement of the church became the sanctuary for the emerging black Catholic congregation, the St. Augustine Society. His remaining years in Chicago were focused on ministering with and building a church for this community. He was a priest for only 11 years before he died from heat stroke. Earlier this year, Cardinal Francis George of the Archdiocese of Chicago announced that he planned to nominate Father Tolton for sainthood. It begins a process that will take some time to complete. Bishop Joseph N. Perry was appointed to highlight his cause. In literature promoting that cause for sainthood, the bishop wrote ""Fr. Tolton grew accustomed to adversity during his short life. He brought hope and comfort to the dying and promises of better days for the living."" His model of perseverance and holiness is a testament to all Catholics and persons of faith who are confronted with challenges. Father Tolton's experience resonates with many black Catholics. For every two steps forward -- the ordination and cause for sainthood of Father Augustus Tolton, the National Black Catholic Lay Congresses of the 19th and 20th centuries -- there are two steps back, like the recent shuttering of the African-American parishes and schools in the inner cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Missouri, and Los Angeles, California, and the struggles of black Catholic lay ministerial leadership who strive to be accepted within the broader church. I have experienced the tension and the joys of being both black and Catholic in my 25 years of ministry. I struggle with the fact that many of my brothers and sisters of African descent do not know this history or see themselves mirrored in the leadership within the Catholic Church in the United States. It is why I went on to study and teach at a graduate school, to help my brothers and sisters understand, and see their story as a part of the Catholic Church. Despite the challenges, our lives are enriched by our faith and sturdied by the example of Father Tolton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. C. Vanessa White.","C.

"(CNN) -- Portugal's Sergio Paulinho won stage 10 to hand Lance Armstrong's RadioShack team their first victory in the Tour de France. Paulinho narrowly held off Vasil Kiryienka of Belarus after both riders launched a bid for the line with 14km of the stage remaining. The peloton never threatened to go with the pair and rolled in at their leisure, with Paulinho becoming the first Portuguese stage winner since Acacio Da Silva in 1989. It brought some comfort to his RadioShack team, led by American Lance Armstrong, who conceded his chances of winning the Tour disappeared over the weekend. Andy Schleck's overall lead was never threatened during the 179km stage from Chambery to Gap, while the home crowd could not celebrate a local winner in sweltering temperatures on Bastille Day. Britain's Mark Cavendish led the peloton home and finished ninth grabbing 12 points in the green jersey standings. Italy's Alessandro Petacchi came tenth. The top ten riders in the general classification standings were unchanged meaning race leader Andy Schleck made sure he retained the yellow jersey for another day. Paulinho, who won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics in the road race, was part of a six-man break and only a determined sprint prevented Kiryienka picking up Belarus' first ever Tour win. ""It was a close sprint but the most important thing is to win and so this moment, for me and my team, is a good one,"" Paulinho told the official Tour de France website. ""I hope that in the coming days the team can achieve a few more victories. ""For me this victory is more important than the silver medal in the Olympic Games. This is the best race in the world and to win one stage in the Tour is the pinnacle of what a cyclist can achieve."" Overall leader Schleck was pleased with a comfortable day in the saddle: ""It was quite an easy day even if it was fast at the beginning. It was a breakaway day so we took it kind of easy behind. ""Okay, there was a lot of wind so the team had to do some work all the way to Gap but it wasn't too stressful. I had a little bit of time to enjoy my first day in the yellow jersey.

"(CNN) -- Jacob Zuma insists the World Cup has already brought South Africa closer together, five days before the tournament begins. The South African president says football fervor has gripped the nation ahead of the opening on game on Friday, which sees South Africa take on Mexico at the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg. And Zuma is hoping the month-long competition can have the same benefit for the nation as the Rugby World Cup did in 1995. ""The enthusiasm, joy and excitement that has engulfed the entire nation in recent weeks has not been witnessed since president Nelson Mandela was released from prison [in 1990],"" Zuma told a press conference. ""The explosion of national pride has been a priceless benefit. It's clear that millions of our people look upon this tournament with hope, pride and sense of belonging. ""The South African flag has become the most popular item on the shopping list of South Africans and this augurs well for our nation-building."" The build-up to the World Cup has been dominated by speculation that the host stadiums may not be completed in time, or that the necessary infrastructure may not be in place, but Zuma has declared the country ready to host one of the world's biggest sporting events. ""We are truly pleased and humbled to host the world in our country for this historical and extraordinary event. South Africa is more than ready. For us the World Cup has already begun."" Zuma and FIFA president Sepp Blatter also paid tribute to former South African president Nelson Mandela, and the role he played in securing Africa's first World Cup. ""At this point it is proper for me to acknowledge and thank our founding president and icon, Nelson Mandela, for his visionary leadership and statesmanship,"" said Zuma. ""He also worked hard personally to bring us to this glorious moment. He would love to be there. Whether he will be there on the day depends entirely on the former president..

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- An Iraqi soldier opened fire Tuesday on a group of U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, killing two and wounding nine others, the U.S. military and the Iraqi military said. They are the first American deaths in Iraq since the U.S. combat mission officially ended last week. The attack occurred inside an Iraqi army commando compound when the soldier, clad in an Iraqi army uniform, fired on the U.S. soldiers near the Salaheddin province city of Tuz, the U.S. military said. The attacker was shot and killed. Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Askari, a Defense Ministry spokesman, identified the shooter as Soran Rahman, from the Iraqi army's 4th Division. Al-Askari said Rahman got into a fight with U.S. soldiers, and then pulled his weapon and fired on them before he was shot dead. The spokesman said a joint U.S.-Iraqi investigation into the incident was under way. The soldiers were part of a security element for a U.S. company commander who was meeting with members of Iraqi security forces  at the compound. ""This is a tragic and cowardly act, which I firmly believe was an isolated incident and is certainly not reflective of the Iraqi security forces"" in Salaheddin, said Maj. Gen. Tony Cucolo, commander, Task Force Marne. In a second attack in Salaheddin province, a U.S. soldier and a number of Iraqis were wounded when a convoy in central Tikrit was hit by grenades early Tuesday afternoon, a U.S. military spokesman said. Soldiers who were in the vehicle that was attacked killed the grenade thrower, he said. An Iraqi Interior Ministry official and police in Tikrit said that the man threw two grenades at the convoy, damaging a vehicle, and that U.S. forces then opened fire ""randomly,"" killing a civilian and wounding four others. But a spokesman for the U.S. military issued a statement disagreeing with that assessment, saying the U.S. military believes that the civilians' wounds were caused by the grenade that exploded and not from indiscriminate gunfire. He said a U.S. military investigation concluded that the civilians' wounds were caused by shrapnel and not from bullets. Two witnesses identified the body as that of the attacker, the spokesman said. More than 4,400 U.S. troops died in Iraq during the war. While violence has dropped in the last two years, President Barack Obama said last week that ""violence will not end with our combat mission."" ""Extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife. But ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals,"" he said in a speech from the Oval Office on August 31. That's when he announced the end of the U.S. combat mission and the beginning of a new American phase in Iraq. U.S. troops are expected to advise and assist Iraq's security forces, back Iraqi troops in counterterrorism missions and protect American civilians there during a transitional period. Unless the United States and Iraq forge a new agreement, all U.S. troops are scheduled to depart Iraq by the end of 2011.

"(CNN) -- South Africa's World Cup dream is hanging by a thread after Uruguay took a firm grip on Group A with a ruthless 3-0 win over the hosts. Diego Forlan gave the South American side a first half lead after his shot deflected off Aaron Mokoena and into the net. South Africa pushed forward in the second half but their hopes were dashed when Uruguay striker Luis Suarez was brought down in the penalty area by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, who was sent off. Forlan converted the resulting penalty past substitute 'keeper Moeneeb Josephs to kill the hosts off and send many South Africa fans heading for the exits. Alvaro Pereira converted a late third as South Africa desperately tried to salvage something from the game. Uruguay go top of Group A with four points from their two games. South Africa have a solitary point after two games, and must beat France in their final game to have any hope of progressing to the knock out stages. The hosts had gone into the game buoyed by their opening day draw with Mexico and riding a wave of emotion after the country enthusiastically embraced the first ever World Cup held on African soil. Group A was delicately poised after all four teams drew their opening game and it was Uruguay who started the more positively, striker Luis Suarez shooting wide after just seven minutes. On 20 minutes Forlan broke the deadlock. Picking the ball up in midfield the Atletico Madrid forward surged towards the edge of the penalty area before unleashing a fierce drive on goal. The ball took a touch off Mokoena and dipped under the crossbar. South Africa struggled to retain possession as Uruguay pushed forward but the game reached the interval with no further scoring. The hosts played with more urgency after the break but couldn't unearth a chance before the game's decisive passage of play. On 75 minutes Suarez picked up a loose ball in the area before being clipped by Khune's leg. The referee pointed to the penalty spot and showed the goalkeeper a straight red card. Forlan slotted the penalty into the roof of the net to take the stuffing out of South Africa and as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's ten men edged forward in search of a goal Uruguay killed them off. Suarez collected Forlan's long pass before crossing for Pereira to bundle the ball home and put the game beyond doubt, right on the final whistle. Group A's other teams -- France and Mexico -- play on Thursday night in Polokwane. South Africa's final game is against France on Tuesday.","World Cup hosts South Africa are beaten 3-0 by Uruguay .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have had significant successes against drug traffickers, President Felipe Calderon said in his fourth annual state-of-the-nation speech Thursday, noting that three major kingpins have been captured or killed in the past year. In addition, Calderon said, authorities have arrested 125 cartel cell leaders or lieutenants and captured 5,108 hit men since he took office in December 2006. The war on organized crime he heightened after taking office also has led to the confiscation of $10 billion worth of drugs and the seizure of 34,000 motor vehicles, nearly 500 aircraft, 365 boats and 80,000 firearms, of which 50,000 were assault rifles, Calderon said. Calderon's remarks came just days after the federal police captured Edgar ""La Barbie"" Valdez Villarreal, one of the country's most wanted drug traffickers. The arrest was viewed as a solid victory for Calderon's operation against the cartels. However, violence in some parts of the country, particularly near the border, continue unabated. Other victories for Calderon this year included the killing of another drug kingpin, Arturo Beltran Leyva in December, and the subsequent arrest of his brother, Carlos Beltran Leyva. In January, authorities arrested Teodoro ""El Teo"" Garcia Simental, another top trafficker. Garcia Simental was a top lieutenant of the Tijuana cartel until he defected to the rival Sinaloa cartel after a power struggle. Another top leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel, was killed in a raid in July. According to the Mexican government, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006.","President Felipe Calderon lays out his record in state-of-the-nation speech .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Nigeria's acting head of state has urged citizens to maintain peace and stability while the nation's ailing president recuperates after more than three months at a Saudi Arabia hospital. Vice President Goodluck Jonathan's comments came after President Umaru Yar'Adua returned home early Wednesday, but his condition is unknown. He left Nigeria in November for treatment for inflammation of tissue around his heart, creating a power vacuum in Africa's most populous nation for months. Nigerian lawmakers voted earlier this month to install Jonathan as acting head of state. On Wednesday, Jonathan assured Nigerians ""that the ship of state is on course"" and lauded Yar'Adua's return, but did not give details on his condition. ""It is at times like this that all patriots must rise to the occasion, and place the interest of the country above every other consideration,"" the acting president said in a statement. Jonathan will continue to oversee the nation as the president recuperates, but his health has ""greatly improved,"" said presidential spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi. Yar'Adua's absence sparked protests in the capital, Abuja, where demonstrators demanded a constitutional order on his absence and evidence about his condition. During his absence, some incidents in the west African nation sparked international headlines, prompting more backlash. A Nigerian man was charged with attempting to bring down a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day. A cease-fire Yar'Adua had spear-headed with militants also started unraveling, and religious conflict in the city of Jos killed hundreds. Yar'Adua's return sparked fears of more instability in the oil-rich nation. A statement from the U.S. State Department hailed the news, but said it hoped his return was not an effort by his advisers to topple stability and renew uncertainty in the democratic process. ""Nigeria is an extraordinarily important country to its friends and partners, and all those in positions of responsibility should put the health of the president and the best interests of the country and people of Nigeria above personal ambition or gain,"" Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson said in a statement. ""As a nation of 150 million people, Nigeria's democracy and its continued adherence to constitutional rule should be the highest priority,"" the statement added.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN)  -- The reputed leader of the Zetas drug cartel in the Mexican state of Veracruz was killed in a gunbattle with federal authorities, the Mexican attorney general's office has said. Braulio Arellano Dominguez, also known as ""El Gonzo,"" ""Zeta 20"" or ""El Verdugo,"" was mortally wounded when federal police and sailors went to search a house in the city of Soledad de Doblado, the attorney general said in a release Tuesday. Arellano Dominguez opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver and was wounded in the firefight, officials said. He died while being transported to a hospital. Three other suspects were arrested. Officials said they confiscated five cars, four motorcycles, a submachine gun, a hand grenade, four pistols, more than 150 rounds of ammunition, communication equipment, three bags containing unspecified powder and pills, 74,900 pesos ($5,655) and $107 in U.S. currency. Veracruz is in southeastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Los Zetas, formed by former Mexican elite commando-type soldiers, consists mostly of ex-federal and local police. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers the group among the most advanced and violent of Mexico's drug cartels. Originally formed as the Gulf drug cartel's enforcement wing, the Zetas increasingly have branched out on their own. More than 12,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels after taking office in December 2006. He has deployed thousands of military personnel and federal police in his battle against the drug traffickers.","Reputed leader of Los Zetas cartel in Mexico's Veracruz state reportedly in gunbattle .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The release of American hiker Sarah Shourd has been ""canceled"" because the judicial process has not been completed, a prosecutor said Friday, according to the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency. Iranian officials had said Thursday that Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, would be released Saturday. ""The news [of the impending release] is not approved by the judiciary and, naturally, any decision regarding the defendants is contingent upon the completion of the due process,"" said Abas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's public and revolutionary prosecutor, according to ILNA. The Islamic Republic News Agency, an official agency of the Iranian government, cited the deputy director of the president's office of communications as saying that Shourd's release had only been ""postponed."" ""He said more details will be given later,"" it added. Shourd, 32, along with Shane Bauer, 28, and Josh Fattal, 28, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Masoud Shafii, the Iranian lawyer who represents the hikers, said he has put in a formal request for the trio's release within the past two weeks. Shafii said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment, and that Shourd has a medical condition that requires proper care. A spokeswoman for the families told CNN that Shourd told her mother during their sole visit, over two days in May, that she had found a lump in her breast. The hikers' families' website, freethehikers.org, said Shourd has been in solitary confinement, able to meet for only two 30-minute periods per day with Bauer, who is her fiancé, and Fattal. The two men share a cell. The three Americans -- all of them graduates of the University of California, Berkeley -- have not been charged, the website says. They are in Evin Prison in Tehran, have been able to telephone their families only once, on March 9, and have been denied access to their lawyer, the website adds. ""Shane, Sarah and Josh care greatly about our world and have a documented record as advocates for social and environmental justice,"" it says. ""They admire and respect different cultures and religions and share a love of travel that has taken them to many countries. That is why they went to Kurdistan, not because they wanted to enter Iran. ""Their protracted detention without due process is illegal according to international and Iranian law and must end immediately. It is widely acknowledged that they are being held for political purposes that have nothing to do with the facts of their case. Their detention is arbitrary and inhumane and we call on the Iranian authorities to release them without further delay.""

"(CNN) -- We are all sick at heart to witness the unfathomable suffering in Haiti. Why do bad things happen to innocent people? Why Haiti, again? Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently, ""It is biblical, the tragedy that continues to stalk Haiti and the Haitian people."" How we make meaning of this suffering will be crucial to how we respond, in the long term, as a global community. My Haitian in-laws, visiting from Boston, Massachusetts, to take some comfort with us, announced that the verse of the day on their favorite Bible Web site is from Revelation 16:18. ""And there were voices and thunders and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great."" The word ""earthquake"" appears sixteen times in the Bible. It was clear to them -- and many other Christians -- that the earthquake was part of God's plan. Why God ordains such disasters is a mystery that is not ours to question. It is only our job to have faith. iReport: Looking for loves ones in Haiti . A friend who barely escaped the collapse of her house in the quake writes that people in her Port-au-Prince neighborhood are living this time as the apocalypse. They are gathering en masse, singing hymns and praying nonstop as they wait for disaster aid -- and Jesus. For them, the meaning of their suffering is clear. How else to interpret the collapse of their entire world, earthquake, famine, death, disease and drought? They are God's children living out the last chapter of the Bible. Fundamentalist Pat Robertson says that the earthquake is the devil's work. Haitians are cursed by a pact with Satan that their ancestors made, he says. Distorting a Haitian national myth, he is referring to a famous Afro-Creole religious service said to have sparked and launched the Haitian War of Independence in 1791. Ironically, historians tell us that such a single ceremony never happened --although surely there were many slave gatherings, and many Afro-Creole religious rituals in the region. Haitians do not mistake African religiosity for Satanism as Robertson does, so for them the ceremony was a spiritually charged political rally. Slaves gathered to plan and inspire themselves for the outrageous feat they would succeed in performing: a slave revolution, the abolition of slavery, and by 1804, national independence. Afro-Creole religion, known as Vodou, still underpins the philosophy of many Haitians, though by no means everyone. A spirit-priest I know reads the earthquake as an allegorical message from the spirits who infuse the land. ""The land is our mother,"" he said. When you abuse the land -- deforest her, plant only one crop, overpopulate her, erode her soil -- she explodes, searching for a way to rebalance. The spirit of the land had become sick with abuse. Her children -- the eldest ones, the ones in charge, the Haitian government -- had no policies, no laws to protect the land or use it wisely. The spirit-mother exploded with fever. ""We know this has a scientific cause,"" said the spirit-priest. ""But look how the government buildings caved in. This tells us something."" In the last several years there has been a saying among Haitians that ""the country is finished."" ""Peyi-a fini,"" they say in Creole. It has been called a dying land, a failed state, a product of irreversible environmental degradation. For social scientists, there is nothing metaphysical about the question ""Why Haiti?"" Longstanding structural reasons have produced a dysfunctional system long in crisis. Beginning as a French slave society, the nation was founded at a severe disadvantage. France demanded enormous payment for abandoned property after the revolution, starting a cycle of debt that was never broken. Deep and abiding racism prevented the U.S. and Europe from recognizing Haiti for 60 years. Trade was never established on even terms. The military ruled the state, culminating in the brutal Duvalier dictatorship, which the U.S. supported. No robust civil society developed -- there's no vigorous tradition of PTAs and town planning boards. A brain drain evacuated top talent from the country, while the U.S.-subsidized farm industry sent surplus crops to Haiti, undercutting local prices there. Farmers abandoned their lands, flocked to the capital, and built the shanty towns that have now collapsed into rubble, burying the innocent and vulnerable, strong and powerful alike. The suffering Haitians are enduring is a natural disaster worsened by human-made conditions. It is a spiritual crucible. But it is also a crisis of meaning. For Christians it is to have faith, hope, and charity. For fundamentalist Protestants, it is to convert all souls, give aid, and wait for Jesus' return. For Vodouists, it is to regain balance with the land and the unseen spiritual world. For many social scientists, it is to strengthen Haitians' capacity for self-government, to relieve the debt Haiti owes, to reforest the land, and to figure out how to divorce aid from dependence. How we interpret the suffering of the good people of Haiti will lay the groundwork for how we walk forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth McAlister.","Haiti has endured extraordinary suffering, Elizabeth McAlister says .
She says the nation's different faiths view the suffering differently .
Some view the earthquake as a sign of the Apocalypse, she says .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- After months of jury selection and delays caused by the defendant's alleged suicide attempt, the triple murder case against Steven Hayes, one of two accused in the killing of a Connecticut physician's family, is set to begin Monday. Hayes, 47, and his co-defendant, Joshua Komisarjevsky, 30, are charged with capital murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, burglary, and arson in an alleged crime spree that resulted in the deaths of a doctor's wife and two daughters. The two paroled felons are accused of breaking into the doctor's home in the early morning hours of July 23, 2007, and terrorizing the family for hours before setting fire to the house. ""The case against Hayes appears strong. The real battle should be in the penalty phase,"" said Christopher Morano, who was part of the team that prosecuted Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel, and is now a Connecticut-based defense attorney. ""I expect the prosecution will present their evidence methodically, they'll work to protect their case from any appellate errors and ignore the media and the behind-the-scenes political battle over the death penalty."" Lawyers involved in the case are barred from talking to the media by a court-imposed gag order, so trial strategy and details of the crime have been kept under tight wraps. However those details could be made public during opening statements, as lawyers on both sides have moved to make them. While openings are routine in most states and typically serve as a road map to the evidence, they are not the norm in Connecticut, Morano said. ""Opening statements are usually up to the discretion of the judge,"" he said. Connecticut prosecutors usually start their cases with a witness who will set the scene. In this case that could be Dr. William Petit, the only survivor of the home invasion. Petit was beaten and bound during the attack. According to local newspaper accounts, he has been a vocal advocate for the death penalty in his quest for justice. His comments at one point drew protests from Hayes' attorney, Thomas Ullmann, who complained to the court that Petit was trying to influence potential jurors. For legal reasons, Komisarjevsky will be tried separately. He and Hayes could face lethal injection if they are convicted of capital murder in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters. Hayes also is accused of raping and strangling Hawke-Petit and prosecutors have charged Komisarjevsky with sexually assaulting Petit's 11-year-old daughter. Momentum to repeal Connecticut's death penalty hit a snag last year when the state's Republican governor, M. Jodi Rell, vetoed an abolition bill passed by the State's House and Senate. Twelve jurors and seven alternates have been selected to hear the case against Hayes, which is expected to take up to three months.","Steven Hayes is one of two accused of killing a woman and her two daughters .

"(CNN) -- A Louisiana judge has ordered prosecutors to release their files on the deaths of patients at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina, finding that no related legal cases are in the works. Baton Rouge District Judge Donald Johnson ruled that investigators' records of the Memorial Medical Center deaths don't involve ""criminal litigation which is either pending or which can be reasonably anticipated,"" so they have to be disclosed under state open records laws. It's the second such order by a state judge, following a 2007 decision that was vacated by an appeals court. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Doe had sued to block the public release of the file, claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy. CNN and the New Orleans Times-Picayune are among the parties to the lawsuit, which also included state and local prosecutors. ""We are glad that the Louisiana court has recognized that the investigatory file into the deaths that occurred at Memorial Medical Center in the days following Hurricane Katrina can no longer be withheld from disclosure under the public records laws,"" CNN said in a statement on the decision. ""CNN remains committed to covering New Orleans post-Katrina."" The Louisiana Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court in July to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case was expected, leading to the ruling received today. There was no immediate word on whether any of those parties would appeal, but Lori Mince, one of the lawyers who represented CNN, said she expected someone will do so. ""Unless everyone is going to fold up their tent, which seems unlikely, we're in for another several months of appeals,"" Mince said. The case stems from allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial Hospital following the 2005 hurricane, when floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. A doctor and two nurses were arrested in connection with the deaths, but a grand jury declined to bring charges against them in 2007. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients. Foti said the four, who ranged in age from their early 60s to their early 90s, were given a ""lethal cocktail"" of morphine and another depressant, midazolam hydrochloride. Experts he consulted reported that of all the people who died in Katrina, only at Memorial was that combination of drugs to blame. Pou and the nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically by staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. Foti gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony, but in July 2007, a grand jury refused to indict Pou. Then-New Orleans District Attorney Eddie Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it. But the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs. All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths, and concluded the patients were homicide victims.","Judge says no pending cases justify keeping file closed .

"(CNN) -- Argentina football coach Diego Maradona has undergone plastic surgery on his face after being bitten by one of his dogs. The 49-year-old was admitted to the Sanatorio Los Arcos clinic in Buenos Aires on Monday after suffering an injury to his top lip, hospital spokesperson Izarriaga Facundo told CNN. He is doing well after undergoing reconstructive surgery last night and will be discharged later on Tuesday, the spokesperson added. Maradona spent several weeks in the same clinic in 2007 after developing serious health problems. Is Messi better than Maradona? His career has been interspersed with moments of glory and controversy. In 1986 he scored an infamous ""Hand of God"" goal against England on the way to inspiring Argentina to World Cup victory. He was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after failing a doping test for cocaine while playing for Napoli in Italy, and was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. for using ephedrine. Since retiring from playing aged 37, he has battled several health problems related to his weight, drugs and alcohol. Maradona's Argentina side made a disappointing start to their World Cup campaign before qualifying for the finals in South Africa via a late goal against Uruguay in their last game in October. Following the victory, Maradona unleashed an obscene tirade at journalists and was banned for two months.","Diego Maradona has plastic surgery on his face after getting bitten by one of his dogs.

"(CNN) -- The son of an 81-year-old man who was fatally beaten Sunday after attending his granddaughter's wedding in Lynchburg, Virginia, said he holds no animosity toward the three teenagers who are being held as suspects. ""I don't want retribution, I want redemption,"" Gregg Baker said about the killing of his father, George Baker. ""I want God to reach out and touch those young men and change their lives,"" the younger Baker said in an interview with CNN affiliate WDBJ. George Baker, a retired salesman, had traveled from his home in Tempe, Arizona, to Lynchburg in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains for the wedding, said his son, the father of the bride. ""Several times at the reception, my daughter coaxed him out on the dance floor and I saw them one time hugging and I overheard him tell her how beautiful she looked, how happy he was for she and her husband and (how he) enjoyed the wedding service immensely,"" Gregg Baker told HLN's ""Prime News"" Thursday. He added that his father spoke that night with the pastor, telling him, ""If I die tonight, I die a happy man."" After the ceremony, the patriarch was walking down Main Street toward a restaurant where the reception was to be held when he was attacked by the three boys in what they told police was an attempt to impress some girls, Gregg Baker said. The elderly victim was taken to a hospital, where he died Monday morning, police said. Two 16-year-old boys and a 13-year-old boy have been charged in the killing. ""Really, it's difficult to get your hands around this and try to rationalize this type of behavior,"" said Lynchburg Police Capt. Todd Swisher. ""Three individuals brutally assault a defenseless person, and that's what happened."" Baker family spokesman Andy Hill called the incident ""a wake-up call for everybody out there to really pay attention to your children, let them understand that there are a lot of second- and third-order consequences for acts like this, a lot of people get hurt."" Under Virginia law, the 13-year-old cannot be tried as an adult, but the 16-year-olds will be tried as adults, said criminal justice attorney Jennifer Bonjean.","""I want God to reach out and touch those young men,"" son of slain man says .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Suksma Ratri separated from her husband after suffering ongoing domestic violence. But four years ago, the young mother from Indonesia found out her ex-husband had become extremely ill, and possibly had AIDS. Ratri immediately went to her doctor to be tested. The results were what she says she largely expected at that point -- she was HIV-positive. Ratri told her story to a gathering of journalists at the United Nations Tuesday, in a press conference to announce the launch of a new campaign by UNAIDS, the U.N.'s joint program on HIV/AIDS. The organization is launching a five-year program to help fight the growing number of issues surrounding women becoming infected with HIV/AIDS. Their initiatives include curbing violence against women, increasing available preventative care and treatment, and better enforcing human rights on an international scale. By focusing on those issues, the campaign hopes to effectively battle to the high rate of HIV infection among females around the world. Like many women, Ratri became a victim in a global epidemic that is the leading cause of death and disease among those between the ages of 15 to 49 worldwide. The disease has been disproportionately affecting women for several years, a change in the trend that once applied to men when the virus became well-known in the early 1980s. Now separated from her husband, Ratri serves as an activist for the rights of migrants in Asia to reduce their vulnerabilities to HIV. She lives openly with her disease, a decision she says allows her to overcome the stigma concerning people who are HIV-positive. Ratri says she was lucky to be able to accept her status as HIV-positive as quickly as she did. ""I needed to fight the stigma,"" she said. ""I needed to be open."" She is well aware that people are taken aback when they find out she has HIV. She often hears people comment on the fact that she seems ""normal"" despite the presence of infection. ""It's just I have the virus and you don't,"" said Ratri. ""That's the only difference between us."" UNAIDS is also receiving some star-studded support for the program. Internationally renowned singer Annie Lennox was on hand at the United Nations to voice her support. At the invitation of former President Nelson Mandela, she visited South Africa, where HIV prevalence among women ages 15 to 24 years is three times higher than that of men of the same age. The high rate of sexual violence against women in that country is believed to contribute to the growing number of HIV/AIDS cases. Every ten minutes, a woman is raped in the country, totaling more than 54,000 attacks per year, according to authorities. After witnessing the effects of HIV/AIDS on South African women for herself, Lennox says she was moved to help the dire situation. ""There were not enough things being done to address a very urgent chronic endemic situation,"" said Lennox. ""Many mothers who could have been alive to take care of their children were not there anymore."" Lennox released her fourth solo album, ""Songs of Mass Destruction,"" in October 2007, including a song that launched a campaign to raise awareness and support South African women affected by the HIV virus and AIDS pandemic. ""Women are the face (of HIV/AIDS) now. Stigma runs from the very top echelons of society, all the way down to the poor,"" said Lennox. ""(The women) have to be able to come out of the shadows, and we must represent them,"" she said.","UNAIDS launched a five-year program to battle the high rate of HIV infection among women .

"(CNN) -- Dads in short shorts and moms in beehive hairdos are becoming all the rage on the Internet. Parents are usually the first to show off pictures of their kids, but that role has been reversed in a new breed of style blogs in which children submit nostalgic and stylish photos of their parents from back in the day. Blogs like My Mom, the Style Icon, My Parents Were Awesome  and Dads in Short Shorts allow proud children to submit nostalgic pictures of their parents to put on display for the world. ""Similar to the way that young people look to celebrities as style icons, more people are looking to these attainable vintage fashions from their parents and there is a growing population of people who prefer these classic looks,"" said Margot Nason, editor of the trend forecasting newsletter Trend Central. What is so unique about these blogs is that the photos celebrate just how cool today's offspring think their parents are. Rather than laughing or cringing at old photos of their folks, today's children want everyone to see their parents in their heyday. Newspaper editor Piper Weiss got the idea for My Mom, the Style Icon when she was rifling through her mother's closet in search of vintage clothes to steal for her own wardrobe. ""I began using pictures of her before I was born as a guide to my own style because I figured whatever looked good on her when she was young would look good on me now,"" said Weiss, 31. ""I discovered a photo album of pictures of her before she met my dad and she was so heart-stoppingly gorgeous I wanted to share them with everyone I knew. I started the blog with pictures of my mom and then people's own submissions started rolling in."" Since the Web site has been live for a little more than a month, Weiss has received several hundred submissions of parent pictures from folks who want to memorialize their mom and dad's most stylish years on the Internet. During a recession, folks are more likely to indulge in the kind of nostalgia these old pictures evoke. ""Times of uncertainty make you long for the past, and the nostalgia of these pictures makes people feel safe,"" said Samantha Marcus Yanks, editor-in-chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines. ""And a bit of nostalgia is inspirational in fashion these days, because it seems more affordable."" The Web site Dads in Short Shorts, started by marketing manager Tara Eisenberg, 26, and painter Annie Kyle, 26, has a genesis similar to My Mom, the Style Icon. ""On a summer road trip we were looking through an old photo album and discovered a shot of a dad in bright yellow shorts mixed in with seemingly normal family photos,"" Eisenberg said. ""The mom claimed the shot was an 'accident' and that she was just 'testing the camera.' Upon further investigation, we noticed a lot of our friends had similar 'accidents' in their old photo albums, and thus the blog was born."" Dads in Short Shorts has had more the 50 submissions of dads wearing above the knee pants, with more pouring in every day. How do parents feel about being exposed in all their youthful glory and occasional fashion disasters on the Internet for all to see? ""The blog is great fun for me and the nostalgia is a trip,"" said Marilyn Weiss about her debut on My Mom, the Style Icon. ""Not many guests want to sit down and see your old photos. They want to show you theirs. ""Fortunately for this mom, my daughter has provided me with quite an extensive and diverse audience."" Samantha Josephs, whose mom, Susan Buckner, played Patty Simcox in the movie version of ""Grease,"" was inspired to send a picture of her mom from the '70s when she was touring with Dean Martin and the Golddiggers. ""The photos that I've collected from her from all of the girls in the group were always my favorite because of the platinum big hair and the kitten eyes,"" Josephs said. ""My mother looks iconic in the photo, and I still look at her the same when I see her now."" Buckner was certainly a style icon in her own right in the '70s, but being made one in the Internet age held a whole new meaning. ""My mom screamed when she saw it. She thanked me a thousand times over, made it her screen saver and said what an amazing gift this was to her to be made an icon on the Internet,"" Josephs said.","Some ""kids"" are proud of how stylish their parents were years ago .

"(CNN)  -- Shots were fired Sunday near a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland, but the motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, according to the Interior Ministry of Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, shown in France on November 13, called the incident a provocation. The ministry said the motorcade, which carried Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's South Ossetia region when the shots were fired. No other shooting was reported in the area. South Ossetia was the site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August. The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. Saakashvili later told reporters the incident ""clearly was intended as a provocation."" He said that he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed ""you are dealing with unpredictable people"" in the disputed area. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency Interfax said the command of the Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia denied blame for the gunfire. ""Allegations that Russian military personnel were involved in the fire against the motorcade are not true. An attack on the motorcade from our military personnel is out of the question,"" a peacekeeping force spokesman said, according to Interfax. The news agency also quoted a senior South Ossetian official as saying that South Ossetia ""has nothing to do"" with the incident. ""The Georgian side is once again disseminating misinformation,"" South Ossetian Deputy Defense Minister Ibragim Gasseyev told Interfax. Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders with those regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing.","NEW: Russian peacekeepers, South Ossetia deny involvement in shooting .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has been included in the United States Ryder Cup team by captain Corey Pavin. Woods, who held on to his world number one status at the Deutsche Bank Championship after an 11th placed finish, was handed one of four wildcard picks despite an indifferent year. The 34-year-old struggled for form in the wake of revelations about his private life and last month he confirmed his divorce from Elin Nordegren. Rickie Fowler, Zach Johnson and Stewart Cink were also included in the 12-strong team to defend the Ryder Cup against Europe at Celtic Manor in Wales at the start of October. Pavin's Ryder Cup picks almost right . The eight players who qualified automatically were Phil Mickelson, Hunter Mahan, Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker, Dustin Johnson, Jeff Overton and Matt Kuchar. Woods told a news conference he was ""honored"" to be selected by Pavin: ""It's great to be part of the team and I'm honored to be selected and represent the United States. Corey Pavin's picks dissected on Golf.com . ""I've been to Wales before in the Walker Cup. I'm looking forward to going back and having a great time with the team and hopefully bring the cup back."" Woods has participated in five Ryder Cups and won 10 of the 25 matches he has played, losing 13 and halving two. ""I always love playing in Ryder Cup, being part of the team,"" Woods added. ""It is an experience you will never forget. ""It is one of those things I have been looking forward to. It is nice my game is coming around. I feel my game is not very far away. It makes it a lot easier going into a pressure-packed environment."" Pavin added: ""What I was trying to do was not form any opinions until this weekend. I didn't want to burden myself with over thinking this so I just waited. ""I was hoping he [Woods] would qualify on points. He didn't but then I was just waiting to see how he was going to play. ""I'm pleased to see Tiger playing better - he is one of 12 guys on the team and every one is just as important as the other players."" Cink has appeared in four Ryder Cups and won the 2009 Open Championship at Turnberry in Scotland. Johnson won the 2007 Masters and tied for third at the recent US PGA Championship. His only appearance in the Ryder Cup came back in 2007. Fowler is a Ryder Cup rookie and only turned professional last year. He tied for 14th at this year's Open Championship at St Andrews. European captain Colin Montgomerie named three-time major winner Padraig Harrington, Luke Donald and European Tour rookie Edoardo Molinari as his three wildcards picks last Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho is confident that Real Madrid can break Barcelona's dominance in Spain in his first season in charge of the nine-time European champions. The capital club won the last of its 31 La Liga crowns in 2008, but Mourinho exclusively told CNN that he believed he could continue the success that saw him win titles in his native Portugal, England and Italy. ""I hope so. I did it with Porto, I did it with Inter, with Chelsea we didn't win the Champions League but we won two consecutive Premierships so, why not to do it with Real?"" the 47-year-old told CNN World Sport's Patrick Snell. ""It's a big club, it's a club with lots of good players. In this moment they have the motivation because they win nothing in the last years, but of course it's not easy, because we have real opponents, and we have to be the team."" Mourinho has a big history with Barcelona, where he was an assistant coach under Bobby Robson and then Louis van Gaal from 1996-2000. He had several big European clashes with the Catalan club while in charge of Chelsea, and his Inter side beat Pep Guardiola's titleholders in last season's Champions League semis before going on to defeat Van Gaal's Bayern in the final. ""You know, everybody speaks about our second game in Barcelona where we had a very defensive approach. But they forget in the first match in the Champions League with Inter we smashed them, we scored three goals and we could have scored four or five, so I think the problem with Barcelona is more psychological than other things,"" Mourinho said. ""Lots of teams are afraid of them, they are afraid to attack them. We did it. We won it, and after that in the second leg, it's a semifinal, it's a Champions League semifinal -- it's not the moment to play the beautiful game, it's the moment to make history. Carvalho completes Real Madrid move . ""And we made history, we reached the final, and after that in the final, it was an easy match for us. Bayern was a good team, but we were so solid by a psychological point of view, that Inter did it, and it looked like it was easy, and it wasn't."" When Mourinho arrived in London in 2004, he famously quipped to the British press that he was ""The Special One"" -- a nickname that has stuck wherever he has gone since. ""But you know, I won lots of things. I won 17 titles in the past 10 years, and I'm one of the three coaches that won two Champions Leagues with two different teams, so, I'm one of the good ones,"" he said. ""But to say I'm the Special One, I prefer not to say that, I just say 'I have a nice system'."" Mourinho will have to juggle a star-studded squad which has failed to equal the sum of its parts in the past two seasons, with Real's opening match away to Mallorca on August 29. Injury blow for Real star Kaka . He has brought in internationals such as Angel Di Maria and Ricardo Carvalho, but will be without Kaka for up to four months after the Brazil playmaker need knee surgery on his return from the World Cup in South Africa. ""We all know that the knee was a real problem, and after that the problem he has in the groin will be solved when the knee problem is solved,"" Mourinho said. ""And now we know until December-January we don't have him, so we have to prepare the team, organize the team without Kaka. But he will be back, and he will be back at 100 percent, and at 100 percent he's one of the best and we need him."" Cristiano Ronaldo almost single-handedly kept Real in the Spanish title race last season with his goals and inspirational performances, and Mourinho said he was looking forward to working with his compatriot -- the most expensive player in the world. ""He's fantastic, and the way he works speaks for itself. He's a boy that works very, very hard every day -- lots of ambition, he wants to improve all the time,"" Mourinho said. ""So with the potential he has, I just hope he keeps going. Because I cannot demand more than he's giving."" While Real spent $350 million on Ronaldo and other players this time last year, one position that has never been in doubt is that of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who captained Spain to a historic first World Cup title last month. He joined ""Los Merengues"" as a nine-year-old in 1990, and will this season pass 400 first-team appearances. ""I believe in this club -- I'm lucky to be Madrid born and bred,"" Casillas told CNN. ""To live in the city, to play for the club, this is home for me. It would be hard to ever consider leaving this club. It has helped shape me, it's developed me as a person on so many levels since I was so young."" While Real's expensive squad has a reputation of being a group of talented individuals who struggle to gel, Casillas said the players were focused on ending Barcelona's run of two consecutive titles. ""We're all unified as one. We're hard-working, humble people. People who fight hard, willing to struggle for the cause. Whether it's Cristiano, Kaka, Casillas, Canales -- we're all in it together, and that's what's important"" Casillas said Spain's long-awaited success was a dream come true for his generation of players. ""What it means is so significant. We succeeded in realizing a dream we all had since we were young kids. All footballers have a dream to win the World Cup for their country and I as a youngster was no different,"" he said. ""Look at who we were up against. Maradona's Argentina, Germany, Italy, France and Brazil. We had to succeed against all of them! Did we ever really think we would do it given all the bad luck we'd had in the past? But look in the end, we were successful!""","Big-spending Real Madrid seeking to win first Spanish league title since 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey opened her talk show's 25th and final season Monday with the surprise of a lifetime for her audience, a favorite tactic for the media maven. The 300 audience members will travel to Australia in December -- courtesy of Winfrey -- on an eight-day, seven-night trip that has been in the making for nearly a year, according to her production company, Harpo Productions. While there, the Sydney Opera House will be the site of a special ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" taping before thousands of Australian fans. Monday's surprise trip rivals one of Winfrey's most famous episodes, when she gave away cars to each of her audience members to open her 19th season in 2004. She's also known for giving away thousands of dollars in gifts to the lucky audience members who attend her annual ""Favorite Things"" show. Winfrey announced last year that she would be taking her longtime talk show off the air. ""Twenty-five years feels right in my bones and it feels right in my spirit. It's the perfect number -- the exact right time,"" Winfrey said in a statement at the time. Since then, the television mogul has said her show will go out with a bang. As of January 1, Winfrey will move on to her new OWN network, and as a result, she told TV Guide that she has different standards for her guests for the upcoming season. ""This year will be about creating moments,"" she said. The premiere week of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" will feature an appearance by country stars Naomi and Wynonna . Judd; a return visit to Williamson, West Virginia, where Winfrey did an episode on HIV/AIDS in 1987, to talk with the guests of that show; a one-on-one with Bethany Storro, a victim of an acid attack caused by a stranger; and the announcement of Winfrey's latest book club selection, according to a press release. The premiere episode is supposed to be filled with celebrity guests and a surprise musical performance. ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" first hit national airwaves on September 8, 1986. ""I was beyond excited ... and as you all might expect, a little nervous,"" Winfrey said in her statement announcing the show's last season. ""I knew then what a miraculous opportunity I had been given, but I certainly never could have imagined the 'yellow brick road' of blessings that have led me to this moment with you."" Winfrey told TV Guide, ""the show hasn't been a big part of my life. It's been my life. I didn't have children. I had the show. ""I don't intend to be crying the whole season,"" she told TV Guide.
